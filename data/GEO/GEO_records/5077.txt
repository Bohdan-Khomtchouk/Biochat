TITLE
Transmembrane protein 88 depletion effect on stem cell cardiac differentiation in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of RUES2 stem cells first depleted for transmembrane protein 88 (TMEM88) and then induced to differentiate into cardiac cells. RUES cells examined at day 5 of differentitation. Results provide insight into the role of TMEM 88 in cardiac cell differentiation.
