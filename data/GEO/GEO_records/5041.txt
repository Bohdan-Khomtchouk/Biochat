TITLE
db/db model of obesity-induced type 2 diabetes: neuroretina

SUMMARY
Analysis of neuroretina from 8-week C57BLKsJ-db/db diabetic mice. These leptin-receptor-deficient db/db mice have been shown to exhibit early features of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying early diabetic retinal neurodegeneration.
