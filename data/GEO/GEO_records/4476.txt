TITLE
Parkin expression in parkin-deficient U87MG glioma cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of U87MG glioma cells stably expressing parkin or vector alone. Parkin expression is dramatically reduced in glioma cells. Parkin mutations are a major cause of parkinsonism. Results provide insight into tumor suppressor function of parkin in brain tumors.
