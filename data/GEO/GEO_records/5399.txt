TITLE
RNA-binding protein Musashi-2 deficiency effect on LSK hematopoietic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of Musashi-2 (Msi2)-deficient hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs; LSK, Lineageloc-kit+, Sca+). The Musashi (Msi) RNA-binding protein family regulates stem cell function. Results provide insight into the role of Msi2 in HSCs.
