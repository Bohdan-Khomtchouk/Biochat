TITLE
Bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor mutation effect on lung

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung from transgenics expressing a BMPR2 tail domain mutation (BMPR2R899X) in smooth muscle. Nine weeks of BMPR2R899X expression can result in elevated right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP), producing a mutant phenotype relevant to human pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
