TITLE
Early differentiating TG2a embryonic stem cells expressing cell surface 5T4 oncofetal glycoprotein

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentiating E14 TG2a ESCs with cell surface expression of 5T4. The upregulation of 5T4 expression is associated with loss of pluripotency in ES cells. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the balance between pluripotency and differentiation in ES cells.
