TITLE
Human Papillomavirus type 16 E6 transgenic model (K14E6): cervical and skin tissues

SUMMARY
Analysis of cervix and skin from 6 week-old, virgin, transgenic females expressing HPV16 E6 oncoprotein. K14E6 transgenics present a more aggressive phenotype in the skin than in the cervix. Results provide insight into the molecular basis for this observed difference in E6 effect.
