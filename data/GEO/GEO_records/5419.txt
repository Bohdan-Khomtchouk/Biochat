TITLE
MEK inhibitor PD-0325901 and rapamycin combined treatment effect on malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor model

SUMMARY
Analysis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) from NPcis animals (carrying Nf1 and p53 mutations) treated with rapamycin, MEK inhibitor PD-0325901, or the combination of rapamycin and PD-0325901. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying MPNST pathogenesis.
