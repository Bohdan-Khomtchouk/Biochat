TITLE
Fer-1 null mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of fer-1 loss of function C. elegans mutants. The fer-1 gene encodes a homolog for the human Dysferlin gene. Mutations in the human Dysferlin gene results in Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B). Results provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of LGMD2B.

ORGANISM
