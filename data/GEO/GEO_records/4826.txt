TITLE
ARID1A depletion effect on ovarian surface epithelial cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of OSE4 and IOSE80pc ovarian surface epithelial cells depleted for ARID1A, which encodes large nuclear protein p270. ARID1A depletion enhances OSE4 and IOSE80pc proliferation. OSE4 cells become highly tumorigenic upon ARID1A depletion. Results suggest a tumor-suppressor role for ARID1A.
