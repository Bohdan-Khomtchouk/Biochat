TITLE
Cardiac right ventricle hypertrophy model

SUMMARY
Analysis of right ventricle (RV) from C57BL/6 males subjected to hemoclip installation around the pulmonary artery (PA) for up to 6 weeks. PA clipping induces RV hypertrophy (RVH) while avoiding detrimental RV pressure overload.  Results provide insight into the molecular basis of RV remodeling.

ORGANISM
