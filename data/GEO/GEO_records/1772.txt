TITLE
Hypoxia effect on vhl and p53 null mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of cell lines lacking VHL or p53 following exposure to hypoxia. VHL is the gene responsible for degrading transcription factor HIF-1. p53 null mutants examined to identify genes whose expression under hypoxia depends on p53. Results identify genes regulated by HIF-1.
