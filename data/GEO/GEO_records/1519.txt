TITLE
Fibroblasts induced to an antiviral state by interferon-beta

SUMMARY
Analysis of wildtype embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) induced to an antiviral state with interferon IFN-β. IFN-β plays a crucial role in host defense by modulating gene expression and inducing antiviral activity. Results identify IFN-induced genes believed responsible for the antiviral action of IFN.
