TITLE
Nrf2-deficient type II lung epithelial cell response to antioxidant supplementation

SUMMARY
Analysis of Nrf2 deficient lung epithelial cells treated with the antioxidant glutathione (GSH). GSH rescues cells from prooxidant-induced lung injury associated with Nrf2 deficiency. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which Nrf2 regulates cellular protection and proliferation.
