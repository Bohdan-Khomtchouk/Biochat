TITLE
High-fat dietary restriction effect on epididymal white adipose tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of epididymal WAT from C57BL/6J adult males adapted to a high-fat diet for 3 wks, then fed a high-fat diet on an ad-libitum basis (HF-AL) or on a restricted basis (HF-DR) for 12 wks. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying improved metabolic health induced by HF-DR.
