TITLE
Postmortem temporal cortex from Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (MRC-CFAS) cohort: astrocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of GFAP+ astrocytes representing different Braak stages and ApoE genotypes, in post-mortem temporal cortex samples. Astrocytes synthesize ApoE, which is involved in the astrocytic clearance of aggregated Î²-amyloid plaques. Results provide insight into role of ApoE in Alzheimer's pathology.
