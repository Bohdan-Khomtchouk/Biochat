TITLE
Adrenergic stress effect on transcription factor GATA4 S105A mutants: heart ventricle

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart from Gata4-S105A knock-in mutants (MAPK phosphorylation site at serine 105 mutated to alanine) treated with phenylephrine. The mutants showed a compromised stress response of the myocardium.  Results provide insight into molecular basis of stress-related cardiac hypertrophy.
