TITLE
Endothelial progenitor cells in fetal liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from fetal liver (LEPs). EPCs have a high angiogenic capacity at sites of tissue injury and, thus, significant therapeutic potential. Results show that LEPs within the CD31+Sca1+ stem cell subset possess the endothelial progenitor activity.
