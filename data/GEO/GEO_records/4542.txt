TITLE
Chronic suppression of phosphodiesterase 10A effect on striatum and hippocampus

SUMMARY
Analysis of C57BL6 striatum and hippocampus following chronic inhibition of PDE10A activity by dosing with PDE10A inhibitor TP-10 or by PDE10A knockout. PDE10A transcripts are significantly downregulated in Huntington's disease (HD) brain. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of HD.
