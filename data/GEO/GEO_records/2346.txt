TITLE
Reticulocyte binding-like homolog 2b knockout effect on 3D7 parasites

SUMMARY
Analysis of reticulocyte binding-like homolog 2b (PfRh2b) null mutant 3D7 parasites. D10 isolate naturally lacks PfRh2b. Silencing of PfRh2b, a key invasion ligand, leads to altered invasion receptor dependency. Results provide insight into the molecular basis for invasion via an alternate pathway.

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum
