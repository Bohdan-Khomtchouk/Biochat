TITLE
Prefrontal cortex during a 24 hour (12 hour light:12 hour dark) cycle

SUMMARY
Analysis of prefrontal cortices from C57BL/6J animals at 4 Zeitgeber time (ZT) points, 3 and 9 hrs after lights on (ZT3 and ZT9) and 3 and 9 hs after lights off (ZT15 and ZT21). The prefrontal cortex is important in regulating sleep and mood. Results provide insight into genes with diurnal rhythms.
