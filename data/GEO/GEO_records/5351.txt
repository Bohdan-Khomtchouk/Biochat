TITLE
Transforming growth factor-beta effect on normal ovarian fibroblast NOF151 cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of normal ovarian fibroblast NOF151 cells treated with 5ng/mL TGF-β1 or TGF-β2. TGF proposed to modulate ovarian cancer progression by modulating contribution of cancer-associated fibroblasts. Results provide insight into role of TGF-β modified fibroblasts in ovarian cancer.
