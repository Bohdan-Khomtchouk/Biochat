TITLE
Mucoid and motile Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected lung epithelial cell comparison

SUMMARY
Comparison of lung epithelial Calu-3 cells infected with the mucoid alginate-producing FRD1 strain to those infected with the isogenic motile flagellin-producing FRD440 strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mucoid and motile strains are associated with chronic and acute lung infections, respectively.
