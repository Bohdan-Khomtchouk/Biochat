TITLE
Tsc2 tumor suppressor gene mutant kidney response to genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of kidneys of Eker males treated for up to 14 days with the genotoxic carcinogen aristolochic acid (AA) or the non-genotoxic carcinogen ochratoxin A (OTA). The Eker rat, heterozygous mutant for the tuberous sclerosis 2 (Tsc2) tumor suppressor gene, is a model to study renal carcinogenesis.
