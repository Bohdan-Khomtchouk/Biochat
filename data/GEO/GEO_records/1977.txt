TITLE
Retinal determination protein Eyeless ectopic expression

SUMMARY
Analysis of leg, wing, and antenna imaginal discs ectopically expressing the retinal determination protein (RD) Eyeless (Ey) in the atonal wild-type or mutant background. Genes that depend on atonal for expression are involved in processes occurring after RD. Results identify targets of Ey.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
