TITLE
Co-expression of tyrosine kinase receptors HER2 and HER3 in mammary epithelial cells MCF10A grown in three-dimensional cultures

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF10A mammary epithelial cells expressing HER2, HER3, or HER2/HER3 heterodimer. Co-expression of HER2 and HER3 induced migration and invasion of MCF10A cells. Results provide insight into the role of HER2 and HER3 in breast cancer.
