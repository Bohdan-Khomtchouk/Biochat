TITLE
Interleukin-22 effect on colon cultures

SUMMARY
Analysis of C57BL/6 colon cultures treated with 10 ng/ml of interleukin-22 (IL-22) for 24 hours. IL-22, a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines, can induce a marked antimicrobial response in vitro. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of IL-22 induced host defense mechanisms.
