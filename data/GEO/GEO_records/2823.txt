TITLE
SOD1-G93A mutant model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: embryonic motor neurons

SUMMARY
Analysis of spinal cord motor neurons from embryonic day 14 transgenics expressing the human superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) G93A mutant protein. The SOD1-G93A transgenic is a model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of ALS.
