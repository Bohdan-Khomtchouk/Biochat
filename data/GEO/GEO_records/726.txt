TITLE
Renin-angiotensin system inhibition effect on cerebral capillaries

SUMMARY
Examination of cerebral capillaries in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensives (SHRSP) treated with either an angiotensin II receptor (AT1R) antagonist or an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Renin-angiotensin system inhibition reduces stroke in SHRSP.
