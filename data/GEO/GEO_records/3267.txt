TITLE
Madin-Darby canine kidney type II cell line response to hepatocyte growth factor

SUMMARY
Analysis of MDCK cells exposed to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a MAPK pathway activator. MDCK cells also exposed to HGF plus MAPK inhibitors. Epithelial organs such as kidney develop via tubulogenesis, a process induced by MAPK activation. Results provide insight into HGF-induced tubulogenesis.

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris
