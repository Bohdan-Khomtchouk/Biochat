TITLE
Induced myeloproliferative neoplasm effect on Scl-tTA::TRE-BCR/ABL double-transgenic model of chronic myeloid leukemia: osteoblastic lineage cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of osteoblastic lineage cells (OBC) from Scl-tTA::TRE-BCR/ABL (BA) double-transgenics withdrawn from doxycycline at 5 weeks of age to induce myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN). MPN development drives OBC expansion. Results provide insight into molecular features of MPN-expanded OBCs.
