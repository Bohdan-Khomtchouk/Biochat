TITLE
Acute physiologic hyperinsulinemia effect on the skeletal muscle: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscles from normal, healthy glucose-tolerant individuals exposed to acute physiological hyperinsulinemia for up to 4 hours. Results suggest a low-grade inflammatory response which may provide insight into the etiology of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes and obesity.
