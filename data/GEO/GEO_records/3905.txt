TITLE
Pollinated pistils: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of pistils up to 8.0 hours after pollination.  Unfertilized ovules were also examined. An intense pollen-pistil interaction precedes fertilization. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying sexual plant reproduction.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
