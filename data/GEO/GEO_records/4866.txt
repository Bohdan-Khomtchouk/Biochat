TITLE
Progesterone effect on uteri of ovariectomized, steroid receptor coregulator-2 deficient mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of uteri from steroid receptor coregulator-2 (SRC-2) mutants that were ovariectomized at 6 weeks and treated with progesterone (P4) 2 weeks later. SRC-2 is a member of the p160/SRC family of coregulators. Results provide mechanistic insight into SRC-2's role in endometrial decidualization.
