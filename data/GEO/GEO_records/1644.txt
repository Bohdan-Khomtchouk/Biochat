TITLE
VTS1 deletion mutant

SUMMARY
Analysis of a strain lacking Vts1p. Vts1p is a putative post-transcriptional regulator that uses a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain to bind an RNA hairpin termed the Smaug recognition element (SRE). Results identify genes that may be regulated by Vts1p and contain one or more copies of the SRE.

ORGANISM
