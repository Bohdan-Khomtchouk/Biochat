TITLE
Colon cancer cell lines with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor

SUMMARY
Analysis of HT29 and Colo205 parental colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines and HT29 and Colo205 clones with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor PLX4720. BRAF is a protein kinase in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Results provide insight into mechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors in CRC.
