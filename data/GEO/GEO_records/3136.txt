TITLE
Triclosan-ciprofloxacin cross-resistant Staphylococcus aureus mutant response to triclosan

SUMMARY
Analysis of Staphylococcus aureus JJ5 mutant strain treated with triclosan. JJ5 is a triclosan-ciprofloxacin cross-resistant strain. Triclosan resistance correlates with ciprofloxacin resistance in several bacteria. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of triclosan resistance in JJ5.

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus
