TITLE
Ascorbic acid effect on Mc3T3 osteoblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of osteoblast (OB) cell line Mc3T3-E1 stimulated with 50ug of ascorbic acid (AA) for 5 days. Procollagen synthesis/secretion is markedly up-regulated in OBs upon AA stimulation. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying procollagen trafficking in stimulated OBs.
