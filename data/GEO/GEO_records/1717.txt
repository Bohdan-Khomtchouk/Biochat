TITLE
Thyroid hormone triiodothyronine effect on tadpole brain: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of brains of NF stage 54 (NF54) premetamorphic tadpoles treated with thyroid hormone (TH) triiodothyronine (T3) for 24 or 48 hours. Premetamorphic brain ventricle cells proliferate and differentiate in response to TH. Results identify genes involved in the TH-induced proliferation pathway.
