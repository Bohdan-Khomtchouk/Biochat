TITLE
Inducer of CBF expression 1 mutant response to cold stress: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of inducer of CBF expression 1 (ICE1) mutant seedlings exposed to 0 C for up to 24 hours. Transcription factor ICE1 is required for chilling/freezing tolerance. Results identify a major role for ICE1 in controlling the expression of many cold-responsive genes during cold stress.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
