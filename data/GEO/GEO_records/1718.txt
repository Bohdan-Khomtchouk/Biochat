TITLE
Thyroid hormone triiodothyronine effect on tadpole limb bud: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of limb buds of NF stage 54 (NF54) premetamorphic tadpoles treated with thyroid hormone (TH) triiodothyronine (T3) for 14, 24 or 48 hours. Premetamorphic limb buds proliferate and differentiate in response to TH. Results identify genes involved in the TH-induced proliferation pathway.
