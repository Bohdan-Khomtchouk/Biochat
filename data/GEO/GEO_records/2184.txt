TITLE
Runt-related transcription factor 2 null mutation effect on the embryonal bone (MG-U74A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic day 14.5 humeri of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) deficient animals. Runx2 is an essential factor for skeletogenesis and heterozygous loss causes cleidocranial dysplasia. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying skeletogenesis.
