TITLE
Pristane-induced arthritis effect on AIRmax and AIRmin acute inflammation model: footpad

SUMMARY
Analysis of footpad from animals with high (AIRmax) or low (AIRmin) acute inflammation following 2 injections of pristine at 60-day intervals. Arthritis development was examined twice weekly for 160 days. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms distinguishing the AIRmax and AIRmin models.
