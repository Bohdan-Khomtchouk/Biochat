TITLE
Caspase-1 deficiency effect on lipid-loaded intestines

SUMMARY
Analysis of the epithelial layer of intestine from Casp1-null, C57BL/6 males 2 hours after an oral lipid bolus. Caspase-1 activates the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-18. These results, together with those from GDS4922, provide insight into the role of caspase-1 in lipid metabolism.
