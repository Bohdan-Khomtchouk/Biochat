TITLE
Sequestosome 1 and dipeptidylpeptidase III overexpression effect on neuroblastoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells overexpressing sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) or dipeptidylpeptidase III (DPP3). SQSTM1 and DPP3 activate the antioxidant response element (ARE). Results provide insight into mechanisms regulating the activation of the ARE.
