TITLE
Fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cells harboring pathogenic leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 mutation

SUMMARY
Analysis of IPSCs generated from LRRK2 (Gly2019Ser) mutation-bearing patient fibroblasts by cell reprogramming. The LRRK2 (G2019S) mutation causes familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying PD.
