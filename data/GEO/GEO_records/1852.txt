TITLE
siRNA knockdown and transcriptional response to DNA damage

SUMMARY
Analysis of HEK293 cells following siRNA knockdown of p53, RelA, or ATM, and subsequent treatment with neocarzinostatin, a radiomimetic drug that induces DNA double-strand breaks. Results indicate RNAi combined with expression profiling is a powerful method for dissecting transcriptional networks.
