TITLE
Heme-responsive gene-2 deficient mutant

SUMMARY
Analysis of heme-cultured HRG-2 mutants. Heme-responsive gene-2 (HRG-2) is a hypodermal, heme-binding, type I membrane protein; cytochrome distribution is abnormal in HRG-2-deficient worms. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of heme homeostasis by HRG-2.
