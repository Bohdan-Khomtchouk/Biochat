TITLE
Estrogen receptor beta knockout effect on skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Comparison of expression profiles of soleus muscles from 5 to 6 month old C57BL/6 males to those of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) knockout male littermates. Male ERbeta knockout muscles are more resistant to fatigue than male wild type muscles.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
