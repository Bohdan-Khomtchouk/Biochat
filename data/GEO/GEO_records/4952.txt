TITLE
BET bromodomain inhibitor I-BET762 effect on prostate cancer cell lines: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of prostate cancer (PC) cell lines (NCI-H660, VCaP, LNCaP, PC-3) treated with I-BET762 at 0.5uM or 10uM for 24hr. I-BET762 is a highly specific inhibitor of BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) proteins. Results provide insight into molecular pathways regulated by I-BET762 treatment in PC.
