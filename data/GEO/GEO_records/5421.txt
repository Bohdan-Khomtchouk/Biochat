TITLE
Transcription factor E2-2 haplodeficiency effect on systemic lupus erythematosus model: splenocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of splenocytes from WT, B6.Sle1.Sle3 (lupus mice) and B6.Sle1.Sle3 Tcf4+/âˆ’ (Sle/het) mice haplodeficient for the transcription factor E2-2 (Tcf4). E2-2 is a specific regulator of plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) development. Results provide insight into role of pDC in SLE pathogenesis.
