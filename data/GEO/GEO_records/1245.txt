TITLE
GATA-1 knockdown effect on megakaryocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of megakaryocytes lacking the transcription factor GATA-1. GATA-1 is required for the development of megakaryocytes and erythroid cells. Megakaryocytes obtained from 13.5 day C57BL/6 mutant embryos. Results provide insight into the role of GATA-1 in megakaryopoiesis.
