TITLE
Transcription factor SRF deletion effect on hematopoietic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of hematopoietic LSK (Lin-Sca1+c-Kit+) cells invalidated for the serum response factor (SRF) gene. SRF regulates genes controlling cytoskeleton structures involved in cell spreading, adhesion and migration. Results provide insight into the role of SRF in hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis.
