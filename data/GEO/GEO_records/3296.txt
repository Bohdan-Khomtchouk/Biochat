TITLE
Transition from anaerobic photosynthesis to aerobic respiration: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of the facultative photosynthetic anaerobe Rhodobacter sphaeroides at various time points during the transition from anaerobic-light to aerobic-dark growth conditions. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from one homeostatic state to another.

ORGANISM
