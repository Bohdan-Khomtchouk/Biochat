TITLE
Embryonic brain development

SUMMARY
Analysis of brains at embryonic days (E) 9.5, 11.5, and 13.5. Mostly undifferentiated neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are present at E9.5, NPCs begin to differentiate into neurons at E11.5, and neurogenesis peaks at E13.5. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurogenesis.
