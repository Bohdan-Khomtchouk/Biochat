TITLE
DEK oncogene deficiency effect in U937 leukemic monocyte lymphoma cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of U937 cells following DEK oncogene knockdown by two different shRNAs (shDEK14, shDEK17). The DEK gene is highly expressed in many types of cancer cells and involved in chromosomal translocation in acute myelogenous leukemia. Results provide insight into the role of DEK in gene regulation.
