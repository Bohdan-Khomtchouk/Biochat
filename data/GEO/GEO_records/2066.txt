TITLE
MicroRNA miR319a overexpression effect on the leaf

SUMMARY
Analysis of leaves from transgenics overexpressing microRNA miR319a. Most plant miRNAs have perfect or near-perfect complementarity with their targets. However, targets with up to five mismatches exist. Results provide insight into the mechanistic basis of target recognition by plant miRNA.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
