TITLE
Pineal gland response to light pulse at various circadian time points

SUMMARY
Analysis of pineal gland from 12-h light/12-h dark cycle-entrained chicks transferred to constant darkness, then exposed to a 1-hr light pulse at various time points (circadian time 6, CT14, CT22). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying time-of-day-dependent responses to light.
