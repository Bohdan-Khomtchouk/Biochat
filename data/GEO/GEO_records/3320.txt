TITLE
Lmx1b knockout effect on embryonic proximal hindlimb buds

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic (e11.5) proximal hindlimb bud tissues deficient for transcription factor Lmx1b. In the developing limb, dorsal-ventral patterning is controlled by LMX1B, expressed in the dorsal mesenchyme. Results provide insight into the Lmx1b-dependent genes in the developing limb bud.
