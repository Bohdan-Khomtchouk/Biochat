TITLE
TNF receptor and lymphotoxin beta -receptor activation effect on aortic endothelial cells in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured aortic endothelial cells stimulated with a combination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and α-LTßR antibody for 24 hours.  Unlike similarly-treated aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs), the endothelial cells did not differentiate into a lymphoid tissue organizer (LTO) phenotype.
