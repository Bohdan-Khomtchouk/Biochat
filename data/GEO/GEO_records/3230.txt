TITLE
Fungal pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi effect on leaves: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of leaves up to 48 hours post-inoculation with Phakopsora pachyrhizi isolates, Hawaii 94-1 (HW94-1) and Taiwan 72-1 (TW72-1). HW94-1 produces a resistant reaction in the host, TW72-1 a susceptible reaction. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of resistance to a fungal pathogen.
