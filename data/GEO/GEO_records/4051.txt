TITLE
Tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell line MCF7 subclones

SUMMARY
Analysis of tamoxifen-sensitive and -resistant subclones of breast tumor MCF7 cells treated with estrogen (E), 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT), or E + 4-OHT. Success of 4-OHT therapy is limited by intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. Results provide insight into mechanisms leading to drug resistance.
