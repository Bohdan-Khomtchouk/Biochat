TITLE
Streptozotocin effect on pancreas of offspring of protein-restricted dams

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreas from streptozotocin-injected female offspring of low protein-fed dams. These offspring fail to regenerate their β-cells following depletion with STZ. Results provide insight into molecular basis of failed β-cell regeneration in offspring of protein-restricted pregnant mice.
