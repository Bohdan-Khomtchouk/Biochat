TITLE
Radioactive iodine effect on normal thyroid: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of thyroid from normal BALB/c adults 24 hours after injection in the tail vein with 13, 130, or 260 kBq of radioactive iodine (131I). The absorbed doses to thyroid were 0.85, 8.5, or 17 Gy. Results provide insight into dose-specific molecular responses of thyroid after 131I administration.
