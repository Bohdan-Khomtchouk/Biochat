TITLE
Interferon receptor deficient lymph node B cell response to influenza infection

SUMMARY
Analysis of lymph node B cells from interferon receptor (IFNR) null mutants infected with the influenza virus. Wild type B cells treated with IFN-beta also examined. Results provide insight into the role of IFNR signaling in the immune response mediated by B cells during influenza infections.
