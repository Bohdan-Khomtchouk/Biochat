TITLE
Quercetin effect on intestinal cell differentiation in vitro: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of post-confluent Caco-2 colon cancer cells up to 10 days after treatment with ascorbate-stabilized quercetin, a polyphenol antioxidant compound. Caco-2 cells differentiate after reaching confluency. Results provide insight into quercetin's role in cell-proliferation and -differentiation.
