TITLE
DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine effect on RAS-transformed fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of HRAS oncogene transformed fibroblasts after treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine for 96 hours. Results provide insight into the role of DNA methylation in oncogenic signaling pathways.
