TITLE
Very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout effect in house dust mite model of asthma: lung

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung from B6129SF2/J animals depleted for very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and subjected to intranasal challenge with house dust mite (HDM). VLDLR is a multiligand apolipoprotein E receptor. Results provide insight into the role of VLDLR in HDM-induced airway inflammation.
