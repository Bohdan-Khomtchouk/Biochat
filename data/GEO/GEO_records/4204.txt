TITLE
Growth factor independence 1 knockout effect on LSK hematopoietic stem bone marrow cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of Lin-Sca1+ckit+Flt3- (LSKFlt3-) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) depleted of growth factor independence 1 (Gfi1). Transcriptional repressor Gfi1 restricts HSC proliferation and is essential to self-renewal. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying Gfi1 effects in HSCs.
