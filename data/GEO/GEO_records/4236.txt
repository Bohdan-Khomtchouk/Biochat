TITLE
Rapamycin-resistant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines resistant to rapamycin, the prototypical mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) inhibitor. The mTOR pathway is constitutively activated in DLBCL. Results provide insight into mechanisms of resistance to mTOR inhibition in DLBCL.
