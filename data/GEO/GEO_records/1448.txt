TITLE
Anoxia and sucrose effect on seedlings

SUMMARY
Analysis of ecotype Columbia glabra seedlings subjected to anoxia for 6 hours in the presence or absence of 90 uM sucrose. Exogenous sucrose enhances the tolerance of seedlings to anoxia. Results identify candidate genes that enhance the tolerance of sucrose treated seedlings to anoxia.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
