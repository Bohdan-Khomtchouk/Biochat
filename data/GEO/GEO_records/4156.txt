TITLE
Parkinson's disease induced pluripotent stem cell model with triplication of the α-synuclein locus

SUMMARY
Analysis of iPSC lines derived from a PD patient with SNCA triplication and an unaffected first-degree relative. Triplication of SNCA, encoding α-synuclein, causes an aggressive form of PD. Results provide insight into the mechanistic basis of neurodegeneration caused by α-synuclein dysfunction.
