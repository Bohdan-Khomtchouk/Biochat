TITLE
Waterlogging effect on root and leaf

SUMMARY
Analysis of root and leaf tissue from partially-submerged, two-leaf stage plants at four and twenty-four hours post-flooding. A major component of waterlogging stress is the lack of oxygen available to submerged tissues. Results provide insight into the molecular responses to waterlogging in plants.

ORGANISM
Gossypium barbadense
