TITLE
Measles virus brain infection model: right cerebral hemisphere

SUMMARY
Analysis of the right half of the brain (contralateral to the inoculation hemisphere) from MeV-infected hsp70 transgenics at 5-10 days post infection. Hsp70 is host protective in this model of MeV brain infection. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of hsp70-dependent innate immunity.
