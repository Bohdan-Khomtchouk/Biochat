TITLE
Low-dose ionizing radiation effect on breast tissue: two inbred strains

SUMMARY
Analysis of mammary gland from BALB/c and C57BL/6 females exposed to low dose (LD) ionizing radiation. The two inbred strains differ in their genetic susceptibility to radiation-induced mammary cancer. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying mammary cancer susceptibility.
