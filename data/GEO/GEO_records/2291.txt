TITLE
Lipin 1-beta overexpression effect on the liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of transgenics overexpressing lipin 1-beta, an alternative form of lipin 1 containing a 33 amino acid insertion. Mutations in the gene encoding lipin 1 cause hepatic steatosis in fld animals, a genetic model of lipodystrophy. Results provide insight into the function of lipin 1.
