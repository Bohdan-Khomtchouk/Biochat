In vivo glucocorticoid effect on non-leukemic peripheral blood lymphocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of mononuclear cells from non-leukemic individuals (1 healthy/3 epileptic) up to 24 hr after glucocorticoid (GC) injection. GCs induce apoptosis and are used to treat lymphoid malignancies. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-leukemic GC effects.
