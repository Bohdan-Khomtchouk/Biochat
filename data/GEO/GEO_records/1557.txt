TITLE
Atrial and ventricular myocardium comparison (HG-U133B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of right atria and left ventricles of hearts. While both the ventricle and atrium contract, the atrium is also a source and target for neurohumoral signals. Results provide insight into the molecular basis for the ultrastructural and functional differences between the atrium and ventricle.
