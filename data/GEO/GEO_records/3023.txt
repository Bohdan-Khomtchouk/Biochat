TITLE
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone effect on pituitary organ cultures

SUMMARY
Analysis of pituitary organ cultures treated with 10 nM gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) for 6 hours. GnRH is a decapeptide hypothalamic hormone that acts upon GnRH receptors in the pituitary. Results provide insight into GnRH-responsive genes in pituitary organ cultures.
