TITLE
PPARα  agonist ciprofibrate effect on liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of primate livers exposed to ciprofibrate at various doses for 4 or 15 days. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) agonists such as ciprofibrate cause hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents but not in primates. Results identify species differences in response to PPARα agonist.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens
