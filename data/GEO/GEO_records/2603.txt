TITLE
Arsenite and p53 effect on G2 synchronized fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of p53-expressing or p53-deficient fibroblasts exposed to arsenite (As) after release from G2 phase synchrony. p53 is activated in response to mitotic disruption by arsenic. Results provide insight into the role of p53 in the As-induced disruption of G2/M phase progression.
