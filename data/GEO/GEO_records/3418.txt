TITLE
Spleen CD11b+ cells response to Yersinia enterocolitica (Ye) YopH deletion mutant infection in vivo

SUMMARY
Analysis of splenic CD11b+ cells from animals infected with wildtype Yersinia enterocolitica (Ye) or a YopH-deficient Ye mutant. YopH is a virulence factor that inhibits phagocytosis of Ye and promotes virulence of Ye. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of YopH-mediated immune evasion.
