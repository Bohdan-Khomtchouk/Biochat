TITLE
PPARgamma agonist and platinum-based drug effect on adenocarcinoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of NSCLC adenocarcinoma cells treated with rosiglitazone, carboplatin, or both. Rosiglitazone is an agonist of the nuclear receptor PPARgamma. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the synergy observed between rosiglitazone and platinum-based drugs in cancer models.
