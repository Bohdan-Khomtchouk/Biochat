TITLE
Iron effect on Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1: dose-response

SUMMARY
Analysis of magnetotactic bacterium strain AMB-1 grown under various initial iron-rich conditions. These bacteria have a high-iron requirement for magnetosome synthesis, several orders of magnitude greater than that for E coli. Results provide insight into specific iron uptake systems in AMB-1.
