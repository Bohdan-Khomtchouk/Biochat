TITLE
Embryonic stem cell response to STAT3 overexpression in vitro (MG-U74A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured embryonic stem (ES) cells overexpressing the transcription factor STAT3. STAT3 is a downstream target of the LIF signaling cascade. LIF activation maintains ES cells in a pluripotent state. Results provide insight into the role of STAT3 in maintenance of ES cell pluripotency.
