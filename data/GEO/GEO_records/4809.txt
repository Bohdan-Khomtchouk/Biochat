TITLE
Gata5 deficiency effect on the lung

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs of C57BL/6J animals deficient for Gata5, a transcription factor expressed in the lung. Gata5 deficiency causes airway constrictor hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which Gata5 deficiency leads to AHR.
