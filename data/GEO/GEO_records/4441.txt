TITLE
Runt homology domain expression effect on hematopoietic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of c-Kit+Sca-1+Lin- hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lacking Runx1 or expressing the runt homology domain, RUNX1 (41-214). RUNX1(41-214) expression induces myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in mice. Results provide insight into molecular basis of MDS progression induced by RUNX1 (41-214).
