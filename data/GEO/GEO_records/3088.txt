TITLE
Leukotriene B4 effect on monocytes: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary monocytes treated for up 16 hours with leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in vitro. LTB4 is a mediator of inflammation. Monocytes express the cell surface receptors BLT1 and BLT2 that mediate the action of LTB4. Results provide insight into the transcriptional response of monocytes to LTB4.
