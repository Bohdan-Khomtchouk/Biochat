TITLE
Limbal and central corneal epithelial basal cell comparison

SUMMARY
Analysis of microdissected resting limbal epithelial basal cells (LE) and central corneal epithelial (CE) basal cells of the eye. LE are enriched in corneal epithelial stem cells, CE  in transient amplifying cells. Results provide insight into the molecular nature of the two basal cell populations.
