TITLE
Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ Coactivator-1 deficiency effect on adult cardiac biventricle

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart from adults deficient for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 (PGC-1) α and PGC-1β. Adult PGC-1α/β deficient heart did not exhibit abnormal mitochondrial dynamics or heart failure.  Results provide insight into role of PGC-1 coactivators in adult heart.
