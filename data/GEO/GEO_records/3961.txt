TITLE
Adipogenesis and obesity: subcutaneous adipose tissue (HG-U133_Plus_2)

SUMMARY
Analysis of adipose tissue from subjects (BMI 16.7-50.2) with normal or impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 diabetes. Adipocytes regulate energy balance and glucose homeostasis. These results, together with miRNA profiling results, provide insight into molecular basis of adipogenesis and obesity.
