Myc activation and deactivation effect on pancreatic islet beta cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of transgenic pancreatic islet beta cells after activation of Myc for up to 24 hours or activation for 21 days followed by deactivation for up to 6 days. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of Myc-driven tumorigenesis in vivo.
