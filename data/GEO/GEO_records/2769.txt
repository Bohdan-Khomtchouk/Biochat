TITLE
Non-coding roX1 and roX2 RNA deficiency effect on larvae

SUMMARY
Analysis of third instar larvae lacking noncoding RNAs roX1 and roX2. The roX RNAs are components of the male-specific lethal (MSL) ribonucleoprotein complex, required for equalization of X:A expression levels in males. Results provide insight into the role of roX RNAs in X-chromosome expression.

ORGANISM
