TITLE
Retinoic acid effect on CD4+ T cells from spleen/lymph nodes

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4+ T cells pooled from spleen and mesenteric/peripheral lymph nodes and cultured with exogenous retinoic acid (RA). Integrins are required for T cell migration to mucosal tissues. Results provide insight into the role of RA in the regulation of mucosal integrin expression in T cells.
