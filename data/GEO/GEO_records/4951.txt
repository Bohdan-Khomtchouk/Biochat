TITLE
Lysophosphatidic acid effect on breast and prostate cancer cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of MDA-MB-231, MCF7 and PC3 cells treated with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA activates six different G protein-coupled receptors (LPA receptors 1-6). Results provide insight into LPA-induced genes among three unrelated cancer cell lines expressing different patterns of LPA receptors.
