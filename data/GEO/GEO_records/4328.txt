TITLE
Cardiac transcription factors Tbx5, Gata4 and Myocardin effect on 10T1/2-tTA fibroblast cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of 10T1/2-tTA fibroblasts infected with different combinations of cardiac transcription factors (TFs) Tbx5, Gata4, and Myocardin lentiviruses and induced with doxycycline for 14 days. Results provide insight into the specific roles of these TFs in activating cardiac gene programs.
