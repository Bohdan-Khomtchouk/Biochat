TITLE
Yeast response to sudden oxygen depletion: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of glucose-limited cultures after shift from fully aerobic (20.9% O2) or oxygen-limited (1.0% O2) to anaerobic conditions, for up to 79 (20.9% O2) or 72 (1.0% O2) h post-shift. Results provide insight into adaptative mechanisms underlying transition from respiratory to fermentative growth.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe
