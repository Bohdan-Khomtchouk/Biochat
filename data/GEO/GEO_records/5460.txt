TITLE
Survival motor neuron deficiency effect on axonal compartment of cultured motoneurons

SUMMARY
Analysis of the axonal compartment of cultured motoneurons depleted for survival motor neuron (Smn). Smn is the protein deficient in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Results provide insight into the axonal mRNA content of degenerating motoneurons in vitro.
