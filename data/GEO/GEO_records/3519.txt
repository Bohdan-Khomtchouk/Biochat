TITLE
Plasmacytoid dendritic cell response to transcription factor E2-2

SUMMARY
Analysis of plasmocytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) heterozygous null for the transcription factor E2-2. Deletion of E2-2 blocked the development of PDCs but not of other lineages. Results provide insight into the role of E2-2 in the specification of the PDC lineage.
