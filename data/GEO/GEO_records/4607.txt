TITLE
Psoriasis non-lesional skin response to interferon-γ

SUMMARY
Analysis of non-lesional (NL) skin of psoriasis patients 24 hrs after a single intradermal injection of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to the NL skin. Results suggest that IFN-γ may prime an inflammatory environment in the skin that shares many features with psoriasis.
