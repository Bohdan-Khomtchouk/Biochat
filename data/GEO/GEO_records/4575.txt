TITLE
ash-2 knockdown effect on germline-deficient glp-1(e2141ts) mutant: day 2 (L3 stage)

SUMMARY
Analysis of day 2 germline-deficient glp-1 mutants treated with ash-2 RNAi. The ASH-2 trithorax complex trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4); an intact germline is required for ASH-2-induced lifespan extension. Results provide insight into the role of histone methylation in longevity.
