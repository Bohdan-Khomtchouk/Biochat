TITLE
Tendon development: embryonic limb tendon cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of tendon cells isolated by FACS from forelimbs of embryonic day 11.5, E12.5 and E14.5 scleraxis (Scx)-GFP embryos. Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Scx is a specific tendon and ligament marker. Results provide insight into molecular pathways involved in tendon development.
