TITLE
Vectorless gravity effect on T cell activation

SUMMARY
Analysis of T cells costimulated with concanavalin A and anti-CD28 antibody in a vectorless gravity environment, which approximates true freefall or microgravity experienced in spaceflight. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the altered immune function experienced by astronauts.
