TITLE
Smooth muscle cell differentiation induced by retinoic acid: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of A404 cells at 48 and 96 hours following 1 umol/L all trans-retinoic acid (RA) treatment to induce differentiation into smooth muscle cells (SMCs).  A set of cells treated with RA for 96 hours was subsequently treated with 0.5 ug/ml puromycin to enrich for SMCs.

ORGANISM
