TITLE
Frontal and parieto-temporal cortical regions of the developing fetal brain

Analysis of prefrontal/orbito-frontal and parieto-temporal cortex at 17 and 19 gestational weeks. These cortical regions contain presumptive Broca and Wernicke language areas. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying development of human-specific features of the cerebral cortex.
