TITLE
Contraction- and freeze-injured skeletal muscles: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscles at various time points up to 7 days following injury caused by eccentric contraction (CI) or by freezing (FI). Results provide insight into the molecular events accompanying the degeneration and repair phases of contraction- and trauma-induced muscle injuries.

ORGANISM
