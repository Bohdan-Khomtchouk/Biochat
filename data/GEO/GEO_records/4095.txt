TITLE
Tamoxifen effect on SRC-1-deficient endocrine-resistant breast cancer cell line LY2

SUMMARY
Analysis of endocrine-resistant LY2 breast cancer cells depleted of p160 steroid coactivator protein SRC-1 and treated with tamoxifen. SRC-1 is central to the development of the endocrine resistant phenotype. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of endocrine resistant breast cancer.
