TITLE
GATA3 ectopic expression effect on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells transduced with a lentivirus expressing GATA3. Luminal transcriptional regulator GATA3 reduces tumorigenicity and metastases of basal triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). Results provide insight into molecular basis of GATA3-mediated reduction of TNBC metastases.
