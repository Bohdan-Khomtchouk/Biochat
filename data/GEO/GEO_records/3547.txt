TITLE
Human cytomegalovirus chemokine receptor U28 expression effect on fibroblast cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells expressing the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) chemokine receptor U28. HCMV proteins are present in malignancies such as colon cancer. U28 activates inflammatory and proliferative signaling pathways. Results provide insight into the role of U28 in oncogenesis.
