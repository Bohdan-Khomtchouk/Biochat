TITLE
Neuromuscular degeneration mutant spinal cord response to neural stem cell transplantation

SUMMARY
Analysis of neuromuscular degeneration mutant (nmd) spinal cords transplanted with ALDHhiSSClo neural stem cells. nmd is a model for spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying neuromuscular improvements in stem cell recipients.
