TITLE
Telomere-elongated, prostate cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of telomere-elongated PC-3 prostate cancer cells in the presence of exogenous human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Forced elongation of telomeres promotes PC-3 cell differentiation. Results provide insight into the influence of telomere length on tumor malignancy.
