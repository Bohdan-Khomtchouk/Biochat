TITLE
Anti-VEGF and Anti-Notch treatment effect on U87 glioblastoma xenograft tumors [HG-U133_Plus_2]

SUMMARY
Analysis of U87 human xenograft tumors (in BALB/c SCID mouse host) treated with antiangiogenic agents bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) and dibenzazepine (anti-Notch). The tumors include mouse host stroma. Results, together with those from GDS5678, provide insight into molecular basis of tumor angiogenesis.
