TITLE
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha deficiency effect on phthalate-exposed liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers from peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α-null animals exposed to the plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP).  DEHP increases liver tumors in the absence of PPARα. Results provide insight into DEHP-induced transcriptional changes independent of PPARα.
