TITLE
Mixed lineage leukemia gene rearrangements in acute myeloid leukemia: bone marrow mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow cells from AML cases representing MLL chromosomal translocation (tMLL) or partial tandem duplication (MLL-PTD). Rearrangements of MLL at chromosome 11q23 are commonly involved in acute leukemia. Results provide insight into molecular heterogeneity between MLL-PTD and tMLL.
