TITLE
Myeloid-related protein 8 and 14 effect on microvascular endothelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) treated with the myeloid-related protein 8 (MRP8) and 14 (MRP14), proteins that form heterodimers secreted by phagocytes at inflammatory sites. Results provide insight into the role of MRP8 and MRP14 in EC cell death during inflammation.
