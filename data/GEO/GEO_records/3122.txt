TITLE
Transcription factor sigma54-deficient rhizobial bacteroids from determinate soybean root nodules

SUMMARY
Comparison of sigma54-deficient mutant strain N50-97 bacteroids with wild type bacteroids, both at 21 days postinoculation. The mutants are able to elicit soybean nodules but unable to carry out symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Results provide insight into the sigma 54 regulon in symbiosis.

ORGANISM
