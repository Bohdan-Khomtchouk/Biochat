TITLE
Maternal diabetes effect on developing embryo

SUMMARY
Analysis of diabetes-exposed, E10.5 whole embryos. Diabetes was induced in FVB females (aged 7-9 wks) by streptozotocin. Maternal diabetes is a well-known risk factor for birth defects, such as neural tube defects. Results provide insight into the causative molecular mechanisms in developing embryo.
