TITLE
TGFβ-activated kinase 1 deficiency effect on liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from 4-week old C57BL/6 males with hepatocyte-specific deletion of TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). In hepatocytes, TAK1 controls activation of both IKK/NF-κB and JNK pathways.   Results provide insight into the role of TAK1 in liver pathophysiology.
