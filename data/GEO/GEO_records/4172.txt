TITLE
Effect of protease-resistant (PML-RAR)α on U937 cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of U937 cells transfected with GFP-(PML-RAR)α (PR) or GFP-PR2VR (cleavage-resistant mutant) and GFP-sorted at 6 and 9 hrs. Neutrophil elastase (NE) cleaves PR, the fusion protein that initiates acute promyelocytic leukemia. Results provide insight into leukemogenicity of NE-resistant PR.
