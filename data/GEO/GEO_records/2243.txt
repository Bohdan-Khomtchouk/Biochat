TITLE
Denervated skeletal muscle response to reinnervation

SUMMARY
Analysis of reinnervated tibialis anterior muscles that were previously denervated for 4 weeks. Denervation-induced myofiber atrophy can be reversed by reinnervation. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms contributing to myofiber growth after reinnervation.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
