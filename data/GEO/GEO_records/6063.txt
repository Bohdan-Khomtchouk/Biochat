TITLE
Influenza A effect on plasmacytoid dendritic cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) exposed to influenza A for 8 hours ex vivo. pDCs are vital to antiviral defense, directing immune responses via secretion of interferon-alpha. Results provide insight into the regulation of the response of pDC to viral pathogens.
