TITLE
Bone morphogenic protein 2 effect on idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension

SUMMARY
Analysis of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) from patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). PASMC treated with 200 nM bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) for 24 hours. BMP signaling dysfunction has been implicated in IPAH.
