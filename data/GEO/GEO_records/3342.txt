TITLE
Curcumin effect on oxidatively stressed monocyte cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of U937 monoctyes exposed to oxidative stress then treated for 4 or 18 hrs with curcumin, a dietary polyphenol. Curcumin restores oxidative stress impaired histone deacetylase-2 activity and corticosteroid efficacy in vitro. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of these effects.
