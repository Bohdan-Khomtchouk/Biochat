TITLE
Estradiol effect on osteosarcoma cells expressing estrogen receptor alpha or beta: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of U2OS osteosarcoma cells after treatment with 17beta-estradiol (E2) for various lengths of time up to 48 hours.  U2OS transfected with either estrogen receptor (ER) alpha or beta.  Results identify signaling pathways in bone regulated by E2 through ERalpha and ERbeta.
