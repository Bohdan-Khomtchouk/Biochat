TITLE
Survival motor neuron deficiency effect on somatodendritic compartment of cultured motoneurons

SUMMARY
Analysis of the somatodendritic compartment of cultured motoneurons depleted for survival motor neuron (Smn). Smn is the protein deficient in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Results provide insight into the somatodendritic mRNA content of degenerating motoneurons in vitro.

ORGANISM
