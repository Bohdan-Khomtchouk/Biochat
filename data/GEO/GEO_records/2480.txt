TITLE
Lipopolysaccharide and chitin oligosaccharide effect on rice cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of rice cells treated with lipopolysaccharide or N-acetylchitooctaose. These agents are pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) molecules important in the innate immune response. Results provide insight into the cellular response to PAMP molecules.

ORGANISM
