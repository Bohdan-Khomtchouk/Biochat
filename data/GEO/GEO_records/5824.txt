TITLE
Short-term high fat diet effect on epididymal adipose fractions: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary adipocytes from epididymis of C57BL/6J males fed a 60% high fat diet (HFD) for up to 7 days to induce obesity. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance in adipose tissues during early obesity.
