TITLE
Scavenger receptor A mutant olfactory epithelium response to olfactory bulbectomy: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of olfactory epithelia (OE) of scavenger receptor A (SR-A) mutants at up to 48 hours after olfactory bulbectomy (OBX). OBX induces apoptotic death of olfactory sensory neurons and recruitment of macrophages to the OE. SR-A mediates the binding of macrophages to apoptotic cells.
