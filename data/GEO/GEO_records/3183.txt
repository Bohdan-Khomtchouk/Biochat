TITLE
Chemokine receptor CXCR7 deficiency effect on neonatal semilunar valves

SUMMARY
Analysis of semilunar valves from neonates lacking the chemokine receptor CXCR7. Most animals lacking CXCR7 die at birth with ventricular septal defects and semilunar heart valve malformation. Results provide insight into the role of CXCR7 in heart valve development.
