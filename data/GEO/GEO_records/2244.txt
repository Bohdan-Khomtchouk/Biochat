TITLE
Melanoma cell line response to E2F-1 overexpression and doxorubicin treatment

SUMMARY
Analysis of E2F-1 overexpressing SK-MEL-2 melanoma cells treated with the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (dox). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the synergistic effect on melanoma cell apoptosis observed when E2F-1 overexpression is combined with dox treatment
