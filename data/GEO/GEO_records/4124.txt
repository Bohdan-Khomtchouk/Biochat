TITLE
Genetic reprogramming of prostate cancer-associated stromal cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) obtained from sorted CD90+ prostate cancer (CP)-associated stromal cells cultured and transfected with stem cell transcription factor POU5F1/LIN28/NANOG/SOX2 expression vectors. Results provide insight into the stemness of CP stromal-derived iPSCs.
