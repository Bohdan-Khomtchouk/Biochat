TITLE
All-trans retinoic acid effect on HL60 myeloid cells overexpressing ecotropic virus integration site 1

SUMMARY
Analysis of EVI1-overexpressing HL60 myeloid cells treated with ATRA. EVI1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in myeloid leukemias; ATRA is a myeloid differentiation inducing agent. Results provide insight into the potential interplay between EVI1 and ATRA in myeloid cells.
