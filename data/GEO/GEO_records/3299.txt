TITLE
Multiple dorsal thalamic nuclei

SUMMARY
Analysis of micro-punches of five different nuclear regions of the dorsal thalamus. Nuclei of the mammalian thalamus are aggregations of neurons with unique architectures and input-output connections. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of nuclear specificity in the dorsal thalamus.
