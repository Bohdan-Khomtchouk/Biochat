TITLE
MYC oncogene overexpression and silencing effect in medulloblastoma DAOY cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of medulloblastoma (MB)-derived cell lines genetically manipulated to either overexpress or silence the MYC oncogene. MYC overexpression and/or amplification is associated with poor clinical outcome. Results provide insight into transcriptional targets mediating the effects of MYC in MB.
