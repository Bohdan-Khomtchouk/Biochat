TITLE
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia response to antisense Bcl-2 inhibitor SPC2996: peripheral blood

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of peripheral blood from 18 relapsed CLL patients treated with a maximum of 6 doses (0.2-6mg/kg) of SPC2996, an antisense molecule targeting the mRNA of Bcl-2 oncoprotein. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the immunostimulatory effects of SPC2996 in CLL.
