TITLE
Erythroid differentiation of erythroleukemia cell line induced by hemin: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of K562 erythroleukemia cells induced to differentiate into erythroid-like cells by hemin.  K562 cells examined at various time points up to 72 hours following treatment with 50 uM hemin.  Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying hemoglobinization.
