TITLE
Chromatin assembly factor 1A deficiency effect on IMR32 neuroblastoma cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of IMR32 neuroblastoma cells upon CHAF1A silencing over a time course (0, 5 and 10 days). CHAF1A is a histone chaperone and epigenetic regulator. Results provide insight into the role of CHAF1A in neuroblastoma progression.
