TITLE
Intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (IT LPS)-induced lung injury effect on Rag-1 null, lymphocyte-deficient mutants

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of lungs from recombinase-activating gene-1-deficient (Rag-1 -/-), lymphocyte-deficient animals following acute lung injury. Resolution of acute lung injury is impaired in Rag-1 null mutants. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying resolution of lung injury.
