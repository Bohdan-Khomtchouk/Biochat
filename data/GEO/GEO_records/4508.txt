TITLE
Histone methyltransferase ESET knockout effect on embryonic dorsal telencephalon

SUMMARY
Analysis of dorsal telencephalon from E14.5 embryos depleted of histone methyltransferase ESET. ESET ablation leads to decreased H3K9 trimethylation and misregulation of genes resulting in severe brain defects and embryonic lethality. Results provide insight into role of ESET in brain development.
