TITLE
Myc deficiency effect on the embryonic heart

SUMMARY
Analysis of Myc-deficient hearts from embryonic day 13.5 transgenics. The E13.5 Myc-null embryos show normal ventricular size and structure, but decreased cardiac myocyte proliferation. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying Myc-induced cellular proliferation.
