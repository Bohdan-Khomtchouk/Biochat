TITLE
Transforming growth factor β effect on mammary epithelial NMuMG cells overexpressing major satellite transcripts

SUMMARY
Analysis of major satellite-NMuMG cells treated with TGF-β for 8 hr. Major satellites are noncoding pericentromeric transcripts essential for heterochromatin formation. Results provide insight into the role of pericentromeric transcription on TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
