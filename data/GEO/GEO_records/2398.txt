TITLE
Hematopoietic cells at various stages of differentiation

SUMMARY
Analysis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), progenitor cells (HPCs), and granulocytes. Short-term (ST) and long-term (LT) repopulating HSCs examined. Results provide insight into the basis of the differences observed in cloning efficiency of each cell type in somatic cell nuclear transfer.
