TITLE
Brassinosteroid effects on wild type and yucca mutant seedlings

SUMMARY
Analysis of brassinolide treatment on 10 day old light-grown Columbia-O wild type and yucca mutant seedlings. Yucca mutants overproduce auxin. Brassinosteroids (BRs) promote cell expansion.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
