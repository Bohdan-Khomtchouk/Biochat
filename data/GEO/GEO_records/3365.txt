TITLE
Oxidative-stress induced neurodegeneration in Harlequin mutant: olfactory epithelium

SUMMARY
Analysis of olfactory epithelium from Harlequin mutant, a model of oxidative stress (OS)-induced neurodegeneration. OS in the olfactory system is a major factor associated with age-related olfactory impairment. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of OS-associated olfactory aging.
