TITLE
SmoA1 and SmoA2 models of medulloblastoma: postnatal day 5 brain

SUMMARY
Analysis of cerebella from Smoothened (Smo)A1 and SmoA2 mutants. The SmoA1 and SmoA2 mutations both cause medulloblastoma but have markedly different effects on cerebellar development. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the oncogenic and developmental effects of the Smo variants.
