TITLE
Deferasirox effect on leukemia cell line: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of leukemia K562 cells treated with 10 or 50 uM deferasirox. Deferasirox is an iron chelator taken orally to treat iron toxicity. Iron depletion by deferasirox inhibits cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this anti-proliferative effect.
