TITLE
Intermittent hypoxia effect on liver

SUMMARY
Examination of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) effect on liver gene expression in leptin deficient (ob/ob) mice. CIH in the presence of pre-existent obesity may cause an increase in gene expression of enzymes of lipid biosynthesis. CIH is a component of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
