TITLE
Freshly-isolated umbilical cord arterial and venous endothelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of freshly-isolated endothelial cells (EC) from umbilical arteries (HUAEC) and veins (HUVEC). ECs lining different vessels differ in morphology and function. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying arteriovenous EC heterogeneity.
