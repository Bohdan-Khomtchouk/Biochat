TITLE
Iron starvation effect on PA2384 null mutant

SUMMARY
Analysis of PAO1 strain PA2384 null mutant grown under iron-limiting conditions. PA2384 is responsive to iron limitation and is weakly similar to the ferric uptake regulator fur. RNA extracted from cells at various stages of growth. Results provide insight into the function of PA2384.
