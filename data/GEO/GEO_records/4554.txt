TITLE
Akt transgenic response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection: CD8 T cell types

SUMMARY
Analysis of na√Øve CD8 T cells, short-lived effector or memory precursor effector cells from LCMV-infected P14/WT or P14/Akt transgenic females. Results provide insight into the role of Akt in effector and memory CD8 T cell differentiation during viral infection.
