TITLE
Tretinoin effect on promyelocytic leukemia cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells treated with tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid; ATRA) or vehicle. ATRA induces terminal differentiation or growth arrest in HL60 cells. Results suggest a 90-gene expression signature for this cell culture model of hematopoietic differentiation.
