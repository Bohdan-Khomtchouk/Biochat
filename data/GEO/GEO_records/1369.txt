TITLE
Autophagy effect on the MHC class II antigenic peptide repertoire

SUMMARY
Analysis of Awells B-lymphoblastoid cell line after 6 and 24 hours of starvation-induced autophagy. Results identify the influence of autophagy on the MHC-II ligandome, in promoting MHC-II presentation of antigens from intracellular source proteins, and on the MHC-II antigen-processing machinery.
