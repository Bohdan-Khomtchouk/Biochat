TITLE
beta-TrCP inhibition and androgen ablation effects on prostate cancer cell line LAPC4

SUMMARY
Analysis of androgen-sensitive LAPC4 prostate cancer cells following beta-TrCP knockdown and androgen ablation. beta-TrCP inhibition reduces prostate cancer growth, showing an additive effect with androgen ablation. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of beta-TrCP inhibition.
