TITLE
Metabolic state-dependent stress response to short-term anaerobiosis: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of catabolite-repressed (glucose) or derepressed (galactose) wildtype JM43 cells shifted from aerobiosis to anaerobiosis (2 generations). Results identify metabolic remodeling that occurs during acclimatization to short-term anaerobiosis in galactose but not in glucose.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
