TITLE
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator deficiency in different genetic backgrounds

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs of C57BL/6J (B6) or BALB/c (BALB) animals deficient for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). B6 background animals have a higher propensity to develop CF lung disease. Results suggest the variable severity of CF is controlled by multiple genetic factors.
