TITLE
Toxicogenomic response to gold nanoparticle exposure

SUMMARY
Analysis of age-synchronized L3 nematodes exposed to LC10 of gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs). The Au-NPs are used as a model for studying particle-specific effects of manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs).  Results provide insight into in vivo particle-specific toxicity of Au-NPs to C. elegans.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans
