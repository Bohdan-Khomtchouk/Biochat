TITLE
Transcription factor Cabut deficiency and overexpression effects on heads: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of heads from strains overexpressing Cabut (cbtOE) or depleted for Cabut (cbtRNAi) at two time points during the day-night cycle (i.e., 3 hr after light-on or light-off).  Krüppel‐like factors Klf10 and Klf11 are close mammalian homologs of cbt. Results provide insight into role of CBT.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
