TITLE
Estren effect on the estrogen receptor alpha null uterus: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of uteri from adult ovariectomized estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) null mutants treated with estren, estradiol, or 19-nortestosterone for 2 or 24 hours. Estren is a synthetic steroid. Results provide insight into the dependence of gene responses induced by estren in the uterus on ERalpha.
