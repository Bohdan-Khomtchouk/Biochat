TITLE
MAP kinase PMK-1 and transcription factor DAF-16 deletion mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of daf-2(e1368) loss-of-function mutant and daf-2(e1368);pmk-1(km25) and daf-2(e1368);daf-16(mgDf47) double mutants.  PMK-1 and DAF-16 confer enhanced pathogen resistance on daf-2 mutants relative to wild-type. Results suggest DAF-16 and PMK-1 upregulate distinct genes to promote immunity.
