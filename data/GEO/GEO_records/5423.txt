TITLE
Circadian modulators SHARP1/SHARP2 deficiency effect on cortex: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cortex from SHARP1/2 double null mutants at ZT4 (wake phase) and ZT16 (sleep phase). bHLH transcription factors SHARP1 (DEC2, BHLHE41) and SHARP2 (DEC1, BHLHE40) are circadian modulators. Results provide insight into the molecular contributions of SHARP1/SHARP2 to the sleep-wake cycle.
