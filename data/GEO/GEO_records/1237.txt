TITLE
Promyelocytic cell response to Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of NB4 promyelocytic leukemic cells infected with Anaplasma phagocytophilum, an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes granulocytic anaplasmosis. NB4 is a model for neutrophil maturation. Results provide insight into host cellular pathways affected by A. phagocytophilum.
