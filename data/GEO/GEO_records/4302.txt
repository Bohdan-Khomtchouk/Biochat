TITLE
Gfi1b overexpression in a pro-B Abelson leukemia virus transformed cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of Abelson murine leukemia virus (AMuLV) pro-B cell line expressing Gfi1b-estrogen receptor fusion protein. Targeted disruption of transcription factor Gfi1b severly impacts B cell development in vivo. Results provide insight into the role of Gfi1b in normal B cell development.
