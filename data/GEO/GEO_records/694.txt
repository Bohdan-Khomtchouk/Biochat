TITLE
AtMYB23 MYB transcription factor target down-regulation

SUMMARY
Examination of rosette leaves from 2 week old Columbia-0 transgenic seedlings expressing AtMYB23SRDX, a chimeric AtMYB23 MYB transcription factor with an SRDX repression domain. Seedlings expressing AtMYB23SRDX are defective in trichome development.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
