TITLE
YAP overexpression effect on MCF10A mammary epithelial cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF10A mammary epithelial cells overexpressing the transcriptional coactivator YAP.  The Hippo pathway impinges on YAP in mammals to coordinate cell proliferation and apoptosis. Results provide insight into molecular components of the Hippo pathway in mammalian cells.
