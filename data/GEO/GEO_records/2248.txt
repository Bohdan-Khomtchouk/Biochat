TITLE
Hereditary pulmonary arterial hypertension model: lung

SUMMARY
Comparison of lungs of animals expressing a dominant negative type II bone morphogenic protein receptor (BMPRII) in smooth muscles to those with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) induced by acute exposure to hypobaric hypoxia. BMPRII mutations are responsible for the majority of hereditary PAHs.
