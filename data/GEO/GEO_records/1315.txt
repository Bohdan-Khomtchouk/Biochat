TITLE
Immune response to suppressive vs. stimulatory immunomodulators

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC) treated with lipid-transfected, double-stranded DNA or CpG oligonucleotides for 4 hours.  Double-stranded DNA is an immunosuppressive agent (ISD), CpG oligo an immunostimulant.  Results provide insight into differential immune response.
