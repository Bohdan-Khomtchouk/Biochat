TITLE
Accelerated postnatal growth effect on low birth weight (LBW) model: epididymal fat

SUMMARY
Analysis of epididymal fat from 3 week-old ICR males undernourished in utero, but permitted catch-up growth (CUG) during suckling. CUG is a growth pattern associated with obesity and diabetes risk. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the deleterious effects of CUG.
