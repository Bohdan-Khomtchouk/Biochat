TITLE
GR24 effect on strigolactone-deficient mutant seedlings

SUMMARY
Analysis of ecotype Columbia, strigolactone (SL)-deficient mutant seedlings treated with GR24 (1uM), a synthetic SL analog. SLs regulate shoot branching. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying SL signaling.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
