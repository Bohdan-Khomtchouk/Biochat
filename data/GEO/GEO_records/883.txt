TITLE
Lipopolysaccharide-induced gene expression mediated by Schistosome soluble egg antigen

SUMMARY
IL10-/- dendritic cells (DC) pulsed for 6 hours with soluble antigen molecules from the eggs of the helminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni (SEA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or SEA/LPS to compare changes in LPS-induced gene expression mediated by SEA, and the anti-inflammatory properties of SEA.
