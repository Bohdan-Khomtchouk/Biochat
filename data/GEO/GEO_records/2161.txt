TITLE
CH1 domain deletion, p300 and CBP heterozygous null mutant fibroblasts response to hypoxia

SUMMARY
Analysis of hypoxic fibroblasts with deletions in the CH1 domains of p300 and CBP combined with a p300 or CBP allele knockout. CH1 domains interact with the C-TAD domain of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF-1a and -2a. Results provide insight into the role for CH1 domains in hypoxia.
