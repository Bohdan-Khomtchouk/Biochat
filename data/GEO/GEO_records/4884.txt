TITLE
Lysyl oxidase-like 2 depletion effect on MDA-MB-231 cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells depleted for Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2). LOXL2 is a member of the Lysyl oxidase family of copper-containing enzymes that catalyze the oxidative deamination of epsilon-amino groups in lysines. Results provide insight into the role of LOXL2 in transcriptional regulation.
