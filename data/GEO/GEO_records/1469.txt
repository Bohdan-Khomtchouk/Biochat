TITLE
Oxidative stress effect on pyocin expression

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of strain PA01 exposed to hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species, at a sublethal concentration of 1 mM. Results identify upregulation of pyocin (bacteriocin) genes as a potentially novel defensive scheme in response to oxidative attack by infected host cells.

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
