TITLE
Heat-stress-associated 32-kD protein Hsa32 null mutant response to heat shock

SUMMARY
Analysis of heat-stress-associated 32-kD protein (Hsa32) knockout mutant seedlings subjected to heat shock at 37 degrees C for 2 hours. Results provide insight into the role of Hsa32 in acquired thermotolerance.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
