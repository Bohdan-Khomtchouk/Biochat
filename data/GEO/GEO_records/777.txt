TITLE
Nutrient limitation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions effect on gene expression

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of MATa CEN.PK113-7D chemostat cultures grown either aerobically or anaerobically in media limited for either glucose, nitrogen, phosphorous, or sulfur.  Results provide insight into the interaction between oxygen and nutrient responsive pathways.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
