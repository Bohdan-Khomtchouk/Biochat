TITLE
Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor R547 effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with CDK inhibitor R547 at 2 doses for 2 and 24 hours. R547 exerts an antiproliferative effect on various cell lines. Results compared with those from DU145 (GDS5267) and HCT116 cells (GDS5268) to identify pharmacodynamic biomarkers for R547.
