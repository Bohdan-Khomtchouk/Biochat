TITLE
Hoxa11/Hoxd11 null mutation effect on the metanephric mesenchyme

SUMMARY
Analysis of metanephric mesenchyme (MM) dissected from the rudimentary kidney of embryonic day E11.5 Hoxa11 Hoxd11 null mutants and wild types. Gene expression in wild type ureteric bud (UB) examined. Hox11 genes are expressed in the early MM and are required for the induction of UB formation.
