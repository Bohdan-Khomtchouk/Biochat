TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (hiPSC) cardiomyocytes in 2D versus 3D (Engineered heart tissue) format

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of cardiomyocytes cultivated in 2D or age-matched 3D (Engineered heart tissue, EHT) format.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from hiPSC-CM cultivated in 2D versus 3D format. Array data  (Illumina Human HT-12 v2) were processed on the Illumina GenomeStudio V2011.1 Platform (Gene Expression Module 1.9.0), two slides, five conditions with four to five biological replicates each:  cardiomyocytes (N=4), cardiomyocytes 2D (N=5), cardiomyocytes EHT (N=6; table 1). The array data have been quantile normalized on probe level (47,310 probes) without background correction. Data have been log2 transformed after an offset addition (16).
