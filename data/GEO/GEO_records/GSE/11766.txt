SUMMARY
Levels of C/EBPα are low in myeloid blast crisis (BC) of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and its expression in p210BCR/ABL-expressing hematopoietic cells induces granulocytic differentiation, inhibits proliferation and suppresses leukemogenesis.  To assess the mechanisms involved in these effects, C/EBPα targets were identified  by microarray analyses.  Upon C/EBPα activation, expression of c-Myb and GATA-2 was  repressed in 32D-BCR/ABL, K562 and CML-BC primary cells but only c-Myb levels decreased slightly   in CD34+ normal progenitors. The role of these two genes for the biological effects of C/EBPα was assessed by perturbing their expression in K562 cells. Expression of c-Myb blocked the proliferation inhibition and differentiation-inducing effects of C/EBPα while c-Myb siRNA treatment enhanced C/EBPα-mediated proliferation inhibition and induced changes in gene expression indicative of monocytic  differentiation. GATA-2 expression suppressed the proliferation inhibitory effect of C/EBPα but blocked in part the effect on differentiation; GATA-2 siRNA treatment had no effects on C/EBPα induction of differentiation but inhibited proliferation of K562 cells, alone or upon C/EBPα activation. In summary, the effects of C/EBPα in p210BCR/ABL -expressing cells depend, in part, on transcriptional repression of c-Myb and GATA-2.  Since perturbation of c-Myb and GATA-2 expression has non identical consequences for proliferation and differentiation of K562 cells, the effects of C/EBPα appear to involve different transcription-regulated targets.
