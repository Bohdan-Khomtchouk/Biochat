TITLE
BCL11A is a triple-negative breast cancer gene with critical functions in stem and progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has poor prognostic outcome compared to other types  of breast cancer1. At present the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying TNBC  pathology are not well understood1. Here we report that the transcription factor BCL11A is  overexpressed in TNBC including basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) and that its genomic locus  is amplified in up to 38% of BLBC tumours. BCL11A overexpression in immortalised human  breast epithelial cells promotes tumour formation in xenograft models, whereas knockdown  of BCL11A in TNBC cell lines suppresses their tumourigenic potential. In the DMBA-induced  mouse mammary tumour model, Bcl11a is found to be essential for tumourigenesis since  deletion of Bcl11a before DMBA treatment substantially decreases tumour formation, even in  p53-null cells, and inactivation of Bcl11a in established tumours causes their regression. At  the cellular level, BCL11A overexpression enhances clonogenicity in vitro whereas its deletion  in the mouse causes a reduction in the number of mammary epithelial stem and progenitor  cells. Thus, BCL11A has an important role in the genesis of TNBC and in normal mammary  epithelial cells. This study highlights the importance of further investigation of BCL11A in  breast cancer diagnosis and targeted therapies.
