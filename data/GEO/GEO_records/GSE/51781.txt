TITLE
Expression data from oligodendroglial cell line

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Coexpression of alpha-synuclein and p25alpha in an oligodendroglial cell line elicites a degenerative response that relies on aggregation and phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein at Ser129 We used microarray analysis to detail the changes in gene expression caused by alpha-synuclein aggregation followed by cellular degeneration

DESIGN
Alpha-synuclein was coexpressed with p25alpha in an oligodendroglial cell line and mRNA was isolated at 8, 12, and 16 hrs after transfection. Gene expression was analyzed by two identical microarray set-ups
