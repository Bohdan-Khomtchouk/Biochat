TITLE
fiber transformation with activation of CaN pathway

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparing the gene expression profile of day 3 of in vitro cultured FDB fibers with or without activation of calcineurin signaling pathways, with amplified RNA (cRNA probes). constitutively active calcineurin was overexpression in one group of FDB fibers. Keywords: cell treatment
