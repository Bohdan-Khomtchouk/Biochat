TITLE
Gene-level summary data from Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST array was used to measure differential splicing patterns in archived RNA isolated from 26 of 80 children (11 Rejectors and 15 Non-Rejectors). The gene-level probe summaries reported in this series were computed using the Affymetrix Power Tools (APT) software and 'rma-sketch' normalization method. Keywords: Affymetrix 1.0 ST exon array; gene-level analysis

DESIGN
The gene-level normalized intensities (NI) were computed with the MiDAS algorithm and both the splicing index (SI) and Student's t-test p-values (two-sided) were computed on the NI values in R.  To remove low expressed gene-level probes, those with values less than 3.5 (log2 scale) in > 50% of the samples in either group were filtered out leaving 17,242 of the original 22,011 probes. Those gene-level probes that were highly differentially expressed between groups were also removed using a fold change threshold of log2. This step accounts for the tendency for the genelevel probe set intensities in each group to be " disproportionately affected by background noise or saturation " (Affymetrix Technical notes).
