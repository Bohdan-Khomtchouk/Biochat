TITLE
Effects of Salidroside on gene expression in ischemic brain of rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We employed DNA microarray to identify genes differentially regulated by salidroside in ischemic brain of MCAO rats. With a cut of p < .01 and 2-fold change, we found that 121 genes were upregulated and 142 genes were down-regulated in the MCAO group, compared to the sham group. Administration of salidroside (1 h after reperfusion, daily for 6 d) enhanced 28 transcripts and suppressed 16 transcripts. The genes involved in neuroplasticity and oxygen carrier were further confirmed by qRT-PCR. Our data suggest that salidroside could regulate neuroplasticity in post-ischemic stroke, in addition to its neuroportective function.

DESIGN
MCAO rats were injected intraperitoneally with salidroside (50 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle (saline) once a day for 6 d, commencing 1 h after reperfusion (n=3  /group). Ischemic brain was dissected for RNA extraction. Differential gene expression regulated by salidroside were analysed by microarray and subsequently confirmed by qRT-PCR.
