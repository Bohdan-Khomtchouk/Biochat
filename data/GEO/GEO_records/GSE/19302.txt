TITLE
Expression profile of the “heat-inducible N-degron” of Nab2 (nab2-td)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Gene expression in eukaryotes is an essential process that includes transcription, pre-RNA processing and RNA export. All these steps are coupled and normally, any failure in one step affects the other steps and could cause nuclear mRNA retention. One important player in this interface is the poly(A)-RNA binding protein Nab2, which regulates the poly(A)-tail length of mRNAs protecting their 3’-ends from a second round of polyadenylation and facilitating their nucleo-cytoplasmic export. Interestingly, here we show that Nab2 has additional roles in mRNA transcription elongation, tRNA metabolism and rRNA export. We use Genome-wide analysis of expression of a conditional degron nab2 mutant that allows the depletion of the protein in 15 minutes, to demosntrate that the role of Nab2 in RNAPII transcription and RNAPIII metabolism is not the result of a secondary effect. Our results identify primary targets of nab2 revealing novel functions for Nab2 in transcription and metabolism of most types of RNAs, not only poly(A) mRNAs, indicating that Nab2 function is more ubiquitous than previously anticipated, being a central player in the general and coordinated control of gene expression from transcription elongation to translation initiation.

DESIGN
Two and three repeats of the wild type control and the nab2-td mutant respectively at time 0, 30 and 75 minutes after the degron induction.
