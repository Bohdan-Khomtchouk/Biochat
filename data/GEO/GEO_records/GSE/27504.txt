TITLE
miRNA profiles of tonsillar B cell subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to assess the miRNA signature of B cells undergoing the germinal center reaction, we isolated three subsets of B cells from tonsils--naive (N), germinal center (GC), and memory (M) and looked at their miRNA profile.

DESIGN
We looked at three subsets of B cells, isolated from tonsils obtained from four different donors. Thus, we profiled a total of 12 samples, and each tonsillar subset--N, GC, and M, had four biological replicates.
