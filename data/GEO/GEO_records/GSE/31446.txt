TITLE
Tumor-microenvironment interactions studied by zonal transcriptional profiling of squamous cell lung carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better understand the interaction between tumor cells and their microenvironment with regard to mechanisms of invasion, total RNA was isolated from the inner-tumor, tumor invasion front, adjacent lung and distant normal lung tissue from 18 patients with squamous cell lung carcinoma using punch-aided laser capture microdissection. Comprehensive mRNA expression profiles were obtained from microarray expreiments and statistical analyses revealed extensive changes in gene expression when comparing the inner tumor and tumor front with the normal lung and lung front. However, only a few genes were differentially expressed between the tumor front and the inner tumor. The identified genes indicate prostaglandin mediated inflammatory processes at the invasion front
