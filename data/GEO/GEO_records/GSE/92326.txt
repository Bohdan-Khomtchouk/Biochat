TITLE
Transcription analysis of the responses of porcine heart to Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is generally regarded as an opportunistic pathogen that causes erysipelas in swine and other diseases in several mammalian and avian species.This study aimed to perform a whole-genomic analysis of the transcriptional responses of a pig heart to virulent and avirulent strains and PBS by using Affymetrix Porcine Gene 1.0 ST Microarray to elucidate the immune responses of hosts to E. rhusiopathiae.

DESIGN
A total of 9 healthy pigs were randomly allocated to 3 groups with 3 pigs each: two groups of piglets were challenged intradermally with virulent and avirulent strains , respectively, and the remaining piglets were used as controls. Challenged by an identical volume of PBS.

PLATFORM
GPL16493 [PorGene-1_0-st] Porcine Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
