TITLE
Experimentally identified targets of a subset of adenovirus 5-encoded miRNAs.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human adenovirus 5 encodes a small set of miRNAs, which are generated by DICER-mediated processing of 2 larger precursors, the so-called virus-associated RNAs I and II. To identify targets of one of the major miRNA isoforms derived from virus-associated RNAI (mivaRNAI-137), we isolated Argonaute complexes of mivaRNAI-137-transfected cells and analyzed co-purifying RNAs by microarray analysis. RNAs enriched in Argonaute complexes of mivaRNAI-137-transfected cells compared to cells transfected with a control siRNA were identified and subjected to further validation. RNAs specifically associated with Argonaute-containining complexes of adenovirus 5-infected cells were identified as well.

DESIGN
9 sets of RNAs isolated from Argonaute-containing complexes of cells transfected with 2 types of adenovirus 5-encoded miRNAs or a negative control siRNA as well as the corresponding total RNA were subjected to microarray analysis. Consequences on gene expression of hypoxic condition created by exposure of cells to 1% oxygen in a hypoxia chamber.
