TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of omental adipose tissues in human obesity by RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: To profile the transcriptomes of omental adipose tissues from obese and lean humans. Methods: Omental adipose tissues from obese and lean patients were subjected to RNA-Seq. Results: Differential expression analysis identified 206 dysregulated genes (p-value < 0.05 by moderated t-test and fold change â‰¥ 2 in obesity) that are known to be involved in a multitude of functions, including response to stress, inflammatory response and leukocyte adhesion. Differential splicing analysis uncovered the possible role of TLR4 RNA splicing in obesity. Our findings suggest that, as a person experiences weight gain/obesity, the adipose splicing pattern of TLR4 transcripts changes in favor of activation of TLR4 signaling, which in turn may contribute to the progression of obesity-related inflammation and complications. Conclusion:  This study provides a look into the transcriptome of disease-state adipose tissue in obesity, and demonstrates the potential importance of aberrant RNA splicing and expression in obesity-associated immune dysregulation.

DESIGN
Study design is of cross-sectional nature. Seven samples (three obese and four lean) were analyzed.
