TITLE
Expression data of EZH2-dependent genes in prostate cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EZH2 is frequently over-expressed in aggressive and metastatic solid tumors, including castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We sought to determine EZH2-dependent gene expression programmes in prostate cancer progression, and found an intriguing functional switch of EZH2 from a repressor to an activator during CRPC development. We used microarrays to detail the global profiling of gene expression that are differentially regulated upon EZH2 depletion in two different prostate cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
The androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and the LNCaP-derived androgen-independent cell line LNCaP-abl (abl) were used for this study, as their transcription profiles strongly resemble that of clinical androgen-dependent and castration resistant prostate tumors, respectively. EZH2 was silenced by specific siRNAs in both cell lines, and total RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
