Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The SNAI1 and SNAI2 embryonic genes are reactivated in numerous cancer types, including carcinomas. They promote cancer cell dissemination by inducing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and by protecting cells from anoikis. We now have demonstrated that the sequentially related SNAI3 gene is aberrantly reactivated in human breast carcinomas. To compare the functional properties of the three SNAIL family members, the transcription factors were ectopically expressed in immortalized mammary epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC-hTERT cells) or MCF10A cells were infected with SNAIL retroviral expression constructs. The gene expression profiles of the resulting cell lines, cultured in standard conditions or after plating them 24h in low-adherent (LA) conditions, were performed.
