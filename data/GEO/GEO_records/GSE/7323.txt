TITLE
Hippocampus response to ketone bodies (maalo-affy-rat-387180)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Diets characterized by increased blood levels of ketone bodies can protect the brain against a variety of acute and chronic neurological diseases. Moreover, ketone bodies are neuroprotective in many in vitro models of neurological injury. The underlying mechanisms remain unknown however. Recently, we have shown that ketone bodies do not only decrease neuronal injury and death but also protect long-term potentiation in acute hippocampal slices exposed to oxidative stress in the form of exogenous hydrogen peroxide. Elucidating the mechanisms behind the effects of ketone bodies on neuronal survival and function will undoubtedly lead to the development of novel neuroprotective treatments. Our aim is to determine acute changes in gene expression of CA1 pyramidal neurons exposed to various duration of the ketone bodies acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons exposed to oxidative stress do not display any long-term potention following burst stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. Incubation with the ketone bodies acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate for at least 20 min prior to hydrogen peroxide application restores long-term potentiation to control levels. We hypothesize that the neuroprotective effects of ketone bodies are mediated by changes in gene expression. Acute hippocampal slices (400 microns in thickness) were obtained from 4 week-old rats and exposed to acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (1 mM each) for 1 h and 6 h.  A control group was incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid only. After treatment, the hippocampal slices were used immediately for RNA isolation. Isolated RNA was sent for analysis. Each sample sent for analysis included tissue from 7 separate animals. Hybridization to an Affymetrix array is being performed 3 times for each experimental condition. Keywords: dose response
