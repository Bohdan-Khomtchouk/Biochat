TITLE
INTACT method for gene expression and chromatin profiling of individual cell types within a tissue

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used in vivo biotin labeling of a nuclear envelope protein in individual cell types followed by affinity isolation of labeled nuclei to measure gene expression and chromatin features of the hair and non-hair cell types of the Arabidopsis root epidermis. Keywords: Chromatin affinity-purification on microarray

DESIGN
All experiments were done using two channels per chip. Two types of experiments were performed. Expression profiling was performed by comparing cDNAs synthesized from nuclear RNA isolated from INTACT-prepared Arabidopsis nuclei to total sonicated genomic DNA isolated from Arabidopsis plants. Chromatin profiling was performed using INTACT-prepared Arabidopsis nuclei. DNA isolated by Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using antibodies to modified histones was compared to histone H3 ChIP DNA from the same sample.
