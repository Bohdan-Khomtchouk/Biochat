TITLE
Global miRNA expression profiling of Junb-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The AP-1 transcription factor subunit Junb acts as a context-dependent transcriptional regulator. While positive regulatory functions of Junb are widely studied, the mechanism by which Junb exerts negative regulatory functions remains unclear. miRNAs could translate repressor functions of Junb. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify Junb-dependent miRNAs in immortalized fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from murine Junb knock-out and wildtype embryos. Cells were published previously in Licht et al. (2010) J Clin Invest. 120(7):2307-18.

DESIGN
Junb knock-out clones (n=2) and wildtype clones  (n=2) have been screened for the expression of all currently known murine miRNAs.
