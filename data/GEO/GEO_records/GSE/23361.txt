TITLE
Significant Downregulation of Platelet Gene Expression in Metastatic Lung Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Platelets have multiple roles in cancer cell metastasis.  In this work we employed exon microarray technology to address platelet gene expression in metastatic non small cell lung cancer versus controls without cancer.  We found that 197 of the 200 genes with the most significantly altered expression levels had their expression levels downregulated.

DESIGN
Retrospective observational study. Total of 12 samples: 6 controls and 6 lung cancer samples.
