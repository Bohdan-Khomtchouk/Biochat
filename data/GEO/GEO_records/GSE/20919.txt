TITLE
Short-term (12h) ATRA treatment of embryoid bodies.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in embryonic stem cells, early differentiated embrioid bodies and effect of short-term ATRA treatment.

DESIGN
Expression data from undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (D3), four-day old aggregated embrioid bodies and 12h atRA or DMSO treated embrioid bodies. Three replicates each.

PLATFORM
