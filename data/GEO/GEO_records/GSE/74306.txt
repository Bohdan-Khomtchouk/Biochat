TITLE
Mouse Dendritic Cells Expression Data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DC) play a vital role in the induction of activation or tolerance of immune response.  Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors potently modulate experimental graft-vs-host disease, allograft rejection, and autoimmune diseases, partly through the regulation of dendritic cells. The molecular mechanisms underpinning their immunosuppressive effects on DCs are not well understood. The functional relevance of acetylation in DC responses remains undefined. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in dendritic cells after treated with or without SAHA, a HDAC inhibitor utilized in clinic, to identify the upregulated and downregulated genes.

DESIGN
To obtain overall gene expression profile, we extracted bone marrow cells from at least 3 mice for each experiment.  Purified (95% purity) mouse dendritic cells were treated with SAHA (500 nm for 12 hours) or control diluent, then used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
