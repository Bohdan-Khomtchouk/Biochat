TITLE
Gene expression data in aortic tissue from rats with experimental preeclampsia, healthy pregnancy and non pregnant rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Normal pregnancy requires adaptations of the maternal vasculature. During preeclampsia these adjustments are not well established, resulting in maternal hypertension and proteinuria. The effects of preeclampsia on the maternal vasculature are not yet fully understood. We aimed to identify gene expression differences in the aorta between non pregnant, healthy pregnant, and experimental preeclamptic rats using a genome wide approach. Whole aortic tissue was isolated from rats with low-dose LPS-induced preeclampsia, healthy pregnant and non-pregnant rats. Gene expression was measured by a whole genome microarray.

DESIGN
3 groups were compared. Preeclamptic animals (n=5), healthy pregnant animals (n=5), and non pregnant animals (n=4)
