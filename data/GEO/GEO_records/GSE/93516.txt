TITLE
A double blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study to examine reduction of CD34+/CD117+ lymphoma progenitor cells and duration of remission induced by neoadjuvant valspodar in dogs with large B-cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
We previously described a population of lymphoid progenitor cells (LPCs) in canine B-cell lymphoma defined by retention of the early progenitor markers CD34 and CD117 and slow proliferation molecular signatures that persist in the xenotransplantation setting. We examined whether valspodar, a selective inhibitor of the ATP-binding cassette B1 transporter (ABCB1, a.k.a., p-glycoprotein/multidrug resistance protein-1) used in the neoadjuvant setting would sensitize LPCs to doxorubicin and extend the length of remission in dogs with therapy-naive large B-cell lymphoma. Twenty dogs were enrolled into a double-blinded, placebo controlled study where experimental and control groups received oral valspodar (7.5 mg/kg) or placebo, respectively, twice daily for five days followed by five treatments with doxorubicin 21 days apart with a reduction in the first dose to mitigate the potential side effects of ABCB1 inhibition. Lymph node and blood LPCs were quantified at diagnosis, on the fourth day of the neoadjuvant period, and 1-week after the first chemotherapy dose. Valspodar therapy was well tolerated. There were no significant differences between groups in total LPCs in lymph nodes or peripheral blood, nor in event-free survival or overall survival. Overall, we conclude that valspodar can be administered safely in the neoadjuvant setting for canine B-cell lymphoma; however, its use to attenuate ABCB1+ cells does not appear to alter the composition of lymph node or blood LPCs, and it is not sufficient to prolong doxorubicin-dependent remissions in this setting.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of lymph node biopsy samples from dogs with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, before and after 4-days of  treatment with valspodar or placebo, were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
