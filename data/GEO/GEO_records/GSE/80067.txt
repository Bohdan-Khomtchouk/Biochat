TITLE
Effects of model chylomicron remants on gene expresssion in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene experssion study of the HAEC transcriptional response to artificial chlyomicron remnant-like particles (A-CRLPs) prepared with triglycerides extracted from four natural dietary oils: fish, DHASCO, corn and palm oils.  We hypothesised that A-CRLPs could differentially regulate HAEC gene expression according to thier triglyceride content.  These data provide an important starting point for investigations into the effects of A-CRLPs on endothelial cells, particulary genes involved in redox balance and inflammatory processes.

DESIGN
Six experimental conditions: PBS (extra control), Primary/main  control remnant control (RC), Fish, DHASCO, Corn or Palm A-CRLPs  n = 4 biological replicates (i.e. 4 HAEC batches from different donors)
