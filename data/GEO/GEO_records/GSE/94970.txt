TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of human T-cell Jurkat cell line in resting cells (t0) and at 8h, 24h and 48h post-activation using Raji B-cells conjugated with superantigen (SEE)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Activation of T-cells induces dramatic changes in genome organisation and gene transcription. Here we identify changes in transcriptional profiles at 8h, 24h and 48 post activation

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from resting and activated Jurkat cells at three separate time points

PLATFORM
