TITLE
Transcriptome of reloaded soleus muscle of 129/SV mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
1 year-old male 129/SV mice. Animals were acclimatized to housing in single cages for one week followed by 7 days of hindlimb suspension and one day of reloading. Soleus muscle was harvested, total RNA isolated and subjected to transcript profiling with custom microarrays with custom-designed ATLASTM cDNA nylon filter as described (Dapp, C., Schmutz, S., Hoppeler, H. & Fluck, M. (2004) Physiol Genomics 20, 97-107). Keywords: transcriptome
