TITLE
Human Wnt signaling pathway (Realtime qPCR array)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSC) and human embryonic mesenchymal stem cells (ESMSC)were used. X-ray irradiation (2Gy) or 0Gy was delivered. After 4 hours, equal amount total RNA from each sample was extracted prior to gene expression analysis. After making cDNA, genes associated with Wnt signaling pathway were analyzed.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling.  Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and human embryonic mesenchymal stem cells were used. X-ray irradiation (2Gy) or 0Gy was delivered. After 4 hours, equal amount total RNA from each sample was extracted prior to gene expression analysis.
