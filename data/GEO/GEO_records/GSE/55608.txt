TITLE
Expression data from human primary monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the delayed LPS-induced expression pattern in monocytes. Activation of monocytes by microbial products is an important mechanism contributing to host protection against invading pathogens. This process has to be tightly controlled to ensure that antimicrobial response does not result in fatal host tissue damage. Therefore we investigated control mechanisms during prolonged monocyte activation by bacterial endotoxin.

DESIGN
We performed a genome-wide analysis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered expression profile in monocytes after 4 hours and 16 hours. To identify destinct delayed LPS-induced expression pattern  we compared these both expression profiles.
