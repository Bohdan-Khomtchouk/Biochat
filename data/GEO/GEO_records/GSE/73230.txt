TITLE
Gene expression of canine mammary cancer stem-like cells co-cultured with tumor associated macrophages

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
The aim of our study was to evaluate gene expression of canine mammary cancer stem-like cells co-cultured with tumor associated macrophages. Two canine mammary cancer cell lines (CMT-U27 and P114) were stained using  anti-Sca1 (stem cell antigen 1), anti-EpCAM (Epithelial cell adhesion molecule)  and anti-CD44 antibody. The FACS analysis showed 0,02-0,05% of Sca1+/EpCAM+/CD44+ in each of the cell line. Cancer stem-like cells were collected using FACS Aria II then  co-cultured with tumor associated macrophages and used for further analysis of gene expression ( using Agilent Gene Expression Hybridization Kit ).

DESIGN
Canine mammary cancer cell lines were stained using anti-Sca1 (stem cell antigen 1), anti-EpCAM (Epithelial cell adhesion molecule) and anti-CD44 antibodies. Next using FACS Aria II and Sca1+/EpCAM+/CD44+ cells were collected and co-cultured with tumor associated macrophages. Then, total RNA was isolated and hybridized at Gene Expression microarray.
