TITLE
Genome-wide impact of ART-27 loss on androgen-regulated transcription in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The androgen receptor (AR) directs diverse biological processes through interaction with coregulators such as androgen receptor trapped clone-27 (ART-27). The impact of ART-27 on genome-wide transcription was examined. The studies indicate that loss of ART-27 enhances expression of many androgen-regulated genes, suggesting that ART-27 inhibits gene expression. Surprisingly, classes of genes that are upregulated upon ART-27 depletion include regulators of DNA damage checkpoint and cell cycle progression, suggesting that ART-27 functions to keep expression levels of these genes low.

DESIGN
Steroid-deprived LNCaP cells were transfected with control or ART-27 siRNA and stimulated with ethanol vehicle or 10 nM R1881 for 18 hrs. 8 samples, 4 conditions, 2 replicates per condition.
