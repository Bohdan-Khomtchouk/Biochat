TITLE
microRNA expression in skin and wound edge tissue at different time points

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Change in miRNA expression pattern during different phases of wound healing following full thickness excisional wounding was studied.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a comprehensive profiling of all the mouse/rat miRs annotated in the miRBase 8.0 was performed using the FlexmiRâ„¢ MicroRNA Labeling Kit

PLATFORM
