TITLE
Expression data comparing wild-type and spt mutant zebrafish tissues at two developmental time points.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Mesoderm differentiation in zebrafish relies on a complex interaction between transcription factors and signaling pathways. Tbx16 is a t-box transcription factor involved in this interaction. Here, we examine downstream targets of tbx16 in the intermediate mesoderm at the 4/5-somite stage and tail mesoderm at the 21-somite stage by comparing wild-type tissues with tissues from the tbx16 mutant, spadetail (spt).

DESIGN
We isolated meodermal tissues at two developmental time points (4/5-somite and 21-somite) from both wild-type and spt mutant tissues using dissection and FACS. We compared patterns of gene expression between the mutant and wild-type using Affymetrix zebrafish arrays. We also used GSEA to look for globally disrupted signaling pathways in the mutant at both developmental time points.
