TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human lung cancer and control samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PURPOSE The development of reliable gene expression profiling technology is having an increasing impact on our understanding of lung cancer biology. The present study aims to determine whether the phenotypic heterogeneity and genetic diversity of lung cancer are correlated. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this study, microarray analysis was performed in a set of 91 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples in order to: establish gene signatures in primary adenocarcinomas and squamous-cell carcinomas; determine differentially expressed gene sequences at different stages of the disease; and identify sequences with biological significance for tumor progression. After microarray analysis, the expression level of 92 selected genes was validated by qPCR in an independent set of 70 samples. RESULTS Gene sequences were differentially expressed as a function of tumor type, stage, and differentiation grade. High upregulation was observed for KRT15 and PKP1, which may be good markers to distinguish squamous cell carcinoma samples. High downregulation was observed for DSG3 in stage IA adenocarcinomas. CONCLUSION Expression signatures in NSCLC distinguish tumor type, stage, and differentiation grade. Keywords: Tumor vs control comparative genomics study

DESIGN
91 samples studied, 46 tumors and 45 controls. All samples are paired except three.
