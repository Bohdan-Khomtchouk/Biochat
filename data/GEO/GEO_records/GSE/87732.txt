TITLE
Expression data from Daxx knockout MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) often harbor loss-of-function mutations in Daxx gene. Daxx interacts with several partners to regulate cellular processes and gene expression. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression change in Daxx knockout MEFs and identified up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Daxx knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts complemented with vector or Daxx were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain downstream target genes regulated by Daxx.
