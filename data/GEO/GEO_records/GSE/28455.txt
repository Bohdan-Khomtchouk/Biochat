TITLE
Sox2-regulatory networks in embryonic and trophoblast stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sox2 is a pleiotropic transcription factor that regulates self-renewal and differentiation capacity in different types of stem cells, raising the possibility that it regulates similar transcriptional programs controlling common stemness. Embryonic stem (ES) cells and trophoblast stem (TS) cells are two developmentally related types of stem cells, which originate from distinct lineages of peri-implantation embryos. We have found that Sox2 is a critical regulator of self-renewal in both of two stem cells. Genome-wide analysis of Sox2 target genes using Affymetrix Exon Arrays and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) unraveled that it regulates distinct transcriptional networks in ES and TS cells. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
