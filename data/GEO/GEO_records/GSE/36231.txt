TITLE
S. aureus gene expression following growth in media containing oleic acid

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus RN4220

SUMMARY
S. aureus response to exogenous fatty acid (oleic acid) Gene expression profiles were generated by microarray analysis of S. aureus cells grown in media without or with oleic aicd

DESIGN
Comparison of expression profiles after growth of S. aureus in exogenous fatty acid S. aureus was grown in media with and without oleic acid to an OD600nm of 0.5, and RNA was extracted to look at the gobal gene expression.
