TITLE
Profiling gene expression changes in the epidermis of embryonic murine Harlequin Icthyosis skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of the epidermis from Lexicon Genetics Abca12 knockout mouse model of Harlequin Ichythois compared with wild type embryos to search for pathways specifically altered in the condition. Results indicate a large immune and inflammatory response occurs in the sterile environment of the uterus.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from E17.5 back skin epidermis from murine Harlequin Ichthyosis model compared with wild type embryos.
