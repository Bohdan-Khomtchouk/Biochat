TITLE
Expression profiles of human oral cancer cell lines under hypoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A gene expression profiles of human oral squamous cell carcinoma lines, HSC-2 and Ca9-22, cultured under hypoxic conditions (1% pO2 for 24 or 48 hours) were compaired with those under normoxic conditions (21% pO2).

DESIGN
Six arrays for 2 cell lines in 3 conditions were analyzed.
