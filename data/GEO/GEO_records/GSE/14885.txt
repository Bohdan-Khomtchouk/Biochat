TITLE
Time course study of Mediterranean mussel (M. galloprovincialis, Lmk, 1819) digestive gland treated with okadaic acid

ORGANISM
Mytilus galloprovincialis

SUMMARY
Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lmk, 1819) is economically relevant bivalve specie. In Adriatic Sea, periodical temperatures increases define optimal growth conditions for Dinoflagellate spp which can reach high concentrations also in filter-feeding mussels, thus causing potential human health problems. The most commonly used methods for the detection of Diarrhoeic Shellfish Poisoning  biotoxins have either a low sensitivity or are too expensive to be used for routine tests. Genomic tools, such as microarray platforms, provide a reliable and alternative solution to overcome these problems. In this study we used a mussel cDNA microarray for studying gene expression changes in mussels exposed to Okadaic acid. Mussels collected in the Gulf of Trieste, located in Northern Adriatic Sea, were fed with Okadaic acid-spiked invertebrates for five weeks. In a time course experiment we were able to describe an early acute response just from the first 4th day time point. Among the differentially expressed genes we found a general up-regulation of stress proteins and proteins involved in cellular synthesis. Overall, we identified 34 transcripts candidate as useful markers to monitor OA-induced stress in mussels. This study contributes to the characterization of many potential genetic markers that could be used in future environmental monitoring, and could lead to explore new mechanisms of stress tolerance in marine mollusc species. Keywords: Time course, stress response

DESIGN
Loop Design experiment including 5 time points (T0 = control samples, T1 = 3 days post treatment, T2 = 1 week post treatment, T4 = 3 weeks post treatment, T6 = 5 weeks post treatment). 3 biological replicates were done for a total number of 15 samples
