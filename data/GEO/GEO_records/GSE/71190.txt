TITLE
High-density deletion bin map of wheat D genome

ORGANISM
Aegilops tauschii

SUMMARY
A NimbleGen array containing both gene-based and RJM repeat junction probe sequences derived from Ae. Tauschii was developed and used to map the Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic lines and deletion bin lines of the D genome chromosomes.

DESIGN
The NimbleGen array was hybridized in duplicate with Cy3 labeled seven nullisomic-tetrasomic lines, deletion bin lines for D genome chromosomes, and control reference Chinese Spring; as well as Cy5 labeled reference line Chinese Spring.
