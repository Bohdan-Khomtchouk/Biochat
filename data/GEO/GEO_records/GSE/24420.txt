TITLE
Chip-chip from mouse olfactory epithelium (OE) and liver with antibodies against H3K9me3 and H4K20me3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Olfactory Receptor (OR) genes are specifically expressed in the MOE in a monogenic and monoallelic fashion. Only 1 out of 2800 alleles is expressed in each olfactory sensory neuron in mice. ChIP-chip from mouse olfactory epithelium (OE) and liver for H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 revealed that the ORs are highly enriched for these modifications in OE but not in liver.
