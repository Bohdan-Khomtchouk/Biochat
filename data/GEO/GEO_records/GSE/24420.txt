TITLE
Chip-chip from mouse olfactory epithelium (OE) and liver with antibodies against H3K9me3 and H4K20me3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Olfactory Receptor (OR) genes are specifically expressed in the MOE in a monogenic and monoallelic fashion. Only 1 out of 2800 alleles is expressed in each olfactory sensory neuron in mice. ChIP-chip from mouse olfactory epithelium (OE) and liver for H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 revealed that the ORs are highly enriched for these modifications in OE but not in liver.

DESIGN
24 samples were analyzed (20 from OE and 4 from liver) with matching inputs as controls. For the OE samples, there were 2-3 replicates for each array.
