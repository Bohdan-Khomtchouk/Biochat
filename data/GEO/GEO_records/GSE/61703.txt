TITLE
ChIP-chip of MCF7 Sox2 regulatory region 2 transcription activity reporter unresponsive and reporter responsive breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found that MCF7 and ZR751 Sox2-expressing breast cancer cell lines comprise of cells with heterogeneous Sox2 transcription activity reporter response. A small subset of Sox2 reporter responsive cells are more tumourigenic than the bulk Sox2 reporter unresponsive cells. We questioned whether Sox2 exhibit differential gene promoter occupancies in the two cell subsets to govern differential gene expression patterns.

DESIGN
Sox2 ChIP in reporter unresponsive (RU) and reporter responsive (RR) cells (duplicate samples) were compared. IgG ChIP in RU and RR cells served as the negative controls.
