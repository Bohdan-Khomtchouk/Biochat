TITLE
RNA-seq of male and female control cortex

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study was to compare gene expression patterns in the male and female human cortex Methods: We performed RiboZero Gold (rRNA depleted) 50bp PE RNA-seq in a set of control samples of both sexes to identify sexually dimorphic gene expression patterns. Results: Within these samples, we corroborated findings from a discovery set of RNA-seq data from adult human cortex tissue from the BrainSpan consortium which demonstrated male-biased expression of astrocyte marker genes and a gene co-expression module found to be up-regulated in the adult autistic cortex. Conclusions: These findings suggest that sex-differential risk for autism spectrum disorder is not the result of sex-differential regulation of ASD risk genes, but of naturally occurring sexually dimorphic processes that modulate the impact of risk variants for autism spectrum disorder.
