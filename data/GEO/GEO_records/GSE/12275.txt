TITLE
MEF FAN TNF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FAN (Factor associated with neutral sphingomyelinase activation) is an adaptor protein that constitutively binds to TNF-R1. Microarray analysis was performed in fibroblasts derived from wild-type or FAN knockout mouse embryos to evaluate the role of FAN in TNF-induced gene expression. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
MEFs were derived from C57BL/6 embryos that were either wild type or FAN-/-. Cells were either grown in DMEM 0%FCS for 24h or DMEM 0% FCS for 8h followed by incubation in DMEM 0% FCS containing 50ng/ml TNF for 16h. These four conditions were each used to generate total RNA (RNeasy MidiKit, Qiagen) which was sent to AROS applied biotechnology (Sweden) for Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array analysis.
