TITLE
Smart-seq2 analysis of P17 FACS sorted retinal cells from the Kcng4-cre;stop-YFP X  Thy1-stop-YFP Line#1 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Four Kcng4-cre;stop-YFP mouse retinas from two mice were dissected, dissociated and FACS sorted, and single cell RNA-seq libraries were generated for 384 single cells using Smart-seq2. Aligned bam files are generated for 383 samples as one failed to align.

DESIGN
Four mouse retinas (labeled 1la, 1Ra, and 2la, 2Ra respective from the two mice) were used, and 96 single cells from each were processed using Smart-seq2. Total 384 cells Smart-seq2 analysis of P17 FACS sorted retinal cells from the Kcng4-cre;stop-YFP mice (Kcng4tm1.1(cre)Jrs mice [Duan et al., Cell 158, 793-807, 2015] crossed to the cre-dependent reporter Thy1-stop-YFP Line#1 [Buffelli et al., Nature 424, 430-434, 2003])
