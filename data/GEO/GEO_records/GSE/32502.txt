TITLE
Expression data from primary human skin fibroblasts treated with vehicle (DMSO) and the antioxidant Trolox (0.5 mM, 96 hrs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three (3) independent cell cultures for each condition (DMSO and Trolox) were analyzed. The effect of Trolox was checked on the protein level (being an increased protein level of fully assembled mitochondrial complex I) using blue-native PAGE analysis (as described in Koopman et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1777:853-859, 2008, prior to mRNA extraction.  We used the control cell line #5120 at similar passage number for all six experiments.

DESIGN
We generated the following pairwise comparisons Vehicle > Trolox and Vehicle < Trolox. Changes â‰¥2  and Benjamini Hochberg corrected p-values < 0.05 were considered significant.
