TITLE
Comprehensive transcriptome profiles distinguish the CSP and XIP signaling pathways in Streptococcus mutans UA159

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
In Streptococcus mutans, an oral colonizer associated with dental caries, competence for natural transformation can be triggered by both CSP and XIP pheromones. Competence induced by CSP is a late response that requires induction of the XIP encoding gene comS, but the mechanism(s) linking the two systems remains unknown. To learn how the CSP and XIP pheromone regulatory pathways are temporally linked, we mapped the global changes in gene expression at early and late phases of the CSP response and investigated the effect of deletion of comS on the S. mutans transcriptional profile. The early phase of the CSP response was characterized by an increase in gene expression at five loci associated with bacteriocin production and immunity. In the late phase, the up-regulated regions expanded to include a total of 27 loci, including comS and genes required for DNA uptake and recombination. In the absence of comS, no increase in expression of the genes up-regulated as a late response was observed in response to CSP, whereas expression of those regulated as an early response was maintained.  These results indicate that the entire late response to CSP depends on the expression of comS and that the immediate transcriptional response to CSP, mediated by ComE, is restricted to just five bacteriocin-related loci

DESIGN
To distinguish the immediate, and presumably direct, regulatory response to CSP from later, and presumably indirect, effects of exposure to this pheromone, we have assembled a comprehensive strand-specific microarray census of mRNA in strain UA159 at both early and late times in the CSP response as well as in a comS mutant.
