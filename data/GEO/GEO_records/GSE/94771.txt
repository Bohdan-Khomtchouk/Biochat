TITLE
microRNA expression in bovine cumulus cells and its relation to oocyte developmental competence

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
microRNA sequencing to find differences in miRNA expression in bovine cumulus cells between cumulus pieces retrieved from COCs developing into a blastocyst after fertilization or remain uncleaved after fertilization

DESIGN
cumulus pieces of the two different groups were analysed, if there is a difference in miRNA expression

PLATFORM
GPL23055 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Bos taurus)
