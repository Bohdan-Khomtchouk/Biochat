TITLE
CD4+ T cell gene expression in virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients during Maraviroc intensification therapy.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4+ T cell gene expression changes after 4 and 24 weeks of Maraviroc administration relative to baseline in 25 immunodiscordant patients with viral suppression. Maraviroc elicited very modest changes in CD4+ T cell transcriptome.

DESIGN
The goal of this study was to identify genes with a potential role in Maraviroc-induced CD4+ T cell recovery in immunodiscordant patients. The study measured gene expression in CD4+ T cells isolated from the whole blood of HIV-infected patients before and at two time points after addition of Maraviroc to the baseline antiretroviral therapy. Thirty two patients were recruited from 3 sites, University of California, San Diego (UCSD), University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and University of Southern California (USC), and peripheral blood samples were obtained at 3 visits, week 0 (baseline), week 4 and week 24 after initiation of Maraviroc therapy. Because of poor RNA quality and outliers on the microarrays, 7 patients were excluded from the study. Non-outlier week 0 and week 24 arrays from one of the patients (Patient ID 01-005) were used for array data normalization and processing, but were not included in the time course analysis since the week 4 sample was not available.
