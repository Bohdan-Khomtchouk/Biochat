TITLE
Xylella fastidiosa 9a5c: gomesin-treated cells vs. control

ORGANISM
Xylella fastidiosa

SUMMARY
In the xylem vessels of susceptible hosts, such as citrus trees or grapevines, Xylella fastidiosa forms biofilm like-colonies that can block water transport, which appears to correlate to disease symptoms. Besides helping host colonization, bacterial biofilms play an important role in resistance against antimicrobial agents, for instance antimicrobial peptides (AMP). Here we show that gomesin, a potent AMP from a Brazilian tarantula spider, modulates X. fastidiosa gene expression profile upon 60 min treatment with a sublethal concentration. Data from DNA microarray hybridizations revealed that among the up-regulated coding sequences (CDS), some are related to biofilm production. In addition, we show that the biofilm formed by gomesin-treated bacteria is thicker than that formed by non-treated cells or cells exposed to streptomycin. We have also observed that treatment of X. fastidiosa with sublethal concentration of gomesin before inoculation in tobacco plants correlates with reduction in CVC symptoms, an effect possibly due to trapping of bacterial cells to fewer xylem vessels given the enhancement in biofilm production. Together, our results suggest that X. fastidiosa can selectively sense a sublethal concentration of gomesin modulating its gene expression to produce a stronger biofilm that may protect itself against the toxic effects of this AMP.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control (PW media) vs. gomesin-treated cells. Biological replicates: 5 control, 5 gomesin-treated, independently grown and harvested. Two replicates (left and right side of slide) per array. Total of 10 slides were hibridized, including dye-swap of and two self-self experiments.
