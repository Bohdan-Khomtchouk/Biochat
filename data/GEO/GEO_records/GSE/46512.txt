TITLE
Ribosome Profiling over a Zebrafish Developmental Timecourse

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To experimentally-validate the non-coding status of annotated lncRNAs, we performed ribosome profiling over a developmental timecourse that matched our previously-published (Pauli et al. 2012) developmental transcriptome. We find that many previously-annotated lncRNAs appear to be translated, but in a pattern more akin to 5' leaders of coding genes.

DESIGN
Ribosome profiling over 8 stages in early zebrafish development: 2-4 cell, 256 cell, 1K cell, Dome, Shield, Bud, 28hpf and 5dpf

PLATFORM
GPL14875 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Danio rerio)
