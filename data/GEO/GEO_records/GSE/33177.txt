TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression induced by Phytophthora infestans in tomato leaves

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Phytophthora infestans is most notorious oomycete causing a devastating disease on tomato called late blight. The molecular mechanisms involved in host-parasite interaction is still unexplored well. Investigation of changes in gene expression profile after pathogen infection to find out the mechanisms involved in infection process

DESIGN
Second full expanded leaves from both healthy tomato plants (non-inoculated) and diseased tomato plants inoculated with Phytophthora infestans inoculum were used to extract total RNA for microarry analysis 12 hours post inoculation time.
