TITLE
Microarray data of FACS purified population isolated from AML patients.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We isolated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from AML patients by FACS.

DESIGN
Mononuclear bone marrow cells from AML patient were enriched for 34+ and leukemic Granulocyte Macrophage Progenitors (L-GMP) cells were sorted by FACS and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips. see 1-2 for details. 1.
