TITLE
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome is highly connected by inter- and intra- chromosomal interactions

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Nuclear and mitochondrial organelles must maintain a communication system. Loci on the mitochondrial genome were recently reported to interact with nuclear loci. To determine whether this is part of a DNA based communication system we used genome conformation capture to map the global network of DNA-DNA interactions between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes (Mito-nDNA) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells grown under three different metabolic conditions. The interactions that form between mitochondrial and nuclear loci are dependent on the metabolic state of the yeast. Moreover, the frequency of specific mitochondrial - nuclear interactions (i.e. COX1-MSY1 and Q0182-RSM7) showed significant reductions in the absence of mitochondrial encoded reverse transcriptase machinery. Furthermore, these reductions correlated with increases in the transcript levels of the nuclear loci (MSY1 and RSM7). We propose that these interactions represent an inter-organelle DNA mediated communication system and that reverse transcription of mitochondrial RNA plays a role in this process.

DESIGN
Genome Conformation Capture (GCC) has been performed on exponentially growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures in glucose containing media. Paired end sequencing on an Illumina Genome Analyser was performed before the sequences were analysed by the propieatry software Topography 1.19. Inter- and intra- chromosomal interactions were mapped onto the S. cerevisiae S288 genome scaffold.
