TITLE
miR-182 modulates myocardial hypertrophic response induced by angiogenesis in heart (miRNA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Angiogenesis induced by placental growth factor (PlGF) in heart promotes myocardial hypertrophy through the paracrine action of endothelium-derived nitric oxide which triggers the degradation of RGS4 and subsequent activation of the Akt/mTORC1 pathway in cardiomyocytes. However, whether alterations in miRNAs contribute to the development of hypertrophy is largely undetermined. We found that miR-182 contributed to the hypertrophic response and activation of the Akt/mTORC1 pathway by suppressing the expression of Bcat2, Pink1, Adcy6, Foxo3.

DESIGN
The expression of miRNAs and the effects of anti-miRs were investigated in the mouse model of myocardial angiogenesis induced by conditional, cardiac specific expression of PlGF. We also induced angiogenesis, but blocked hypertrophy by concomitant expression of PlGF and RGS4 (PlGF/RGS4 mice). Microarray profiling of miRNAs in LV myocardium was determined after 3 and 6 weeks of transgene expression.
