TITLE
miR-182 modulates myocardial hypertrophic response induced by angiogenesis in heart (miRNA)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Angiogenesis induced by placental growth factor (PlGF) in heart promotes myocardial hypertrophy through the paracrine action of endothelium-derived nitric oxide which triggers the degradation of RGS4 and subsequent activation of the Akt/mTORC1 pathway in cardiomyocytes. However, whether alterations in miRNAs contribute to the development of hypertrophy is largely undetermined. We found that miR-182 contributed to the hypertrophic response and activation of the Akt/mTORC1 pathway by suppressing the expression of Bcat2, Pink1, Adcy6, Foxo3.
