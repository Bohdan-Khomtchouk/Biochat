TITLE
Zebrafish zic2 controls formation of periocular neural crest and choroid fissure morphogenesis

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
RNA-seq transcriptome analysis identified an early requirement for zic2 in periocular neural crest as an activator of alx1, a transcription factor with essential roles in craniofacial and ocular morphogenesis in human and zebrafish

DESIGN
Embryos derived from a zic2aGBT133/+; zic2bUW1127/+  incross were sorted by presence or absence of coloboma.  RNA was prepared from each individual embryo at ~ 25 hpf
