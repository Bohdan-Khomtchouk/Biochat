TITLE
Expression data from mouse induced Erythroid Progenitor (iEP)-derived colonies, mouse bone marrow and fetal liver BFU-Es and mouse fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Forced expression of Gata1, Tal1, Lmo2 and c-Myc reprograms murine adult fibroblasts into erythroid progenitor cells. The resulting cells, called induced erythroid progenitors/precursors (iEPs), resemble bona fide erythroid cells in terms of morphology, colony forming capacity, and gene expression. We used microarrays to characterize the reprogrammed cells (iEP_red and iEP_non-red) at the molecular level and compare their global gene expression profile with bona fide erythroid cells (FL and BM BFU-Es) and starting fibroblasts (Fibs).

DESIGN
To obtain mRNA from pure cell populations, BFU-E colony-forming assays were performed on day 5-iEPs as well as on mouse E14.5 fetal liver cells and bone marrow cells. Eight days after, colonies were picked and processed for RNA extraction. Cultured fibroblasts were collected as controls.
