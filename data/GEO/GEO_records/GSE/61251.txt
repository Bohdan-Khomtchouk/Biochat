TITLE
Differentially-expressed miRNAs in MDBK cells infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus compared to MDBK cells

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Non-canonical microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short endogenous RNA molecules with the ability to control development, autophagy, apoptosis and the stress response in eukaryotes by pairing with partially complementary sites in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of targeted genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that miRNAs serve as critical effectors in intricate networks of host-pathogen interactions. Thereforce, the differential expression of miRNAs were evaluated in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) NADL (100 TCID50/ 0.1 ml) for 6 h compared to normal MDBK cells using Solexa high-throughput sequencing technology (BGI, China).

DESIGN
Examination of small RNA populations in BVDV infected MDBK cells compared to MDBK cells
