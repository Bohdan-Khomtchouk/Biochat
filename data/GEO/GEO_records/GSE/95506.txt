TITLE
Expression data from human myocardial cells, AC16

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed to provide new compelling clues in the PM2.5-induced toxicity and mechanism which order the meaningful bioinformatics evidences for further study on human cardiovascular system. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes after treated with chemical substance.

DESIGN
Human myocardial cells AC16 were exposed to PM2.5 for 24h, and collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. After that, we tested the expression data of human myocardial cells.
