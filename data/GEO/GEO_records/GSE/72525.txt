TITLE
Expression of genes at the 45 min time point relative to that at 0 min time after release from initiation-arrest in either presence or absence of TorR

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We find that the response regulator TorR protein of the TorR/TorS two-component signal transduction system localizes to the old poles of the Escherichia coli cells, forming a functional focus. Interestingly, TorR co-localizes with the nucleoid in a cell-cycle-dependent mode, implying a cell-cycle-dependent interaction of TorR with its target genes.
