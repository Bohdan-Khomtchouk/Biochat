TITLE
Expression of genes at the 45 min time point relative to that at 0 min time after release from initiation-arrest in either presence or absence of TorR

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. W3110

SUMMARY
We find that the response regulator TorR protein of the TorR/TorS two-component signal transduction system localizes to the old poles of the Escherichia coli cells, forming a functional focus. Interestingly, TorR co-localizes with the nucleoid in a cell-cycle-dependent mode, implying a cell-cycle-dependent interaction of TorR with its target genes.

DESIGN
We choosed the samples collected at 0min and 45min after being synchronized regarded as Z0 cells and Z45 cells expressed TorR respectively, beacuse there was significant difference between these different time intervals. In order to rule out the interference factor coming from the regulation only in a cell-cycle dependent way, we used the samples collected at 0min and 45min after being synchronized without TorR, regarded as W0 cells and W45 cells. And then we made comparisons of gene expression between different groups. Firstly, we made a comparison between Z45 cells and Z0 cells in treated group. Secondly, we presented a comparison between W45 cells and W0 cells in untreated control group.
