TITLE
Arabidopsis transcriptional profile in response to chromate (K2CrO4)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis thalina seedlings in response to high (140 µM) and low (20 µM) concentrations of chromate (K2CrO4). Low concentrations of chromate (e.g. 40 µM) promoted primary root growth, while high concentrations (e.g. 140 µM) repressed growth and increased formation of root hairs, lateral roots and adventitious roots.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, high (140 µM) and low (20 µM) concentrations of chromate (K2CrO4) vs non-chromate added (Control). Four biological replicates, one replicate per array.
