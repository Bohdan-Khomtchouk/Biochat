TITLE
VSartorelli SMC Calorie Restriction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The integration of positive and negative intra- and extra-cellular signals dictates whether a cell will proliferate or differentiate. While it is intuitive to speculate that nutrients availability may influence this alternative, a comprehensive complement of the molecular determinants involved in this process has not been elucidated yet. In this study, we will investigate how nutrients (glucose) affect skeletal myogenesis. C2C12 cells will be cultured in high glucose and low glucose conditions, and their differenciation will be studied. Keywords: Differential Design, Differentiation Medium (DM), Growth Medium (GM)

DESIGN
We hypothesize that calorie restriction may have an effect on appropriate differentiation of skeletal myoblasts and this effect can be demonstrated by expression profiling.
