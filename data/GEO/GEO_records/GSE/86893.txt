TITLE
mRNA profiles from dorsal raphe and amygdala of high-responder and low-responder rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We identified 271 transcripts as differentially regulated in the dorsal raphe and/or the amygdala of high-responder and low-responder rats

DESIGN
Counts of transcripts (n=6/brain region/strain) from two brain regions (dorsal raphe and amygdala) from rat strains selectively-bred for response to novelty (high-responder/low-responder rats)

PLATFORM
GPL18694 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Rattus norvegicus)
