TITLE
Filaria induced monocyte dysfunction and its reversal following treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess the function of peripheral blood derived monocytes in patently infected filaria patients (either Wuchereria bancrofti, Mansonella perstans, or both), we investigated the cytokine production and gene expression profile of these cells in filaria infected patients and compared them with those from uninfected normal blood bank donors. Monocytes from infected individuals were studded with intracellular microfilarial antigens. In addition, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I bacteria (SAC)/IFN γ activated monocytes from the infected individuals produced less IL 8, Exodus II, MIP 1a, MIP 1b, eotaxin, RANTES, IL 1a, and MIP 3b compared with normal patients. Microarray analysis of ex vivo isolated monocytes demonstrated that multiple genes involved in signal transduction, apoptosis, and adhesion were expressed to a greater degree in filaria infected patient monocytes compared with those of uninfected normal individuals. Eight months following treatment with a single dose of ivermectin/albendazole, monocytes of W. bancrofti infected individuals were capable of producing more IL 8, IL 1a, MIP 1a, and IL 10 in response to SAC/IFN γ compared with their pretreatment levels. Further, when monocyte global expression was compared before and after treatment of the W. bancrofti, there was a marked increase in mRNA expression of genes associated with protein metabolism, and in HSP most particularly, compared with pretreatment expression. These data suggest that the function and gene expression of monocytes in filaria infected patients are altered; however, this dysfunction can be reveresed to a degree following treatment with a single dose of ivermection/albendazole.
