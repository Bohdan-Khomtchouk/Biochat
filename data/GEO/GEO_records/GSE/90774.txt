TITLE
Molecular heterogeneity of NK/T-cell lymphoma (miRNA profiling)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate if biologically distinct subsets exists in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL), we performed unsupervised integrative analyses of gene expression profiling (GEP), miRNA profiling, and copy number aberration (CNA) on 66 cases of NKTL from diverse anatomical sites. This series is the miRNA profiling of 24 cases.

DESIGN
Unsupervised analysis of FFPE NKTL samples (20 test, 46 validation set)

PLATFORM
GPL19117 [miRNA-4] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-4 Array
