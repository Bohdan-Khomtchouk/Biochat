TITLE
Gene expression changes between sensitive and YK-4-279-resistant Ewing's Sarcoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray gene expression analysis conducted from cell lines in each of three cohorts: (1) Resistant ES cell lines, (2) Sensitive parental ES cell lines treated with YK-4-279 for 72 hours, and (3) untreated sensitive parental ES cell lines (Three replicates from TC32 & TC71 original parental cell lines) We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying mechanism of resistance to YK-4-279 within parental sensitive and resistant selected Ewing's Sarcoma cell lines. We identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the cell lines using the Qiagen miRNeasy Mini kit. RNA quality was assessed to have an RNA integrity number before amplification and labeling using Affymetrix’s GeneChip GeneChip®3’ IVT Express Kit following manufacturer’s instructions. Amplified and biotinylated cRNAs were hybridized onto Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 cartridge arrays, Washed, and Stained with kit following manufacturer’s instructions. Arrays were scanned using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and the initial raw data were extracted using Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console-Expression software. The statistical analyses of scanned data were performed using default setting on GeneSpring GX 12.1 software (Agilent).
