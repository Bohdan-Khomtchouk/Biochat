TITLE
Attachment of Bacillus subtilis to the hyphae of Aspergillus niger results in altered metabolism and defense mechanisms in both partner

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
Interaction of microbes affects the growth, metabolism and differentiation of members of the community. While direct and indirect competitions, like spite and nutrient consumption have negative effect on each other, microbes also evolved in nature not only to fight, but in some cases to adapt or support each other while increasing the fitness of the community. Presence of bacteria and fungi in the soil results in interactions and various examples were described, including mutualism. Bacilli attach to the plant root and form complex communities in the rhizosphere. Bacillus subtilis, when grown in the presence of Aspergillus niger interacts with the fungal partner, attaches and grows on the hyphae. Using dual transcriptome experiment, we show that both fungi and bacteria alter their metabolisms during the interaction. Interestingly, the transcription of genes related to the antifungal and antibacterial defense mechanism of B. subtilis and A. niger, respectively, are decreased upon attachment of bacteria to the mycelia. Our microarray experiments provide a novel insight into the mutual interaction of a bacterium and a fungus.

DESIGN
Aspergillus niger were grown with and without Bacillus subtilis. Biological triplicates were made for both conditions, Affymetrix microarray experiments were performed on these samples.
