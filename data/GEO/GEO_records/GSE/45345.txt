TITLE
bf_vs_f-Comparative Arabidopsis Transcriptome -Sequencing

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
cat-seq - bf_vs_f - A comparative assessment of the Arabidopsis sequencing approach High-throughput sequencing cDNA GAII or HiSeq2000 sequenceur (technology Solexa) and data on CATMA array hybridation (version 6). These different characteristics will be studied through the analysis of control samples but also samples from mutants in genes coding for cytosolic or nuclear PPR proteins - The two selected samples are the flower buds and leaves of Arabidopsis. Two organs known as the transcriptome is very different. This experience will serve as reference

DESIGN
2 dye-swap - organ comparison
