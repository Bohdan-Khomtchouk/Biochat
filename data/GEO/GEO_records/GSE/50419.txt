TITLE
Array analysis of wound induced hair neogenesis (late stage)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were wounded and measured for regeneration starting 4 days after wound closure with simultaneous measurement of hair follicle neogenesis and biopsing. At each time point, RNA was collected from one mouse with high number of regenerated follicles and one without regenerated follicles.

DESIGN
Whole skin  biopsies of wound scars were submitted for Affymetrix Exon arrays. 3 replicates of mice with high number of regenerated follicles, 3 replicates of mice with no regenerated follicles; each pair taken at a different date after wound closure.

PLATFORM
