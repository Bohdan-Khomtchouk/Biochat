TITLE
Transcriptome Responses of the Host Spodoptera litura upon Spodoptera litura nucleopolyhedrovirus infection

ORGANISM
Spodoptera litura

SUMMARY
To reveal dynamic regulation of host gene expression and an overview of events in the infection cycle after SpltNPV infection

DESIGN
To analyze cellular responses to SpltNPV infection, a S.litura cell line (SL221) was infected with wild-type baculovirus SpltNPV at a MOI of 1. RNAs were isolated at three time points through the infection cycle (6hpi, 12hpi and 18hpi) and also from control (mock infected) cells. The obtained cellular ranscriptome from the host S.litura was set for illumina strand specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze changes in host cell gene expression upon SpltNPV infection.
