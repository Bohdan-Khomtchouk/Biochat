TITLE
Comparative transcription profiling of heritage maize lines

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Three different maize lines were assayed for differential gene expression in mature leaf tissue. Leaves from the Oh43 maize line are more resistant to insect larvae damage than the original parents, lines Oh40B and W8. The goal of the project was to discover genes highly expressed in the Oh43 line that potentially contributes to insect resistance.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from a mature leaf (third visible leaf from the top of a 7 leaf plant) of each inbred (Oh43, Oh40B, and W8). cDNA from four biological replicates of each inbred was labeled (indirect method) twice with Cy5 and twice with Cy3. A total of six microarray slides were probed with 12 different labeled cDNAs.
