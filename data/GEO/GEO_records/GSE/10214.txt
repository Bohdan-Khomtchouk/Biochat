TITLE
Expression data from memory P14 transgenic T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used to compare differences and similarities in gene expression patterns between memory CD8+ T cells from mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or influenza virus. Keywords: infection response

DESIGN
Mice containing transferred P14 CD8+ transgenic T cells were infected with LCMV or influenza and rested for 90 days.  P14 cells were purified by cell sorting, as well as cells from unimmunized P14 mice as controls, and used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
