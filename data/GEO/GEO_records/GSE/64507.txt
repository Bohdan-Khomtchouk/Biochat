TITLE
Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells nucleosome occupancy data after simulation by heat killed Salmonella typhimurium

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In eukaryotes, nucleosomes participate in all DNA-templated events by regulating access to the underlying DNA sequence. However, the dynamics of nucleosomes during a genome response has not been well characterized . We stimulated DrosophilaÂ S2 cells with heat-killed Gram-negative bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, and mapped genome-wide nucleosome occupancy at high temporal resolution by MNase-seq using Illumina HiSeq 2500. We show widespread nucleosome occupancy change in S2 cells during the immune response, with the biggest nucleosomal loss occurring at 4hr post stimulation.

DESIGN
Drsophila S2 cells at 0hr, 30minutes, 1hr and 4hr post heat-killed Salmonella typhimuriumstimulation
