TITLE
Determination of Lsd1 function in brown adipose tissue by global transcriptome analysis [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of Lsd1 in BAT, we crossed mice harboring conditional Lsd1 alleles (Zhu et al., 2014) with the Ucp1-Cre deleter strain (Turpin et al., 2014), which results in Cre-mediated loss of Lsd1 selectively in brown adipocytes. Transciptome analysis of BAT obtained from control and knock-out mice revealed 3322 genes differentially expressed between Lsd1 knock-out and control mice at 10 weeks of age (p-value < 10-2).

DESIGN
We selectively knocked-out Lsd1 in brown adipose tissue by crossing Lsd1 floxed mice to Ucp1-Cre mice. RNA from BAT of 10 week.old control (Lsd1 floxed mice) and knock-out mice was extracted with trizol according to the manufacturer protocol. RNA samples were sequenced by the standard Illumina protocol to create raw sequence files (.fastq files). We annotated these reads to the mm10 build of the mouse genome using TopHat version 2. The aligned reads were counted with the homer software (analyze RNA) and DEGâ€™s were identified using EdgeR and DESeq version 1.8.3. LSD1 binding profile in fat cells - samples and experiments will continue to be added to this study over the course of the project.
