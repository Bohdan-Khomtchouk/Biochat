TITLE
Expression data from mouse bone marrow late pre-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
B-cell development in the bone marrow proceeds through phenotypically defined stages. At the pre-B cell stage, cells stop cycling and rearrange the light chain of immunoglobulin. There are notable defects in the number of these cells and subsequent stages of B-cell development in mice with hematopoietic deficiency of the gene Ddx3x, when compared to wildtype control mice. We used microarrays to determine differences in gene expression between bone marrow pre-B cells in wild-type mice and those deficient in Ddx3x in hematopoietic cells (Vav1-cre x Ddx3x-floxed, male, hemizygous)

DESIGN
Bone marrow late pre-B cells (CD3-,Ly6C-,Ter119-,CD11b-,Gr1-,B220+,CD43-,IgM-,IgD-) were sorted from 4 male Ddx3x hemizygous (Vav1Cre+ Ddx3x-fl/Y) mice and 4 male littermates (Vav1Cre- Ddx3x-Fl/Y). Total cellular RNA was isolated from sorted cells and subjected to analysis on GeneChip Mouse Gene 2.0 arryas (Affymetrix).
