TITLE
Regulatory and epistatic networks unravel the complexity of piebald, a pigmentation phenotype in Merino sheep

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Ovine skin samples comparing pigmentation samples from piebald and normal Merino sheep

DESIGN
All pair comparison of 5 pigmentation samples with dye swaps.   Dye swaps were performed with different biological replicates (labelled 1 or 2)  NOR - White sample from a normal, non-affected wild-type individual sheep  PBB - Black sample from a piebald individual sheep  PBW - White sample from a piebald individual sheep   RSB - Black sample from a recessive black sheep  RSW - White sample from a recissive black sheep taken from the inguinal, non-pigmented area.
