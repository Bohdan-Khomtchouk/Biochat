TITLE
Developmental transcriptome of Castanospermum australe seed tissues

ORGANISM
Castanospermum australe

SUMMARY
Seeds of the legume Castanospermum australe are shed at relatively high moisture contents, and to do not acquire desiccation tolerance during their seed development, they are referred to as 'recalcitrant'. To characterize the regulatory pathways and molecular mechnanisms are occur during seed development and to allow for a comparative analysis with seed development of desiccation-tolerant species, cotyledon and embryonic axes were harvested at different stages of development, arbitrarily defined in terms of seed weight (grams) and color. Transcriptomes of 6 stages were analysed using Nimblegen slides: 2.5g - 4.5g - 7.5g - yellow-green (YG) - green (G) - brown (B) for cotyledons (C) and YG, G and B for emrbyonic axes (A)

DESIGN
Six-condition experiment, 2.5C/4.5C - 7.5C/YGC - GC/BC - YGC/BC - GA/BA - YGA/BA. Two replicates from each developmental stage were used for dye switch, each time the control was considered as the earlier developmental stage vs the treatment, corresponding to the later developmental stage. A total of four replicates were analysed.
