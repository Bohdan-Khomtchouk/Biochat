TITLE
Comparative gene expression profiling of group-housed, less aggressive vs. single-housed, more aggressive male flies

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Social experience influences multiple behaviors of many animal species, including aggression. Social isolation often increases aggressiveness. To investigater the molecular basis of social influences on aggressiveness, we performed comparative gene expression profiling on heads from 6-day-old, single-housed, more aggressive and group-housed, less aggressive male flies. Keywords: social experience

DESIGN
1 (single-housed) or 10 (group-housed) male flies were housed in plastic vials after eclosion for 6 days. Between 5-6pm on the 6th day, flies were frozen and their heads were harvested for Trizol RNA extraction and microarray experiment. Both single- and group-housing groups contained 3 biological replicates, which had a sampling pool of 20 heads.
