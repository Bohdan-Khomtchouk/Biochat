TITLE
Drosophila U6atac snRNA mutant

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
A Drosophila line (l(2)k01105) with a P-element insertion in U6atac snRNA, an essential component of the U12-type spliceosome, was used to investigate the impact of disrupted U12-dependent splicing during larval development. A custom-designed exon array was used to study the expression of genes containing U12-type introns and genes involved in downstream pathways affected by deficient U12-dependent splicing. Flies homozygous for the U6atac mutation (U6atac/U6atac) were compared to heterozygotes (U6atac/CyO-GFP) which have a normal phenotype.

DESIGN
Samples from homozygous and heterozygous U6atac mutant larvae at 1st, 2nd and 3rd larval instar were labelled with three colours and hybridized three samples per array. Three independently harvested biological replicates were made, with dye swap, except only two replicates for 3rd stage heterozygous control.  This study presents exon-level data.
