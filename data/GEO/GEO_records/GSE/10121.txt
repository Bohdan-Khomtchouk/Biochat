TITLE
Expression Profiling of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Mucosa of healthy non-tumor patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In an attempt to further elucidate the pathomechanisms in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), gene expression profiling to a set of 35 primary OSCCs compared to 6 oral mucosa from healthy non-tumor patients was performed. Keywords: expression profiling
