TITLE
RNA-seq on Tbx5ua Knockdown mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By comprehensive screening of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) over mouse heart development, we have identified Tbx5 upstream antisense RNA (Tbx5ua). In order to understand its function, we produced Tbx5ua knock down ES cells by inserting triple bovine polyadenylation signal to the second exon of Tbx5ua. From the ES cells we made chimeric mouse embryos via tetraploid complementation assay. We conducted RNA-seq analysis on the WT and KD heart ventricles at E9.5 to further elucidate the lncRNA's molecular functions.

DESIGN
Single-end RNA-seq of total RNAs extracted from the ventricles of tetraploid chimeric mice generated from wildtype or Tbx5ua knockdown B6J ES cells

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
