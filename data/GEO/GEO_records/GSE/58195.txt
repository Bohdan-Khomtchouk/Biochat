TITLE
Analysis of structural diversity in wolf-like canids reveals post-domestication variants

ORGANISM
Canis lupus ; Canis latrans ; Canis lupus familiaris ; Canis rufus ; Canis aureus

SUMMARY
This study uses a custom made Nimblegen aCGH chip that targeted all segmental duplications in the canine genome to identify associated CNVs. A total of 23 hybridizations were performed in a panel of diverse dogs and a single wolf.

DESIGN
This study focuses on the use a custom made Nimblegen aCGH chip to genotype 1,611 dog CNVs in 23 wolf-like canids (4 purebred dogs, one dingo, 15 gray wolves, one red wolf, one coyote and one golden jackal) to identify CNVs that may have arisen after domestication
