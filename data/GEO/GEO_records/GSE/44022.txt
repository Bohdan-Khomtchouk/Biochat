TITLE
Expression profiling of cisplatin resistant derivatives of ovarian cancer cell line A2780

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine genes with altered expression after selection of ovarian cancer cells for survival in increasing concentrations of cisplatin.

DESIGN
A series of progressively cispatin resistant derivatives of A2780 ovarian cancer cell lines was hybridized to spotted cDNA microarrays using two color technology using the parental A2780 cells as a reference.  Duplicate hybridizations were carried out for each resistant derivative.
