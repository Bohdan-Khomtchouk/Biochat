TITLE
Expression data from Col-0 and hcr1 roots

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcript profiling analysis of Hydraulic conductivity of Root 1 (HCR1) mutant compared to wild type (Col-0) using ARABIDOPSIS GENE1.1ST ARRAY STRIP (901793, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA).

DESIGN
Arabidopsis Col-0 and hcr1 plants were grown under hypoxia (pO2 = 11.1 ± 1.1 % ) in hydroponic solution , and root samples of 21 d old plants were harvested. Each sample was a pool of five plants, and each type of sample was harvested in triplicate. Total RNAs were isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (74204, Qiagen) after DNase treatment (79254, Qiagen). RNA quantities were assessed with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Wilmington, USA) and RNA qualities using RNA 6000 Nanochips with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, USA). For each sample, 100 ng of total RNA were amplified using the GeneChip® WT PLUS Reagent Kit (902280, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 10 μg of the resulting biotin-labeled single stranded cDNA was used for hybridization to ARABIDOPSIS GENE1.1ST ARRAY STRIP (901793, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA).  Hybridization was carried out at 45 °C for 16 h, and the arrays were washed and stained according to the protocol described in the Manual Target Preparation for GeneChip® Whole Transcript (WT) Expression Arrays (P/N 703174 Rev.2, Affymetrix). The arrays were scanned using GeneAtlas Imaging Station (Affymetrix). The microarray computaional analysis was performed on *.CEL and *.CHP data files.
