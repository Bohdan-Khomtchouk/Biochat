TITLE
Expression data from mouse bone marrow myeloid dendritic cells (classical DCs) and classical dendritic cells in spleen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Classical dendritic cells may be found in mouse bone marrow and spleen. Due to the differences in their local environment, two populations may express different genes and potentially carry different functions We used microarrays to compare the gene expression profiles between myeloid dendritic cells and classical dendritic cells in spleen. Our data supported the hypothesis that bone marrow myeloid dendritic cells are enriched for the expression of certain sets of genes that may play specific functions in the bone marrow microenvironment

DESIGN
Myeloid dendritic cells and classical dendritic cells from bone marrow and spleen were FACS sorted from four mice. RNA were extracted from these sorted cells and processed for microarray using Affymetrix mogene 1.0 ST chip. Cells from one mouse represent one sample

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
