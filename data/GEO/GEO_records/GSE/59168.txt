TITLE
BCR-ABL1 promotes leukemia by converting p27 into a cytoplasmic oncoprotein

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Coordinated BCR-ABL1 kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms convert p27 from a nuclear tumor suppressor to a cytoplasmic oncogene. Persistence of oncogenic p27 functions despite effective inhibition of BCR-ABL1 may contribute to resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

DESIGN
BCR-ABL1 induced p27 versus knockout, controlling with Empty vector p27 versus knock out
