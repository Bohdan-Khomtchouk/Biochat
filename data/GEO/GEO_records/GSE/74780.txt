TITLE
Expression data from WT and Klrc1-/- CD8+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD8+ T cells and NK cells protect from viral infections by killing virally-infected cells and secreting interferon-g.  Several inhibitory receptors limit the magnitude and duration of these anti-viral responses. We used microarrays to assess the transcriptome of ectromelia virus (ECTV) specific CD8+ T cells that genetically lack one such receptor, NKG2A, which is encoded by Klrc1.

DESIGN
Na√Øve or ECTV-specific CD8+ T cells were sorted directly into RLT buffer.  RNA was then extracted, processed, and hybridized to Affymetrix arrays.
