TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of SLIRP knockdown with 1nM DHT in LNCaP cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to profile gene expression changes that could occur with the loss of co-repressor SLIRP. In addition, we wanted to investigate how DHT could further alter gene expression. Methods: LNCaP cells were transfected with custom nonsense control siRNA or a pool of SLIRP siRNA (HSS130109, HSS188666, HSS188667 Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 40nM for 24hrs. Cells were washed once with PBS and replaced with SFM containing EtOH or 1nM/ml DHT for another 24hrs.  Two biological replicates were collected from 2 different experiemnts for total of 4 replicates. RNA collected  was sequenced using Illumia HiSeq2000 single read 50 bp by the HTSF core at UNC and aligned and normalized by the Bioinformatics core at UNC. Results: We found a differential gene expression pattern between our control and SLIRP knockdown samples. We also identified a 176 AR gene signature with 3 subclasses and a large SLIRP gene signature (~1700).
