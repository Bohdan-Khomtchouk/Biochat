TITLE
Transcriptome of wild-type and G9a mutant upon viral challenge

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to generate transcriptome of wild-type and G9a mutant adult flies (females) 24h post-infection with  Drosophila C Virus (DCV).

DESIGN
We generated 8 different data sets. For wild-type controls and G9a mutants, we performed both mock and DCV infection, and collected both whole flies and fat bodies. All flies were 3-5 days old females.
