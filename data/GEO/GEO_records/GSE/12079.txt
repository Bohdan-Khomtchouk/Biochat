TITLE
Molecular profiling of CD3- CD4+ T-cells from patients with the lymphocytic variant of hypereosinophilic syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The clonal CD3- CD4+ Th2 cell population characterizing some hypereosinophilic syndrome patients stably endures for years provoking a chronic inflammatory skin disease, with a subgroup of patients ultimately progressing to T-cell lymphoma. The aim of this study is the identification of the molecular changes (1) associated with the persistence of the pre-malignant clone (2) associated with the activation of co-stimulatory receptors and (3) associated with the emergence of malignant T-cell subclones.
