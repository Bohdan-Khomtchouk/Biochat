TITLE
Genome-wide binding of hSTN1 in response to hydroxyurea-induced replication stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We find that hSTN1 is preferentially enriched at GC-rich repetitive sequences genome-wide after hydroxyurea treatment.

DESIGN
HeLa cells stably expressing myc-tagged hSTN1 were treated with 2 mM hydroxyurea, crosslinked, and ChIP-seq was performed.
