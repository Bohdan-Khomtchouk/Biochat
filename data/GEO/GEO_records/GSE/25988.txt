TITLE
Expression data from Drosophila dLmo (EP1306 and BxJ) mutants

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The Drosophila gene dLmo encodes a transcriptional regulator involved in wing development and behavioral responses to cocaine and ethanol. We were interested in discovering novel transcriptional targets of dLmo in the nervous system by examining gene expression changes in the heads of wild-type flies and flies carrying dLmo loss-of-function (EP1306) and gain-of-function mutants (BxJ).

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from 3 pooled groups of 200 fly heads from each genotype (w;iso control, EP1306, and BxJ) and hybridized to triplicate Affymetrix Drosophila 2.0 oligonucleotide microarray chips at the Partners HealthCare Center for Personalized Genetic Medicine microarray facility (Harvard University).
