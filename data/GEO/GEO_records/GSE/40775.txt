TITLE
Microarray analysis of genes regulated by SHP in wild-type and ob/ob mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver gene expression was compared in wild type, SHP knockout, ob/ob, and ob/ob SHP double mutant mice.

DESIGN
A total of eight samples were analyzed using Affymetrix arrays.  Each of the four genotypes studied were assayed in duplicate.
