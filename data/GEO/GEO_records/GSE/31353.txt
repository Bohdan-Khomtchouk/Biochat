TITLE
Methylation map of 8 neuroblastoma cell lines: NGS after MBD2-capture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
8 neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines (CLB-GA, IMR-32, SH-SY5Y, N206, CHP-902R, LAN-2, SK-N-AS, SJNB-1) their methylome is determined by sequencing after MBD2-capture using MethylCollector (ActiveMotif)

DESIGN
8 NB cell lines were included (CLB-GA, IMR-32, SH-SY5Y, N206, CHP-902R, LAN-2, SK-N-AS, SJNB-1) in this study. After shearing (fragments of about 200 bp), DNA was captured using MBD2-capture (MethylCollector - ActiveMotif) followed by library preparation and multiplexing. Captured sequence tags were sequenced paired-end (2 x 45 bp) on Illumina GAIIx.
