TITLE
Time course of response of ML-DmD4-c1 cells to ecdysone

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The changes in transcript titers are described for Drosophila ML-DmD4-c1 cells following 5-48 hr treatment with 20-hydroxyecdysone. Keywords: hormone response

DESIGN
RNA from ecdysone-treated cells was compared to RNA from cells treated with carrier alone. A total of 3-4 slides were analyzed for each time point, each from a separate biological sample; dye-swaps were included.
