TITLE
Gene expression microarray of HT1080 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effects of genomic elements, gene transcritpion, and DNA replication on gene targeting.  The hypothesis tested was that genomic elements and processes either positively or megatively influence AAV-mediated gene targeting.  Results show that homologous recombination increases when the target site is transcribed in the opposite orientation of an incoming replication or transcription fork.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from cultured HT1080 cell lines

PLATFORM
GPL6884 Illumina HumanWG-6 v3.0 expression beadchip
