TITLE
Expression data of osteogenic differentiated cartilage endplate-derived stem cells (CESCs) under hypoxia or normoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cartilage endplate-derived stem cells (CESCs) with chondro-osteogenic differentiation capacity may be responsible for the balance of chondrification and ossification in cartilage endplate (CEP). CEP is an avascular and hypoxic tissue, and hypoxia could inhibit the osteogenic differentiation of CESCs. We used high-throughput scanning to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and alternatively spliced genes (ASGs) during osteogenic differentiation of CESCs under hypoxia compared to those induced under normoxia.

DESIGN
Human cartilage endplate-derived stem cells (CESCs) were treated with osteogenic differentiation medium under normoxia and hypoxia for 21 days respectively.
