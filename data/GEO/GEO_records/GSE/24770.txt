TITLE
Heterochronic Evolution Reveals Modular Timing Changes in Budding Yeast Transcriptomes (Mutation Accumulation Lines)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
45 genome-wide microarray measurements for 23 mutation accumulation lines grown in YPD liquid culture MA lines obtained by single-colony transfer on YPD plates for 600 generations, starting from a BY4741 derived strain (see Zeyl C, DeVisser JA: Estimates of the rate and distribution of fitness effects of spontaneous mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genetics 2001, 157:53â€“61)

DESIGN
Two biological replicates for each strain in a common reference design (no dye-swap)
