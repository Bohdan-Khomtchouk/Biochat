TITLE
Gene expression of Laccaria bicolor S238N free-living mycelium grown on different media

ORGANISM
Laccaria bicolor S238N-H82

SUMMARY
Transcript profiles of Laccaria bicolor S238N mycelium on various media were analyzed. The array probes were designed from gene models taken from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI, department of energy) Laccaria bicolor genome sequence version 1. One goal was to evaluate the effect of nutrient deprivation on the transcriptome of Laccaria bicolor.
