TITLE
Gene expression of Laccaria bicolor S238N free-living mycelium grown on different media

ORGANISM
Laccaria bicolor

SUMMARY
Transcript profiles of Laccaria bicolor S238N mycelium on various media were analyzed. The array probes were designed from gene models taken from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI, department of energy) Laccaria bicolor genome sequence version 1. One goal was to evaluate the effect of nutrient deprivation on the transcriptome of Laccaria bicolor.

DESIGN
We performed 15 hybridizations (Roche-NimbleGen) with samples derived from Laccaria bicolor free-living mycelium grown on MMN medium, on MMN with a 10 times reduction in all major macro-elements, on MMN with a 10 times reduction in the quantity of glucose or onto agar medium supplemented with the same nutrients used to fertilize our mycorrhization experiments.
