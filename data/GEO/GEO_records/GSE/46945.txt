TITLE
DNase Iâ€“hypersensitive exons colocalize with promoters and distal regulatory elements

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Native-ChIP was performed to determine whether cross-linked ChIP-Seq enrichments observed at DHS exons result from co-precipitation with proximal promoter.

DESIGN
Native ChIP-Seq was performed on H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 histone modifications in human cells
