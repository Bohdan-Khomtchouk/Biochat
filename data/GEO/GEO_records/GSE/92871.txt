TITLE
ATAC sequencing of K-562 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed the global effect of c-Myb knockdown and rescue with ectopically expressed WT c-Myb and c-Myb D152V on chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq

DESIGN
Cells were tranfected with siRNA for 24 hours and  50 000 cells were harvested for ATAC. Three individual experiments were performed. Libraries were prepared and 40-bp paired-end reads were obtained using an Illumina Nextseq 500 sequencer
