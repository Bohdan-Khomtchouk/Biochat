TITLE
The effect of ERG overexpression and ERG knockdown by shRNA in RWPE1 and VCAP cells, respectively

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this project was to analyze the global gene expression profiles of RWPE1 and VCAP cells following transfection of GFP, GFP-ERG at 48 and 72hrs time points and stable ERG shRNA, scramble shRNA, respectively.

DESIGN
RWPE1 cells were transfected with GFP or GFP-ERG. VCAP cells were transfected with ERG lenti-shRNA or scramble shRNA. Transfections were performed in duplicate. Total cellular RNA was isolated with Trizol and quality analysed by the bioanalyser kit.
