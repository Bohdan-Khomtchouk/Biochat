TITLE
Distinctive gene expression of prostatic stromal cells cultured from diseased versus normal tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To obtain a comprehensive view of the transcriptional programs in prostatic stromal cells of different histological/pathological origin, we profiled 18 adult human stromal cell cultures from normal transition zone (TZ), normal peripheral zone (PZ), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer (CA) using cDNA microarrays. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
