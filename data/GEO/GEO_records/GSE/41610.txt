TITLE
mRNA expression after siRNA-mediated knock down of Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA expression after Ezh2 knock down was analyzed to identify genes regulated by Ezh2.

DESIGN
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were transfected with 25 nmol/L of control small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Silencer Select Negative Control Ambion, Austin, TX) or siRNA directed against Ezh2 (s4918; Ambion) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Total RNA was harvested 72 hours after transfection.
