TITLE
COHCAP HCT116 Mutant Comparison [methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression and methylation differences are compared for a normal HCT116 cell line and a derived mutant with altered DNA methylation patterns.

DESIGN
The data compares the effect of a gene mutation on genome-wide expression (and methylation).  This data is being published as a technical test of utility for a novel integrative genomic algorithm (COHCAP) Keywords: parental, mutant
