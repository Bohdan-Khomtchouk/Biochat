TITLE
Proinflammatory response of human epithelial cell to TNF, flagellin, wild type Salmonella

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T84 cells were stimulated with TNF, or flagellin, or wildtype Salmonella.  RNA were extracted from treated cells at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hour time points, labelled, and hybridized the arrays. Keywords: Human

DESIGN
The objective of this study is to investigate the different proinflammatory response of human intestinal epithelial cells to three different treatments. There are triplicates for each treatment. Data were analyzed according to publication guidline.
