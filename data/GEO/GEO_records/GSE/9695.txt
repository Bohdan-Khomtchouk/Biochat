TITLE
Role of phospholipase D in salycilic acid signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Our goal is to identify Salycilic Acid responsive genes dependent on PLD activation. - The experiment is done on Arabidopsis suspension cells, ecotype Columbia : Research of phospholipase D (PLD) activity implication in the response to SA. The use of primary alcohol, like N-butanol, makes possible to derive PLD activity towards the production of phosphatidylalcohol with the detriment of phosphatidic acid, the product of the PLD. Thus, in the presence of n-butanol, the response of the genes to SA dependent on phosphatidic acid will see their response disturbed. On the contrary, in the presence of tertiary butanol, the response of the genes should not be disturbed, tertiary alcohols not acting on the PLD. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
