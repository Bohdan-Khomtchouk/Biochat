TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of ERalpha binding sites in U2OS-ERalpha cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP followed by deep sequencing was performed with antibodies to ERalpha in U2OS-ERalpha cells treated with 17beta-estradiol.

DESIGN
Examination of Eralpha binding sites in U2OS-Eralpha cells.  Sequenced input was used as a control
