TITLE
RNA expression analysis after MCF-7 cell treatment with demethylating agent 5-Aza-2â€™-deoxycitidine (5-Aza)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of MCF-7 cells treated with 5-Aza for 96 h. Relative abundance to untreated control cells was used to estimate the effect of DNA demethylation on the expression of the RNAs.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, 5-Aza-treated vs. untretated MCF-7 cells. Biological replicates: 2. Technical replicates: 2.
