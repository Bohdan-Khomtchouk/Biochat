TITLE
Sp9 regulates medial ganglionic eminence-derived cortical interneuron development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the mammalian cortex, about 60% of GABAergic interneurons, mainly including parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) and somatostatin (SST+) interneurons are generated from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) in the subpallium and tangentially migrate to the cortex. Here we analyze the role of the Sp9 transcription factor in regulating the development of MGE-derived cortical interneurons. We show that SP9 is widely expressed in the MGE subventricular zone (SVZ) and in MGE-derived migrating interneurons. By analyzing Sp9 null and conditional mutant mice, we demonstrate that Sp9 promotes MGE progenitor proliferation in the SVZ and is required for the normal patterning of tangential migration and the laminar distribution of MGE-derived cortical GABAergic interneurons. Loss of Sp9 function results in a ~50% reduction of MGE-derived cortical interneurons, an ectopic aggregation of MGE-derived neurons in the embryonic ventral telencephalon, and an increased ratio of SST+/PV+ cortical interneurons. Finally, we provide evidence that Sp9 regulates MGE derived cortical interneuron development through promoting expression of the Lhx6 and Lhx8 transcription factors.

DESIGN
Medial ganglionic eminence mRNA profiles of embryonic 12.5 wild type (WT) and sp9 null mutant mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using using an illumina high-seq 2500

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
