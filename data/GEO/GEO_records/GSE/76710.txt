TITLE
Inferring gene regulatory networks that control maintenance and identity of the Arabidopsis root stem cells

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We isolated QC and xylem cells by sorting GFP+ cells marked with pWOX5::GFP and pTMO5::GFP respectively. We obtained cell-type specific transcriptional profiles of QC and xylem cells.

DESIGN
Seedlings were grown for 5 days. WOX5::GFP and pTMO5::GFP sorted fluorecent cells were harvested for RNA extraction.
