TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of miRNA levels in colon cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of miRNA levels found in tissue obtained from proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) TNM stage 2|3|4 colon tumor, deficient MMR (dMMR) colon tumor, and normal colon.

DESIGN
miRNA levels obtained from macrodissected colon tumors with > 70% H & E staining were compared with normal colon tissue. Additional comparisons based on mismatch repair status identified by loss of hMLH1 protein and microsattelite instability assay and TNM stage were carried out. This submission provides access to the data discussed in our paper. The supplementary file 'GSE18392_non-normalized_data.txt' file contains non-normalized data for Samples GSM458618-GSM458762.
