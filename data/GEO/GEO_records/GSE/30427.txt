TITLE
Expression analysis of mouse thyroid tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is the most aggressive form of thyroid cancer, and often derives from pre-existing well-differentiated tumors.  We have engineered the first mouse model of ATC by combining in the mouse thyroid follicular cells two molecular hallmarks of human ATC: activation of PI3K (via Pten deletion) and inactivation of p53.  By 9 months of age, over 75% of the compound mutant mice develop aggressive, undifferentiated thyroid tumors that evolve from pre-existing follicular hyperplasia and carcinoma.  These tumors display all the features of their human counterpart, including pleomorphism, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, aneuploidy, local invasion and distant metastases.

DESIGN
We have performed expression profiling of thyroids from control, single mutants, compound mutants, follicular tumors from Pten-/- mice and [Pten-/-,KrasG12D] mice, and anaplastic tumors from Pten, p53-/- mice.
