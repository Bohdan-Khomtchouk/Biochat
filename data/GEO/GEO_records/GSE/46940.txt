TITLE
Gene expression in extra-embryonic tissues flushed out at D18 from heifers, early and late lactating cows

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Evaluate the influence of maternal metabolism on gene expression profiles from extra-embryonic tissues at D18 Keyword: Holstein Heifers and Postpartum dairy cows, metabolism and energy status, elongation and gastrulation, extra-embryonic tissues, transcriptome, correlations between genes & metabolites?

DESIGN
8 replicates in GH, 11 replicates in ELC and 10 replicates in LLC (extra-embryonic tissues) per group of female (N=3) were hybridized (total N=29) against a placental reference that hybridized itself to 99% of the array. Hybridization design: 6 microarrays per experiment (N=5) were randomly hybridized to the EET from 2 conceptuses originating either from development in heifers, ELC or LLC. Extra-embryonic tissues were systematically labelled with Cy3 and Reference in Cy5.
