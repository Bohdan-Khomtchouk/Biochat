TITLE
Cardiac aldosterone regulated genes in mice with cardiomyocytes targeted mineralocorticoid receptor overexpression (MR-Cardio mice) and their controls (Ctrl mice)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inappropriate mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation is involved in cardiac diseases. The mechanisms are still unclears.  Mice overexpressing MR in cardiomyocytes (MR-Cardio) and their controls (Ctrl) were treated for 7 days with aldosterone and a whole genome microarray analysis was performed.

DESIGN
Four-group experiment: Control mice (Ctrl), transgenic mice (MR-Cardio), Ctrl mice + aldosterone treatment, MR-Cardio mice + aldosterone treatment. Three comparisons: Ctrl vs MR-Cardio, Ctrl vs Ctrl-Aldo, MR-Cardio vs MR-Cardio-Aldo

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
