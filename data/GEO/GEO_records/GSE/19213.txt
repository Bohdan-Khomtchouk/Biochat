TITLE
Expression data from oxidant treated yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast transcription factor Yap1 mediates adaptive response against H2O2 and the cystein thiol reactive Michael acceptor, N-ethylmaleimid (NEM) and acrolein.  The response against H2O2 was found to be distinct from that against NEM and acrolein. We used microarray experiment to identify two subsets of Yap1-dependent genes that correspond to these two adaptive responses.

DESIGN
Wild-type yeast BY4741 cells were grown in early exponential phase and treated with H2O2, NEM, or acrolein.  RNAs were then extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
