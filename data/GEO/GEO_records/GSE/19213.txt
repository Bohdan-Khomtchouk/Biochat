TITLE
Expression data from oxidant treated yeast

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Yeast transcription factor Yap1 mediates adaptive response against H2O2 and the cystein thiol reactive Michael acceptor, N-ethylmaleimid (NEM) and acrolein.  The response against H2O2 was found to be distinct from that against NEM and acrolein. We used microarray experiment to identify two subsets of Yap1-dependent genes that correspond to these two adaptive responses.
