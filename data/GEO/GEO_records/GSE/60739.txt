TITLE
Comprehensive analysis of host gene expression in Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus-infected Spodoptera frugiperda cells

ORGANISM
Spodoptera frugiperda

SUMMARY
Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is the best-studied baculovirus and most commonly used virus vector for baculovirus expression vector systems. The effect of AcMNPV infection on host cells is incompletely understood. A microarray based on Spodoptera frugiperda ESTs was used to investigate the impact of AcMNPV on host gene expression in cultured S. frugiperda, Sf21 cells. Most host genes were down-regulated over the time course of infection, although a small number were up-regulated. The most highly up-regulated genes encoded heat shock protein 70s and several poorly characterized proteins. Regulated genes with the highest score identified by functional annotation clustering included primarily products required for protein expression and trafficking in the ER and golgi. All were significantly down-regulated by approximately 12h post-infection. Microarray data were validated by qRT-PCR. This study provides the first comprehensive host transcriptome overview of Sf21 cells during AcMNPV infection.

DESIGN
Host gene expression of the Sf21 cells was measured in AcMNPV mock-infected Sf21cells as well as AcMNPV-infected Sf21 cells at 6, 12, and 24 hours post infection (hpi). Four independent experiments were performed at each time (6, 12, and 24 hpi) using different donors for each experiment. Only two 24 hour sample data sets were used in the final analysis as two did not meet QC criteria.
