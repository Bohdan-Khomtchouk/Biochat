TITLE
Expression profiling of rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with anti-TNF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of anti-TNF responders were compared to profiles of anti-TNF non-responders in order to identify an expression signature for anti-TNF response

DESIGN
In total 42 patients were treated with anti-TNF. RNA was isoloated from white blood cells and anti-TNF responders (n=18) were compared to nonresponders (n=24) regarding expression profiles
