TITLE
Genome-wide, High Resolution DNA Methylation Profiling Using Bisulfite-Mediated Cytosine Conversion

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We developed a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling technology that determines methylation patterns using small amounts of starting material. This process involves a novel amplification step for DNA subjected to bisulfite-mediated cytosine conversion and generates highly reproducible datasets with low technical variation. The technology, named BiMP (for Bisulfite Methylation Profiling), is more cost-effective than mC immunoprecipitation techniques (mCIP) and can be applied to as little as 100 ng of Arabidopsis DNA. It is anticipated that this technology can be applied to mammalian genomes and may allow methylation profiling of a small number of physiologically uniform cells.
