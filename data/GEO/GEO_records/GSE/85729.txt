TITLE
Increased tumourigenesis in ApcMin/+ mice fed with a Western-type diet associates with changes in PDK4, Erk/Akt and mTor pathways, intestinal immunity and the expression of energy metabolism-related genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Western diet enhances intestinal tumorigenesis in Min/+ mice, associating with mucosal metabolic and inflammatory stress and loss of Apc heterozygosity We investigated the interaction of WD and heterozygous mutation in the Apc gene in the histologically normal intestinal mucosa of ApcMin/+ (Min/+) mice. AIN-93G diet vs. a diet modified from AIN-93G, with high fat and low fiber, vitamin D, calcium and folate. (66.4% of total fat from milk, and 33.6% from rapeseed and sunflower oil)

DESIGN
RNA from 1-3 mice small intestine per chip. Controls vs Western diet, males vs. females
