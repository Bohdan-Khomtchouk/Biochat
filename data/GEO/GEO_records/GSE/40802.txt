TITLE
Gene expression data of two different strains of laying hens from a small group housing system

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in newly developed housing systems is important to understand gene functions in chicken for adaptation and possible gene-environment interactions among layer lines. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize the molecular processes that are different among the two layer lines Lohmann Selected Leghorn (LSL) and Lohmann Brown (LB) using whole genome RNA expression profiles. Despite their approximately identical egg production performance these layer lines differ markedly in other phenotypic traits. The two layer lines were kept under the production environment of the newly developed small group housing system Eurovent German with two different group sizes and three tiers.

DESIGN
We used a chicken RNA microarray to identify differentially expressed genes among the two layer lines LSL and LB.
