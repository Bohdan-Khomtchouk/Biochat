TITLE
Gene expression accompanying the promotion of hepatocellular carcinoma by intestinal microbiota and Tlr4 in mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The effect of Tlr4P712H mutation (rendering TLR4 non-functional), or gut-sterilization by antbiotics, on the induction of tumorgenesis by CCl4 and diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was characterized. Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 gene expression measurements were used to characterize the transcriptomic basis of the effects of the above treatments and genotypes on tumorgenesis.

DESIGN
Gene expression of mouse livers of A. Normal liver from WT C3H/HeOuJ mice, B. HCC from WT C3H/HeOuJ mice treated with CCl4 and DEN, C.HCC from TLR4-mutant C3H/HeJ mice (Tlr4P712H) treated with CCl4 and DEN and D.HCC from WT C3H/HeOuJ mice treated with antibiotics (a combination of ampicillin (1 g/l), neomycin [1 g/l], metronidazole[1 g/l]  and vancomycin [500 mg/l] in drinking water) and CCl4 and DEN were characterized.
