TITLE
Gene expression changes in a breast cancer stem cell model.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is activated during cancer invasion and metastasis, enriches for cancer stem cells (CSCs), and contributes to therapeutic resistance and disease recurrence. The epithelial cell line MCF7, can be induced to undergo EMT with the induction of PKC by PMA. 5-10% of the resulting cells have a CSC phenotype. This study looks at the transcriptome of these cells and how it differs from cells with a non-CSC phenotype.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were stimulated with PMA and FACS sorted. 4 samples, no replicates
