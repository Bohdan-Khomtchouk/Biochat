TITLE
Spo13 facilitates monopolin recruitment to kinetochores and regulates maintenance of centromeric cohesion

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
BACKGROUND: Cells undergoing meiosis perform two consecutive divisions after a single round of DNA replication. During the first meiotic division, homologous chromosomes segregate to opposite poles. This is achieved by (1) the pairing of maternal and paternal chromosomes via recombination producing chiasmata, (2) coorientation of homologous chromosomes such that sister chromatids attach to the same spindle pole, and (3) resolution of chiasmata by proteolytic cleavage by separase of the meiotic-specific cohesin Rec8 along chromosome arms. Crucially, cohesin at centromeres is retained to allow sister centromeres to biorient at the second division. Little is known about how these meiosis I-specific events are regulated. RESULTS: Here, we show that Spo13, a centromere-associated protein produced exclusively during meiosis I, is required to prevent sister kinetochore biorientation by facilitating the recruitment of the monopolin complex to kinetochores. Spo13 is also required for the reaccumulation of securin, the persistence of centromeric cohesin during meiosis II, and the maintenance of a metaphase I arrest induced by downregulation of the APC/C activator CDC20. CONCLUSION: Spo13 is a key regulator of several meiosis I events. The presence of Spo13 at centromere-surrounding regions is consistent with the notion that it plays a direct role in both monopolin recruitment to centromeres during meiosis I and maintenance of centromeric cohesion between the meiotic divisions. Spo13 may also limit separase activity after the first division by ensuring securin reaccumulation and, in doing so, preventing precocious removal from chromatin of centromeric cohesin.
