TITLE
Allelic Imbalances in bladder tumors based on high-density SNP array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison between germline (blood) and microdissected bladder tumors to determine allelic imbalances. The GeneChipÂ® Mapping 10K Early Access Array Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA was used to determine the number of heterozygous SNPs in DNA from blood compared to the number of heterozygous SNPs in DNA from tumor in the same patient. Keywords: repeat sample
