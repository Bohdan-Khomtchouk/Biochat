TITLE
Genome-wide maps of CtBP binding profile in breast cancer cell line MCF-7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CtBP is a global co-repressor by serving as transcriptional factor in multiple pathways. CtBP functioned as transcriptional factor by recruiting other cofactors such as G9a, HDAC1 and PcG proteins. CtBP is found to be over enriched in several type of tumor samples. To dipict the role of CtBP in globally regulating gene expression, we applied ChIP-seq technology to find out the binding profile of CtBP in breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Our data suggest CtBP plays a global regulatory role in DNA damage repair, tumor initiation, and EMT process.

DESIGN
Examine CtBP binding in MCF-7 cells
