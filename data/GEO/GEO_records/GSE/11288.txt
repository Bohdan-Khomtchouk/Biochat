TITLE
Gene microarray analysis of mouse-brain endothelial cells exposure to Pertussis Toxin and B-oligomer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pertussis Toxin (PTX) regulated inflammatory and angiogenesis-related transcripts in endothelial cells from mouse brain(MBEC). Of ~14,000 mouse genes tracked, 34 showed altered expression in response to PTX, and most of these changes were dependent on the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the S1 subunit of the active holotoxin. More than one third of these genes have roles in inflammation and angiogenesis. Keywords: response to treatment

DESIGN
MBEC(passage1) cultured on collagen-coated glass chamber slides were treated with PTX and B-oligomer at 3ng/ml, or PBS as control. Six hours later, total RNA were isolated from the cells. Gene microarray were performed to identify early candidate genes that are affected by PTX. The experiment was repeated twice independently.
