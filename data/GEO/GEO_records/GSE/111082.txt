TITLE
Hominin-specific NOTCH2NL genes affect Notch signaling and cortical neurogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genetic changes causing brain size expansion in human evolution have remained elusive. Notch signaling is essential for radial glia stem cell proliferation and a determinant of neuronal number in the mammalian cortex. We find three paralogs of human-specific NOTCH2NL are highly expressed in radial glia. Functional analysis reveals different alleles of NOTCH2NL have varying potencies to enhance Notch signaling by interacting directly with NOTCH receptors. Consistent with a role in Notch signaling, NOTCH2NL ectopic expression delays differentiation of neuronal progenitors, while deletion accelerates differentiation. Furthermore, NOTCH2NL genes provide the breakpoints in typical cases of 1q21.1 distal deletion/duplication syndrome, where duplications are associated with macrocephaly and autism, and deletions with microcephaly and schizophrenia. Thus, the emergence of hominin-specific NOTCH2NL genes may have contributed to the rapid evolution of the larger hominin neocortex accompanied by loss of genomic stability at the 1q21.1 locus and a resulting recurrent neurodevelopmental disorder.

DESIGN
H9 embryonic stem cells were used for directed differentiation towards cortical organoids. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, H9 control and H9 NOTCH2NL knockout lines were generated. Comparative analysis of RNA-seq at week 4 of differentiation was done to assess the effect of NOTCH2NL KO on cortical neurogenesis. Mouse 46C ES cell stable lines were generated, overexpressing either EV control, or NOTCH2NL-Sh_T197I cDNA. Mouse 46C stable cell lines were differentiated into cortical organoids, and gene expression level was compared by RNA-Seq at day 6 of differentiation.
