TITLE
Gene expression profiling in equine polysaccharide storage myopathy

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
Standardized muscular biopsies of the dorsal compartment of the gluteus medius muscle were performed in 7 horses suffering from equine polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM) and 6 sound Norman Cob horses . Gene expression analysis was performed using an equine oligonucleotide microarray which included 384 equine gene probes of the nuclear genome and all the mitochondrial genes.

DESIGN
All the samples of PSSM muscles were hybridized against the reference control muscles. This reference was made by pooling together all the mRNA extracted after in vitro transcription from the 6 control muscles of the sound horses. Briefly, the hybridization protocol was adapted from Le Brigand et al. (2006). An open-access long oligonucleotide microarray resource for analysis of the human and mouse transcriptomes.
