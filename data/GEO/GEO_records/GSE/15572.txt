TITLE
Gene expression profiling in equine polysaccharide storage myopathy

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
Standardized muscular biopsies of the dorsal compartment of the gluteus medius muscle were performed in 7 horses suffering from equine polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM) and 6 sound Norman Cob horses . Gene expression analysis was performed using an equine oligonucleotide microarray which included 384 equine gene probes of the nuclear genome and all the mitochondrial genes.
