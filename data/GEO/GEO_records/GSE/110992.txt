TITLE
Microarray study of tumoral tissue transcriptome of breast cancer in mexican women who are overweight or obese

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this work, transcriptoma of invasive breast carcinoma was studied by means of microarray expression in Mexican women who are overweight or obese. The dysfunction of the adipokines signaling pathways has recently been linked to more aggressive features of breast c√°ncer. We hypothesized that there are changes related to the signaling of adipokines in the expression profile of invasive breast carcinoma of Mexican women with overweight or obesity. The objectives were as follows: 1) Determine the expression profile of tumour tissue of Mexican women who are overweight or obese by comparing tumoral tissue and non -tumoral tissue, both from the same patient, 2) Identification of over- or underexpressed genes involved in signalling pathways related to adipokines and the tumour process, 3) Identify the signalling pathways that presented genes with expression changes and were related to adipokines and the tumoural process.

DESIGN
Six independent pools: three samples from obese patients, two samples from obese patients,  two samples from overweight patients,  two samples from overweight patients, three samples from overweight patients, two samples from overweight patients, comprised of total RNA isolated from tumor and adjacent tissue.
