TITLE
Expression profile of HEK293 cells stably transfected with PRL-1 (PTP4A1) or empty pcDNA4 vector (control)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The multifunctional protein tyrosine phosphatase PRL-1 (Gene Symbol:  PTP4A1) has been identified as an important oncogene with roles in promoting cell proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, and metastasis.  However, little is currently known about the signaling pathways through which it mediates its effects. We used Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays to examine the global molecular changes of gene expression occurring in response to stable PRL-1 overexpression in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from triplicate cultures of HEK293 cells stably overexpressing PRL-1 (HEK293-PRL-1) and HEK293 cells stably transfected with empty pcDNA4 vector (HEK293-Vector).  Samples were hybridized to Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays (1 array per sample for a total of 6 arrays).  One of the arrays hybridized with a PRL-1 transfected sample was excluded after qRT-PCR demonstrated that this sample did not exhibit increased PRL-1 expression over the level of the empty vector controls.  The remaining 2 HEK293-PRL-1 samples both expressed PRL-1 at least 2-fold higher than any of the 3 empty vector controls.
