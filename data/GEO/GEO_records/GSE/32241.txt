TITLE
Differentially regulated genes induced in Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis by in vitro acid-nitrosative multi-stress

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis in in vitro acid-nitrosative multistress, comparing untreated control cells and bacteria under multi-stress.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, MAP-K vs. MAP-ACID-NO treated. Biological replicates: 3 controls, 3 Acid-NO treated, independently grown and harvested. In controls and Acid-NO treated cells, good quality RNA samples obtained from each pellet were pooled together and used for microarray experiments to get an average of three separate experiments, four replicates per array.

PLATFORM
