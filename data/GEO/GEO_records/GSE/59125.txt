TITLE
Chemical conversion of human fibroblasts into functional Schwann cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the transcriptome-wide gene expression changes underlying chemical conversion of human fibroblasts into induced Schwann Cells over a time period of 39 days. We compared then the expression profiles of these induced Schwann Cells to primary Schwann cells. The gene expression results analyzed in this study are further described in Thoma et al. (2014) Chemical conversion of human fibroblasts into functional Schwann cells. Under submission

DESIGN
Human fibroblasts were selected at successive stages of the chemical conversion process towards induced Schwann cells for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix HG-U133_plus_2 microarrays.
