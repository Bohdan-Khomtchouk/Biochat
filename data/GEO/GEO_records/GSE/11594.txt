TITLE
Expression data from dark grown Arabidopsis Wild type (Wt, col-o) and pif1-2 (At2g20810, Salk_072677) mutant seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis bHLH transcription factor PIF1 has been shown function as a negative regulator of Chlorophyll biosynthesis. Pif1-2 mutant accumulate more protochlorophylide during prolonged dark growth condations, therefore the comparation between Wt and pif1-2 mutant will help us find the PIF1 target genes in Chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway at genome wide level under the dark grown conditions. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression under the regulation of PIF1. Keywords: Genotype comparison
