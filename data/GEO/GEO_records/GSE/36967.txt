TITLE
Affymetrix SNP 6.0 profiles of 10 Human B-NHL lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
B-cell Non Hodgkin Lymphoma are a heterogenous group chracterized by a variety of genetic changes, including translocations, deletions and amplifications. Here we analyzed 10 B-NHL lines  by Affymetrix SNP 6.0 to detect copy number changes. Specifically, we aim to identify cell lines suitable for testing the consequences of acute reintroduction of candidate tumor suppressor genes as they harbor deletions which include the candidate gene(s).

DESIGN
10 BNHL cell lines were grown in standard cell culture conditions. Genomic DNA was exptracted from frozen pellets and analyzed for copy number variations with Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Arrays
