TITLE
Early Mouse Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Early during culture of primary mouse HSCs gene expression changes. These expression alterations can be affected by treating cells with histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid

DESIGN
Primary mouse Hepatic stellate cells were cultured for short periods of time (4-16-64h) in presence or absence of valproic acid. Gene expression analysis (mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays according to manufacturerâ€™s manual 701880Rev4 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)), in vitro stellate cell activation and inhibition of the activation by valproic acid treatment.
