TITLE
Gene expression analysis of 5-aza-dC treated pancreatic cancer associated fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of 5-aza-dC treated pancreatic cancer associated fibroblasts To identify genes silenced by methylation in pancreatic CAFs, we performed gene expression profiling on 5-aza-dC treated pancreatic cancer associated fibroblast cultures using Affymetrix Exon arrays.

DESIGN
We analyzed 5 untreated and 5-aza-dC-treated pancreatic cancer associated fibroblast cultures using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform. Gene expression levels were compared using Partek (version 6.3beta).

PLATFORM
GPL5175 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
