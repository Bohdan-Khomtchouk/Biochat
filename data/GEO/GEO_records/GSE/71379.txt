TITLE
Gene expression profile of liver tissue from carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-treated mouse cultured ex vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene-expression profiles of liver tissue of cabon tetrachloride (CCl4)-treated and control mice were obtained before and after organotypic ex vivo tissue culture. keywords: liver tissue, mouse, gene-expression microarray, Illumina, ex vivo tissue culture

DESIGN
Animals received humane care according to the criteria outlined in the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” of the National Academy of Sciences. All animals were maintained in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care. Strain A/J male mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were treated three times a week for 18 weeks with either 0.1cc of a 40 percent solution of CCl4 (Sigma) in olive oil or with vehicle control by oral gavage.  Mice were sacrificed and the liver was harvested for RNA extraction (day 0) or organotypic ex vivo tissue culture. Fresh liver tissues were sectioned into 300mm-thick slices and cultured for 24h (day 1) or 48h (day 2) with DMEM/F12 media (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100U/mL penicillin, 100mg/mL streptomycin, and 2.5mg/mL amphotericin B. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent, and subjected to expression profiling.
