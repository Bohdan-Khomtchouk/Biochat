TITLE
Detection of Human Viruses from wastewater sewage extracts

ORGANISM
Viruses

SUMMARY
Sewage samples were collected and concentrated for Human and animal viruses. Viruses were cultured on Buffalo Green Monkey Cells (BGMK) and their genomic DNA/RNA were extracted and labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 respectively. Labeled DNA/RNA were hybridized unto the array and signals generated were analyzed to indicate the presence of target viruses. Keywords: Detection of pathogens within environmental sample (Viruses)

DESIGN
Environmental viruses were concentrated using organic flocculation with Beef Extract supplemented with glycine. Viruses were concentrated using 2 successive rounds of centrifugation and resuspended in Sodium Phosphate buffer. Viral nucleic acid was extracted, labeled and hybridized unto the microarray to determine the presence of target viruses within the sample.
