TITLE
Single glomerular podocyte RNA-seq analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Available single-cell RNA-seq analyses have revealed that individual cells of the same type differ substantially in gene expression. We wonder whether glomerular podocytes, the cell type that is part of glomerular filtration, also exhibit big difference in gene expression among individual cells; and what biological information could be obtained from the single-podocyte RNA-seq data. Therefore, we isolated mouse glomeruli by Dynabead/magnetic concentration method, and digested them with enzymes to dissociate the cells. We loaded the single cell suspension to a Fluidigm  C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep System for single cell cDNA preparation. The cDNA samples were amplified and underwent sequecing using Illumina Highseq 2000 system.

DESIGN
In total, 20 single podocytes from a C57BL/6 male mouse were analyzed.
