TITLE
NFAT5 is a critical regulator of rheumatoid inflammation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NFAT5 is an osmoprotective transcription factor whose DNA binding domain shares structural homology with NFkappaB and other member of NFAT family, but its role in chronic inflammatory diseases remains unclear. The mRNA profiling of synoviocytes and endothelial cells transfected with NFAT5-targeted siRNA reveals three major changes in cellular processes associated with the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis: cell cycle and survival, angiogenesis, and cell migration.

DESIGN
The cells were transfected with NFAT5-targeted siRNA or non-specific scrambled (control) siRNA.
