TITLE
mRNA expression data from adenoma, gene modified, and colorectal cancer organoid.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established human colorectal tumor organoids from benign adenoma, primary colorectal cancer or metastasized colorectal cancer. The gene signature of tumor organoids associated with their tumor progression status. We also generated genome-edited organoids from human intestinal organoids recapitulating adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Gene expression signature of the genome engineered organoids were similar to that of adenoma organoids. This result indicated multiple (up to five) genetic mutations were insufficient for gene expression reprogramming of colorectal cancer. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in human colorectal tumor organoids and artificially mutation introduced organoids.

DESIGN
To assess the expression profiling of genome-engineered organoids, we prepared total-RNA from cultured adenoma, carcinoma and genome-engineered organoids. We produced two types of genome-engineered organoids using the CRISPR/Cas9 or lentivirus vector system. Each engineered gene and engineered methods are described as a single alphabet and method name, respectively, in the sample characteristics field.   The abbreviations for the engineered genes are as follows. 1) Genome-engineered organoids with CRISPR/Cas9 A = APC deletion; K = KRAS G12V knock in; S = Smad4 deletion; T = TP53 deletion; P = PIK3CA E545K knock in. 2) Genome-engineered organoids with Lent virus vector B = CTNNB1 S33Y overexpression; K = KRAS G12V overexpression; S = Smad4 shRNA overexpression; T = TP53 shRNA overexpression; P = PIK3CA E545K overexpression.
