TITLE
Expression data from induced mescenchymal stem cells (iMSCs), human adult fibroblasts (42 and 56-year old), and neonatal fibroblast (CRL2097).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human dermal fibroblasts are conversion into iMSCs by drug treatment, the global gene profiles of iMSCs are comparable to bone marrow MSCs. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in iMSCs, BMMSCs and fibroblasts.

DESIGN
We generated iMSCs  that derived from 42 and 56-year old dermal fibroblasts and neonatal fibroblasts CRL2097, these three source of fibroblasts as negative control and one BMMSCs for positive control.
