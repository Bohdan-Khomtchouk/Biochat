TITLE
Changes in gene expression in HOS and U2-OS cell lines after exposure to 600 Î¼g/mL OGE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Osteosarcoma (Osteosarcoma) is a type of bone cancer. Eighty percent of this tumor will be metastatic to the lungs or liver, and as a result, patients generally need chemotherapy to improve survival possibility. Recently, anti-tumor activity has been reported in Ocimum gratissimum aqueous extract (OGE), which has been the focus of recent extensive studies on therapeutic strategies due to its antioxidant properties. We used microarrays to identify potential and novel target genes responsive to the anticancer effect in OGE treatment in osteosarcoma cells,

DESIGN
We performed pharmacogenomics analyses for the effect of OGE on human osteosarcoma U2-OS and HOS cell growth. Cell viability, Western blot and flow cytometry analysis were performed before performing pharmacogenomics analyses for the effect of OGE on human osteosarcoma U2-OS and HOS cell growth, including cDNA microarray and RT-PCR assays.
