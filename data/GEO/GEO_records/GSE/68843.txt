TITLE
Transcriptom analysis of FLT1 regulated genes in metastasis associated macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes in metastasis associated macrophage (MAM) with control and FLT1 inhibitory antibody (MF1) were compared using FACS sorted cells from mice bearing pulmonary metastasis of breast tumor cells treated with Ctrl and MF1 antibody

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from metastasis associated macrophages from three separate mice treated with FLT1 inhibitory antibody (MF1) and three separate mice treated with control antibody.  Each chip measures the expression level of 42586 genes.
