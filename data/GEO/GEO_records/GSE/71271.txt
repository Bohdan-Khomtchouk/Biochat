TITLE
Salt stress responses of Arabidopsis thaliana and Eutrema salsugineum (Thellungiella salsuginea)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis thaliana is a glycophyte with a low salt tolerance, while Eutrema is a halophyte with a very high salt tolerance. To elucidate the transcriptional basis of this difference, we performed hydroponis culture experiments where we grew plants under control conditions (25 mM NaCl) or under salt stress (200 mM NaCl for both species, 500 mM for Eutrema). Salt concentration was increased for the stress treatments by increments of 50 mM per day (25 mM on the first day). Plants were grown at the final NaCl concentration for an additional week, when rosettes were harvested for RNA isolation.Expression patterns were compared between treatments and between species.

DESIGN
In total, 15 samples were hybridized. They were derived from three independent biological experiments (replicate_1 to replicate_3). Controlds were grown at 25 mM NaCl, salt stressed plants at either 200 mM NaCl or 500 mM NaCl.
