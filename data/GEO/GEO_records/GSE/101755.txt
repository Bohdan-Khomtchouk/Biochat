TITLE
Effect of atrazine exposure on D. magna gene expression

ORGANISM
Daphnia magna

SUMMARY
We report exposure to 40 µM atrazine, a probable HR96 activator in D. magna, induced detoxification and sphingolipid metabolism genes, consistent with previous work on HR96 activation.

DESIGN
7-day old D. magna exposed to 40 µM atrazine for 96 hours. 5 samples consisted of 3 daphnids each.

PLATFORM
GPL23821 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Daphnia magna)
