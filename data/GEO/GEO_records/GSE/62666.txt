TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in wild-type and SetDB1 induced knockout mESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of histone modifications in mammalian cells and characterized genome-wide SetDB1 binding and H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) profiles in mouse ES cells and uncovered two distinct classes of SetDB1 binding sites, termed solo and ensemble peaks. The solo peaks were devoid of H3K9me3 and enriched near developmental regulators while the ensemble peaks were associated with H3K9me3.  A subset of the SetDB1 solo peaks, particularly those near neural development related genes, was found to be associated with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) as well as PRC2-interacting proteins Jarid2 and Mtf2.  Genetic deletion of Setdb1 dramatically reduced Ezh2 binding as well as histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) trimethylation level at SetDB1 solo peaks and facilitated neural differentiation. Furthermore, we found that H3K27me3 inhibits SetDB1 methyltransferase activity in vitro.  The currently identified reciprocal action between SetDB1 and PRC2 reveals a novel mechanism underlying ES cell pluripotency and differentiation regulation.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different histone modifications in 2 cell status.
