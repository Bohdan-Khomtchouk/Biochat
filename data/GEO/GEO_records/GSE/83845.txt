TITLE
Methylation profiles of lung adenocarcinoma patients in Taiwan

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of tumor samples with lung adenocarcinoma patients. The Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,578 CpGs in lung cancer samples. Samples included tumor samples with lung adenocarcinoma.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 39 adenocarcinoma samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array.
