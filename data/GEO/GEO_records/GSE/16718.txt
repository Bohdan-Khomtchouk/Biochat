TITLE
Identification of novel SNP candidates associated with chemo-responsiveness in colorectal cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identificaiton of novel single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) candidates associated with chemo-responsiveness in colorectal cancers using microarray Response rates of 104 colorectal cancer patients to established regiments (FL, CAPE, FLOX, FLIRI) were evaluated by histoculture drug response assay. Affymetrix SNP 5.0 chips were used to determine genotypes of the same colorectal cancer patients. SNPs associated with chemosensitivity to standard regimens were identified by genome-wide association study. FL: 5-FU + Leucovorin; CA: Capecitabine, FLOX: 5-FU + Leucovorin + Oxaliplatin, FLIRI: 5-FU + Leucovorin + Irinotecan

DESIGN
Response rates of 104 colorectal cancer patients to established regiments (FL, CAPE, FLOX, FLIRI) were evaluated by histoculture drug response assay. Affymetrix SNP 5.0 chips were used to determine genotypes of the same colorectal cancer patients. SNPs associated with chemosensitivity to standard regimens were identified by genome-wide association study. FL: 5-FU + Leucovorin; CA: Capecitabine, FLOX: 5-FU + Leucovorin + Oxaliplatin, FLIRI: 5-FU + Leucovorin + Irinotecan Histoculture drug response assay results provided as % inhibition rate of tumor growth (1 - (tumor cell count in drug treatment)/(tumor cell count in control treatment)) * 100. Cell count is measured by UV spectrometer at 540 nm. The  value is between 0% (No inhibition) to 100% (Complete inhibition). For example, a patient with FL 60 was more responsive to  FL treatment than a patient with FL 20.
