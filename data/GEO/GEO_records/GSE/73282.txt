TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of C. elegans aptf-1(gk7954) mutant in L4 sleep stage.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To investigate which genes are up- or down-regulated during L4 sleep in C. elegans mutant aptf-1(gk794) we performed whole genome microarray expression profiling using the C. elegans (V2) Gene Expression Microarray, 4x44K from Agilent Technologies.

DESIGN
Approximately 200 sleeping L4 worms were used per sample. As a control we have used N2 C. elegans wild type strain. Mutant condition (aptf-1(gk794)) and control (N2) were done in four replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL11346 Agilent-020186 C. elegans (V2) Gene Expression Microarray (Probe Name version)
