TITLE
Gene expression profiling of FFPE breast cancer samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We implemented an optimized processing, using alternative Chip Description Files (CDFs) and fRMA normalization, which improve the quality of downstream analysis.

DESIGN
We profiled 44 FFPE primary breast cancer samples using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray platform after RNA amplification with the Nugen WT-Ovation FFPE System
