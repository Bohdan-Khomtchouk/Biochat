TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling In Murine Corneal Neovascularization Models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to find out the vital genes during the corneal neovascularization (CNV), we set up two CNV models, one being induced by suture placement and the other by alkali burn to the corneal center. Young adult Balb/c and C57BL/6 were used. The corneas were checked daily for CNV development and some of the corneas were removed at two pre-determined time points for RNA extraction. Preliminary experiment indicated slightly different dynamics in suture- or chemical burn-induced CNV. Vigorous growth appeared at day 5 and day 6 in S-CNV and CB-CNV, and reached maximum length around day 10 and day 14, respectively, in S-CNV and CB-CNV. To check whether genetic MHC background has any effect on development of CNV, we compared CB-CNV in Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice at day 6.

DESIGN
Corneas from Balb/c mice were isolated 5 and 10 days after suture-induced CNV, and 6 and 14 days after chemical burn-induced CNV. Corneas from C57BL/6 mice were isolated 6 days after chemical burn-induced CNV. Each time point had two or three biological replications.
