TITLE
High-salt diet leads to differential gene expression in DOCA-treated mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the present study we made use of the (1-renin) DOCA-salt mouse model - which has been previously shown to develop cardiac and renal hypertrophy  - to evaluate the direct effects of high-salt diet on cardiac function and gene expression profiling. The comparison between low-salt and high-salt DOCA-treated mice will reveal what genes are directly modulated by sodium in (normotensive) DOCA-treated mice.
