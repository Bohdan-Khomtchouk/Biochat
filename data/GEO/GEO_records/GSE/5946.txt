TITLE
High-salt diet leads to differential gene expression in DOCA-treated mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the present study we made use of the (1-renin) DOCA-salt mouse model - which has been previously shown to develop cardiac and renal hypertrophy  - to evaluate the direct effects of high-salt diet on cardiac function and gene expression profiling. The comparison between low-salt and high-salt DOCA-treated mice will reveal what genes are directly modulated by sodium in (normotensive) DOCA-treated mice.

DESIGN
In this first series, six (7-8 week old) DOCA-treated mice were separated in 2 groups: Group1 (Low-Salt)= LS + Nx + DOCA35 + tap (LS= 0.5mg Na/g food; Nx= uninephrectomized; DOCA35= deoxycorticosterone acetate for 5 weeks; tap= normal drinking water) Group2 (High-salt)= LS + Nx + DOCA35 + 1%NaCl (LS= 0.5mg Na/g food; Nx= uninephrectomized; DOCA35= deoxycorticosterone acetate for 5 weeks; 1%NaCl= 1%NaCl in drinking water for 5 weeks) cDNA high-density microarray assays were used to explore changes in cardiac expression of ~17’000 clones in hearts of Low-salt and High-salt treated DOCA-mice. This series contains 3 biological replicates and one dye swap.
