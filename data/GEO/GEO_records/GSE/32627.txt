TITLE
Genome-wide  mapping  of  Sox6  binding  sites  in  mouse fetal myotubes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In  order  to  understand  how  Sox6  coordinately  regulates  the  transcription  of  multiple fiber type specific genes during muscle development, we have performed ChIP-seq analyses to identify Sox6 target genes as well as RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding sites in mouse fetal myotubes.

DESIGN
Examination of Sox6 and Pol II binding sites in mouse fetal primary myotubes

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
