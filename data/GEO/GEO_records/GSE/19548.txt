TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of RNA Pol III binding site (K562)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation following by high-thoughput tag sequencing (ChIP-Seq) using the GA II platform from Illumina for the human  RNA Polymerase III in K562 cells. We have also generated a sequenced input DNA datasets for K562 cells. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
Map binding sites of RNA Polymerase III in the genome of K562 cells. The K562 input data has been deposited in GEO as GSM325934.

PLATFORM
GPL9052 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Homo sapiens)
