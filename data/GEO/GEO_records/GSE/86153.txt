TITLE
Identification of extensive cellular diversity and maturation of active neuronal networks in long-term cultures of human brain organoids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed  gene expression in  over  80,000  individual  cells  isolated  from  31  human  whole-brain  organoids  that  has developed  for  3-6  months.  We  find  that  organoids  can  generate a  broad  diversity  of  cells, which  we  show  are  related  to  known  endogenous  classes, including  subpopulations  of neurons and progenitors of the cerebral cortex

DESIGN
Single cell Droplet sequencing of human cerebral organoid
