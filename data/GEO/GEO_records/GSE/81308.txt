TITLE
U937 treated with decitabine, panobinostat and valproic acid [Illumina]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We employed the AML cell line model U937 to determine the effects of single and dual treatment with the HMA decitabine and the HDACi Pano or VPA on  gene expression and DNA methylation. We noted global alterations of gene expression and a massive effect on the methylome.

DESIGN
We analyzed 6 treatment conditions in triplicates summarizing to 18 samples.
