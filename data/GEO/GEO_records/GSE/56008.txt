TITLE
Genome-wide identification of E2f3 and Myc DNA binding sites in normal and Rb-deficient intestines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore how Myc and E2f3 might coordinate gene expression programs that drive  normal cell cycles in wild type intestines and ectopic cell cycles in Rb-deficient small intestines, we compared Myc and E2f3 chromatin occupancy in these tissues.

DESIGN
Examination of DNA binding of 2 transcription factors (E2f3 and Myc) in normal and Rb-deficient villus cells.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
