TITLE
Effects of methylprednisolone on Aspergillus fumigatus 293 gene expression

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus Af293

SUMMARY
Corticosteroid use has epidemiologically been associated with invasive aspergillosis.  We found that hydrocortisone and MP in physiological concentrations cause a change in morphology of A. fumigatus 293 growth with a less dense core, and straighter outgrowth of longer hyphae. Treated with MP, we found a differential expression of genes annotated to cell wall structure, and to cell cycle programme compared to untreated control, which could explain the changes in morphology. The up-regulation of genes encoding for toxins, iron acquisition, and cell wall components enforcing oxidative stress resistance would theoretically result in a more pathogenic A. fumigatus phenotype. Upregulation of pathways involved in DNA-repair might indicate on genotoxic effects of MP.

DESIGN
Examination of test setting with 0.5 microM methylprednisolone versus control setting without methylprednisolone. Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed on the pooled data of the 3 samples treated with MP versus the 3 untreated control samples, with correction for the total number of reads per group.
