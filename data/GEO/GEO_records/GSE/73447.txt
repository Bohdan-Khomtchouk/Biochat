TITLE
Atrx facilitate normal neuronal differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: the chromatin-remodeler ATRX is frequently mutated in a range of human malignancies including pediatric and adult gliomas, and its loss underlies induction of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway for chromosome-end maintenance. But how ATRX exters its glioma suppresor role remains unclear. Here, we combine RNAi and somatic deletion approaches to demonstrate ATRX as a glioma suppressor controlling neural differentiation. Loss of ATRX promotes gliomagenesis by blocking neuronal progenitors from undergoing terminal maturation. Our findings provide the molecular and cellular mechanism underline ATRX's function in gliomagenesis.

DESIGN
Examined gene expression profiles of three Atrx-deleted neural stem cells and two control ones cultured in two differentiation conditions.
