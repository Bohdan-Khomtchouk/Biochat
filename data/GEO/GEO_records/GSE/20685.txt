TITLE
Microarray-based molecular subtyping of breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The primary goal of this study is to identify molecular subtypes of breast cancer through gene expression profiles of 327 breast cancer samples and determine molecular and clinical characteristics of different breast cancer subtypes. We studied expression signatures of different cellular functions (e.g., cell proliferation/cell cycle, wound response, tumor stromal response, vascular endothelial normalization, drug esponse genes, etc.) in different breast cancer molecular subtypes and investigated how microarray-based breast cancer molecular subtypes may be used to guide treatment.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of 327 breast cancer samples were determined using total RNA and Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 arrays.
