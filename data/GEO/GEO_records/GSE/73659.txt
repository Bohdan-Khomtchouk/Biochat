TITLE
Murine chondrocytes: Control vs Ad-Epas1 infected

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse chondrocytes comparing chondrocytes infected with empty adenovirus and Epas1 adenovirus. RNA was extracted from each chondrocytes. We used microarrays to determine the effect of Epas1 overexpression on chondrocytes and identify the noble regulatory molecules during osteoarthritic pathogenesis.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Mock vs. Ad-Epas1 chondrocytes. Biological replicates: 4 mock adenoviral infected replicates, 4 Ad-Epas1 infected replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
