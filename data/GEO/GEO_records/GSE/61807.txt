TITLE
Nanos2-associated mRNAs in the postnatal testis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify Nanos2-associated mRNAs, we performed microarray analysis of mRNAs coprecipitated with FLAG-tagged NANOS2 with postnatal testis from Tg-Nanos2 enhancer-3xFLAG-Nanos2-3'UTR at P7.

DESIGN
Biological duplicates were examined at each sample.
