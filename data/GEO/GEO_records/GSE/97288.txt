TITLE
ENAP1 is involved in ethylene response

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report that ethylene regulate the ENAP1 binding. We perform a dual cross-linking procedure using the additional cross-linker ethylene glycol bis-succinimidylsuccinate (EGS; Thermo Scientific) along with formaldehyde according to (Pedmale et al. 2016) for Chip-sequencing (ChIPseq) of ENAP1, as well as ENAP1 ChIP- EIN2 reChIPseq (ChIP-reChIPseq), which were used chromatins isolated from 3-day old etiolated Col-0 seedlings treated with ethylene or air gas. Results show that ENAP1 is involved in the EIN2 dependent ethylene response.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different protein binding in 1 Arabidopsis lines which under 2 different treatment.
