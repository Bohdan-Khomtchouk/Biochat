TITLE
Gene expression analysis of embryo-derived stromal cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hematopoiesis occurs in a microenviroenment in which stromal cells are prominent. Stromal cells have been shown to maintain stem cell behaviour of hematopoietic stem cells. We derived several different stromal cell lines from midgestation embryos which will, or will not maintain hemetopoietic stem cells in cultures. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying maintenance and emergence of hematopoietic stem cells in cocultures with embryo-derived stromal cells. Keywords: Comparison CEL files will become available on November 29, 2008

DESIGN
Embryo-derived stromal cell lines were grown to confluence and irradiated as described earlier (Oostendorp et al., Stem Cells. 2005;23:842:50). Normalized Gene expression of the three different cell lines was compared.
