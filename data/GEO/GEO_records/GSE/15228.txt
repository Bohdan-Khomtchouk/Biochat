TITLE
Gene expression differences between TAF4b-KO, Het and WT ovaries at 3 weeks of age

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The rapid decline of ovarian function in TAF4b-null mice begins in early postnatal life and follicle depletion is completed by sixteen weeks. To uncover differences in gene expression that may underlie accelerated ovarian aging, we compared genome-wide expression profiles of three week old, pre-pubescent TAF4b-null and wild-type ovaries.

DESIGN
Total RNA from 9, 3-week-old mice (3 wild-type, 3 TAF4b-heterozygous, 3 TAF4b-null) was obtained as described as above.  RNA quality was checked using a Bioanalyzer, and concentration determined using a Nanodrop. 300 ng of each RNA sample was used in the Affymetrix Whole-transcript Sense Target Labeling Assay (Rev 3) followed by hybridization to a GeneChipÂ® Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. 9 GeneChips were used to provide biological triplicates of each genotype. The Affymetrix Expression Console (v 1.1) was used to normalize data and determine signal intensity (RMA-Sketch).
