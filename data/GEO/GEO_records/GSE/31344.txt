TITLE
smRNA sequencing of queen and virgin queen of two ants: Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator

ORGANISM
Camponotus floridanus

SUMMARY
Deep sequencing of smRNA from queen and virgin queen of two Ants: Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator

DESIGN
Total RNA were isolated from virgin queens and queens by pulverizing the entire animal after removal of gut and poison glands in liquid N2 and then dissolving in TRIzol. Gel-purified 18-30 nts RNAs were used for sequencing.
