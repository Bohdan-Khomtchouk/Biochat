TITLE
In vivo epigenomic profiling of germ cells reveals germ cell molecular signatures [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The limited number of in vivo germ cells poses an impediment to genome-wide studies. Here, we applied a small-scale ChIP-Seq method on purified mouse fetal germ cells to generate genome-wide maps of four histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac and H2BK20ac), facilitating the identification of active and repressed cis-regulatory elements in germ cells in vivo. Comparison of active chromatin state between somatic, embryonic stem cells (ESC) and germ cells revealed promoters and enhancers needed for stem cell maintenance and germ cell development. The nuclear receptor Nr5a2 motif is enriched at a subset of cis-regulatory regions and we confirm its role in germ cell differentiation. Interestingly, germ cells have comparatively more H3K27me3-marked sites that are absent in ESC and other somatic cell types. These repressed regions are enriched for retrotransposons and MHC genes and this indicates that these loci are specifically silenced in germ cells. Together, our study provides the first genome-wide histone modification maps of in vivo germ cells and revealed the molecular chromatin signatures unique to germ cells.

DESIGN
Germ cells were FACS-purified from gonadal single cell suspension based on Pou5f1-GFP expression. ChIP-seq of Histone modification was done for two timepoints in this study: E11.5 (male/female), E13.5 (male). For E13.5 timepoint, two biological replicates were analyzed. In order to validate small scale ChIP-seq method limited number of ES cells were used to check consistency of ChIP-seq data.
