TITLE
Predictors of depression in breast cancer patients during and after radiotherapy: Role of chemotherapy and the inflammatory response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chemotherapy and the inflammatory response were associated with persistent depressive symptoms in breast cancer patients undergoing radiation. Treatments targeting inflammation before radiation may reduce depression post radiation therapy, especially in patients who have been treated previously with chemotherapy.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from the women (n=61) with Stage 0-III breast cancer treated with or without chemotherapy.
