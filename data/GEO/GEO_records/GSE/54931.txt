TITLE
Comparison of gene expression pattern between Wild-type and Setd2 knockout mESCs [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SETD2/HYPB has been known as a histone H3K36 specific methyltransferase. However, its roles in physiology such as development and cellular function remain unclear. In this study, using mESCs as cellular model, we show that Setd2 mainly regulates differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) towards primitive endoderm. This study aimed at exploring how did Setd2 regulate primitive endoderm. differentiation. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression controled by setd2, which is required for endoderm differentiation.

DESIGN
Wild type and Setd2 knockout mESCs were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays. We sought to obtain some deregulated genes, which were required for primitive endoderm differentiation. For comparison, three biological repeats of each were performed.
