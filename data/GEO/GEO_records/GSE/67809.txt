TITLE
Genome-wide chromatin binding of transcription factor E2F1 in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our computational approach identified E2F1 as a collaborative factor for EZH2 in transcriptional regulation of cancer-related genes. This experiment is designed to validate the interaction between E2F1 and EZH2 on the chromatin. By obtaining over 1 billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated the genome-wide localizations of E2F1 in CRPC cell line LNCaP-abl cells, and found that Indeed, these sites are enriched near the transcription start sites of EZH2-activated genes. Further analysis of the transcription factor motifs enriched at these peaks revealed the enrichement of androgen receptor motif, suggesting a co-activator role for EZH2 in concert with AR. Our work demonstrated a novel funtion of EZH2 in transcriptional activation by directly binding to the chromatin sites that cooperate with AR.
