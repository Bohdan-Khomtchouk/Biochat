TITLE
Gene expression analysis of the colon with and without DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) inhibition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression microarray to assess the effects of reduced DNA methylation on global gene expression. Gene expression profiles of colonic mucosa from mice with two different genotypes (Dnmt1LO/LO and Dnmt1LO/LO, TgVillacIGY) were compared. Dnmt1 expression is repressed only in the Dnmt1LO/LO, TgVillacIGY mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the colonic mucosa of four mouse, two biological replicates of each genotype in two technical relicates.  Their gene expression profiles were obtained using the Illumina Ref-8 whole-genome expression BeadChip (MouseRef-8 v2.0). We processed our data using the Lumi Id and ReMOAT annotation data base (MouseWG-6 corresponding to GPL6887).
