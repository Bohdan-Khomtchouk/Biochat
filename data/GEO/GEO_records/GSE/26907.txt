TITLE
Gene expression in a porcine preadipocyte cell line during differentiation

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
These data show time-course transcriptional profiling of porcine subcutaneous preadipocyte cell line (PSPA) during differentiation. In the early stage after stimulation for adipocyte differentiation, upregulation of many genes encoding proteins involved in regulation of cell proliferation and transcription was observed. The data presented here should form a valuable database for exploring candidate genes for fat-related QTLs in pigs, and also for analyses to clarify the physiological characteristics of development of porcine adipose tissues by comparison with the results in humans and mice.

DESIGN
The experiments consist of samples at seven different time points with an undifferentiated control. A set of the experiments is repeated three times.
