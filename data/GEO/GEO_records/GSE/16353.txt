TITLE
The profile of cellular and KSHV microRNAs in AIDS_KS biopsies (and normal skin control biopsies)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kaposi sarcoma is the most common cancer in AIDS patients and is typified by red skin lesions. The disease is caused by the KSHV virus (HHV8) and is recognisable by its distinctive red skin lesions. The lesions are KSHV-infected spindle cells, most commonly the lymphatic endothelial and blood vessel endothelial cells (LEC and BEC), plus surrounding stroma. Here we study the microRNA profiles of the KS lesion biopsies in AIDS patients (including both the cellular and KSHV microRNA).

DESIGN
There are  (n=3) normal skin biopsies from healthy patients and (n=5) AIDS-KS biopsies. Three of the AIDS-KS biopsies were technically replicated and 2 were single hybridisations.
