TITLE
Ovaries of PNA mice and controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the etiology of the hyperandrogenic phenotype of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a prenatally androgenized (PNA) mouse model was validated and used for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
2 groups of samples were tested, with each group containing 5 mouse ovaries. Over 39,000 transcripts were analyzed with the GeneChip® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array by using the selection criteria of fold change ≥1.5. Transcripts whose fold change < 1.5 are listed in the 'Normalized_Data' sheet of the 'DifferentialData.xlsx' file.
