TITLE
Expression of Sodalis glossinidius genes derived from self-cleared and infected Glossina palpalis gambiensis flies

ORGANISM
Sodalis glossinidius

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of Sodalis glossinidius derived from Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection self cleared and infected Glossina palpalis gambiensis. At 3 time points (3, 10 and 20 days) after infectived blood meal, flies were analysed by PCR to isolate the infected and infection self cleared flies. Then, infected and infection self cleared flies midgut were dissected for RNA extraction.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted at 3 time points (3, 10 and 20 days) from 24 samples including, for each time, 4 infected and 4 infection self-cleared flies.
