TITLE
Mapping of the GDI1 duplication at Xq28 in four unrelated XLMR patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a study to elucidate the genetic defects in patients with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) we performed X chromosome-specific BAC-array-CGH and identified a 0.33 Mb inherited recurrent copy number gain at Xq28 in affected males of four unrelated XLMR families. All aberrations segregate with the disease in the families and the carrier mothers show a nonrandom X-inactivation. Tiling Xq28 region-specific oligo-array revealed that all aberrations start at the same position (153.218 Mb) and end between 153.530 and 154.542 Mb. The copy number gain is complex in nature but always included 18 genes of which three, RPL10, ATP6AP1 and GDI1, are highly expressed in brain. From these, the copy number of GDI1 correlated with the severity of clinical features since it was duplicated in one family with nonsyndromic moderate MR, triplicated in males from two families with mild MR and additional features, while in a fourth family with a severe syndromic form of MR, it was present in four copies. Moreover, expression analysis revealed copy number-dependent increased mRNA levels in affected patients compared to control individuals. Interestingly, the breakpoint junction regions suggested a yet unknown recombination mechanism between two adjacent but different sets of low copy repeats.

DESIGN
For duplication mapping and exact copy number analysis in all four families, differentially-labeled patient versus male control DNA samples were hybridized onto a custom designed 4x44k oligo-array (Agilent Technologies) that covers the repeat-masked region 152.70 Mb to 153.65 Mb at tiling resolution.
