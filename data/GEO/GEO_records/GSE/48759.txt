TITLE
Remodeling of the enhancer landscape during macrophage activation is coupled to enhancer transcription

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent studies suggest a hierarchical model in which lineage-determining factors act in a collaborative manner to select and prime cell-specific enhancers, thereby enabling signal-dependent transcription factors to bind and function in a cell type-specific manner. Consistent with this model, TLR4 signaling primarily regulates macrophage gene expression through a pre-existing enhancer landscape. However, TLR4 signaling also induces priming of ~3000 enhancer-like regions de novo, enabling visualization of intermediates in enhancer selection and activation. Unexpectedly, we find that enhancer transcription precedes local mono- and di-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1/2). H3K4 methylation at de novo enhancers is primarily dependent on the histone methyltransferases Mll1, Mll2/4 and Mll3, and is significantly reduced by inhibition of RNA polymerase II elongation. Collectively, these findings suggest an essential role of enhancer transcription in H3K4me1/2 deposition at de novo enhancers that is independent of potential functions of the resulting eRNA transcripts.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq and Gro-Seq profiling was performed in thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages, PU.1-/- and PUER cells treated as indicated.
