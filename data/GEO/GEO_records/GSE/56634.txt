TITLE
Gene expression analysis of directly converted brown adipocytes (dBAs). [mouse]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparasion of each cell mRNA expression pattern Mouse fibroblasts were directly converted into brown adipocytes (dBAs) by transducing some transcription factors. To characterize the dBAs more in detail, RNA extracted from the mouse brown adipose tissue, mouse dBAs, and mouse iPS-derived brown adipocytes (iBAs) were subjected to DNA microarray analysis, and global gene expression profiles of the cells were compared.
