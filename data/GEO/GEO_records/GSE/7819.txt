TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in SVG-A glial cells and SVGR2 glial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SVGR2 cells are glial cells which are derived from SVG-A cells. They were created by subjecting SVG-A cells to multiple rounds of lytic infection by the human polyomavirus JCV. SVGR2 cells are the cells that survived this process and are resistant to JCV infection. This experiment was designed to identify gene expression differences that may be responsible for SVGR2 resistance to JCV. Keywords: Cell type

DESIGN
SVG-A and SVGR2 cells are transformed cell lines. To eliminate gene expression differences that may have occurred due to genetic instability of these cell lines three subclones of each of the cell lines were created and used as a triplicate in the comparison. Total RNA was extracted from cells that had been left at 100% confluency for one day using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. cDNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix Human GeneChips U133A or U133B according to Affymetrix gudielines.
