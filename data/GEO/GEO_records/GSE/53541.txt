TITLE
Zrf1 is required to establish and maintain neural progenitor identity (mRNA array)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our work aims  to characterize the role of Zrf1 in the generation and maintenance of neural progenitor cells (NPCs)

DESIGN
Gene expression profile of shCtrl and shZrf1 cells during generation of RGC-like NPC from ESC at day 6 of neural induction. Cells were grown according to this protocol: Bibel et al, Nat Prot., 2007

PLATFORM
GPL13912 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
