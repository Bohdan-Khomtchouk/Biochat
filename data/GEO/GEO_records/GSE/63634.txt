TITLE
Epigenomic landscape during organ formation in human early embryos

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we present the whole genome ChIP-Seq analyses of a wide variety of histone marks, H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 in the brain, heart, and liver, along with the RNA-seq data of these organs of early human embryos 12 weeks after gestation.

DESIGN
In total, brain, heart, and liver of early human post-implantation embryos were used, and four histone modifications were detected, including H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. Also, the transcriptomes of these three organs were analyzed.
