TITLE
C57Bl/6N Mice on High Fat Diet Display Reduced Intestinal and Hepatic Cholesterol Levels despite a Plasma Hypercholesterolemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background Small intestine and liver greatly contribute to whole body lipid, cholesterol and phospholipid metabolism but to which extent cholesterol and phospholipid handling in these tissues is affected by high fat Western-style obesogenic diets remains to be defined. We therefore quantified cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations in intestine and liver and determined fecal neutral sterol and bile acid excretion in C57Bl/6N mice fed for 12 weeks either a cholesterol-free high carbohydrate control diet or a high fat diet containing 0.03 % (w/w) cholesterol. To identify underlying mechanisms of dietary adaptation in intestine and liver, changes in gene expression were assessed by microarray and qPCR profiling, respectively. Results Animals on high fat diet showed increased plasma cholesterol levels, associated with the higher dietary cholesterol supply, yet, significantly reduced cholesterol levels were found in intestine and liver. Transcript profiling revealed evidence that expression of numerous genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake via LDL, but also in phospholipid metabolism, underwent compensatory regulations in both tissues. Alterations in glycerophospholipid metabolism were confirmed at the metabolite level by phospolipid profiling via mass spectrometry. Conclusions Our findings suggest that intestine and liver react to a high dietary fat intake by an activation of de novo cholesterol synthesis and other cholesterol-saving mechanisms, as well as with major changes in phospholipid metabolism, to accommodate to the fat load.

DESIGN
The proximal or distal part of the intestine of mice fed either a control or a high fat diet were analyzed. 5 replicates each.
