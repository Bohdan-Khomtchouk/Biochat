TITLE
The diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana grown at [normal and elevated CO2] x [normal and elevated light]

ORGANISM
Thalassiosira pseudonana

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana at normal and elevlated CO2 levels and at normal and elevated light levels. Common reference total RNA (Agilent Quick-Amp Cy3-labeled) was used in all arrays as an internal standard.

DESIGN
Triplicate batch cultures grown at normal (~400ppm) and elevated (~800ppm) CO2 levels, both at i) normal or ii) elevated light levels. Samples were taken during a) exponential and b) stationary growth during all growth experiments. Result: 48 total transcriptomic measurements: [3 parallel replicates] x [400ppm, 800ppm] x [normal light, high light] x [exponential, stationary] x [2 serial replicates]
