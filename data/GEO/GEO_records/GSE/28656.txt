TITLE
Genes regulated by Nkx2-3 in human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nkx2-3 is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Nkx2-3 is expressed in microvascular endothelial cells and the muscuularis mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract. Human intestinal microvascular cells (HIMEC) are actively involved in the pathogenesis of IBD and IBD-associated microvascular dysfunction. To understand the cellular function of Nkx2-3 and its potential role underlying IBD pathogenesis, we investigated the genes regulated by Nkx2-3 in HIMEC usin cDNA microarray.

DESIGN
2 HIMEC lines (21B and 432) are used in thi study. For each HIMEC lines, either si-Nkx2-3 or contro vector was transfected 2 times to get biological replicates.
