TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of APC knockdown in proliferating primary myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
APC is a key regulator of canonical Wnt signalling since it participates to beta-catenin targeting to proteasomal degradation when the pathway is inactive. Moreover, independently of Wnt signaling, APC regulates several cellular functions such as mycrotubule dynamics, chromosome segregation, cell adhesion. Although APC has been widely studied for its implication in initation and progression of several cancers, its role in satellite cells (skeletal muscle stem cells) has never been investigated. Here we used microarrays and to clarify APC functions and we identified several pathways and cellular processes to be affected following APC silencing.

DESIGN
We cultured satellite cells-derived primary myoblasts in proliferating conditions and we transfected them either by a siRNA targeting APC or by a control siRNA. 48 hours after transfection, cells were processed for RNA extraction.
