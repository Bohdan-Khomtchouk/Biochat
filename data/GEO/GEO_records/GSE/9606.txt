TITLE
Lungs of ferrets infected with either an H3N2 or H5N1 subtype of influenza A virus.

ORGANISM
Mustela putorius furo

SUMMARY
A global genomics approach was used to identify patterns of immune dysregulation during H5N1 influenza virus infection as the host response, in particular hyperchemokinemia, is thought to contribute to the extreme pathology associated with this disease. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Ferrets were inoculated intranasally with 10(6) EID50 of either A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) or A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2).  At 2, 4 and 6 days post-infection (DPI), ferrets were euthanized and lung tissue was excised for RNA purification and subsequent gene expression analysis.
