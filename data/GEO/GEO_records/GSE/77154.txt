TITLE
IFNγ influences epithelial anti-viral responses via histone methylation of the RIG-I promoter

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This in-vitro study suggests the inflammatory environment of naive epithelial cells can induce epigenetic modulation of innate immune responses at the level of histone methylation and potentially lead to long-term impacts on anti-viral immunity.

DESIGN
Investigate the epigenetic effects of cytokine priming on innate immune response genes in the airways epithelium. AALEB cells were treated with interferon-gamma (IFNγ), infected with RSV, both, or neither. Two replicates each.
