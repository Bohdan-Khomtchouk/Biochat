TITLE
Intestinal epithelial cells transfected with Ras and treated with TGF-beta-1

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
RIE (rat intestinal epithelial) cells treated with 2 ng/ml of TGF-beta-1 for 1 hr were compared to control cells. The experiment was performed under identical conditions four times: RIE vs RIE - TGF-beta #1-#4. RIE-Ras cells were established by stable transfection of the parental cells with pSV2-H-Ras(12V) which contain human sequences encoding the constitutively active H-Ras(12V) protein. RIE-Ras cells treated with 2 ng/ml of TGF-beta-1 for 1 hr were compared to control cells. The experiment was performed four times under identical conditions (RIE-Ras vs RIE-RAS TGF-beta #1-#4). Keywords = TGF-beta Keywords = rat Keywords = intestinal epithelial cells Keywords: parallel sample
