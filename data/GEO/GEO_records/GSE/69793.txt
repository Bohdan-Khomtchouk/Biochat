TITLE
Exposure to different nickel nanoparticles and nickel salt: gene expression profile in Enchytraeus crypticus

ORGANISM
Enchytraeus crypticus

SUMMARY
The effect of nanomaterials (NMs) is less understood in light of the implemented and existing methodologies for regular chemicals. To understand the mode of action of NMs is one of the alternatives to improve predictions and environmental risk assessment (ERA). In the present work the high-throughput gene expression tool (4x44K microarray for Enchytraeus crypticus) was used to investigate the mechanisms activated by Ni exposure. Ni nanoparticles (Ni-NPs) were investigated together with Ni-salt (NiNO3). Testing was done based on reproduction effect concentrations (EC20, EC50) using 3 and 7 days exposure periods.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile of Enchytraeus crypticus was analysed after 3 and 7 days of exposure to the EC20 and EC50 (effect concentrations on reproduction) of nickel nanoparticles (Ni-NPs) and nickel salt (NiNO3) in LUFA 2.2 soil. Three biological replicates per test treatment and control (un-spiked LUFA soil) were used.
