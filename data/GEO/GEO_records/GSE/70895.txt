TITLE
RNAseq from mouse hippcampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The RNA binding protein T-STAR controls alternative splicing of important synaptic proteins, and of its paralog SLM1, but its overall functions or physiological importance are unknown. These RNAseq analyses use dissected material from wild type and T-STAR knock out mice. The aim was to identify gene expression changes in the absence of T-STAR protein.

DESIGN
RNAseq reads were taken from wild type mice and mice with homozygous deletions of the Khdrbs3 gene Wild type Ammon's Horn, homozygote Khdrbs3 Ammon's Horn, wild type Dentate Gyrus.
