TITLE
CbGRiTS: Cerebellar Gene Regulation in Time and Space

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This dataset is populated with transcriptome data across embryonic and postnatal development from two standard mouse strains, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. Users can evaluate expression profiles across cerebellar development in a deep time series.

DESIGN
We performed microarray analysis on whole cerebellar tissues from two inbred strains of mouse [C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2)] at 24-hour intervals in embryonic development from embryonic day 12 (E12) to postnatal day 0 (P0), and at 3-day intervals from P0 to P9 in the postnatal period and most time point samples include 3 biological replicates each for both strains.
