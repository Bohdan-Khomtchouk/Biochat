TITLE
Expression data from human keratinocyte and PBMC-derived iPS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology allows for the generation of patient-specific pluripotent stem cells, from somatic cell sources, thereby providing a novel cell therapy platform for severe degenerative diseases. One of the key issues for clinical-grade iPSC derivation is the accessibility of donor cells used for reprogramming and subsequent feasiblity of reprogramming into a pluripotent state. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression profiles from blood cells. The use of blood cells allows for minimally invasive tissue procurement under GMP conditions and rapid cellular reprogramming, mobilized HPCs and unmobilized PBMCs would be ideal somatic cell sources for clinical-grade iPSC derivation.

DESIGN
We examined the feasibility of reprogramming mobilized GMP-grade hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and mononuclear myeloid cells and tested the pluripotency of derived iPS clones.
