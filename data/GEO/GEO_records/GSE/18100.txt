TITLE
Distribution of PcG, TrxG, RNA Pol II and associated histone marks in ML-DmBG3-c2 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
PcG and TrxG are important epigenetic regulators of genome expression. Here we have determined genomic distributions of PC, E(Z), H3K27me3, TRX, ASH1, RNA Pol II, H3K4me3, H3K27ac in cultured Drosophila ML-DmBG3-c2 cells by hybridization of ChIP products with tiling microarrays.
