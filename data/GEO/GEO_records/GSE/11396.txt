ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A comparative study of gene expression in mice which carry different truncations or mutations of the growth hormone receptor Keywords: genotype comparison

DESIGN
Growth hormone receptor was truncated at amino acid 569, amino acid 391, mutated within the Box1 region, or removed altogether (KO) and transgenic mice were created.  At 4 months of age male mice were starved overnight and sacrificed.
