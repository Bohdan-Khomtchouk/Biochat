TITLE
Effects of mating on gene expression profiles of mature ant queens

ORGANISM
Cardiocondyla obscurior

SUMMARY
Will be added/updated once the manuscript is finalized.

DESIGN
Cardiocondyla obscurior queens. Three treatments: virgin queens, queens mated by real males, queens sham-mated (by sterile males). Queens collected 1 week and 8 week after mating. seven loops for queens collected 1 week after mating; nine loops for queens collected 8 weeks after mating. Five direct comparisons (with dye-swaps... so 10 arrays) were done of between 1 week and 8 week samples of queens mated by real males. Each sample is RNA from two queens (from different colonies). Samples were hybridized against Solenopsis invicta microarrays (signal was detectable for most clones!)
