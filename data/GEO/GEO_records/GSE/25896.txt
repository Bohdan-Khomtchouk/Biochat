TITLE
Paternally-induced transgenerational environmental reprogramming of metabolic gene expression in mammals (Affymetrix)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epigenetic information can be inherited through the mammalian germline, and represents a plausible transgenerational carrier of environmental information. To test whether transgenerational inheritance of environmental information occurs in mammals, we carried out an expression profiling screen for genes in mice that responded to paternal diet. Characterising the change in RNA expression in sperm in response to different paternal diets.

DESIGN
Examination of the effect of different diets, control diet, low-protein diet and caloric-restriction diet, on the RNA expression in the sperm. 8 samples: 3 are control diets and 2 are low protein diets 1 caloric restriction diet, and 2 samples from Epidydimal tissue.
