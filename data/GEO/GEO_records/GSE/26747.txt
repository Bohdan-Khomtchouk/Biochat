TITLE
Gene expression analysis of dendritic cells from normal or tumor sections of human prostates

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumors cause the induction or repression of many genes associated with inflammation. To investigate the up and down regulation of genes associated with immune stimulation or immune tolerance RNA was isolated from dendritic cells from normal or tumor bearing prostate for microarray analysis. Using normal or tumorogenic sections of human prostates as determined by Pathology experts (UMD). Keywords: Comparative gene expression, prostate cancer, dendritic cells

DESIGN
Prostatic dendritic cells were isolated from 5 patients for comparison of gene expression.
