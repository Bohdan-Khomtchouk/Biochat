TITLE
The impact of anaerobiosis on expression of the iron-responsive Fur and RyhB Regulons [expression microarray]

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
As descirbed in the manuscript " The impact of anaerobiosis on expression of the iron-responsive Fur and RyhB Regulons " we profiled the gene expression of E. coli K12 during aerobic or anaerobic growth and in the presence or absence of the transcription factor Fur and/or the small RNA RyhB.

DESIGN
We performed tiling microarray analyses to reveal the expression profiles of wild-type E. coli K12 or E. coli K12 lacking the transcription factor Fur and/or the small RNA RyhB during aerobic or ananerobic growth. Please note that the *PAIR.pair files contain the complete normalized data ('PM' column; 389,307 data rows including controls) while the sample data tables contain 378,238 rows (without control values)
