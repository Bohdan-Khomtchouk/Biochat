TITLE
Frequent and Transient Acquisition of Pluripotency During Somatic Cell Trans-Differentiation with iPSCs Reprogramming Factors (ATAC-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent reports have proposed a new paradigm for obtaining mature somatic cell types from fibroblasts without going through a pluripotent state, by briefly expressing canonical iPSC reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (abbreviated as OSKM), in cells expanded in lineage differentiation promoting conditions. Here we apply genetic lineage tracing for endogenous Nanog, Oct4 and X chromosome reactivation during OSKM induced trans-differentiation, as these molecular events mark final stages for acquisition of induced pluripotency. Remarkably, the vast majority of reprogrammed cardiomyocytes or neural stem cells derived from mouse fibroblasts via OSKM mediated trans-differentiation were attained after transient acquisition of pluripotency, and followed by rapid differentiation. Our findings underscore a molecular and functional coupling between inducing pluripotency and obtaining “trans-differentiated” somatic cells via OSKM induction, and have implications on defining molecular trajectories assumed during different cell reprogramming methods.

DESIGN
poly RNA-Seq and Chromatin accesibility (ATAC-seq) were measured during conversion of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to neural stem cells using OSKM trans-differentiation method, as well as in mouse emrbyonic fibroblasts, iPSCs and mouse ESCs.
