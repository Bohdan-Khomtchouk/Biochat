TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing analyses of WT and DDX46+/- macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DDX46 is identified to be required at the early step of pre-spliceosome assembly,but whether DDX46 could regulate antiviral transcripts isoform splicing in the nucleus remain elusive.

DESIGN
Transcriptome sequencing analyses of  WT and DDX46+/- macrophages from mouse peritoneal macrophages infected with VSV for 8 h.

PLATFORM
