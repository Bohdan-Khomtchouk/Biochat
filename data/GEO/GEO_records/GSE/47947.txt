TITLE
Whole genome McrBC-chip on DNA methylation of diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum

ORGANISM
Phaeodactylum tricornutum

SUMMARY
Extensive gene methylation correlated strongly with transcriptional silencing and differential expression under specific conditions. DNA methylation and its role in gene regulation is conserved in stramenopile.

DESIGN
Methylome of the whole genome of diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum.
