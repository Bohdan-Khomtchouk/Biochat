TITLE
DNA damage-induced differentiation of NSC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine ES-derived neural stem cells (NSC) were not irradiated (ctrl) or irradiated with 10Gy and cultured for 7 days (irr). The goal was to study the gene expression changes in NSC at d7 after irradiation.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 4 ctrl and 4 irr samples (biological quadruplicates).
