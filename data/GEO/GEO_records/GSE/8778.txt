TITLE
Genetic alteration in recurrent melanoma - part 2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Studying a unique case of metastatic melanoma, we observed that cell lines derived from metachronous metastases arising over a decade retained a central core of genetic stability in spite of divergent phenotypes. In the present study we expanded our previous observations comparing these autologous cell lines of clonal derivation with heterologous ones and correlated array Comparative Genomic Hybridization with gene expression profiling to determine their relative contribution to the dynamics of disease progression. aCGH and gene expression profiling were performed on autologous cell lines and heterologous melanoma cell lines originated from other patients. A striking correlation existed between total extent of genetic imbalances, global transcriptional patterns and cellular phenotypes; they did not follow a strict temporal progression but stemmed independently at various time points from a central core of genetic stability best explained according to the cancer stem cell hypothesis; although their contribution was intertwined, genomic imbalances detectable by aCGH contributed only 25% of the transcriptional traits determining autologous tumors distinctiveness. Our study provides important insights about the dynamics of cancer progression and supports the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies against stable genetic factors determining the individuality of each patientâ€™s disease that are maintained throughout the end stage of disease. Keywords: genetic modification design

DESIGN
We report the analysis of gene expression profiling of melanoma cell lines obtained from metastsases of a long term survivor melanoma patient and other melanoma cell lines. RNA was amplified and hybridized to 17.5K cDNA arrays.
