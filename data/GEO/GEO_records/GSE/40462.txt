TITLE
Expression data from H226 squamous cell carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To define the contribution of p53 versus DNp63a to gene expression control, we performed a series of microarray assays for cells where p53 was activated using Nutlin-3 or DNp63a was knocked down using a stably transduced tetracycline inducible shRNA. We determined that p53 transcriptionally activates and DNp63a transcriptionally represses a non-overlapping subset of genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA from H226 cells harvested using Tri reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for gene expression analysis on Affymetrix HuGene 1.0 ST arrays following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Differential gene expression was determined with Partek software using one-way ANOVA.
