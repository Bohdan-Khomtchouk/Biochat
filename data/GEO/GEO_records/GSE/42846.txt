TITLE
Marker gene discovery for Staphylococcus epidermidis infection in zebrafish embryos (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We use the zebrafish embryo model to study the innate immune response against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Therefore, we injected S. epidermidis  into the yolk at 2 hpf and took samples at 5 days post injection.

DESIGN
This deep sequence study was designed to determine the gene expression profile by  Staphylococcus epidermidis infection. RNA was isolated from embryos at 5 days post injection. Wildtypes zebrafish embryos were micro-injected into the yolk (2hpf) with 20 CFU of S. epidermdis O-47 mCherry bacteria suspended in PVP (Polyvinylpyrrolidone), or Non-injected as a control. After injections embryos were transferred into fresh egg water and incubated at 28Â°C. At 5 days post injection 100-200 embryos per group were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent.
