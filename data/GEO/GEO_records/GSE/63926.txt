TITLE
Gene expression changes in Suillus luteus- Pinus sylvestris ectomycorrhizal roots compared to Suillus luteus free-living mycelium

ORGANISM
Suillus luteus

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from Suillus luteus ectomycorrhizal roots compared to free-living mycelium . Mycorrhizal roots were harvested after 40 days, pooled and used for RNA extraction. Reads of 2X100bp were generated and aligned to Suillus luteus ( ) using CLC Genomics Workbench 6.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Suillus luteus ectomycorrhizal roots and free-living mycelium were generated by paired-end (2x100bp) Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing. Two biological replicates were sequenced for mycorrhizal and mycelium samples.
