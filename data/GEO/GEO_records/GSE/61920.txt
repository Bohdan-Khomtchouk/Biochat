TITLE
Protein−DNA binding in the absence of specific base-pair recognition

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Until now, it has been reasonably assumed that specific base-pair recognition is the only mechanism controlling the specificity of transcription factor (TF)−DNA binding. Contrary to this assumption, here we show that nonspecific DNA sequences possessing certain repeat symmetries, when present outside of specific TF binding sites (TFBSs), statistically control TF−DNA binding preferences. We used high-throughput protein−DNA binding assays to measure the binding levels and free energies of binding for several human TFs to tens of thousands of short DNA sequences with varying re- peat symmetries. Based on statistical mechanics modeling, we iden- tify a new protein−DNA binding mechanism induced by DNA se- quence symmetry in the absence of specific base-pair recognition, and experimentally demonstrate that this mechanism indeed gov- erns protein−DNA binding preferences.
