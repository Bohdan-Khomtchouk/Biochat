TITLE
KYSE170 transfected with ncRNA or miR-210

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA species, some of which are playing important roles in malignancies. However, roles of miR-210 in cancer have yet to be unknown and controversial. Here, we found the expression level of miR-210 is downregulated in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and its cell lines. Additionally, we demonstrate that miR-210 inhibits cancer cell survival and proliferation through upregulation of cell death and induction of cell cycle arrest at G1/G0 and G2/M phases. However, candidate target mRNAs of miR-210 and the mechanism behind observed phenomena is uncertain. Then, we performed comprehensive gene expression analysis to identify candidate target mRNAs and understand their mechanisms.

DESIGN
KYSE-170 cells were transfected with oligoribonucleotides for miR-210 or ncRNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) using Hiperfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the providerâ€™s protocol for overexpression. Total RNA was extracted by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method and was labeled and prepared for hybridization to human Oligo chip 25k (Toray, Kamakura, Japan) using standard methods.
