Analysis of the group A Streptococcus CcpA Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Streptococcus sp. 'group A'

SUMMARY
This study evaluate how catabolite control protein A (CcpA) inactivation affected gene transcript levels in the group A Streptococcus serotype M1 strain MGAS5005 during growth in standard laboratory medium. Keywords: transcriptome analysis

DESIGN
4 replicates of strain MGAS5005 and delta_cppA were grown in THY to early and late logarithmic growth phases.  The transcriptomes of each samples were then analyzed.
