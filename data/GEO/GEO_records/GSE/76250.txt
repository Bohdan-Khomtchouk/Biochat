TITLE
Comprehensive transcriptome profiling reveals multigene signatures in triple negative breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To develop and validate novel multigene signatures to facilitate individualized treatment of TNBC patients By integrating expression profiles of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).

DESIGN
We analysed 165 TNBC samples and 33 paired normal breast tissues using transcriptome microarrays. Tumor-specific mRNAs and lncRNAs were identified and correlated with patientsâ€™ recurrence-free survival (RFS). Using Cox regression model, we built two multigene signatures incorporating mRNAs and lncRNAs. The prognostic and predictive accuracy of the signatures were tested in a training set of 165 TNBC patients and validated in another 101 TNBC patients.
