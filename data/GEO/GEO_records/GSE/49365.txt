TITLE
Genome-wide acetylated histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac) in HDAC3-depleted liver rescued with deacectylase-dead HDAC3 mutants

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that several deacetylase-dead HDAC3 mutants were able to rescue the metabolic phenotype of HDAC3-depleted livers. Here we profile the histone acetylation in the presence of different HDAC3 mutants in mouse liver.

DESIGN
Deacetylase-dead HDAC3 mutants, including HAHA, KA, YF and HEBI, were introduced into HDAC3-depleted (Cre) mouse livers by virus along with wild-type (WT) HDAC3 as a control. Livers were harvested at 5 pm (ZT 10) and subjected to ChIP with anti-H3K9ac antibodies followed by deep sequencing.
