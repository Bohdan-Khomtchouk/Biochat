TITLE
Gene expression of Listeria monocytogenes-infected HepG2  hepatocellular carcinoma in the presense of IL-17Aand IL-22

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IL-17A and IL-22 induced several inflammation-induced genes and anti-microbial molecules including Pla2g2a and Lcn2 on HepG2 cells when the cells were treated with the cytokines before Listeria monocytogenes infection.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were treated with 50 ng/ml IL-17A and 10 ng/ml IL-22 before L. monocytogenes in vitro infection at MOI 10. Reference cells were not treated with the cytokines before the infection. Two independent experiments were carried out.
