TITLE
Expression data from MTF mutant roots

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Mutation of MTF in Arabidopsis increases Agrobacterium-mediated transformation susceptibility. Being a putative transcription factor, different genes controlling transformation may be regulated by MTF. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and to identify genes that play a role in transformation.

DESIGN
Root samples from mutants MTF1-1 and MTF1-4, along with the wild-type, Col0, were collected after 12 days of growth in B5 liquid medium. RNA was extracted from three biological replicates, with 20 plants in each replicate, and used for hybridization to Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.
