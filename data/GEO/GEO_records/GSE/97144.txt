TITLE
Comparative analyses of DMRs

ORGANISM
Populus nigra x (Populus deltoids x Populus nigra)

SUMMARY
We clarify the role of the DNA methylation by using microarrays in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of Populus Ã— euramericana clones dormant or active and submitted to contrasted environments. This work aimed at characterizing: (i) the range of genetic and environmental variations of global DNA methylation and its correlation with biomass production, (ii) mitotically-conserved DMRs in winter-dormant SAM and (iii) common DMRs with their corresponding genes network and their biological role in phenotypic plasticity and stress memory toward natural environment conditions.

DESIGN
For each conditions one sample was used
