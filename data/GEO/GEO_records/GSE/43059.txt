TITLE
Role of Jmjd2b and Jmjd2c in mESCs identity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarray to determine the changes in gene expression profile after KD of Jmjd2b and Jmjd2c compared to Anti-GFP KD from mES cells

DESIGN
Mouse ES cells were infected with AntiGFP, Jmjd2b and Jmjd2c shRNAs lentivirus, puromycin selected, passage them 2-3 times, collected for RNA isolation and gene expression
