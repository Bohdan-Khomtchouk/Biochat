TITLE
Fat Treg cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparisons of global gene-expression profiles revealed a greater distinction between CD4+ Treg cells and CD4+ conventional (Tconv) T cells  residing in abdominal (epidydimal) fat versus in more standard locations such as the spleen, thymus and LN. Keywords: Cell population comparison

DESIGN
All gene expression profiles were obtained from highly purified T cell populations sorted by flow cytometry. To reduce variability, cells from multiple mice were pooled for sorting, and three replicates were generated for all groups. RNA from 3-5 x 104 cells was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix M430v2 microarrays. Raw data were preprocessed with the RMA algorithm in GenePattern, and averaged expression values were used for analysis.
