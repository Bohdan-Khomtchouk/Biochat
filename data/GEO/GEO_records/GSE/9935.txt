TITLE
Benign Uncultured CD133+ vs CD133-

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
6 benign TURP samples taken directly from patients were subjected to collagen digestion overnight. Epithelial cells isolated were adhered to collagen for 15 minutes. Adherent cells were passed through a magnetic bead column and cells positive for CD133 antibody were double selected. RNA was extracted from CD133+ and CD133- cells from each patient and amplified using the RiboAmp HS RNA amplification system. CD133+ (Cy5) and CD133- (Cy5) cDNA was hybridised to 30K cDNA array (CRUK facility) using the Invitrogen post labelling system. In each case that RNA was co-hybridised to a human pooled universal reference cDNA (Cy3). Keywords: repeat sample

DESIGN
12 samples  - All samples compared to universal reference RNA
