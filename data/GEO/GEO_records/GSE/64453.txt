TITLE
Transformation of enriched mammary cell populations with Polyoma Middle T Antigen influences tumor subtype and metastatic potential

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Breast cancer is a multifaceted disease, exhibiting significant molecular, histological, and pathological diversity. Factors that impact this heterogeneity are poorly understood; however, transformation of distinct normal cell populations of the breast may generate different tumor phenotypes. Our previous study demonstrates that the polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyMT) oncogene can establish diverse tumor subtypes when broadly expressed within mouse mammary epithelial cells. Herein, we assess the molecular, histological, and metastatic outcomes from distinct mammary cell populations transformed with PyMT. By combining several methodologies, including lentiviral infection, cell sorting, and transplantation, we have characterized tumors arising from enriched populations of mammary epithelial cells. We have found that expression of PyMT within different cell populations influences tumor histology, molecular subtype, and metastatic potential.

DESIGN
32 samples, 1 from each of 32 mouse mammary tumors arising from transplanted mouse mamary epithelial cells (MMECs) transduced with PyMT-expressing  lentivirus. MMECs were sorted into four different types prior to transplant: luminal CD133+ (8 samples), luminal CD133- (11 samples), stem (6 samples), and  basal (7 samples). The background for the cell donor and transplant recipients mice was FVB/NJ obtained from Jackson Laboratories.
