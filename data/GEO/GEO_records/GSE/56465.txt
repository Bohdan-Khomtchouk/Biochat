TITLE
Comparison of haploid and diploid clones of KBM7 cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The series were performed to study the changes in gene expression upon diploidization of KBM7 cancer (CML) cell line. The line can exist either as a clone with 24 chromosomes (nearly haploid) or with 48 chromosomes (nearly diploid). Gene expression patterns are largely ploidy-independent, as suggested by this experiment

DESIGN
Single cell derived clones of KBM7 cell line were grown. Included 7 haploid and 10 diploid clones, each with 2 independent total RNA extraction/microarray run. Also included peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples for comparison purposes.
