TITLE
AHX and AOH effect on Oryza sativa

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Fairy rings are zones of stimulated grass growth by the interaction between the fungi and the plant. In the previous research, we reported the identification of the “fairy”, 2-azahypoxanthine (AHX), produced by the fairy ring-forming fungus and the mechanism of its growth-promoting activity using DNA microarray. We discovered AOH, a common metabolite of AHX in plants.  We investigate expression profiling of rice seedlings treated with AHX or AOH for the mechanism of their growth-promoting activity.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, control vs. AHX-treated rice (50 and 200 mM) and AOH-treated rice (50 and 200 mM).

PLATFORM
GPL6864 Agilent-015241 Rice Gene Expression 4x44K Microarray (Feature Number version)
