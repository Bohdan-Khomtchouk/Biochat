TITLE
Chip-Seq analysis of HAUSP and HIF-1alpha

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We reported that HAUSP (USP7) deubiquitinase interacts with and deubiquitinates HIF-1Î± to increase  its stability and functions. HAUSP, HIF-1alpha and CBP could form a complex to regulate histone modification and gene transcription

DESIGN
To identify the overlapping set of genes bound by HAUSP and HIF-1alpha, (1) H1299 and MDA-MB 231 cells were used for Chip-seq analysis of HAUSP, (2) H1299 cells lysate was used for Chip-seq analys of HIF-1alpha, and (3) H1299 cell as an input
