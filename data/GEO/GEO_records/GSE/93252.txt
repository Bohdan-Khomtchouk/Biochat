TITLE
RNA Sequencing Reveals Regulation of Marginal Zone B-Cell Differentiation by MicroRNA-146a

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Splenocytes were FACS-sorted from Wild-type and Mir146a-/- mice to isolate specific B-cell developmental stages. Utilizing high-throughput sequencing, we comparatively analyzed developmental stage-specific splenic B cell transcriptomes, including Transitional-1 (T1), Transitional-2 (T2), Marginal zone (MZ) and Follicular (FO) in both Wild-type and Mir146a-/- B cells. Two replicates of each developmental stage were submitted for high-throughput sequencing.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic profiles of primary B cell developmental subsets (T1, T2 MZ, FO) from Wild-type and Mir146a-/- mice in duplicate.
