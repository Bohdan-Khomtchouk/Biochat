TITLE
BMP-2-responsive genes in mouse periodontal ligament-derived PDL-L2 cells with and without endoglin knockdown

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was designed to identify endoglin (ENG)-dependent BMP2-responsive genes in the mouse fibroblastic cell line PDL-L2.

DESIGN
PDL-L2 cells were treated with an siRNA for endoglin (siENG) or a control siRNA (siCont). After 48hr, the cells were exposed to recombinant human BMP-2 (250 ng/ml) or vehicle and cultured for 12 hr.
