TITLE
Transcriptonal profile of cord lining epithelial cells after phage integrase mediated integration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The two obstacles that impede a wider application of genetically modified cells expressing therapeutic transgenes for ex vivo gene therapy are the immune mediated rejection of the transplanted cells, combined with their potential to cause iatrogenic oncogenesis. In this study we describe a new cellular vehicle for this form of therapy, termed the cord lining epithelial cell (CLEC). CLECs are derived from the human amnion and incorporate many of the immunoregulatory functions associated with the fetal/maternal interface. We show that CLECs can be safely transfected by phage Ï†C31 integrase to accomplish site-specific integration of a therapeutic human transgene. We also show that transplanted CLECs are not oncogenic in vivo and can be maintained in immunocompetent mice where acute xeno-rejection rapidly destroys other human cell types. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of CLECs for ex vivo gene therapy by delivering human coagulation factor 8 to mice with Hemophilia A.

DESIGN
The transcriptome datasets of human umbilical cord lining epithelial cells were compared before(CLEC) and 1 month after(CLEC-GFP) phage integrase mediated integration of EGFP cDNA into the genome. Transcriptome datasets were generated in singles and genes differentiallty expressed in cells before and after phage integrase treatment were analysed. Genes differentially expressed by at least 2 fold as compared to untreated CLEC were considered to be significantly dysregulated. List of genes with significant dysregulation were used for further analysis and used to determine if genomic integration events had resulted in any potential geno-toxicity.
