TITLE
ntr-Transcriptomic study of a thioredoxin reductase knock-out mutant.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs04-02_ntr - ntr - Thioredoxins are small redox proteins implicated in crucial pathways of cell life. They are reduced by a conserved flavoprotein named NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase (NTR). In order to give an insight into the functions of the NTR/thioredoxin pathway in Arabidopsis, we have used a reverse genetic approch. Both NTR genes (NTRA and NTRB) have been inactivated in the double ntra ntrb mutant. T-DNA lines have been provided by the SALK library. Surprisingly, this mutant shows a limited phenotype suggested that some additional redox pathways are involved in compensating the inactivation of the NTR/thioredoxin pathway. In order to isolate compensatory genes that would be transcriptionally induced in the ntra ntrb mutant, we have performed this CATMA project.  - Comparison of the transcript profile of the ntra ntrb knock-out mutant vs Col-0 wild-type ecotype. Seeds of the wild-type Col-0 ecotype and of the ntra ntrb homozygote double mutant were sowed in soil. Three replicates of lines were made (Col-0 1, 2 and 3 ntra ntrb 1, 2 and 3) : plants were put at different places of the greenhouse and grown at different times. Germination was synchronized by 4 days at 4degreeC and plants were grown during 17 days, until they reached a 6 rosette leaves stage. Entire plants (30 plants per sample) were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80degreeC until extraction. Keywords: gene knock out,wt vs mutant comparison
