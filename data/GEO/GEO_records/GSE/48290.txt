TITLE
Gene expression profile changes during blastocysts hatching of embryos produced from parthenogenesis and in vivo

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Comparative transcriptomic analyses among in vivo (IVV) XB, in vivo (IVV) HB, parthenogenetic activation (PA) XB, and parthenogenetic activation (PA) HB were performed following a reference design.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples extracted from pools of 5 embryos were amplified, labelled with Cy5 dye and hybridized with Cy3 dye labelled reference RNA pool on EMPV1 [GPL14925] microarray following a reference design. Three biological replicates from each group were included in the comparative microarray analysis.
