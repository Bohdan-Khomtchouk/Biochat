TITLE
RecG Directs DNA Synthesis During Double-Strand Break Repair [Chromosomal marker frequency analysis]

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
In the bacterium Escherichia coli, RecG directs DNA synthesis during the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination.

DESIGN
Chromosomal marker frequency analysis (MFA) following induction of a DSB in the absence and presence of RecG
