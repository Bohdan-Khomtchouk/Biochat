TITLE
Identification of the molecular targets of miR-185 in DN3 stage thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
T cell-specific overexpression of miR-185 caused a developmental block at DN3 stage of thymopoiesis.

DESIGN
DN3 stage thymocytes were sorted from the wild type (C57BL/6) and miR-185 Tg mice, followed by total RNA isolation.
