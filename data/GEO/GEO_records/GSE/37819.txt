TITLE
Expression response of Brucella melitensis strain 16M (ATCC23456) to erythritol

ORGANISM
Brucella melitensis bv. 1 str. 16M

SUMMARY
The four-carbon sugar erythritol is an important component of B. melitensis pathogenesis. To determine the transcriptional response to erythritol, B. melitensis strain 16M was grown in the presence of either glucose or erythritol as a sole carbon source.

DESIGN
Two control samples (glucose) and two experimental samples (erythritol) were analyzed on Nimblegen B. melitensis microarray chips.
