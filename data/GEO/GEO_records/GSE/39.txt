TITLE
Mefloquine treatment of NG108 rat neuronal cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This data series describes expression data for eight paired, control and treated cell cultures obtained on independent occasions. NG108 rat neuronal cell cultures were exposed to either 0.25% DMSO (control) or 4400 ng/ml mefloquine (treated) for two hours. Validation:   Modulation of the following transcripts by mefloquine was confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR:  U30186, X63594cds_g_at, X63594cds_at, X17163cds_s_at, rc_AI175959 and rc_AA945867 (unpaired, unequal variance, one tailed t-test, p < 0.05).
