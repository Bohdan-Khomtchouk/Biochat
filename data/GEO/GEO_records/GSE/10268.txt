TITLE
Variations in stress sensitivity and genomic expression in diverse S. cerevisiae strains (gene expression)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Gene expression variation was measured in 17 non-laboratory strains compared to the sequenced S288c lab strain Keywords: Gene expression comparisons in different yeast strains

DESIGN
Each strain was grown in at least biological triplicate to log phase in rich (YPD) medium.  Extracted total RNA was compared to that collected from the diploid S288C strain, DBY8268 (ura3-52/ura3-delta, ho/ho, GAL2/GAL2)
