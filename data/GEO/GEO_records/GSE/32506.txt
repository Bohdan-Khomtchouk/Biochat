TITLE
Expression data from porcine embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We have been able to derive EpiSC-like pESC lines from in vivo produced porcine blastocysts. Our cell lines showed AP activity, expressions of the genes Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Rex1, TDGF1, bFGF, FGFR1, FGFR2, Nodal and Activin-A involved in pluripotency and signaling pathways and in vitro differentiation potential, displaying similarities to epiblast stem cells or hES cells.

DESIGN
Porcine blastocysts were cultured on mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in pESC medium. Following 5-7 days of culture, we observed EpiSC-like primary colonies derived from day 7 in vivo-produced. These EpiSC-like pESC colonies were mechanically dissociated into several clumps using pulled glass pipettes 10-15 days after seeding. Dissociated clumps were then re-seeded on fresh MEFs, and subsequent EpiSC-like pESC lines were routinely passaged via the pulled glass pipette method every 5-7 days. Our cell lines maintained stemness and a stable morphology for more than 56 passages. The main purpose of the present study was to investigate gloval gene expression from porcine embryonic stem cells.
