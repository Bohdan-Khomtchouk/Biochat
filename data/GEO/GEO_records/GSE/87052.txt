TITLE
NIPI-3 regulates the expression of C. elegans immune genes

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Many pathogens secrete toxins that target key host processes resulting in the activation of immune pathways. The secreted Pseudomonas aeruginosa toxin Exotoxin A (ToxA) disrupts intestinal protein synthesis which triggers the induction of a subset of P. aeruginosa-response genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that losing one ToxA-induced C. elegans gene, the Tribbles pseudokinase ortholog nipi-3, results in hypersusceptibility to both P. aeruginosa and ToxA. We determined that NIPI-3 mediates the post-developmental expression of intestinal immune genes and proteins and primarily functions in parallel to known immune pathways, including p38 PMK-1 MAPK signaling.  Here we present the microarray data that was used to determine that (1) nipi-3 regulates immune gene expression and that  (2) nipi-3 and pmk-1 regulate non-overlapping gene sets consistent with them functioning in parallel. We used microarray analysis to identify the genes regulated by nipi-3 and pmk-1 at the L4 stage.

DESIGN
There are nine samples total that comprise three biological replicates of L4 C. elegans animals grown at 20C on OP50. The following genotypes were compared: wild type (N2), nipi-3(fr4), pmk-1(km25).
