TITLE
Expression data from the CD8 T cells of healthy donors and dengue patients from Thailand

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD8 T cells play roles in eliminating virus infected targets through cytotoxic effector function and are of great interest from vaccination prespective.  Previous studies suggest that the cytokines produced by the CD8 T cells may contribute to the pathological  consequences. Because the dengue specific memory T cells strongly secrete cytokines upon in vitro stimulation with heterologous viral antigen, the ‘cytokine storm’ induced by activated T cells may contribute to the immunopathology of dengue infection.  Moreover, the CD8 T cell expansion peaks before or around the time of the peak of clinical symptoms, and the frequency of activated CD8 T cells and cytokine producing cells was somewhat higher in patients with severe forms of dengue disease. To gain further insight into the characteristics of activated CD8 T cells, we performed microarray analysis of the HLA-DR+CD38+ CD8 T cells that were sorted from the PBMCs of seven dengue patients from Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand and compare with the sorted naive (CCR7+CD45RA+) CD8 T cells from five Thai healthy donors.
