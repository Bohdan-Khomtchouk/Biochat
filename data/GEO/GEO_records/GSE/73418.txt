TITLE
Genetic and epigenetic variation in the lineage specification of regulatory T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq of H3K27ac was performed in regulatory T cells (resting and activated) and conventional T cells (na√Øve, effector, memory) in mouse and human.  A small number of regulatory elements were lineage specific in both mouse and human and represented the 'core' lineage specification program.  Regulatory element acetylation levels were associated with genetic variation in humans and lineage-specific loci were enriched for autoimmune risk-alleles (especially type 1 diabetes) identified in classic and fine-resolution genome-wide association studies.
