TITLE
Yeast mRNA decay analysis after addition of 3 & 10 µ/mL thiolutin

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Time course after the addition of the transcriptional inhibitor thiolutin at 3 and 10 µg/mL to an exponential growing culture of S. cerevisiae in YPD. Keywords: time course, mRNA stability analysis

DESIGN
Total RNA from BQS252 yeast strain (Mat a, ura3-52 derived from FY1679) growing in exponential phase in YPD was extracted at 30 minutes after thiolutin 3 and 10 µg/mL addition. All the samples were hybridized on the same nylon array. 2 replicates.
