TITLE
Transcriptomes in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of Dementia and Alzheimer Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
With the aging population, there is a growing focus on dementia, especially Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The molecular basis underlying the pathogenesis of AD is gradually being elucidated. Increasing evidence has shown that the immunological function of leukocytes plays a crucial role in the development of neurodegenerative disorders. However, there have been few studies among the Taiwanese population. The aim of this study was to investigate potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease from blood leukocytes.

DESIGN
The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) transcriptomes from 5 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 4 AD, as well as 4 normal controls (NC), were analyzed by microarray analysis.
