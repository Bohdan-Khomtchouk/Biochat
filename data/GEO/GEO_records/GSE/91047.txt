TITLE
Regulated gene expression for breast cancer cells treated with NLC-Citral for 48 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further develop our gene expression study, we have employed the microrarray expression to study the regulate gene expression on breast cancer cells after 48 hours of treatments

DESIGN
The regulated genes in different pathways were measured at 48 hours post treatment (NLC-Citral) as compared to the control treatments (Citral, or NLC-Blank).
