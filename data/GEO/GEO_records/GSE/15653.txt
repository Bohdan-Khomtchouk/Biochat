TITLE
Expression data from liver of obese (with or without type 2 diabetes) and lean human subjects.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatic lipid accumulation is an important complication of obesity linked to risk for type 2 diabetes. To identify novel transcriptional changes in human liver which could contribute to hepatic lipid accumulation and associated insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (DM2), we evaluated gene expression and gene set enrichment in surgical liver biopsies from 13 obese (9 with DM2) and 5 control subjects, obtained in the fasting state at the time of elective abdominal surgery for obesity or cholecystectomy. RNA was isolated for cRNA preparation and hybridized to Affymetrix U133A microarrays.

DESIGN
Human liver samples were obtained from 5 lean control subjects undergoing elective cholecystectomy and 13 obese subjects (with or without Type 2 diabetes) undergoing gastric bypass surgery.  Subjects with diabetes were classified as either well-controlled or poorly-controlled.
