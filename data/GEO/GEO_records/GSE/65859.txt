TITLE
Differentially regulated genes in adipocytes derived from Men1-null vs WT mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MEN1  is a tumor suppressor gene loss of which causes lipoma (fatty tumors under the skin) and many other endocrine and non-endocrine  tumors. It's target genes in fat cells (adipocytes) are unknown. Gene expression in adipocytes that were in vitro differentiated from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) of Men1-nul l(Men1-KO) and WT mice were compared to assess the expression of genes upon menin loss in adipocytes that could lead to the deveopment of lipoma.

DESIGN
mESCs (Men1-null and WT) were in vitro differentaited into adipocytes. Positive oil red O staining indicated successful differentiation into adipocytes. The cells were processed for RNA isolation.  RNA preps  were used for microarray analysis.
