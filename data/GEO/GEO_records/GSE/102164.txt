TITLE
Androgen receptor variants mediate DNA repair after prostate cancer irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We employ ChIP- seq methodology, to study the effect of ionizing radiation  treatment in genome wide binding of RNA pol-II and AR

DESIGN
ChIP-seq using RNApol-II and AR antibodies was conductd in R1-D567 irradiated cells with non radiated cells as control
