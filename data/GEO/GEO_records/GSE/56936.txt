TITLE
Expression data from NEAT1 regulated genes with or without polyI:C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are localized in the nucleus, only a few dozen have been functionally characterized. We found that nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), an essential lncRNA for the formation of nuclear body paraspeckles, is induced by poly I:C stimulation, resulting in excess formation of paraspeckles. Using microarray analysis, we investigated whether NEAT1 induction followed by excess formation of paraspeckles was involved in poly I:C-inducible gene expression.

DESIGN
We want to know the NEAT1-regulated genes. To the end, HeLa TO cells with and without poly I:C stimulation and NEAT1-knock down cells with and without poly I:C stimulation and cells transfected with mock plasmid or Neat1v2 expression plasmid alone  were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
