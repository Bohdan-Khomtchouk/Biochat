TITLE
Differentially methylated genes in human IL-7Ra high and low EM CD8+ T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of IL-7Ra high and low EM CD8+ T cells. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,578 CpGs. Samples included 2 IL-7Ra high EM CD8+ T cells and 2 IL-7Ra high EM CD8+ T cells.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 4 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
