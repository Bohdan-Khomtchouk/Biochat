TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA was isolated from Peripheral blood (PB) and Bone Marrow (BM) samples using mirVana kit and RNA integrity number (RIN) was determined in Agilent Bioanalyzer (2100) to assess the suitability for microarray assays. Fifty samples were individually analyzed using miRCURY™ LNA arrays version 11.0 (Exiqon, Denmark). The LNA array slides were scanned using Agilent G2565BA Microarray Scanner System (Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA) and image analysis was carried out using ImaGene 8.0 software (BioDiscovery, Inc., USA). The quantified signals were background corrected (Normexp with offset value 10 14 and normalized using global Lowess (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing) regression algorithm.

DESIGN
Three condition experiment T-ALL vs Healthy Individuals (normals),  B-ALL vs normals, T-ALL vs B-ALL; Biological replicates: 6, T-ALL replicates and 5 B-ALL replicates; Control replicates-5.139 is the BM of individual 136

PLATFORM
GPL17107 Exiqon miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Array - hsa, mmu & rno
