TITLE
Whole genome gene expression profiling in CD4+ T-cells, FACS-sorted based on CADM1/CD7 expression levels, in Adult T-cell Leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) patients, HTLV-1 carriers, and in healthy volunteers.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CADM1 overexpresion and stepwise downregulation of CD7 in CD4+T-cells from ATL patients and HTLV-1 carriers accurately reflect the process of disease, i.e., oligoclonally and clonally exanding cells are accumulated in D (CADM1posCD7dim) and N (CADM1posCD7neg) populations, respectively. Moreover, gene expression profiling of each subpopulation supported that notion.

DESIGN
PBMCs of asymptomatic carriers (ACs) and ATLs were subgrouped based on CADM1 and CD7 expression levels by multicolor flow cytometry. FACS-sorted subpopulations were then subjected to extraction of total RNA, followed by Cy-3 labeling and human whole genome gene expression microarray analyses.
