TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for acute myeloid leukemia samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pediatric patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia. To define genomic architecture, we performed genome-wide copy number abberation analysis in 460 paired diagnostic-remission bone marrow aspirates.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from cryopreserved diagnostic and remission bone marrow samples. Copy number aberration analysis of Affymetrix 6.0 SNP arrays (254 sample pairs) and Illumina 2.5M Omni arrays (206 sample pairs) was performed for 460 acute myeloid leukemia samples. This Series represents the Affymetrix dataset.
