TITLE
Cane Toad Metamorphis

ORGANISM
Rhinella marina

SUMMARY
Comparison of pre and post metamorphis phases of cane toad Keywords: Developmental Stages

DESIGN
Samples were harvested at 9, 18, 28 (pre-metamorph), 30 and 53 (post-metamorph) days of age and RNA extracted using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (100 mg) was reverse transcribed (Qiagen) and labelled cDNA probes were generated using the fluorophores, Cy3 and Cy5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Prehybridization of slides, application of the probe to the microarray slides, hybridisation, and subsequent washing steps were performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Corning Microarray Technology). Slides were scanned and analysed with a GenePix 4000B laser scanner and GenePix 3.0 and 4.0 software (Axon Instruments).
