TITLE
Expression data from renal cortex of ICR-derived Glomerulonephritis (ICGN) mice and ICR mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ICR-derived glomerulonephritis (ICGN) mice is a novel inbred strain of mice with a hereditary nephrotic syndrome. Deletion mutation of tensin 2 (Tns2), a focal adhesion molecule, has been suggested to be responsible for nephrotic syndrome in ICGN mice, however, existence of other associative factors has been suggested. To identify additional associative factors and to better understand onset mechanism of nephrotic syndrome in ICGN mice, comprehensive gene expression analysis using DNA microarray was conducted. Immune-related pathways were markedly altered in ICGN mice kidney as compared with ICR mice. Furthermore, gene expression level of complement component 1, s subcomponent (C1s), whose human homologue has been reported to associate with lupus nephritis, was markedly low in ICGN mice kidney.

DESIGN
RNA from renal cortex of 4- and 8-week-old ICGN and ICR mice was extracted and processed for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays (N=3).
