TITLE
Dependency of Gene Expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae on extracellular Glucose Concentration

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to analyse how the gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae changes in dependency on the glucose concentration. Therefore, fed batch cultivations were carried out, during which the glucose concentration was maintained stable for several hours. Samples were taken at different times during the cultivations, the RNA was isolated and hybridised on whole genome yeast microarrays. Results from cultivations with the glucose concentrations 50, 70, 100 and 500 mg/L are presented. In addition, one sample from a starvation period (0 mg/L glucose) was analysed. Keywords: Dependency on glucose concentration
