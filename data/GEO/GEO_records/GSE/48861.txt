TITLE
Microbial RNAseq analysis of cecal and fecal samples collected from mice colonized with the microbiota of human twins discordant for obesity

ORGANISM
mouse gut metagenome

SUMMARY
Microbial RNAseq analysis of cecal and fecal samples collected from mice colonized with the microbiota of human twins discordant for obesity. Samples were colleted at the time of sacrifice, or 15 days after colonization from mice gavaged with uncultured or cultured fecal microbiota from the lean twins or their obese co-twins. Samples were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq technology, with 101 paired end chemistry.

DESIGN
Comparisson of microbial gene expression between the microbiota of lean and obese twins fed a Low fat, rich in plant polysaccharide diet.

PLATFORM
