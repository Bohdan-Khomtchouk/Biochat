TITLE
microRNA expression profile from five Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Hypermobility type/Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (EDS-HT/JHS) patients' skin fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To screen for potential miRNA that may contribute to the etiopathogenesis of EDS-HT/JHS miRNA expression profiling was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® miRNA 3.0 Array and comparing the miRNA expression changes of skin fibroblasts of five EDS-HT/JHS patients with those of six healthy individuals

DESIGN
Comparison of miRNA expression profiles between five EDS-HT/JHS human fibroblasts and six  controls
