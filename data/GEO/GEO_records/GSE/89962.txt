TITLE
mouse BMDM dual PAMP stimulation with poly(I:C), R848, LPS, Pam3CSK3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression kinetics for BM-DM from C57BL/6 mouse stimulated with four different TLR ligands poly(I:C), R848, LPS, Pam3CSK4 either singly or in paired combination, for 1 hour, 4 hour, or 8 hour.

DESIGN
Mouse BM-DM cells were stimulated with four different reagents poly(I:C), R848, LPS, Pam3CSK4 either singly or in paired combination, for 1 hour, 4 hour, or 8 hour.
