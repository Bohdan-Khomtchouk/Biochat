TITLE
Glucocoritcoid regulated genes in omental and subcutaneous human adipose tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To provide a comprehensive understanding of how GC affect adipose tissue and adipocyte function, we analyzed patterns of gene expression after culture of abdominal subcutaneous (sc) and omental (Om)) Adipose tissue of severely obese subjects (3F, 1M) in the presence of insulin or insulin (7 nM) plus dexamethasone (dex, 25 nM) for 7d.
