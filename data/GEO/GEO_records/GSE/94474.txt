TITLE
Condensin-mediated remodeling of the mitotic chromatin landscape in fission yeast

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Chromatin fibres dynamically change their organisation during cell cycle. In interphase nucleus, chromatin fibres are evenly distributed whereas their spatial occupancy are reorganised to form condensed chromosomes in mitosis. This process called chromosome condensation is necessary for an accomplishment of faithful chromosome segregation. One of the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes complexes, Condensin, is indispensable for chromosome condensation. It remains, however, unknown how Condensin plays its role in shaping mitotic chromosome. Here we show that chromatin fibres change their interacting partners; short-range contacts in interphase nucleus are converted into long-range interactions to shape condensed chromosomes. This conversion of interactions among chromatin fibres results in the formation of larger domains within mitotic chromosomes. Condensin is solely in charge of the conversion and large domain formation in fission yeast mitosis. Our results show how fission yeast Condensin is involved in shaping mitotic chromosomes.
