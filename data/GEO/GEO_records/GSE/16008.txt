TITLE
Gene expression from bronchial and nasal epithelial cell samples of healthy current and never smokers.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA expression was assayed from bronchial epithelial cells collected via bronchoscopy and nasal epithelial cells collected by brushing the inferior turbinate  from healthy current and never smoker volunteers in order to determine the relationship between smoking-related gene expression changes in bronchial and nasal epithelium within the same individual.

DESIGN
Bronchial epithelial cells were collected from current and never smokers via bronchoscopy, and nasal epithelial cells were collected by brushing the inferior turbinate during the same clinic visit. 1ug of RNA was isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST microarrays to obtain mRNA expression. The genome build upon which transcript assignments are based is hg18 (HuEx-1_0-st-v2.na27.hg18.transcript.csv).
