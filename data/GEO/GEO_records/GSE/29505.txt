TITLE
Custom Illumina array DNA methylation analysis of 384 CpGs across five cancer types

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor heterogeneity is a major barrier to effective cancer diagnosis and treatment. We recently identified cancer-specific differentially DNA-methylated regions (cDMRs) in colon cancer, which also distinguish normal tissue types from each other. We therefore hypothesized that these colon cDMRs might also be cDMRs for other cancer types. For colon, lung, breast, thyroid, and Wilms tumors, we show stochastic variation in methylation within each tumor type, but involving the same loci across tumor types, with intermediate values of variation for premalignant adenomas.
