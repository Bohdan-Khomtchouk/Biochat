TITLE
Quantitative microarray profiling of alternative splicing in mouse tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We describe the application of a new microarray platform, which combines information from exon body and splice-junction probes, to analyze the regulation of 3126 alternative splicing events in ten mouse tissues. The details of the methods and algorithms are described in this paper: Revealing global regulatory features of mammalian alternative splicing using a quantitative microarray platform (Molecular Cell, Dec., 2004) Keywords = A new quantitative alternative splicing microarray platform Keywords: other
