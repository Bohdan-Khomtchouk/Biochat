TITLE
Hookworm-Induced Persistent Changes to the Immunological Environment of the Lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis results in persistent changes to the lung environment. Cytokine profiling reveals a sustained increase in both Th1 and Th2 transcripts. Cellular populations of macrophages display an alternative phenotype, with upregulation of YM1, Arg1, Mrc1 as well as Class II MHC. These alternatively activated alveolar macrophages (AAAMs) also increase drastically in number. Subsequent challenge with house dust mite (HDM) Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus shows a reduced allergic phenotype, with decreased fold changes in effector cell cytokines of both the Th1 and Th2 variety indicative of the new regulatory environment established in the lung by helminth infection. Histological examination of the lung environment reveals a significant decrease in eosinophila and reduced mucous production by bronchial epithelial cells. Keywords: Timecourse, Infection, Allergy Model
