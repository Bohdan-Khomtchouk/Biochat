TITLE
Genomewide measurements of neural-specific mRNA decay in Drosophila embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Neural-specific mRNA decay measurements by TU-Decay technique in control and Pumilio knockdown embryos

DESIGN
These TU-Decay microarrays analyze mRNA levels at three timepoints: a one hour pulse, one hour chase, and three hour chase.  Neural-specific RNA purification was achieved using prospero-GAL4 driving UAS-T.g.UPRT.  Pumilio knockdown in the nervous system was acheived using UAS-Pum(RNAi) driven by prospero-Gal4.
