TITLE
Genes associated with prostate cancer are differentially expressed in African American and European American men (matched normal specimens)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A total of 1,507 probes measured the expression of 517 genes on the custom Illumina DASL assay testing if select genes showed cancer-specific differential expression according to race. Genes were chosen for inclusion in the assay based on existing evidence from the literature and our own data for their importance to prostate cancer, prostate cancer aggressiveness, or cancer in general

DESIGN
163 FFPE tumor matched normal (control) samples (80 African American, 83 European American) were assayed
