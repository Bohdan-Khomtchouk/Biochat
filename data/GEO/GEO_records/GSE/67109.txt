TITLE
Genome-wide RNA-expression analysis after p53 activation in colorectal cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to comprehensively identify RNA-expression changes after p53-activation, total RNA was isolated and subjected to next generation seqencing (RNA-Seq) after activation of a conditional p53 allele in SW480 cells.

DESIGN
SW480/pRTR-p53-VSV cells were subjected to RNA-Seq analysis after 48 hours doxycycline-treatment.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
