TITLE
Gene expression in mouse cerebral cortex in response to short-term calorie restriction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The effect of a short-term calorie restricted diet was evaluated in cerebral cortex in seven strains of mice The dietary intervention was initiated at 8 weeks of age and continued until 22 weeks of age

DESIGN
Tissues were collected from mice at 22 weeks of age; there were 112 microarrays used in total: for each of the 7 strains of mice, there were 8 control-fed mice and 8 calorie restricted mice (one individual mouse per microarray)
