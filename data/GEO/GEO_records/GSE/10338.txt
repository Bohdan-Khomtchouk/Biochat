TITLE
Genetics of internal heat necrosis (IHN) in potato (Solanum tuberosum) via microarray analysis of gene expression

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Potato plants of the cultivar 'Atlantic', which is IHN-susceptible, were grown in the greenhouse under a 16-hour photoperiod and 22 C day/18 C night temperatures for 46 days, after which they were transferred to growth chambers with a 14-hour photoperiod and normal (20 C day/18 C night) temperatures.               At 71 DAP (days after planting), half of the plants were subjected to high (28 C day/20 C night) temperatures for the remainder of the study.  Tubers from both normal and high temperature regimes were harvested at two-week intervals, beginning at 76 DAP and ending at 118 DAP.  For each RNA sample, equal amounts of peeled tuber tissue (sampled from the center of the tuber using a cork borer) was pooled from three randomly chosen plants.  RNA was extracted using a hot-phenol and high salt (2.4 M) CTAB-based extraction buffer. Keywords: Loop design
