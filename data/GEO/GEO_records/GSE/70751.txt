TITLE
Enhancer divergence and cis-regulatory evolution in the human and chimpanzee neural crest

ORGANISM
Pan troglodytes

SUMMARY
Here we derive human and chimpanzee cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) and profile histone modifications, transcription factors, chromatin accessibility and gene expression to systematically and quantitatively annotate evolutionary divergence of craniofacial cis-regulatory landscapes.

DESIGN
Histone modifications (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3), chromatin modifiers (p300), transcription factors (NR2F1, TFAP2A), chromatin accessibility (ATACseq) and gene expression (RNAseq) were assayed in CNCCs derived from iPSCs/ESCs from 2 chimpanzee and 3 human individuals.
