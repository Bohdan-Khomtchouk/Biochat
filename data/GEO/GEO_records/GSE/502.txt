TITLE
Eucalyptus grandis BC progeny

ORGANISM
Eucalyptus grandis

SUMMARY
The gene expression profiles of the differentiating xylem of 91 Eucalyptus grandis backcross individuals were characterized following a loop design (Churchill, G.A. Nat Genet. 2002 Dec;32 Suppl:490-5). In this design, RNA from genotype 1666 (labeled with Cy5) was hybridized with RNA from genotype 1667 (labeled with Cy3) on the first slide(GEO accession number GSM7637); the same genotype 1667 (now labeled with Cy5) was compared with genotype 1669 (Cy3) on the second slide (GSM7638), and so on. The loop was completed when genotype 1666 (Cy3) was contrasted to individual 1796 (Cy3) on slide GSM7727. Therefore, 91 individuals (genotypes) from the E. grandis backcross population were analyzed in two replicates, one with RNA labeled with Cy3 and the other with Cy5.
