TITLE
The chromatin remodeler ATRX binds to atypical chromatin domains at the 3’ exons of ZNF genes to preserve H3K9me3 enrichment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we report that ATRX co-localizes with the H3K9-methyl transferase SETDB1 (also known as ESET), the co-repressor TRIM28 (also known as KAP1), and the transcription factor ZNF274 at 3’ exons of Zinc Finger Genes (ZNFs) containing an atypical H3K9me3/H3K36me3 chromatin signature. Disruption of ATRX and ZNF274 leads to a significant reduction of H3K9me3, particularly at the 3’ ZNF exons and other atypical chromatin regions, higher percentages of DNA damage, and defects in cell cycle. Taken together, our studies suggest that ATRX binds the 3’ exons of ZNFs to maintain genomic stability through the regulation of their H3K9me3 levels

DESIGN
XL-MNase ChIP-seq of ATRX was performed in the erythroleukemic cell line K562 and the Neuroblastoma cell line LAN6. Two independent replicates using different ATRX antibodies were performed in K562. Additionally, Native ChIP-seq of H3K9me3 in LAN6, ATRX WT and ATRX KO K562 cells was performed. Input samples were sequenced as control.
