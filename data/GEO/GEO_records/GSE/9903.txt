TITLE
Chilling requirement fulfillment in Vitis riparia overwintering buds

ORGANISM
Vitis riparia

SUMMARY
This study investigated changes in gene expression of controlled environment chilled (4C) grape overwintering buds as they accumulated from 0 to 2000 chilling hours. Keywords: time course, chilling, endodormancy release, axillary bud, grape

DESIGN
A loop design with 3 biological replicates (RNA from buds collected at 0, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 hr of chilling in 2002, 2004, and 2005).

PLATFORM
GPL6275 South Dakota State University custon Vitis bud 10K cDNA array version 1
