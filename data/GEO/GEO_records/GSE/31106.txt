TITLE
Expression data for the different phases of ulcerative colitis-associated carcinogenesis in a mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nonresolving inflammation is correlated to carcinogenesis. Ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer (UC-CRC), one of the typical carcinoma generated by inflammation that cannot be resolved properly, has been widely believed to involve a multistep process contains “inflammation-dysplasia-cancer” sequence. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying the step-wise development of UC-CRC is still not fully understood. Detecting the changes in gene expression profiles may help to reveal why and how does the prolonged inflammatory response lead to carcinogenesis, and to characterize potential diagnostic/prognostic markers or additional therapeutic targets for UC-CRC. There for, we performed temporal genome expression profiling analysis using the Affymetrix genome wide microarray system to identify broad scale changes in gene expression associated with the development of colitis-associated cancer, based on an AOM/DSS induced mouse model of UC-CRC.

DESIGN
6-week-old male ICR mice were given a single intraperitoneal injection of AOM (10mg/kg) at Day 1, followed by three cycles of DSS administration (cycle 1: 2%, Day 8~14; cycle 2: 1.5%, Day 29~33; cycle 3: 1.5%, Day 50~54) in the drinking water. Instead, control group of mice were given a single intraperitoneal injection of saline (10mg/kg) at Day 1 and distilled water drinking from the beginning to the end without DSS. Colorectal tissues were collected at days 14, 28, 42, 56 and 140 (at the end of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 20th week) from the AOM/DSS group and at day 14 from the control group. Pathological changes of each sample were identified under microscope. Samples collected at the end of the 2nd week were inflamed mucosae, the 4th week were low grade dysplasias, the 6th week were high grade dysplasias, the 8th week were high grade dysplasias with active inflammation, the 20th week were carcinomas, and the control sample were normal mucosae. Total RNA were extracted and detected by Affymerix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
