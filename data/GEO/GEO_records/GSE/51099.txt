TITLE
Expression data from Ctla4-/- and DKO CD4+ Tconv cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ctla4-/- mice suffer from a severe autoimmunity characterized by indiscriminate self-reactive T cell activation. Itk-/-Ctla4-/- (DKO) mice are protected from lethal autoimmunity despite a fulminant autoimmune process in the LNs as self-reative T cells fail to migrate to destroy tissues. We used microarray to identify underlying differences in gene expression that could account for lack of migration of DKO T cells into tissues.

DESIGN
CD4+CD25neg T cells from 3 weeks old male Ctla4-/- or DKO mice were sorted in duplicates, RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent and microarray analysis performed with the Affymetrix MoGene 1.0 ST array

PLATFORM
