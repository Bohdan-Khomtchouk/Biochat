TITLE
Expression profiling of lncRNAs/mRNA for 16 human samples derived from patients with altrophic gastritis(Hp+) or gastric cancer(Hp+)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
H.pylori was a well known risk factor for gastic cancer. In this study, we used high-throughtput lncRNA microarray to screen dysregulated lncRNA in gastric cancer, and to investigate the biological function fully understood lncRNA.

DESIGN
A  sixteen chip study using total RNA extracted from four normal mucosa tissues, six atrophic gastritis (Hp+)  tissues and six gastric cancer (Hp+) tissues

PLATFORM
GPL15314 Arraystar Human LncRNA microarray V2.0 (Agilent_033010 Probe Name version)
