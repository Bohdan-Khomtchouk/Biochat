TITLE
Expression data from mouse embryo (E5) cultured in the narrow and wide cavity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mouse anterior-posterior (A-P) axis polarization is preceded by formation of the distal visceral endoderm (DVE). However, the mechanism of the emergence of DVE cells is not well understood. Here, we show by in vitro culturing of embryos immediately after implantation in micro-fabricated cavities (narrow; 90 micro-meter, wide; 180 miro-meter in diameter) that the external mechanical cues exerted on the embryo, i.e. cultured in the narrow cavity, are crucial for DVE formation as well as elongated egg cylinder shape. This implies that these developmental events immediately after implantation are not simply embryo-autonomous processes but require extrinsic mechanical factors. Further whole genome-wide gene expression profiles with DNA microarray revealed that no significant difference of transcripts were evident with or without mechanical cues except DVE-related markers. Thus, we propose that external mechanical cues rather than not specific molecular pathways can trigger the establishment of the A-P axis polarization, which is one of the fundamental proccesses of mammalian embryogenesis.

DESIGN
To identify the differences between the embryos cultured with or without external mechanical cues, we collected mouse embryos at E5.0 and cultured in the narrow (90 micro-meter in diameter) or the wide (180 micro-meter in diameter) cavities for 8 hours for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Arrays were performed using Affymetrix mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays. Analysis was performed on three biological replicates of the mouse embryos cultured in the narrow and wide cavities for 8 hours.
