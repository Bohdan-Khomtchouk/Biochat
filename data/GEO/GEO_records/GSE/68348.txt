TITLE
Differential gene expression profiling by LSD1 inhibition using novel LSD1 inhibitors (NCD25 and NCD38)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LSD1 is a demethylase of histone modification H3k4me1 and H3K4me2. We have developed novel LSD1 inhibitors (NCD25 and NCD38) and found that they are effective to myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemia cells. To understand what mechanisms are affected by these compounds, we employed gene expression profiling analyses. Gene expression profiling data were obtained from HEL, MDS-L, or CMK11-5 cells treated with DMSO (control), NCD25, or NCD38 and compared each other. Expression of eleven transcriptional factors (GFI1, CEBPA, SPI1, MNDA, TAL1, GATA1, NFE2, RXRA, HOXA9, GATA2, and PBX1) was reconfirmed by q-PCR with the same samples.

DESIGN
Gene expression of leukemia cells was measured after 48 hours incubation with or without LSD1 inhibitors. Five independent experiments were performed using 3 cell lines (HEL, MDS-L and CMK11-5) and 2 drugs (NCD38 and NCD25).
