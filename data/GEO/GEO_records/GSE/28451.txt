TITLE
Conditional knockout of Sox2 in embryonic and trophoblast stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare the transcriptional networks governed by Sox2 in embryonic stem (ES) cells and trophoblast stem (TS) cells, we performed whole-genome expression analysis after tetracycline (Tet)-induced knockout of Sox2 in each cell type.

DESIGN
A Tet-inducible Sox2 knockout ES cell line 2TS22C or its derivative TSC line 22CEROH2-TSC1 were treated with Tet for 4 days. A total of 12 samples from ES or TS cells cultured with or without Tet were analyzed in three biological replicates.
