TITLE
Conditional knockout of Sox2 in embryonic and trophoblast stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare the transcriptional networks governed by Sox2 in embryonic stem (ES) cells and trophoblast stem (TS) cells, we performed whole-genome expression analysis after tetracycline (Tet)-induced knockout of Sox2 in each cell type.
