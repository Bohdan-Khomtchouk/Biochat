TITLE
Expression data from 12 human thyroid tissue classes and 2 cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It is often difficult to distinguish histologically between the different types of follicular thyroid carcinoma, particularly when they are less invasive. Thus, the identification of specific gene or protein markers would help to apply the thyroid tumor sub-classification recently proposed by the WHO. However, the selection of the best set of markers for each class of follicular thyroid tumor needs a large-scale comparison of the gene and protein expression patterns of the various types of tumor. Keywords: disease comparison

DESIGN
classification of pathologies and gene markers for the thyroid pathologies
