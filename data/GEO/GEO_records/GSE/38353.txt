TITLE
Expression profiling by array of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (SL1344) qseC mutant x wild type

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
“Stress, survival and virulence: the multi-faceted host/microbial interactions.” Bacteria employ epinephrine and norepinephrine, which converge to distinct bacterial crucial processes, like survival and pathogenicity.  A novel stress periplasmic membrane protein belonging to previously described BOF family, protein renamed here SrpP, and together with membrane sensor kinase QseC has an essential role in stress response and virulence of S. Typhimurium.  SrpP employs its predicted binding pocket, specifically the SrpPE110 residue, and interacts with lipid A modification enzyme, LpxO dioxygenase.  Upon this interaction SrpP in S. Typhimurium finely manages multiple membrane functions to culminate in survival upon stress and pathogenesis in vivo, connecting host-stress chemical signaling to cell stress in bacteria.
