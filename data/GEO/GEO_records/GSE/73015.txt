TITLE
Stable inhibitory activity of regulatory T cells requires the transcription factor Helios

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The maintenance of immune homeostasis requires regulatory T cells (Tregs). Given their intrinsic self-reactivity, Tregs must stably maintain a suppressive phenotype to avoid autoimmunity. We report that impaired expression of the transcription factor (TF) Helios by FoxP3+ CD4 and Qa-1-restricted CD8 Tregs results in defective regulatory activity and autoimmunity in mice. Helios-deficient Treg develop an unstable phenotype during inflammatory responses characterized by reduced FoxP3 expression and increased effector cytokine expression secondary to diminished activation of the STAT5 pathway. CD8 Treg also require Helios-dependent STAT5 activation for survival and to prevent terminal T cell differentiation. Definition of Helios as a key transcription factor that stabilizes regulatory T-cells in the face of inflammatory responses provides a genetic explanation for a core property of regulatory T-cells.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global programs of gene expression by CD8 Treg (CD44+CD122+Ly49+) and conventional memory type of CD8 cells (CD44+CD122+Ly49-).
