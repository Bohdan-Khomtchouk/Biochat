TITLE
miR-192-EGR1/HOXB9 regulatory network controls the angiogenic switch in cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A deeper mechanistic understanding of tumor angiogenesis regulation is needed to improve current anti-angiogenic therapies, which thus far have only modestly improved patient survival. We present converging evidence from systems-based miRNA analyses of large-scale patient datasets along with in vitro and in vivo experiments that identify miR-192 as a key regulator of angiogenesis.

DESIGN
Two groups of samples are included: 1.SKOV3ip1 cells treated with control miRNA. 2.SKOV3ip1 cells treated with miR-192. Gene expression profiles were compared between these two treatment groups.
