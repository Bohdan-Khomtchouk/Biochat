TITLE
af13_plp2 - plp2 paraquat - Functional analysis of lipid acyl hydrolases in Arabidopsis antimicrobial defense

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Effects of deregulation of a lipid acyl hydrolase gene (PLP2, At2g26560) on global transcriptome upon infection by Botrytis cinerea. This deregulation affects resistance levels against fungal and bacterial pathogens, likely by perturbing the biosynthesis of oxylipins. Oxylipins are fatty acid-derived compounds (example:jasmonic acid) with diverse signaling or antimicrobial properties. - 10 uM Paraquat was infiltated in mesophyll of leaves with a syringe without needle. Leaf material was harvested at 0, 4 and 18 hours later. 3 plant genotypes were used (Col-0 ecotype) : - siPLP2 (RNAi-silenced) - pBIN (empty pBIN-transformed) - PLP2OE (PLP2-overexpressors). Keywords: gene knock in (transgenic),time course

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - CATMA arrays
