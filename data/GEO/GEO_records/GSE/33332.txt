TITLE
Prospective isolation and characterization of renal cancer stem cells from human Wilms' tumor xenografts leads to tumor eradication

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Downregulation of specific microRNAs contribute to epithelial-mesenchymal transition of Wilms' tumor cancer initiating cells. In order to gain insight into the biology of initiating cells/cancer stem cells (CIC/CSCs) in Wilms' tumor, we compared the microRNA expression profile of un-sorted propagatable WT xenografts (p-WT Xn), p-WT NCAM+ALDH1+-derived Xn and human fetal kidneys (hFKs). Global microRNA expression analysis showed specific microRNAs to differentially express identifying a strong miRNA signature for the NCAM+ALDH1+ WT CICs.

DESIGN
3 different tissue types (described in 'summary') each with n=4 were homoginized and analyzed for their global miRNA expression profiles. Human Fetal Kidney tissues were used as a control.
