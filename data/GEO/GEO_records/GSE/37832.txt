TITLE
Expression data from mouse embryonic neural stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neural stem cells from different brain regions show differencies in gene expression patterns and physiological functions. We used microarrays to find differential gene expression between the neuralstem cells from the subventricular zone of lateral ventricle and the subventricular zone of third ventricle.

DESIGN
Cultured neural stem cells from embryonic day 17.5 mouse embryos were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain embryonic neural stem cell cultures from three indipendent females.
