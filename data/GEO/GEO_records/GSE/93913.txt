TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of H3K27me3 occupancy in C. merolae

ORGANISM
Cyanidioschyzon merolae strain 10D

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunopreciptation coupled with Illumina sequencing to H3K27me3 occupancy in model red alga, C. merolae. The results revealed preferential abundance over repetitive elements, instead of the genes. This histone mark enriches also over subtelomeric and telomeric regions of the chromosomes. C. merolae H3K27me3 has a canonical repressive function as in the higher eukaryotes and forms differential clusters over the gene bodies with different levels of repression. Overall, our study provides important insights toward the function of chromatin-mediated repression in the evolutionary aspect.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq experiment in triplicate in C. merolae cell cultures. The samples include: H3K27me3, H3 and input. The H3K27me3 domain occupancy was calculated with normalization, either to input or H3 samples.
