TITLE
Gene expression profiles in fins after infection of zebrafish with Spring Viremia Carp Virus (SVCV)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Because fin base is supposed to be the entry zone of some fish virus, we wanted to know which  transcripts are induced after infection of zebrafish with Spring Viremia Carp Virus (SVCV). Two days after infection, differentially expressed transcript levels from selected immune-related zebrafish genes were studied in zebrafish fins. Also transcripts from resistant fishes to viral infection one month after inoculation were studied.

DESIGN
Three different experiments were performed to get three biological replicates. Fishes were divided in two groups in each experiment. First group was infected by immersion with SVCV 107 pfu/ml, second group was used as a control of non-infected fishes. 6 fishes per group were sacrified two days post infection, whereas the rest of infected fishes from the three experiments were maintained for 30 days in the aquariums and then survivors (six for experiment)  were sacrified.
