TITLE
Expression Data from hypothalamus of IL-6 deficient mice and their wild-type littermates following intraperitoneal LPS challenge

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IL-6 has been described to be a critical cytokine in mediating the febrile response because neither IL-6 knockout mice injected with peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or IL-1Î², nor animals treated with IL-6 antiserum develop fever. However, the fever response is developed in IL-6 KO mice following intracerebroventricular administration of Prostaglandin E2 which is the principal mediator of the febrile response.

DESIGN
We performed a genome-wide microarray expression comparison between LPS-treated WT and IL-6 KO mice to evaluate if there were any differentially expressed genes in mice devoid of IL-6 that can explain the absence of fever response.
