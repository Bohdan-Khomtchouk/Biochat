TITLE
Comparative Analysis of Gene Expression Profiles in Infective and Developing Larvae of Brugia malayi and Brugia pahangi

ORGANISM
Brugia malayi ; Brugia pahangi

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles provided novel insights into the genes that are transcriptionally active in infective and developing larvae of two closely related species. Species differences may indicate different metabolic adaptations that could affect host specificity, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of infective (L3) or developing larval RNA used for hybridization, in duplicate, to examine the gene expression changes in Brugia larvae Brugia malayi vector derived third stage larvae (Bm VL3); Brugia pahangi vector derived third stage larvae (Bp VL3); Brugia pahangi L3 cultured in vitro (Bp cL3); Brugia pahangi L3 derived from peritoneal cavity of infected gerbils (Bp ipL3); Brugia pahangi migrating L3 (Bp mL3) from  infected gerbils
