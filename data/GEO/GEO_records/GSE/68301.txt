TITLE
Comparative Analysis of Gene Expression Profiles in Infective and Developing Larvae of Brugia malayi and Brugia pahangi

ORGANISM
Brugia malayi

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles provided novel insights into the genes that are transcriptionally active in infective and developing larvae of two closely related species. Species differences may indicate different metabolic adaptations that could affect host specificity, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity
