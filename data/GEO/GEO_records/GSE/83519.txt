TITLE
Identification of genes with altered expression in head and neck cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Head and neck cancer arises in the mucosal linings of the upper aerodigestive tract. Many genes display an altered expression, but this had been derived from unpaired tumor-mucosa sample series. In this study paired normal mucosa and tumor samples of the same patients are studied.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of 22 tumor samples paired with 22 matched normal mucosa samples

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
