TITLE
A novel Lysyl oxidase like 2 alternative splicing LOXL2 △e13 in esophageal squamous carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A novel alternative splicing isoform of LOXL2 △e13 was expressed ubiquitously in all cell lines and ESCC tissues. In contrast to the impaired deamination enzymatic activity compared with full length LOXL2, LOXL2 △e13 showed an enhanced ability to promote cell mobility and invasiveness in ESCC cells than full length LOXL2 through a different mechanism.

DESIGN
We used cDNA microarrays to identify genes that were differentially expressed upon LOXL2 △ e13 overexpressed. For this purpose, we selected LOXL2 △ e13, WT and empty vector control transfeced ESCC KYSE150 cell lines. Total RNA was extracted,compare the gene expression patterns between LOXL2 △e13, LOXL2 WT and empty vector control transfected cells through the Genechip Primeview Human Gene Expression Array.
