TITLE
Human Calu-3 cell transcriptome response to human interferon α [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA and miRNA analysis with and without interferon α treatment; in parallel, to obtain cell pellets to forward to PNNL for use in top-down proteomics pilot experiments

DESIGN
Human Calu-3 cells were seeded at 1 x 10^6 cells per well on 6 well plates 3 days before infection. Treatments were initiated by replacing culture medium (containing 10% FBS) with fresh medium containing 500 U/ml of human interferon α (PBL Biosciences).  Mock-treated cells were given normal culture medium only.  Mock and treated cells were incubated at 37°C until sample collection time points. Infected samples were collected in quadruplet; time-matched mocks were collected in quadruplet in parallel with infected samples. Time points: 6, 12, and 18 h post-infection
