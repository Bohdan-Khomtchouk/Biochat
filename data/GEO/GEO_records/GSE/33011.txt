TITLE
Suppression of the chromatin remodeling protein CHD3 and platinum resistance in ovarian cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies. Currently platinum-based chemotherapy, coupled with a taxane based drug is the primary treatment for ovarian cancer. Approximately 25% of patients either present with or rapidly develop resistance to platinum based chemotherapy and all recurrent tumors ultimately become resistant. Epigenetic modifications have been associated with tumor formation and progression and may contribute to therapy response. We performed a methylation screen on a set of tumors and have found a number of genes and family members differentially methylated between resistant patients and sensitive patients. Here we show that loss of expression of CHD3, a member of the Mi-2/NuRD complex, causes increased resistance to platinum chemotherapy drugs. Additionally, ovarian cell lines transcriptionally silenced for CHD3 are more invasive, have migratory ability, and display a transformed epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) phenotype. Taken together, we provide the first evidence of a role for CHD3 as an important epigenetic regulator of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer and hypothesize EMT as one of the underlying mechanisms.  Furthermore, CHD3 expression might represent a therapy response predictor  and could be a future therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.

DESIGN
We have developed a method to profile genome wide methylation. 71 ovarian tumor samples and 9 normal tissue samples from individuals were analyzed for CpG methylation. Some of these regions were validated for their methylation as a proof of principle for the method. Kamalakaran S., et. al. Mol Oncol. 2011;5:77-92 (PMID: 21169070).
