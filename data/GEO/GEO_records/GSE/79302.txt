TITLE
Analysis of Sox2-regulated transcriptome in glioma stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma is the most malignant brain tumor in adults and is associated with poor survival despite multimodal treatments. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are cells with properties reminiscent from the normal neural stem cells counterparts. They have been postulated to be the culprit of glioma chemo- and radio-resistance ultimately leading to relapse. Understanding the molecular circuits governing the GSC compartment is essential. Sox2, a critical transcription regulator of embryonic and neural stem cell function, is deregulated in GSCs, but the description of the precise molecular pathways regulated by this gene in GSCs remains poorly understood. Results: We performed a genome-wide analysis of Sox2-regulated transcripts in GSCs, using microarray. We identified a total of 135 differentially expressed coding transcripts and 261 non-coding transcripts (B value > 0). Cell adhesion and cell-cell signaling are among the most enriched terms using GO classification. The pathways altered after Sox2 down-modulation includes multiple cellular processes such as aminoacid metabolism and intercellular signaling cascades. We validate the top 5 down regulated coding genes and one of the top 5 up-regulated coding genes. We also defined and classify the set of non-coding transcripts differentially expressed regulated by Sox2 in GSCs, and validated two of them. Conclusions: We present a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome controlled by Sox2 in GSCs, gaining insights in the understanding of the potential roles of Sox2 in glioblastoma.

DESIGN
Sox2 expression was inhibitd in GSC-11 cell line (human glioblastoma neurosphere cell line) using a specific siRNA against human Sox2 (si-Sox2) and a non-targeting control siRNA (si-scramble) (Ambion) in 4 independent experiments
