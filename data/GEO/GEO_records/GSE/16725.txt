TITLE
Regional brain expression maps for microRNAs in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
MicroRNA transcriptional profiling of male Sprague-Dawley rats rat brains comparing microRNA abundance in five different brain regions.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, regional brain samples vs. universal brain reference. Biological replicates: 4 samples from each region. One sample per array. Each array is divided into 3 replicate subarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL8745 NCode 0.24K multi-species miRNA microarray dual color version 2
