TITLE
Beauveria bassiana SNF 1 (BbSNF1) regulating genes involved in conidiation

ORGANISM
Beauveria bassiana ARSEF 2860

SUMMARY
Gene BbSNF1 playes an essential role in mediating metabolism and cell development during conidation, a determinant to the biocontrol  potential of entomopathogenic fungi.  The genome-wide exprssion analysis involved in fungal conidiation was analyzed by using high throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq). Our transcriptional profiles revealed that numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which involved in metabolism, cell transport and cell rescue, were significantly involved in deveopment of fungal conida.  .

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from BbSNF1 disruption mutant were compared to that of wild type strain (WT) grown on SDA plates (Glucose 4%, Peptone 1%, and Yeast extract 1% plus 1.5% Agar).
