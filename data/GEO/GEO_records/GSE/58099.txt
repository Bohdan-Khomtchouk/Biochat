TITLE
RING1B O-GlcNAcylation regulates gene targeting of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 in human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the DNA binding profile of RING1B (ChIP_HA) and O-GlcNAcylated RING1B (re-ChIP_WGA) in human embryonic stem cells (hESC).

DESIGN
HA-RING1B was recombinantly expressed in hESC. DNA bound by HA-RING1B was enriched through HA-ChIP. DNA bound by O-GlcNAcylated HA-RING1B was enriched thourgh WGA-ChIP.
