TITLE
Relapse versus diagnostic acute myeloid leukaemia samples analysed using Affymetrix 10K SNP array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Relapse is the commonest cause of death in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), but the mechanisms leading to relapse are unclear. Recently, acquisition of segmental uniparental disomy (UPD) by mitotic recombination (MR) has been reported in 15-20% of AML samples at diagnosis using whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. These cytogenetically invisible abnormalities are associated with homozygous mutations in several types of malignancy. Clonal evolution of heterozygous to homozygous mutations by MR could provide a mechanism for relapse. Keywords: DNA copy number, loss of heterozygosity

DESIGN
DNA from 27 pairs of diagnostic and relapsed AML samples were analysed using Affymetrix 10K SNP arrays. The genotype data of relapsed AML were compared with the data from the corresponding presentation AML.
