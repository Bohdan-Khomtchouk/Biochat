TITLE
Expression data of worms under different caloric restriction mimetic treatments

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We used microarray analysis to further our understanding of the mode of action of the well know caloric restriction mimetic rapamycin and the compound Allantoin first studied in the context of aging in this study. His work helps build on our understanding of potential caloric restriction mimetics predicted from our bioinformatic aproach of quering the Connectivity Map, a database of drug-induced gene expression profiles, using the transcriptional profile of CR to identify drugs that induce a similar or opposite gene expression profile.

DESIGN
Wild type worms of eat-2 mutants (a model of caloric restriction) were treated with the compounds of study with 2% DMSO or DMSO alone to serve as controls. All samples were peformed in triplicate.
