TITLE
Expression data from The human glioblastoma cell culture resource: validated cell models representing all molecular subtypes (transcript)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the degree to which the glioma cell lines remained transcriptionally stable under diverse experimental conditions, we transplanted three different lines (U3020MG, U3047MG and U3065MG) intracranially to NOD-SCID mice; explanted the resulting tumors and cultured the cells for two passages, and then isolated RNA from the cell line prior to transplantation (U3020MG-p10, U3047MG-p7, U3065MG-p10), from the xenograft tumor and from the explanted cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from both tumor tissues and glioma cell lines using the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) was labeled and hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array 2.0.  Expression levels were RMA-normalized employing the Affymetrix Expression Console software.
