TITLE
Light and BcLTF1-dependent gene expression profiles in the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea

ORGANISM
Botrytis cinerea

SUMMARY
Full transcriptomes of the Botrytis cinerea wild-type strain B0510 and the null-mutant deltaBcLTF1, cultured in continuous darkness or submitted to a light stimulation, were compared to identify light- or/and BcLTF1-dependent genes.

DESIGN
The Botrytis cinerea wild-type strain and the null-mutant deltaBcLTF1  were cultured for 52h in continuous darkness ; then, cultures were exposed for 60 min to light before harvest (L) or were harvested after additional 60 min darkness (D). 4 replicates were performed. The 16 total-RNA samples (4 conditions* 4 replicates) were used for hybridization on NimbleGen 4plex gene expression arrays (20,885 gene models from Botrytis cinerea with three 60-mer probes per gene).
