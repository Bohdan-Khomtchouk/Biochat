TITLE
Genome-wide identification of eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) miRNAs and their targets reveals differential regulation of heterostyly [Array]

ORGANISM
Macrobrachium nipponense

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of endogenous, non-coding, ~21 nucleotide RNAs, regulate the expression of their target genes by mRNA cleavage or translation inhibition. In plants, miRNAs have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in regulating diverse cellular, physiological, and developmental processes. The identification of all the miRNAs is not yet complete; there are no studies on their possible links with the difference in heterostyly observed in eggplant (Solanum melongena L.).
