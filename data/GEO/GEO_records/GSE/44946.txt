TITLE
Expression data by BRD7552 treatment in PANC-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three master regulatory transcription factors Pdx1, MafA and Ngn3 have the ability to transdifferentiate pancreatic acinar cells to insulin-producing beta cells in mice. BRD7552 was identified as a small-molecule inducer that can upregulate the expression of Pdx1 in PANC-1 cells by high-throughput qPCR screening. We used microarrays to illustrate the mechnism of BRD7552 for PDX1 and insulin induction.

DESIGN
PANC-1 cells were treated with BRD7552 at 5uM, the mininal concentration for the maximal induction of Pdx1. The RNA was isloated at two time points 6-hour and 72-hour.
