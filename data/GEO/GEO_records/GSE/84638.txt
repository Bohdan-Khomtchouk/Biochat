TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in megakaryocytes derived from primary myelofibrosis or healthy individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD34+ cells from healthy individuals or those with primary myelofibrosis were cultured ex vivo under conditions to derive megakaryocytes. Following culture, megakaryocytes were purified by flow cytometry. The gene expression in these cells was determined by Illumina microarray analysis. Note that samples JC1-12 were run at a different time than JC13-24. Investigators may wish to perform the analysis of the two sets independently.
