TITLE
Gene expression analysis in children with complex seizures by influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 or rotavirus gastroenteritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The differences of clinical characteristics in complex seizures induced by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and rotavirus gastroenteritis are well known, but the pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. We analyzed the gene expression profiles in the peripheral whole blood cells isolated from pediatric patients using an Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray. Results provide insights into the difference of the pathogenesis in the patients with complex seizures induced by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and rotavirus infections.

DESIGN
The gene expression profiles in the peripheral whole blood of ten patients (n=5; complex seizures, n=5; control) with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and six patients (n=3; complex seizures, n=3; control) with rotavirus gastroenteritis were examined. Whole blood samples were collected from patients in the acute phase of the disease and in the recovery phase.
