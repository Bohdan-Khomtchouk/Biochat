TITLE
Fractionation iCLIP detects persistent SR protein binding to conserved, retained introns in chromatin, nucleoplasm and cytoplasm

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report a new method which combines subcellular fractionation to advance sequencing technique iCLIP. In this way we identified the spectrum of interactions of two SR-proteins (SRSF3 and SRSF7) to their target RNAs in different subcellular compartments

DESIGN
Examination of 4 replicates for Cytoplasm, Nucleoplasm and Chromatin fractions using Fr-iCLIP technique for SRSF3-GFP; examination of 3 replicates for Cytoplasm, Nucleoplasm and Chromatin fractions using Fr-iCLIP for SRSF7-GFP

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
