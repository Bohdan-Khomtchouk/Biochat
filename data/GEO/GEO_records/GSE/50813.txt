TITLE
Prevention of mammary tumor progression by silencing HoxA1  via intraductal injection of nanoparticle-formulated siRNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Silencing HoxA1 in vivo by intraductal delivery of nanoparticle-formulated siRNA reduced mammary tumor incidence by 75% , reduced cell proliferation, and prevented loss of ER and PR expression.

DESIGN
8 week wild type FVB mouse whole mammary gland and 8week to 20 week transgenic FVB C3(1)-SV40Tag mouse whole mammary gland

PLATFORM
