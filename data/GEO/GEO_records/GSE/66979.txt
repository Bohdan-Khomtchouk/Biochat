TITLE
Comparative genomics reveals Chd1 as a determinant of nucleosome spacing in vivo

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We generated S.cerevisiae strains in which endogenous copies of candidate nucleosome spacing factors were replaced with the K.lactis copies. With this candidate approach, we found that K.lactis Chd1 directed longer nucleosome repeat length in S.cerevisiae. Generating chimeric proteins revealed that the strongest contribution to this differential spacing lies in the undercharacterised N-terminus of Chd1.

DESIGN
nucleosome mapping for S.cerevisiae hho1, ioc3isw1, and chd1 deletion mutants and complemented with the K.lactis copies
