TITLE
Gene expression profile of CAR T cells compared to control ΔCAR T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this experiment was to compare the transcriptional profile of CAR (CD3z endodomain) vs control ΔCAR (truncated version that lacks an endodomain) modified T cells. RNA samples were isolated from trangenic T cells generated from three independent donors.

DESIGN
T cells were sorted 5 days post transduction using a SH800S cell sorter (SONY Biotechnology) to normalize for the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) between transgenic T cells. RNA was isolated at 24 hours after stimulating the transgenic T cells with PSCA antigen using the RNeasy mini plus kit (QIAGEN) and hybridized to the nCounter PanCancer immune profiling panel (human codeset).
