TITLE
Circulating plasma microRNA profiling in patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis before and after treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed to investigate the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the plasma from polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) patients, which fluctuated by treatment. More differentially expressed miRNAs were found in plasma of DM patients compared to PM patients before and after treatment, and their profiles were different.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from plasma of PM/DM patients before and after treatment with prednisolone, or, in case of prednisolone resistance or complications, with the combination of calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine or tacrolims) and/or pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide.
