TITLE
Effect of NDRG3 overexpression on cell response to hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of HeLa cells overexpressing NDRG3 or exposed to hypoxic condition.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of HeLa cells stably expressing NDRG3 were compared to gene expression profiles of HeLa stable cells expressing mock or hypoxia-mediated gene expression profiles.
