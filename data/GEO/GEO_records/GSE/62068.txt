TITLE
Gene expression in whole mouse E9.0 embryos comparing wt with Arid3b-null embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have analysed and compared mRNA expression between wt embryos and embryos deficient for Arid3b at E9.0 days of development, with the aim of identifying differentially expressed genes that could give us a clue to the functions of Arid3b during development.

DESIGN
Four wild-type and four mutant samples, consisting of 3-4 embryos each, were used.
