TITLE
Mouse iNKT cell: Wild type Vs Bcl11b deficient

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse iNKT cells comparing wild type and Bcl11b deficient cell. The mice were treated with 4 μg of α-galactosylceramide. Goal was to determine the effects of transcription  factor Bcl11b removal in iNKT cells.

DESIGN
Intraperitoneal treatment with 4 μg of  α-Galactosylceramide. Two pair of wild type (BCL11b F/F  Vα14 transgenic) and  Knock out (BCL11b F/F PLZF-Cre Vα14 transgenic)) mice were treated. Lymphocytes from spleen and liver were enriched and stain with PBS-57 Loaded CD1d tetramer. Pure iNKT cells were collected  through cell sorter.
