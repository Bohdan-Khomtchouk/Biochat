TITLE
Comparison of mouse genes from the lungs of chronic, acute, tolerant, and non-asthmatic mouse models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of whole lung tissue from three mouse models of asthma Acute asthma was produced by immunization twice, one week apart, of Balb/C mice 8-12 weeks of age with Aspergillus species (5 μg) in adjuvant (1:1 vol/vol). Adjuvant was aluminum and magnesium hydroxide (Pierce). Asthma was initiated by three consecutive intranasal exposures to Aspergillus species (5μg in 15μL saline) and asthma was evaluated 72 hours after the final exposure. Tolerant asthma was produced by intranasal delivery of Aspergillus species (5μg in 15μL saline) twice a week for six consecutive weeks to Balb/C mice 8-12 weeks of age. Asthma was evaluated after mice were rested for an additional three weeks. Chronic asthma was produced by intranasal delivery of the Dustmite/ Ragweed/ Aspergillus (5,50,5ug in 15ul saline) mixture twice a week for six consecutive weeks in female mice Balb/C mice 8-12 weeks of age. Asthma was evaluated 3 weeks after cessation of allergen exposure. Saline control mice were treated intransally with 15ul of saline twice a week for 6 weeks. Asthma was assesed 3 weeks after the final exposure.
