TITLE
Expression data from differentiating Flk1- and Flk1+ ES cells expressing Snail during Wnt inhibition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ES cells differentiated in the presence of the Wnt inhibitor DKK1 fail to express the transcription factor Snail and undergo EMT or mesoderm differentiation.  We generated an ES cell line, A2.snail, that induced Snail expression upon addition of doxycycline addition. Microarrays were used to gain a global picture of Flk1- and Flk1+ cells generated one day after Snail was expressed during Wnt inhibition.
