TITLE
Gene expression profiling of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) following an acute exposure to pulp and paper mill effluents

ORGANISM
Pimephales promelas

SUMMARY
We evaluated the possible mechanisms by which exposure to a sequentially treated pulp and paper mill effluent affects gene expression in the liver of male and female fathead minnows.

DESIGN
Sexually mature fathead minnows were exposed to either river water, which served as our control (C), 10% untreated kraft effluent (UTK), 25% treated kraft effluent (TK) or 100% final effluent (CMO) from a multiprocess pulp and paper mill for 6 days.  A total of 4 treatments.  Each exposure aquarium consisted of a 42.1 L column that contained individual 5.3 L chambers.  Each chamber contained a FHM breeding pair.   A total of 3 biological replicates for male and female FHM per treatment were sent for microarray analysis resulting in a total of 24 arrays run as a reference design with a pooled sample of the 6 river water exposed fish serving as the reference sample..
