TITLE
Gene expression profiles of E15.5 peripheral blastema isolated from Meis1-EGFP transgenic mice using FACS. (GUDMAP Series ID: 17)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing kidney. The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in FACS isolated components of the developing kidney. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. Keywords: Comparison of kidney components.

DESIGN
At specific developmental time points we isolate discrete elements of the kidney by using fluorescent  activated cell sorting (FACS) and then define their gene expression  profiles with microarrays.
