TITLE
Microarray data of mRNA exprssion in ERK/MAPK inactivated P14 mouse sensorimotor cortices

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inactivation of ERK/MAPK signaling in developing postmitotic cortical excitatory neurons results in a significent loss of Ctip2 positive layer 5 neurons and axon projections. Microarray dada revealed the reduced levels of a vast majority of layer V specific transcripts.

DESIGN
ERK/MAPK signaling was inactivated by germline deletion of the gene Mek2 and conditional delection of the gene Mek1 using Nex:Cre driver. Sensorimotor cortices were dissected from 3 pair of mutant and control mice at the age of P14. Total RNAs were extracted using Qiagen miRNeasy kit and subjected to quality check and microarray analysis. Total 6 samples.
