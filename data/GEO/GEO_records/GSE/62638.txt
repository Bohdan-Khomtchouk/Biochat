TITLE
Expression data from ZBP1-expression and ZBP1 nonexpression breast tumors.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ZBP1/IMP1 is an mRNA binding protein that post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of a handful mRNAs, implicated in maintaining cell polarity and adhesion. We have previously shown that ZBP1 was able to inhibit proliferation and invasiveness of breast carcinoma cells in vitro. In the current study, we utilized orthotopic breast fat pad xenografts to further investigate the ZBP1-mediated functions in breast tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. We used microarrays to identify important gene for breast tumor growth and metastasis in response to ZBP1 expression

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from breast tumor generated from ZBP1-expression and ZBP1-nonexpression MDA231 cells and used for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain gene expression profiles from the individual tumors and identify what genes are up-regulated or down-regulated in the presence of ZBP1. The microarray experiments and data analysis were performed in 'Gene Company Limited' in Senzheng, China. G-10 and G-13, Tumors generated from MDA231/GFP cells; I-5 and I-6, tumors generated from MDA231/ZBP1-GFP cells.

PLATFORM
