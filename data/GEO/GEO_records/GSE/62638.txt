TITLE
Expression data from ZBP1-expression and ZBP1 nonexpression breast tumors.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ZBP1/IMP1 is an mRNA binding protein that post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of a handful mRNAs, implicated in maintaining cell polarity and adhesion. We have previously shown that ZBP1 was able to inhibit proliferation and invasiveness of breast carcinoma cells in vitro. In the current study, we utilized orthotopic breast fat pad xenografts to further investigate the ZBP1-mediated functions in breast tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. We used microarrays to identify important gene for breast tumor growth and metastasis in response to ZBP1 expression
