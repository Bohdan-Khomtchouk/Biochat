TITLE
Myeloid cell derived inducible nitric oxide synthase suppresses M1 macrophage polarization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression between WT and iNOS defecient M1 macrophage

DESIGN
RNA microarray was performed using RNA isolated from M1 polarized macrophages from WT and iNOS deficient mice stimulated with LPS/IFNÎ³ for 6 hours. Total RNA was extracted using a RNeasy plus kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), and the array was performed on an Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip (Illumina, USA) by the Genomics Core Facility at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
