TITLE
SNP Analysis of Primary Glioblastoma Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic abnormalities that are associated with mesecnhmal phenotype of GBM were detected in glioblastoma cell lines. Keywords: SNP array analysis of glioblastome cell lines.

DESIGN
Whole genomic DNA of GBM cell lines (W-98, D431, F-502, and S-496) and the fibroblast cell line were evaluated for allelic imbalances and chromosomal copy number abnormalities by using a highdensity single-nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) array analysis (Affymetrix XbaI 131 Array).
