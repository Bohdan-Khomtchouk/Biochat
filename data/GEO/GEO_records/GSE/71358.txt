TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in xenograft tissue stably expressing ShRNA KDM1A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to chacterise the effect of KDM1A knocking down on genome-wide gene expression in human NSCLC cells in vivo. Affymetrix human transcriptome array 2.0 was used to profile the transcriptome of xenograft tumors derived from PC9 cells stably expressing either ShRNA KDM1A or ShRNA control. These cells were subcutanously injected into the right axillary of the mouse, and allowd to grow for 5 weeks to form xenograft tumors. Although KDM1A is up-regulated in NSCLC, but key genes and pathways regulated by KDM1A was not well-understood in NSCLC. Using this approach, we have shown that KDM1A repressed or activated a distinctive set of pathways and key target genes in vivo. This first comprehesive study of transciptome profile upon KDM1A koncking-down in vivo highlights the distinctive pathways regulated by KDM1A during NSCLC tumorigenesis, and it will help to identify new therapeutic targets for NSCLC treatment.

DESIGN
Xenograft tumors derived from two cell lines: PC9 cells stably expressing ShRNA KDM1A or ShRNA control. We extracted total RNA from 3 independent xenograft tumors per cell line.
