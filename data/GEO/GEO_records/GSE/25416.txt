High-resolution genome-wide in vivo footprinting of diverse transcription factors in human cells (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Using DNaseI hypersensitivity (HS) assays (Dnase-seq), high resolution DNaseI digestion profiles were generated genome-wide in diverse human cell types.  We showed that within general regions of DNaseI HS that are known to identify locations of gene regulatory elements, DNaseI digestion patterns allowed us to identify locations of individual transcription factor binding sites that protected against the bound DNA against digestion. To measure the accuracy of these footprints, we also generated ChIP-seq data for the CTCF DNA binding factor in the same cell growths.  We found that DNaseI footprints containing the CTCF canonical binding motif show significant ChIP-seq signal while CTCF binding motifs not in footprints show almost no signal providing one measure of valdation of the DNaseI footprints.
