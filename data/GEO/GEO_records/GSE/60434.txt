TITLE
Hypoxia-induced TET-TNFa-p38-MAPK signaling axis drives tumor malignancy of human breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hypoxia, a hallmark of most solid tumors, leads to aberrations in epigenetic modifications promoting malignant tumor phenotypes, including metastatic features and stem cell-like characteristics. Aberrant DNA methylation has been considered to play an essential role during tumor progression and tightly associate with tumor malignancy. However, the mechanism by which hypoxia alters DNA methylation to promote tumor malignancy remains poorly understood. Ten-eleven translocation 1-3 (TET1-3) proteins, which catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), play a critical role in the DNA demethylation that controls different biological processes. Here we demonstrate that the expression of TET1 and TET3 is closely associated with tumor hypoxia, tumor malignancy and poor prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Hypoxia results in deregulation of TET1 and TET3, leading to breast tumor initiating cell (BTIC) properties. Mechanically, hypoxia regulates expression of TET1 and TET3 via hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), thereby resulting in 5hmC genome-wide changes, which in turn leads to the upregulation of TNFa expression and activation of its downstream p38-MAPK pathway. Importantly, signal transduction through the TET-TNFa-p38-MAPK signaling axis is required for the acquisition of BTIC characteristics and chemotherapy resistance, leading to more malignant tumor phenotypes. Inhibition of the hypoxia-TET-TNFÎ±-p38-MAPK signaling pathway results in compromised BTIC properties and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a possible therapeutic strategy.
