SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of invasive breast cancer events from the tamoxifen prevention trial validates low estrogen receptor mRNA level as the main determinant of tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. In NSABP Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT), tamoxifen reduced the incidence of estrogen receptor (ER) positive tumors but not estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. More importantly, only 69% of estrogen receptor positive tumors were prevented by tamoxifen. The ER positive tumors arising in tamoxifen arm provides an ideal clinical model for acquired tamoxifen resistance. Based on data from NSABP trial B14 which showed linear prediction of the degree of benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen by the levels of ESR1 mRNA coding for ER-alpha, we hypothesized a priori that level of ESR1 mRNA would be lower in ER positive tumors arising in tamoxifen arm compared to those in placebo arm of BCPT.
