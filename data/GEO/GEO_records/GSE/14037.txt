TITLE
Membrane-polysome associated fractionation of HES2 embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The membrane fraction and the cytosolic fraction of HES2 cells were collected and subjected to microarray.  The experiment was performed in triplicate Keywords: membrane-polysome fractionation of RNA

DESIGN
Three consecutive passages of HES2 cells were grown and subject to membrane-polysome fractionation.  A total of 6 samples, (3 replicates of 2 fractions) were included in the experiment
