TITLE
MicroRNA expression from ARPE-19 cells:  control and PDTC treated.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cultured cell line ARPE-19 is frequently employed in studies of rpe function.  Here we have identified the microRNAs expressed in RPE cells in the presence and absence of PDTC (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate), an antioxidant.

DESIGN
Analysis used microrNA extracted from untreated cells as a control for cells treated with PDTC
