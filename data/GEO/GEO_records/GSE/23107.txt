TITLE
MicroRNA expression from ARPE-19 cells:  control and PDTC treated.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The cultured cell line ARPE-19 is frequently employed in studies of rpe function.  Here we have identified the microRNAs expressed in RPE cells in the presence and absence of PDTC (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate), an antioxidant.
