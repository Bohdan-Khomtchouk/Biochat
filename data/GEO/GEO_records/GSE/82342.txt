TITLE
Beta-catenin hyperactivation in embryonic pancreas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying beta catenin activation in embryonic pancreas.

DESIGN
Pancreas were obtained at E13.5 developmental stage from control and Pdx-Cre beta catenin-exon3 floxed (active) embryos
