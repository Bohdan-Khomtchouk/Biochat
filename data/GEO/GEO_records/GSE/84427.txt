TITLE
Response of Streptococcus mutans wild type and lrgAB-deficient strains to environemntal stressors encountered in the oral cavity

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans

SUMMARY
We assesed the transcriptional response of wild-type and isogenic lrgAB mutant to growth in the presence of three different stress conditions (aerobiosis, high-temperature, and the cell-wall active antibiotic vancomycin) by using RNA-seq

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels at the mid-exponential phase of growth, in triplicates
