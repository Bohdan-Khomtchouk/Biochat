TITLE
Transcriptional response in influenza-infected lungs from C57BL/6 wt, 129S7 wt and IFNAR-/- (129) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to analyse the global program of gene expression in response to Influenza A (X31) infection in lungs from C57BL/6 wt, 129S7 wt and IFNAR-/- (129) mice.

DESIGN
Mock- or 5 day influenza A (X31)-infected total lungs from mice with the indicated genotypes were collected and processed for expression profiling.
