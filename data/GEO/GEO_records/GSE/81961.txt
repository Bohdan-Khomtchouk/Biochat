TITLE
Peripheral Blood Methylation Profiling of Female Crohnâ€™s Disease Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of female Crohn's disease patients versus healthy female controls. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs in peripheral blood samples. Samples included 25 healthy controls and 18 female patients with histologically confirmed CD.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 43 samples (25 healthy controls and 18 female patients with histologically confirmed CD) were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip Please note that three patient samples (Crohn100, Crohn32, and Crohn75) did not pass QC test and were removed from data processing. Therefore, only 15 patient samples are included in the records.
