TITLE
YAP conveys an invasive phenotype to clear cell renal cell carcinoma cell lines via endothelin-2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the biological mechanisms underlying the oncogenic properties of YAP in ccRCC the human ccRCC cell line MZ1774 was transduced with lentivirus containing a shRNA-cassette targeting YAP-mRNA. Expression profiles of MZ1774 YAP knockdown cells were compared to mock-transduced control cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA from MZ1774 cells stably expressing shRNA directed against YAP compared to mock-transduced MZ1174 cells
