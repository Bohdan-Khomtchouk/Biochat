TITLE
Effects of EDAG knockdown on gene expression profiles in human erythroid cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effects of EDAG knockdown on gene exrpession profile in human cord blood CD34+ cells with EPO treatment with microarray assay. Freshly isolated human cord blood CD34+ cells were pre-activated for 24 hours and then infected with EDAG RNAi lentivirus or control lentivirus for 3 times within 24 hours. Then the cells were cultured in the presence of EPO to induce erythroid differentiation. Four days later, the cells were harvested for microarray test. The microarray showed that 3149 differentially expressed genes in siEDAG group compared to control group.The altered genes were associated with gene exrpression, cell cycle and hematopoietic differentiation. These data show that EDAG knckdown led to down-regulation of erythroid genes which are activated by GATA1.

DESIGN
Human CD34+ cells infected with EDAG RNAi or control lentivirus were treated with EPO (5U/ml) for 4 days and gene expression were measured using Agilent human whole Genome 8*60K array. Two replicates.
