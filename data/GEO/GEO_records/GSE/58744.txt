TITLE
Comparative Genome-Wide Profiling of Transposon and Retrovirus Integration Sites in Primary Human CD4+ T Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We mapped Sleeping Beauty (SB) and piggyBac (PB) insertions in primary human CD4+ T cells and compared their insertion profiles with those of the MLV retrovirus and the HIV lentivirus with respect to proximity to genes, TSSs, CpG islands, DNase I hypersensitive sites, repetitive elements, chromatin marks and transcriptional status of genes.

DESIGN
Examination of two transposon systems in one cell type.

PLATFORM
