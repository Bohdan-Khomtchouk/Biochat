TITLE
Genetic and genomic analysis of hyperlipidemia, obesity and diabetes using TALLYHO x C57BL6 F2 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the most common form of diabetes in humans and is closely associated with dyslipidemia and obesity that magnifies the mortality and morbidity related to T2D. The TALLYHO/JngJ (TH) mouse is a polygenic model for T2D characterized by obesity, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose uptake and tolerance, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia. To determine the genetic factors that contribute to these T2D related characteristics in TH mice, we interbred TH mice with C57BL/6J (B6) mice. The parental, F1, and F2 mice were phenotyped at 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks of age for 4-hour fasting plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin, and glucose levels, as well as body weights. Fat pad and carcass weights were measured at 24 weeks after sacrificing the mice. The F2 mice were genotyped genome-wide for 68 markers. Of 393 genotyped F2 mice, 16 were chosen from the extremes of the triglyceride distribution (8 high and 8 low), and liver, pancreas, muscle and adipose tissue were measured for gene expression. Gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis aided in selection of candidates underlying hyperlipidemia, diabetes and obesity QTLs. We identified several genetic loci that affected quantitative variation in plasma lipid and glucose levels and obesity traits.

DESIGN
16 (8 high and 8 low) out of 393 F2 mice were chosen from the extremes of the triglyceride distribution, excluding overtly diabetic mice, and liver, pancreas, muscle and adipose tissue were measured for gene expression. In addition to data from the 64 microarrays on the 16 mice, a supplemental file with phenotypes and marker genotypes is provided for all mice as a supplementary file on the Series record (below). Mouse identification numbers are included to connect the data files.
