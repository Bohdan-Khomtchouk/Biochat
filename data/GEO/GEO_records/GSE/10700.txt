TITLE
Time course of NHBE cells exposed to whole cigarette smoke

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression patterns were assessed in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells exposed to cigarette smoke from a reference cigarette (2R4F, University of Kentucky) and a typical American brand of " light " cigarettes ( " Lights " ) in order to develop a better understanding of the genomic impact of tobacco exposure, which can ultimately define biomarkers that discriminate tobacco-related effects and outcomes in a clinical setting.  NHBE cells were treated with whole cigarette smoke for 15 minutes and alterations to the transcriptome assessed at 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours post-exposure using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. Keywords: time course, cigarette smoke exposure

DESIGN
4 replicate Petri dishes of cells were exposed in a custom-built smoke exposure chamber. Cigarettes were smoked as per FTC protocols, and the smoke diluted such that the cells were at least 50% viable as compared to mock (air)-exposed controls after 24h. RNA from each replicate dish was analyzed using a separate array. Four replicates of an incubator (untreated with either smoke or air) are included also.
