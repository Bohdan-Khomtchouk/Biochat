TITLE
lonB mutant

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato str. DC3000

SUMMARY
The bacterial Lon protease participates in a variety of biological processes. In Pseudomonas syringae, mutation of lon is known to activate hrpL and a few hrpL-regulated genes in the rich medium. The elevated expression of hrpL and hrpL-regulated genes results from of increased stability of HrpR, the transcriptional activator of hrpL, in the lon mutant. Here we conducted a microarray analysis to determine genes that are differently expressed in the lon- mutant of P. s. pv. tomato DC3000 grown in the rich medium KB. Most genes induced in the lon- mutant belong to the HrpL-regulon or are related to the transcription, protein synthesis, and energy metabolism. The major group of genes reduced in the lon- mutant is related to cell wall biogenesis. The HrpL-regulated genes exhibit different induction patterns in the lon- mutant, suggesting the involvement of regulators additional to HrpL in regulating these genes. Compared with the wild type bacteria, the lon- mutants exhibit elevated hrpL expression in KB medium but reduced hrpL expression in the minimal medium (MM). The reduced hrpL RNA is correlated with the reduced hrpR and hrpS RNAs, suggesting that the Lon-mediated regulation of hrpL involves different mechanisms in KB and MM. Consistent with the reduced expression of the hrpL in MM, the lon- mutants are less pathogenic on host plants. Keywords: Expression profiles of lonB mutant in KB
