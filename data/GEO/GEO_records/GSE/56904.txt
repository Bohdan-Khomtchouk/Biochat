TITLE
Study of Foxp3 expression in tumor-associated macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using 5 differents approaches, including RNA sequencing, we demonstrated that macrophages that specifically infiltrate renal tumors, express the immunosuppressive transcription factor Foxp3.

DESIGN
Examination of the Foxp3 mRNA expression in 3 different cell subsets (including CD4 T cells (CD4), type-1 macrophages (M1) and type-2 macrophages (M2))

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
