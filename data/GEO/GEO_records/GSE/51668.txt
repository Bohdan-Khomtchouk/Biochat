TITLE
Raptor/mTORC1-dependent metabolic programming of exit from quiescence underlies T cell activation and fate decisions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Na√Øve T cells respond to antigen stimulation by exiting from quiescence into clonal expansion and functional differentiation, but the control mechanism is elusive. Here we describe that Raptor/mTORC1-dependent metabolic reprogramming is a central determinant of this transitional process. Loss of Raptor abrogates T cell priming and Th2 cell differentiation, although Raptor function is less important for continuous proliferation of actively cycling cells. mTORC1 coordinates multiple metabolic programs in T cells including glycolysis, lipid synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation to mediate antigen-triggered exit from quiescence. mTORC1 further links glucose metabolism to the initiation of Th2 differentiation by orchestrating cytokine receptor expression and cytokine responsiveness. Activation of Raptor/mTORC1 integrates T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 co-stimulatory signals in antigen-stimulated T cells. Our studies identify a Raptor/mTORC1-dependent pathway linking signal-dependent metabolic reprogramming to quiescence exit, and this in turn coordinates lymphocyte activation and fate decisions in adaptive immunity.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to explore the gene expression profiles differentially expressed in CD4+ T-cells from wild-type (WT) and CD4(cre) x Raptor(fl/fl) mice before and after stimulation with anti CD3/CD28 antibodies.
