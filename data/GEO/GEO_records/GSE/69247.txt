TITLE
Transcriptional effect of the luteinizing hormone surge in bovine granulosa cells during the peri-ovulation period

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Granulosa cells from three different stages were used to assess the short- and long-term effects of luteinizing hormone (LH) on follicle differentiation: 1) 2 h before induction of the LH surge, 2) 6 h and 3) 22 h after the LH surge.

DESIGN
Three time points experiment: 2h pre-LH, 6h post-LH and 22h post-LH. Granulosa cells from the 6h post-LH and 22h post-LH were compared to the 2h pre-LH. Biological replicates: 4 from each time point. One replicate per array. Dye-swaps were performed.

PLATFORM
