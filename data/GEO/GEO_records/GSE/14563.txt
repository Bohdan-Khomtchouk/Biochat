TITLE
Liver gene expression in a panel of laboratory inbred mouse strains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to perform gene expression quantitative trait locus mapping (eQTL) in the livers of a panel of 36 laboratory inbred strains.  Mice were dosed with a saline solution by oral gavage and sacrificed at 24 hours. Livers were removed at sacrifice, RNA was extracted and gene expression was assayed using the Agilent G4121A array. Keywords: eQTL, mouse, liver

DESIGN
73 arrays were run on 36 laboratory inbred strains, with one to three arrays per strain.
