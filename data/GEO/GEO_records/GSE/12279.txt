TITLE
Functional cooperation between AAA-ATPase domain and a bromodomain.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A functional cooperation between an AAA type ATPase domain and a bromodomain has been evidenced. These two domains were identified and their activity tested in a yet uncharacterized factor, named Atad2, whose two-domain configuration remained highly conserved during evolution. In human and mouse, Atad2 is most abundantly expressed in testis and in the mouse. It has also been detected in post-meiotic stages and in mature spermatozoa. The AAA-ATPase domain was found necessary for protein multimerization and high affinity binding to acetylated nucleosomes by its bromodomain. The binding was found specific to acetylated histone H4 tail with a critical role for the acetylated K5 position. In vivo studies show that Atad2 behaves as a general repressor of transcription and possesses a chromatin “freezing” activity. Finally, we demonstrate that the induction of apoptosis leads to an early degradation of Atad2, which probably facilitates the action of apoptotic factors by increasing chromatin dynamics.
