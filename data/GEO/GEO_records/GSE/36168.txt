TITLE
Expression data from LCMV-infected P14 and Akt transgenic P14 CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway impacts various aspects of CD8 T cell homeostasis, such as effect versus memory cell differentiation, during viral infection. We used microarrays to determine which downstream molecules were affected and what other signaling pathways were interconnected with the Akt pathway by constitutive activation of Akt in LCMV-infected CD8 T cells.

DESIGN
Splenocytes from naive P14/WT or P14/Akt mice were stained with anti-CD8 and anti-Ly5.1, and CD8 T cells were sorted using a FACSAria II instrument. Purified Ly5.1+ CD8 T cells from P14/WT or P14/Akt mice were transferred into B6 mice, which were subsequently infected with LCMV Armstrong. At day 8 post infection, splenocytes were stained with anti-CD8, anti-Ly5.1, anti-KLRG1, and anti-CD127. Following staining, short-lived effector cells (SLECs) and memory precursor effector cells (MPECs) were sorted using the FACSAria II instrument; the purity of the sorted cells was > 95%.  A total of 5 samples were analyzed, including WT naive, WT SLEC, WT MPEC, Akt naive and Akt SLEC.
