TITLE
DNA copy number changes in colorectal flat adenomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background & aim: Flat adenomas form a specific phenotype of colorectal adenomas that has been associated with more severe molecular changes and consequently a more aggressive clinical behavior compared to their polypoid counterparts. In the present study we set out to compare one of the molecular changes most explicitly associated with adenoma to carcinoma progression, i.e. chromosomal instability, between flat and polypoid colorectal adenomas. Methods: Consecutive series of 83 flat and 35 polypoid adenomas were analyzed for DNA copy number changes using a high resolution arrayCGH platform as well as for mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Gene ontology on the genes located on the significantly different regions was performed. Results: Overall, flat adenomas show similar DNA copy number changes as polypoid adenomas. Patterns of DNA copy number changes differed between the two phenotypes with significantly more frequently loss of 5q14.3 and 5q15-q23.3 in flat adenomas, while loss of 1p36.32-p35.3, 10q25.2-q25.3, 17p12 and chromosome 18 were more frequent in polypoid adenomas. The 5q15-q23.3 region harbors the APC locus, therefore mutation status of APC was investigated, showing significantly less mutations in flat adenomas. Pathway analysis and datamining linked the 5q region to inflammation. Conclusion: These results provide evidence that flat and polypoid adenomas have partly overlapping DNA copy number changes, while alterations more specific to flat adenomas have associations with inflammation. Loss of 5q has been associated with aggressive behavior and this could serve as an explanation for a more aggressive clinical behavior of flat lesions.

DESIGN
FFPE colorectal tissue samples of 35 polypoid adenomas and 83 flat adenomas. Test samples were compared to an external pool of normal male/female reference DNA.
