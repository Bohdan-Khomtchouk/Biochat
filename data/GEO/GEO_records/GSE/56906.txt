TITLE
Effect of EtOH on neural stem cells derived from human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have performed gene expression microarray analysis to profile transcriptomic signatures affected by EtOH during neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells

DESIGN
H1 human embryonic stem cells were differentiated into neural rosettes and neural progenitor cells in the presence or absence of 20mM EtOH treatment. Undifferentiated passage 40 H1 cells were used as a parental control. Total RNA was isolated from biological duplicates and subjected to gene expression profiling analysis using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 Array
