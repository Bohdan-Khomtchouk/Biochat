TITLE
Characterisation of Transcriptional Changes in the Spinal Cord of the Progressive Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis ABH Mouse Model by RNA Sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing was used to explore global gene expression in the chronic relapsing and secondary progressive EAE (pEAE)  Biozzi ABH mouse model of MS. Spinal cord tissue RNA from pEAE Biozzi ABH mice and healthy littermate controls was sequenced. 2,072 genes were differentially expressed (q < 0.05) from which 1,397 were significantly upregulated and 675 were significantly downregulated. This hypothesis-free investigation characterised the genomic changes that describe the pEAE mouse model.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 control and 3 pEAE mice

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
