TITLE
comparison of powdery mildew-induced gene expression between Col-0 and the edr1 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The edr1 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana displays enhanced resistance to the powdery mildew Golovinomyces cichoracearum, resulting in cell death and an absence of visible disease symptoms.  To better characterize and understand the defense response of edr1, a time course of early signaling responses was performed after inoculation with powdery mildew and compared to the responses of wild-type Col-0.  These time points represent early stages in the infection process, before any signs of susceptibility or resistance are visible.

DESIGN
Four-week-old Col-0 and edr1 plants were inoculated with powdery mildew and whole rosettes were collected at 0, 18, 36, and 96 hours post inoculation.  Each sample is a pool of four rosettes processed together.
