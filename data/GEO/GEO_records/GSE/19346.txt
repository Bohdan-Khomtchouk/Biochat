TITLE
Expression data from wildtype Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm1021 and an hfq mutant

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
The RNA-binding protein Hfq is a global regulator, which controls diverse cellular processes in bacteria. To begin understanding the role of Hfq in the Sinorhizobium meliloti-Medicago truncatula nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, we defined free-living and symbiotic phenotypes of an hfq mutant. Over 500 transcripts were differentially accumulated in the hfq mutant of S. meliloti Rm1021 when grown in a shaking culture.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm1021 or its isogenic hfq deletion mutant, grown to late exponential phase in rich medium, was performed using custom Affymetrix GeneChips.
