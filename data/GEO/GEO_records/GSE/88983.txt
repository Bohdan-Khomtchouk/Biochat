TITLE
TRF2-ChipSeq in post mitotic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the TRF2 binding sites in post mitotic mammalian cells under TRF2 (protein level) modulation. By obtaining sequences from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of differentiated muscle cells (myotubes). Importantly we find that TRF2 levels are correlated with age (R= 0.60) making our results of importance in regards of the changes that occur in the chromatin landscape upon aging. We found multiple TRF2 binding sites that are conserved across cell types (Young et al., 2008, Simonet et al., 2011) highlighting the central role of TRF2 as a key chromatin modifier and gene regulator.
