TITLE
PI3K/AKT pathway is activated by miRNA-22 in the proliferative CLL subset (miRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Understanding the crosstalk between malignant B-cells and their milieu could provide clues on the molecular and clinical biology of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Aiming to generate novel therapeutic strategies, different groups have studied different CLL proliferative fractions. We previously, identified one of these proliferative subsets in the peripheral blood from progressive unmutated CLL patients. Since the presence of this small subset appears to be a hallmark of a proliferative disease in which B lymphocytes are being constitutively activated in the proliferative centers of these patients, we performed gene expression analysis comparing the global mRNA and microRNAs expression of this leukemic subpopulation. Our results suggest that the proliferative behaviour of this fraction appears to depend on microRNA-22 over-expression, which induces PTEN downregulation and PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Transfection experiments demonstrated that miR-22 overexpression in CLL B-cells switches on PI3K/AKT leading to FOXO1 inactivation, p27-Kip1 downregulation, and overexpression of Survivin and Ki-67 proteins. We also demonstrated that this pathway could be triggered by microenvironment signals like CD40L/IL4 and more importantly, that this regulatory loop is also present in lymph nodes from progressive UM patients. Altogether, these results underline the key role of PI3K/AKT pathway in the generation of the CLL proliferative pool and provide rationale for the usage of PI3K inhibitors.

DESIGN
B cells from Chronic Lymphpcytic Leukaemia patients were isolated from blood. By sorting experiments we purify the QF from PF from progressive patients. We extract the total RNA from 8 samples and perform microRNA arrays.
