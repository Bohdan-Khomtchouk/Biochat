Expression profiling of whole liver in 31 BxD mouse strains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A genetical-genomics study underaken in 31 BxD strains using whole liver: as used in Williams, Cotsapas et al, Nature Genetics, 2006. Keywords: genetical-genomics

DESIGN
Each sample is a single hybridisation from a given BxD strain to a C57 reference sample. Two-colour glass arrays were used. No dye swaps were employed. Full details are avaiable in the supplementary material of PMID:16874319.
