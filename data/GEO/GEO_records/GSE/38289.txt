TITLE
Effects of DHT on the ovary of fathead minnow

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Fathead minnow ovary explants were incubated with DHT at 10^-6M for 6, 9, and 12 hours. Estrogen production was significantly increased in these ovaries at all three time points.

DESIGN
control 6 hours (n=4), DHT 6 hours (n=5), control 9 hours (n=5), DHT 9 hours (n=5), control 12 hours (n=4), DHT 12 hours (n=4),
