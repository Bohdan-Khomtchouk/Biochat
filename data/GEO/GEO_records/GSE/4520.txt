TITLE
Mouse cerebellar libraries:Ethanol-treated and controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
P300 and P720 C57BL6/J male mice were exposed to ethanol vapor (95% w/v) for 3 hours each day for a total of 5 days. Blood alcohol levels in the ethanol treated animals was 3.0mg/ml. Controls at P300 and P720 were included. Keywords: SAGE-dose response

DESIGN
All C57BL/6 male mice were sacrificed and the cerebellum was quickly removed. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol. For the creation of the libraries, 40micrograms of total RNA was used. cDNA was synthesized on oligo dt beads. Enzyme: NlaIII Vector: pZERO-I

PLATFORM
GPL11 SAGE:10:NlaIII:Mus musculus
