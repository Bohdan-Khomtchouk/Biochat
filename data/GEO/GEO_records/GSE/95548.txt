TITLE
Transgenic Plasmodium falciparum blood stage parasites F12/GDV1-GFP-DD: control (-Shield-1;F12/GDV1-GFP-DDOFF) vs GDV1-overexpressing (+Shield-1;F12/GDV1-GFP-DDON) parasites

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of transgenic P. falciparum blood stage parasites expressing an ectopic copy of GDV1-GFP-DD (F12/GDV1-GFP-DD). The DD (FKBP destabilisation domain) allows for the conditional expression of fusion proteins: DD fusion proteins are rapidly degraded or stably expressed in absence or presence of the stabilising ligand Shield-1, respectively (Banaszynski LA, Chen LC, Maynard-Smith LA, Ooi AG, Wandless TJ. A rapid, reversible, and tunable method to regulate protein function in living cells using synthetic small molecules.Cell. 2006 Sep 8;126(5):995-1004). The goal of this experiment was to identify genes differentially expressed in response to induced GDV1 overexpression.
