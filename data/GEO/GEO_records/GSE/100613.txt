TITLE
Drosophila TFIIB ChIP-seq after CBP inhibition

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
TFIIB chromatin binding is drastically reduced genome-wide after 10 min of CBP (also known as nejire) inhibition.

DESIGN
Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells were treated with control (C37) or the CBP inhibitor C646 for 10 min, fixed with with formaldehyde, and chromatin prepared. One percent Drosophila virilis chromatin was mixed with this chromatin (spike-in). An antibody raised against Drosophila TFIIB (gift from Jim Kadonaga, UCSD) was used for ChIP-seq.
