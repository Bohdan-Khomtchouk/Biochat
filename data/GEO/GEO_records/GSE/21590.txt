TITLE
Reaeration timecourse from a defined hypoxia model

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Reaeration timecourse from a defined hypoxia model in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The mechanism by which mycobacteria return to a replicating state upon re-exposure to favorable conditions is not well understood. In this study, we utilized reaeration from a defined hypoxia model to characterize the adaptive response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) following a return to favorable growth conditions. Global transcriptional analysis identified the ~100 gene Reaeration Response, induced relative to both log-phase and hypoxic MTB. This response includes chaperones and proteases, as well as the transcription factor Rv2745c, a Clp protease gene regulator (ClgR) orthologue.  During reaeration, genes repressed during hypoxia are also upregulated in a wave of transcription that includes genes crucial to transcription, translation and oxidative phosphorylation.

DESIGN
Each reaerating culture compared at multiple timepoints to a sample from the same culture at seven days of hypoxia. Three or more replicates at each timepoint.
