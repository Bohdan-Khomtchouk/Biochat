TITLE
Transcriptional Signatures of Hypoxic and Inflammatory Renal Epithelial Injury

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify RNA transcripts involved in acute and chronic renal epithelial injury, we performed unbiased whole transcriptome profiling of human proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) in hypoxic and inflammatory conditions. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that the protein-coding and noncoding transcriptomic landscape differed between hypoxia-stimulated and cytokine-stimulated human PTECs.

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptomic response of human PTECs to hypoxic or inflammatory injury

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
