TITLE
Estrogen inhibits lipid content in liver exclusively from membrane receptor signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Membrane estrogen receptor (ER) alpha stimulates AMP kinase to suppress SREBP1 processing and lipids in liver Here we present evidence that signaling from membrane-localized ERalpha similarly suppresses a subset of mRNAs in the livers of female WT and membrane only estrogen receptor (MOER) transgenic mice but not in estrogen receptor knock out (ERKO) mice

DESIGN
Three month old wild type, MOER and ERKO mice were ovariectomized and utilized per IRB-approved. Following ovariectomy and recovery the animals were injected intraperitoneally with PPT (100 Î¼g) or oil placebo (0.1 mL) daily for 3 days. Whole livers were removed upon euthanasia.
