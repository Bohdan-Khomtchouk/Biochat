TITLE
Activin/Nodal signalling controls divergent transcriptional networks in pluripotent and endoderm progenitors.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Activin/Nodal signalling is necessary to maintain pluripotency of human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs) and to induce their differentiation towards endoderm. However, the mechanisms by which Activin/Nodal signalling achieves these opposite functions remain unclear. To unravel these mechanisms, we examined the transcriptional network controlled in hESCs by Smad2 and Smad3 which represent the direct effectors of Activin/Nodal signalling. These analyses reveal that Smad2/3 participate in the control of the core transcriptional network characterising pluripotency which includes Oct-4, Nanog, FoxD3, Dppa4, Tert, Myc and UTF-1. In addition, similar experiments performed on endoderm cells confirm that a broad part of the transcriptional network directing differentiation is downstream of Smad2/3. Therefore, Activin/Nodal signalling appears to control divergent transcriptional networks in hESCs and in endoderm. Importantly, we observed an overlap between the transcriptional network downstream of Nanog and Smad2/3 in hESCs while functional studies showed that both factors cooperate to control the expression of pluripotency genes. Therefore, the effect of Activin/Nodal signalling on pluripotency and differentiation could be dictated by tissue specific Smad2/3 partners such as Nanog, explaining the mechanisms by which signalling pathways can orchestrate divergent cell fate decisions.
