TITLE
ChIP-Seq of RNA polymerase and co-factors in Jurkat T-ALL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription of oncogenes is regulated by co-factors, some of which are now targetable with small molecules.  This series contains ChIP-Seq targeting transcriptional co-factors and RNA polymerase from cells treated with small molecules targeting co-factors.

DESIGN
