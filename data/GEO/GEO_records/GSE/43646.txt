time course expression profile of ap1-cal after induction of an ap1-transgene-Time course of meiotic gene expression in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs11-09_meotic - time course expression profile of ap1-cal after induction of an ap1-transgene - CDKs are major regulators of the mitotic as well as the meiotic cell cycle. In comparison with the mitotic cell cycle much less is known about the regulation of meiosis, especially in plants. One of the reasons for this is the very low abundance and the difficult accessibility of cell undergoing meiosis. We have developed a system to enrich for meiocytes. This will be the material with which we will search for CDK substrates in a biochemical approach. To first get an overview about the meiotic genes expressed in this system, we want to perform here a time series at four time points after the induction that leads to the synchronized development of meiocytes. The in the microarray identified genes, will then set the frame for the upcoming biochemical experiments. - An ap1-cal double mutants carrying an Glucocorticoid-receptor fusion to AP1 was indcued and samples were collected 2 days after induction (dai), 8dapi, 9dai, 10dai and 11dai. Then, the expression profile of 2dai were compared with 8dai, 8 with 9, 9 with 10, and 10 with 11.
