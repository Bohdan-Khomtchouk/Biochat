TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of differential gene expression after treatment of the PLCε inhibitor U73122 in colorectal CD110+TICs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of PLCε-regulation of tyrosine metabolism at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that the PLCε pathway-directed transcriptional control play a key role for metabolic reprogramming in CD110+TICs after Kras extinction. Results provide important information of the response of colorectal CD110+TICs to inhibition of the PLCε pathway, such as specific stress-responsive genes, up- or down-regulated specific anabolic/catabolic cellular functions.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated CD110+TICs subjected to 24 hours in vitro U73122 (1μM) treatment compared to untreated control cells.

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
