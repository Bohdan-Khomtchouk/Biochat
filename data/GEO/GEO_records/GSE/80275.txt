TITLE
The ubiquitin-dependent N-end rule pathway enhances pathogen responses in plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Microarray experiments to compare gene expression profiles of ate1 ate2 double-mutant plants and the wild type at different developmental stages and after the infiltration with Pseudomonas syringae strain Pst AvrRpm1.

DESIGN
Global gene expression in ate1 ate2 double mutant seedlings was compared to that in wild-type seedlings using Agilent whole-genome microarrays. In addition, the response of both ate1 ate2 mutant and wild-type plants to infection with Pseudomonas syringae strain Pst AvrRpm1 was tested at different time-points after infiltration.
