TITLE
Mammary-specific gene activation is defined by progressive recruitment of STAT5 followed by the establishment of H3K4me3 marks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq (at parturition: L1) as well as STAT5A and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq with wild-type mammary gland tissues (at day 6 of pregnancy: p6, day 13 of pregnancy: p13, and L1).

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide STAT5A and H3K4me3 and whole transcriptome in wild-type mammary tissues.
