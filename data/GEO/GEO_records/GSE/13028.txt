TITLE
Response to temperature increase is genotype-dependent: A genomic analysis of marine larvae

ORGANISM
Crassostrea gigas

SUMMARY
We produced differentially sensitive-temperature phenotypes using genetically defined larval families of the bivalve Crassostrea gigas.  Larval growth rates varied ~5-fold and reciprocal hybrids showed different genotype-dependent responses over a 15-25Â°C temperature range.  Whole-genome expression analysis of ~24 million cDNAs from larvae identified 22,250 unique transcripts.  Of these, ~15% showed a significant interaction between genotype and temperature and are associated with genotype-dependent differences in response to temperature.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 genotypes of Pacific oyster larvae, grown at 3 temperatures
