TITLE
Lung transcript expression profile after Gata5 gene deletion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gata5 is a zinc finger transcription factor that is expressed in embryonic pulmonary mesenchyme and becomes upregulated in the lungs, gut, and bladder during postnatal development. We used microarray to comapre gene expression profiles of mouse lung between Gata5 knockout and wild type mice. We hope to identify the differentially expressed genes that affected by Gata5 gene deletion and their functional clusters or pathways. The goal of this study is  to identify the differentially expressed genes that affected by Gata5 gene deletion and their functional clusters or pathways.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples from three Gata5 KO and four wild type control mouse left lungs were extracted from the mouse lungs and profiled using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
