TITLE
Transcript expression data from Populus euphratica leaves subjected to infection by Marssonina pathogen

ORGANISM
Populus deltoides

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of Populus deltoides induced by fungal pathogenic Marssonina brunneain iduring time-course infection. We used Affymetrix poplar genome genechip microarrays to analyze the full transcript expression underlying time-course infection and identified significantly differently expressed genes during the infection process.

DESIGN
2-year-old seedlings of P. deltoides grown were innoculated with the suspension of the pathogenic spores throught leaves spraying. Collecting the samples at interval time of  2 days and one week. Affymetrix poplar genechip was hired to investigate the full transcripts changed of the poplar response to the pathogen attack during the time.
