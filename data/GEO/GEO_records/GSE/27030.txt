TITLE
Genome-wide binding profiles of the B-Myb-MuvB complex in HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genomic regions bound by B-Myb and LIN9 (a subunit of the MuvB complex), we performed ChIP-Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) using chromatin from proliferating HeLa cells in which we can detect a robust association between B-Myb and subunits of the MuvB complex. This analysis allowed us identify late cell cycle or G2/M expressed genes as specific targets of the B-Myb-MuvB complex.

DESIGN
Examination of B-Myb and LIN9 binding in asynchronously growing HeLa cells

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
