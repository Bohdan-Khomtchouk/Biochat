TITLE
Alterations of the human gut microbiome in multiple sclerosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gut microbiome plays an important role in normal immune function and has been implicated in several autoimmune disorders. Here we use high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate the gut microbiome in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS, n=61) and healthy controls (n=43). Alterations in the gut microbiome in MS include increases in the genera Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia and decreases in Butyricimonas, and correlate with variations in the expression of genes involved in dendritic cell maturation, interferon signaling and NF-kB signaling pathways in circulating T cells and monocytes. Patients on disease-modifying treatment show increased abundances of the genera Prevotella and Sutterella, and decreased Sarcina, compared to untreated patients. MS patients of a second cohort show elevated breath methane compared to controls, consistent with our observation of increased gut Methanobrevibacter in MS in the first cohort. Further study is required to assess whether the observed alterations in the gut microbiome play a role in, or are a consequence of, MS pathogenesis.

DESIGN
T cells and monocytes were collected from healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis.  Immune gene expression was measured by the Nanostring nCounter GX Human Immunology Kit v2 (Catalog #115000061).  Comparisons were made between healthy controls, patients with multiple sclerosis, both on and off treatment.
