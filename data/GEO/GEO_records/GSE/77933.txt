TITLE
Gene expression analysis of RNAs isolated from inguinal White Adipose Tissue (iWAT) of ZIP13-KO mice and their WT littermate mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to assess overall gene expression change in objectively, we performed a microarray analysis of iWAT derived from ZIP13-KO mice and their WT littermate mice

DESIGN
Triplicate experiments were performed for iWAT of Zip13-KO mice and their WT littermate mice. Total RNA was isolated from tissues using Qiazol (QIAGEN) following the manufacturersâ€™ protocols.
