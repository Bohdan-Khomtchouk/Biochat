TITLE
Comparison of miR-181a transfected K562 cells and mock transfected K562 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This series consists of samples taken from two groups of K562 cells(miR-181a transfected group and control group ) and harvested 48 hours later. We used Agilent human 1A oligo microarray identified the changes in gene expression profile of K562 cells after miR-181a transfection experiment. Further studies aimed to find target mRNA of miR-181a in mammalian cells and its biological function. Keywords = miR-181a Keywords = microarray Keywords = K562 Keywords: microRNA transfection analysis
