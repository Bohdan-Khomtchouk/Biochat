TITLE
Piwi knockdown in Drosophila Intestinal Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of Piwi-deficient ISCs isolated by FACS. We used esg::Gal4, UAS::GFP; tub::Gal80ts to drive the expression of an RNAi against mCherry (control) or Piwi for 7 days.

DESIGN
Duplicates of mCherry RNAi expressing ISCs and Piwi RNAi expressing ISCs. Each sample was obtained from a pool of 100 dissected and FACSorted fly guts.

PLATFORM
GPL16479 Illumina MiSeq (Drosophila melanogaster)
