TITLE
Expression data from Rice leaves

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Senescence is a developmental process and chlorophyll is an indicator of leaf senescene. In plants cytokinin plays a role in delaying leaf senescence. Chlorophyll degradation is tightly regulated during senescence and cytokinin might interplay in the chrorophyll degradation pathway to regulate leaf greening. we used microarray to study the differential gene expression during leaf senescence and inpresence of a synthetic cytokinin (6-benzyl adenine).

DESIGN
third leaf of 30-day-old rice plant were selected and incubated for 72 hours in solution containing 6-BA in darkness. Control condition leaves were incubated in solution without 6-BA. Three sets of control versus 6-BA treated leaves were used for RNA extraction and hybridation on Affymatrix rice gene chip.
