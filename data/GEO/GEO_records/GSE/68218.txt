TITLE
The transcirptional effect of CtrA depletion in S. meliloti

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021

SUMMARY
We wanted to test the effect on global gene expression of depleting the essential cell cycle regulator CtrA in order to determine the genes both indirectly and directly transcriptionally regulated by CtrA Gene expression changes in S. meliloti 1,2,4 and 6 hours post CtrA depletion

DESIGN
Log-phase S. meliloti cultures carrying an IPTG-inducible allele of CtrA were split and transferred to growth media lacking IPTG (depletion) and with 1mM IPTG (control). Samples for RNA extraction were taken 1,2,4, and 6 hours after the start of the depletion experiment to monitor gene expression changes in the population after different periods of CtrA depletion.
