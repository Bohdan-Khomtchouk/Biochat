TITLE
Extracellular Vesicles Originate from the Conceptus and Uterus During Early Pregnancy in Sheep

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
The present studies tested the hypothesis that the elongating ovine conceptus and uterus produces EVs with the potential to mediate conceptus-maternal communication during early pregnancy. In Study One, EVs were purified from uterine luminal fluid (ULF) of day 14 cyclic sheep. The EVs were fluorescently labeled with PKH67 dye and infused into the uterine lumen of pregnant sheep for 6 days using an osmotic pump. On day 14, labeled EVs were observed in the conceptus trophectoderm and uterine epithelia, but not in the uterine stroma or myometrium. In Study Two, day 14 conceptuses were cultured ex vivo for 24 hours and found to release EVs into the culture medium. Isolated EVs from conceptuses were fluorescently labeled with PKH67 and infused into the uterine lumen of cyclic sheep for 6 days using an osmotic pump. On day 14, labeled EVs were observed in the uterine epithelia, but not in the uterine stroma or myometrium. No evidence of EV escape from the uterine lumen was observed by analysis of the ovary and other maternal tissues. Proteomics analysis of the day 14 conceptus-derived EVs identified 231 proteins that were enriched for extracellular space and several protein classes including proteases, protease inhibitors, chaperones and chaperonins. RNA-sequencing of day 14 conceptus-derived EVs detected expression of 512 mRNAs. The top expressed genes were overrepresented in ribosomal functions and components. These studies support the ideas that EVs emanate from both the conceptus trophectoderm and uterine epithelia and are involved in intercellular communication during the establishment of pregnancy.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiles from day 14 conceptus extracellular vesicles isolated from 24 hour conceptus-conditioned culture media (n=3) were generated by sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.
