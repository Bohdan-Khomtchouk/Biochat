TITLE
Newly constructed network models of different WNT signaling cascades applied to breast cancer expression data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq profiling of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. We profiled RNA expression in the estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) MCF-7 and the triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The objective was to find genes differentially expressed between these cell lines as potential drivers of invasiveness of the triple-negative MDA-MB-231. We further utilized the identified differential genes to validate expression-responsive module of non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

DESIGN
2 biological replicates of MCF-7 and 3 biological replicates of MDA-MB-231

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
