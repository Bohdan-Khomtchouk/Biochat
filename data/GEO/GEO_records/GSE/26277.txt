TITLE
Extraction of Total RNA from Single Neurons: Mauthner-cell Cytoplasm vs. Whole Brain

ORGANISM
Haplochromis burtoni

SUMMARY
Astatotilapia burtoni males change their startle behavior in accordance with changes in a socially-mediated phenotypic state. When dominant (DOM), males are brightly colored, isolated from the school and startle readily in response to an auditory pulse. When subordinate (SUB), males are cryptically colored, school and startle less frequently. We hypothesize that the difference in startle responsiveness is governed by serotonergic modulation on the command-like Mauthner cells (M-cells). We used the selective serotonin receptor subtype 2 (5HTR2) antagonist ketanserin to show that serotonin receptors can modulate startle frequency and that the behavioral difference correlates with differences in electrophysiological recordings of M-cells. Specifically, SUB males have a higher serotonergic tone and demonstrate, by behavior and electrophysiological properties, increased sensitivity to 5-HT manipulations compared to DOMs. Immunohistochemistry for serotonin is present around the M-cells. Furthermore, we identified serotonin receptor transcripts in A. burtoni and used single-cell transcriptomics to determine the presence or absence of specific receptor subtypes in the M-cells. Microarray analysis of M-cell samples shows that the neuronâ€™s transcriptome is relatively stable in individuals of different social status. These results are consistent with a role for serotonin in modulating the behavioral response to sensory stimuli in an ecologically-relevant manner through inhibitory interneurons, which establish the membrane resistance of the M-cell before the auditory stimulus.
