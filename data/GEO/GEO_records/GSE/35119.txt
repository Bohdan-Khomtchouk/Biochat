TITLE
Study of Cj0138 function in Campylobacter jejuni

ORGANISM
Campylobacter

SUMMARY
In order to study the function of the Campylobacter jejuni Cj0138 gene, a series of experiments were carried out. Three strains were constructed: a Cj0138 knockout strain, a strain where the Cj0138 knockout was complemented in trans, and a strain with a second copy over-expressing Cj0138 from an fdxA promoter. The transcriptomes of these were all compared to the wild-type strain. The arrays are all from RNA isolated in mid-exponential growth from independent biological replicates.
