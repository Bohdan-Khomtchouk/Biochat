SUMMARY
Undifferentiated mammosphere RNA. Samples contain RNA extracted from the cells of mouse mammospheres. Mammosphere are believed to be comprised of stem/progenitor cells (GSM88038). Differentiated mammosphere RNA. RNA extracted from the cells of mouse mammospheres induced to differentiate over a 6-day period. Mammosphere are believed to be comprised of stem/progenitor cells (GSM88039). Keywords: mammosphere differentiation
