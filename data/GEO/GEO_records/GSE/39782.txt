TITLE
Tag-seq profiling in eye-antennal and wing imaginal discs of D. melanogaster, D. yakuba and D. virilis

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila virilis ; Drosophila yakuba

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to identify a set of eye-specific genes across Drosophila species. Species are used as replicates to remove biological noise and identify a core set of conserved eye-developmental genes. We analyze this conserved core using the motif discovery tool i-cisTarget, and identify master regulators of retinal determination, including the Zinc Finger transcription factor Glass.

DESIGN
Six samples were analyzed by Illumina Digital Gene Expression (DGE) using the NlaIII restriction enzyme, namely two different tissues (eye-antennal discs and wing discs) for each of the three species under study.
