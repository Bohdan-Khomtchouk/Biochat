TITLE
Genome-wide expression study of the responses of murine NK cells and dendritic cell subsets to MCMV infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine Cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection leads to the activation of various immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. This activation is partly driven by innate cytokines including IFN-I, which are induced early after infection. The objective was to address the role of different innate cytokines in shaping DC subsets and NK cell responses, in particular  the role of cell intrinsic responses to IFN-I. In order to decipher the specific impact of cell-intrinsic IFN-I on cell subsets, we performed a genome-wide expression analysis on CD45.1 WT and CD45.2 IFNAR-/- splenic conventional DC (cDC) subsets and NK cells isolated from C57BL/6 [CD45.1 WT / CD45.2 IFNAR-KO] mixed bone marow chimera mice.

DESIGN
This study includes data from cDC subsets (CD8a and CD11b) and NK cells purified by flow cytometry sorting from the spleen of bone marrow chimera (BMC) mice, under steady-state or MCMV condition. Two independent replicates were made for each cell type, from two independent pools of spleens from uninfected or d1.5 MCMV-infected BMC 5-8 mice,  and were hybridized on 3 separate batches of gene chips.
