TITLE
Gene expression profile of influenza virus antigen-activated or in vitro stimulated murine CD8+ T cells on day 7

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The precise timing and pathway of memory CD8+ T cells differentiation from naïve T cells have remained undetermined. We found the smaller cell-size and slower cell cycling cells were segregated from the proliferative larger cell-size activated T cell pool at the peak of infection. Gene signature of the smaller cell-size slower cycling cells and the large cell-size proliferative cells was compared to the signature of naïve, effector, central and effector memory CD8+ T cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples were prepared from sorted populations of larger or smaller cell-sized cells from spleens of influenza virus PR8-OVA-infected mice on day 7 p.i. or from in vitro 7 days culture after stimulation with plate-bound anti-​CD3ε (1.0 μg ml−1) and anti-​CD28 mAb (0.5 μg ml−1). Effector T-cell control samples were prepared from SIINFEKL (100 ng ml−1) stimulated OT-I cells after 4 days of in vitro culture with rIL-2 (10 ng/ml) and sorted as CD8+​CD44hi​CD62Llo. Control bona fide effector memory and central memory T cells were sorted from the spleens of PR8-OVA-infected mice on day 42 p.i. Naive cells were sorted as CD8+​CD44lo​CD62Lhi cells from uninfected C57BL/6 mice.
