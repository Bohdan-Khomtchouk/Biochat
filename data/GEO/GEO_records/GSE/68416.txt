TITLE
BMAL1 Activates Clock Gene Expression by Regulating Transcription Initiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We showed that Bmal1 mainly regulates clock gene initiation, with this functioning being highly conserved across species.

DESIGN
compare RNA-seq and chip-seq between wildtype and mutant cells

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens) GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens) GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
