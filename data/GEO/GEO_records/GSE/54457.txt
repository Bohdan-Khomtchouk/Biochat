TITLE
Expression profiling of mouse fetal liver late erythroblasts after knockdown of Xpo7

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the transcriptional function (if any) of the presumed nuclear export protein Xpo7 or RanBP16 Murine fetal liver erythroid precursors (Ter119-negative cells) were isolated from C57Bl6 E14.5 embryos by magnetic depletion and infected with retroviruses containing shRNA constructs against Xpo7.  They were then cultured in Epo-containing media (2U/mL) for 36hrs until they were fully differentiated and then sorted by FACS for GFP+ (infected) cells in order to isolate total RNA to be used for the profiling.

DESIGN
Expression profiling in late cultured mouse erythroblasts before and after knockdown of gene Xpo7.
