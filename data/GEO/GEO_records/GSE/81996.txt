TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of pro-invasive fibroblasts activation short term response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effect at short term (48 hours) of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), TGFβ or TGFβ + anti-Lif stimulation on the human primary dermal fibroblast (hDF) transcriptome was analyzed by whole genome microarray expression profiling.

DESIGN
Total RNA of human primary dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) stimulated by LIF, TGFβ or TGFβ + anti-Lif have been performed in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FCS containing 2ng/ml final concentration of human recombinant proteins for 48 hours. One-color experiment with 2 biological replicates (marked 1 or 2) of the 4 experimental conditions. Total of 8 samples.
