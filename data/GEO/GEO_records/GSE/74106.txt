TITLE
Microarray analysis reveals the molecular foundation of the brown planthopper(BPH) resistance of rice variety Rathu Heenati

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In order to reveal the molecular foundation of BPH resistance of RH, the whole genome expressional profiles of RH together with the control TN1 under BPH infestation were determined using cDNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
The experiment design included two rice varieties (RH and TN1), three treatments (natural growth, needle puncturing and BPH infestation) and two sampling time-points (6 and 24 h after BPH infestation). There were 12 samples in total, with three biological replicates per sample.The abbreviations of R6C, R24C, R6N, R24N, R6P, R24P, T6C, T24C, T6N, T24N, T6P and T24P were used to represent these 12 samples. The first letter R or T indicates the rice varieties RH or TN1, respectively; the Arabic numbers in the middle of the abbreviation 6 or 12 indicate the collection time-points 6 or 24 h after the treatment, respectively. The last letter C, N or P indicates the three different treatments: control, needle puncturing or BPH infestation, respectively.
