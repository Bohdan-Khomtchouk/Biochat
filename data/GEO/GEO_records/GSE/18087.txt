TITLE
Genome-wide survey of transcriptional differences between males and females of Tribolium castaneum, the red flour beetle

ORGANISM
Tribolium castaneum

SUMMARY
Genome-wide survey of transcriptional differences between males and females of Tribolium castaneum, the red flour beetle

DESIGN
Four biological replicates for male and female beetles with 20 individuals per replicate. Two technical replicates, one replicate per sex. 16,434 genes/expressed non-coding regions represented twice on each array. Three 60 mer probes for most exons/expressed non-coding regions. 167,538 unique genomic probes replicated twice per array.
