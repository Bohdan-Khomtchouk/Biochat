TITLE
Peripheral blood lymphocytes: ALS patients vs. healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcripional profiling of lymphocytes from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (n=11) and healthy control subjects (n=11). The goal was to determine disease response expression signatures relevant of ALS pathogenesis that affect brain and spinal cord. The reference design was used: each Cy5-labeled cRNA sample from ALS patient or healthy control subject was cohybridized on Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F with the reference pool formed with equal amounts of Cy3-labeled cRNAs from each sample from the healthy control group.

DESIGN
Eleven lymphocyte samples from definite sporadic ALS patients and eleven samples from healthy control subjects were used.
