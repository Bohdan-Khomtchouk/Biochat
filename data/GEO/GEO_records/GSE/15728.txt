TITLE
Mapping of H3, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, and H3K9ac on mixed asexual stages of P. falciparum

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Epigenome profiling has led to the paradigm that promoters of active genes are decorated with H3K4me3 and H3K9ac marks. Data revealed an extensively euchromatic epigenome with heterochromatin restricted to variant surface antigen gene families (VSA) and a number of genes hitherto unlinked to VSA. The vast majority of the genome shows an unexpected pattern of enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac at intergenic regions and depletion at genes.

DESIGN
Chip-chip (and cDNA) from Plasmodium falciparum strain NF54 asexual blood stages with H3, H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and H3K9ac
