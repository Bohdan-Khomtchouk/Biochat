ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seqs followed by miRNA transfections (miR-124 and miR-155) into four different cell lines( HeLa, HEK293, Huh7, and IMR90).

DESIGN
There are two biological replicates of RNA-seqs per each miRNA transfection per each sample and there are corresponding mock transfections.
