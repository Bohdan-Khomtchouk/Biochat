TITLE
BY4741 and BY4741（Δyrr1）transcriptional differences under vanillin stress

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741

SUMMARY
BY4741（Δyrr1）exhibited better vanillin tolerance to vanillin than that of wildtype strain. To assess transcriptional differences between these two strains. Yrr1p is a transcriptional factors which activated genes related to multidrug resistance.The transcriptome of BY4741 and BY4741（Δyrr1）under vanillin stress or vanillin free conditions were conducted,respectively

DESIGN
BY4741 was the control strain and BY4741（Δyrr1） was the experimental strain. The transcriptome resequencing of every strain was conducted in two conditions: under 5mM vanillin stress or vanillin free. The comparisons were: BY4741 vs. BY4741（Δyrr1）under vanillin stress or vanillin free condition; vanillin stress vs. vanillin free condition in BY4741 or BY4741（Δyrr1,respectively.The samples were collected when OD600 reach 1.6-2.0.Each strain under each condition had duplicates.The medium was SD.
