TITLE
DNA Methylation profiles of benzene hematotoxicity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify potential methylation biomarkers in occupationally benzene-exposed individuals and to elucidate mechanisms of benzene hematotoxicity.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of four patients of chronic benzene poisoning, four workers exposed to benzene levels ranging from < 1 ppm and four health controls matched age and gender without benzene exposure samples was hybridized to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
