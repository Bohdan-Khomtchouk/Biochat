TITLE
Gene expression profiling of maize anther and pollen ontogeny

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Global gene expression profiles of seven stages representing 29 days of anther development are analyzed using a 44K oligonucleotide array querying ~80% of maize protein-coding genes.  Each anther stage expresses ~10,000 constitutive and ~10,000 or more transcripts restricted to one or a few stages. Keywords: anther development, maize
