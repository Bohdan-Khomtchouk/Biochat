TITLE
Expression data from exposure of BAT and WAT at 6 and 28 degrees C

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We run microarrays from three per group Sv129 female mice, ten weeks old, which were maintained at 28°C (warm conditions) or 6° C (cold stimulated) for ten days, while standard animal house temperature is 22 °C. After ten days, three types of tissue were collected: Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT), Mesenteric (visceral) White Adipose Tissue (MES) and Posterior Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue (WAT)

DESIGN
Different adipose tissue depots were taken for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to determine the differences between white and brown adipose tissues at different temperatures
