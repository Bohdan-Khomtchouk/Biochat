TITLE
Endothelial cell response to trophoblastic debris

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human placenta is covered by a single multinucleated fetal cell, the syncytiotrophoblast, which is bathed in maternal blood. During all pregnancies, membrane enclosed extracellular vesicles derived from the syncytiotrophoblast are extruded into the maternal blood.The large size of these extracellular vesicles (diameter larger than 10Âµm) is referred to as trophoblastic debris in this study. We have shown in the past that endothleial cells are involved in clearence of this trophoblastic debris and induction of immune tolerence by trophoblastic debris.This study aimed to characterise the transcriptional changes that occur in human vascular endothelial cells following exposure to trophoblastic debris from normal first trimester placentae. Microarrays were used to probe transcriptomic changes 2 and 21 hours after exposure of endothelial cells (Human microvascular endothelial cell line,HMEC-1) to trophoblastic debris from normal first trimester placentae

DESIGN
Trophoblastic debris were isolated by low speed centrifugation from three individual first trimester human placentae (three biological replicates). The protein content in trophoblastic debris was measured by BCA assay. HMEC-1 was co-cultured with trophoblastic debris (60ug/ml total debris protein contents) for either 2 or 21 hours before RNA extraction. Untreated HMEC-1 at 2 and 21 hours were used as controls.In total, 12 samples were analyzed.
