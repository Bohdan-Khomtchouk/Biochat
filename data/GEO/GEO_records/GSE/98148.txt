TITLE
Differential gene expression of endosphere and soil Bacillus mycoides isolate in response to root exudates using RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Bacillus mycoides

SUMMARY
In general, the endosphere isolate EC18 showed more numbers of genes significantly altered in the presence of root exudates than the soil isolate SB8 . Some of the altered genes in the two strains showed overlap. Some of these genes were previously reported to be involved in microbe-plant interactions, such as organic substance metabolism, oxidation reduction, transmembrane transportation and a subset with putative or unknown function. It was also found some genes showed opposite trend among the two strains.

DESIGN
Two strains, two conditions.
