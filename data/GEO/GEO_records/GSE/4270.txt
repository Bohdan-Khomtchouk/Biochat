TITLE
Aging Induced Alterations in Hepatic Gene Expression of the Male Fisher Rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Toxicokinetic and metabolism studies are considered crucial to dose setting and interpretation of data from rodent carcinogenicity studies.  The metabolism and distribution studies are usually conducted in 6 to 8 week old rodents.  However cancer studies generally involve exposures from 6 weeks of age to 108 weeks or more of age.  It is recognized that age-related differences in sensitivities to some xenobiotics occur in several rodent models including the rat.  However, the potential for changes in metabolism with age has received little attention in the toxicology community especially in regard to extrapolation of rodent data to human risk assessment.  The advent of microarray technology has allowed a more global assessment of genes whose products are associated with xenobiotic metabolism.  We studied hepatic gene expression in 38 untreated F344/N rats at approximately 32, 58 and 84 weeks of age corresponding to 6, 12, and 18 months on study.  Statistical analysis of microarray (SAM) identified differential expression between the youngest and the oldest rats for genes whose products are involved in phase I and phase II metabolic pathways.  Fifteen of 30 cytochrome P450 genes from CYP families 1 â€“ 4 showed marked decrease in expression at 84 weeks while only two showed increased expression.  The results of this study demonstrate prominent decreased expression in CYP family genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism in untreated rats as they age.  The assumption of a constant metabolic profile when extrapolating results from long-term chemical exposures needs to be reconsidered.
