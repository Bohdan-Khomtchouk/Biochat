TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of 88 microRNAs involved in human cell differentiation and development in involved skin of systemic scleroderma (SSc), localized scleroderma (LSc) and Keloid.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Skin specimens were derived from involved skin of 3 systemic scleroderma (SSc), 3 localized scleroderma (LSc) and 3 keloid patients. These skin samples and 3 control skins were collected and fixed in formaldehyde immediately after resections. The microRNA (miRNA) isolation from human skin tissue was performed using miRNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen). For PCR array, miRNAs were reverse-transcribed into first strand cDNA using RT2 miRNA First Strand Kit (SABiosciences). A mixture of equal amounts of miRNAs from 3 normal skins, 3 SSc, 3 LSc or 3 keloid were prepared, and miRNA expression profile in each disease in vivo was evaluated using RT2 Profiler PCR Array. The cDNA was mixed with RT2 SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix and the mixture was added into 96-well RT2 miRNA PCR Array that includes primer pairs for 88 human miRNAs (SABiosciences).

DESIGN
Skin specimens were derived from involved skin of 3 systemic scleroderma (SSc), 3 localized scleroderma (LSc) and 3 keloid patients. These skin samples and 3 control skins were collected and fixed in formaldehyde immediately after resections. Control donors were each matched with diseases for age, sex, and biopsy site.
