TITLE
Endothelial cells present an innate resistance to glucocorticoid treatment: implications for therapy of primary vasculitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Morphogenesis of epithelial tissues relies on the precise developmental control of cell polarity and architecture. In the early Drosophila embryo, the primary epithelium forms during cellularisation, following a tightly controlled genetic programme where specific sets of genes are up-regulated. Some of them, for instance, control membrane invagination between the nuclei anchored at the apical surface of the syncytium.

DESIGN
Huvec were treated for 4h and 16h with dexamethasone. Two independent experiments.
