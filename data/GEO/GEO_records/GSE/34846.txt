TITLE
miR-129-3p control cilia assembly by regulating CP110 and actin dynamics [miR-129-3p overexpression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary cilium serves as a cellular “antenna” to sense environmental signals. Ciliogenesis requires the removal of CP110 to convert the mother centriole into the basal body. Actin dynamics is also critical for cilia formation. How these distinct processes are properly regulated remains unknown. Here we show that miR-129-3p, a microRNA conserved in the vertebrates, controlled cilia assembly by down-regulating both CP110 and four proteins critical for actin dynamics, Arp2, Toca1, abLIM1, and abLIM3. Consistently, blocking miR-129-3p repressed cilia formation in cultured mammalian cells, whereas its overexpression potently induced ciliogenesis in proliferating cells and extraordinary cilia elongation. Moreover, inhibition of miR-129-3p in zebrafish embryos suppressed cilia assembly in the Kupffer’s vesicle and pronephric duct, leading to developmental abnormalities including curved body, pericardial oedema, and randomised left-right patterning. Our results thus unravel a novel mechanism that orchestrates both the centriole-to-basal body transition and subsequent cilia assembly via microRNA-mediated posttranscriptional regulations. We want to find the targets of miR-129-3p by overexpressing miR-129-3p oligo or control oligo in hTERT-RPE1 cells. Through microarray analysis we could check the downregulated genes and these genes might be the targets of miR-129-3p.

DESIGN
RPE1 cells were transfected with control (Ctrl) or miR-129-3p (M129) oligo for 72h, and harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Two samples: RPE1-Ctrl, RPE1-M129
