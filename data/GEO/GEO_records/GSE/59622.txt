TITLE
Genes regulated by the winged helix transcription factor Rfx6 in adult beta cell in the mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify genes which are differentiatlly expresesd upon induced inactivation of Rfx6 in beta cell in adult  mice

DESIGN
Rfx6fl/fl; Ins1-CreERT2 (mut) and Rfx6fl/fl (ctrl) 8 weeks old mice were injected subcutaneously with tamoxifen  daily during 3 days. Pancreatic islets were isolated 5 days after the first injection and RNA purified.
