TITLE
RNA-Seq Analysis of Tetranychus cinnabarinus in Response to Curcumin

ORGANISM
Tetranychus cinnabarinus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was employed to analyze the transcriptome changes in T. cinnabarinus treated with curcumin or solvent. A total of 105, 706, 297 clean sequence reads were generated from the sequencing with more than 90% of the reads were successfully mapped to the reference sequence. The RNA-seq identified 111 and 96 differentially expressed genes between curcumin and solvent treated mites at 24 h and 48 h post treatment, respectively. GO enrichment analysis showed that differentially expressed genes from 24 h post treatment were categorized into 35 GO functional groups and differentially expressed genes from 48 h post treatment were categorized into 25 GO functional groups. The cellular process under the category of biological process was dominant throughout the GO classification at both time points. Finally, we screened 23 differentially expressed genes that are functionally identical or similar to the targets of common insecticide/acaricides or associated with mite detoxification and metabolism. Overall our results revealed the global transcriptional changes in T. cinnabarinus upon curcumin treatment and will enable the further identification of the targets of curcumin on mite.

DESIGN
In this study, RNA-seq was employed to analyze the transcriptome changes in T. cinnabarinus treated with curcumin or solvent treatment 24h and 48h.
