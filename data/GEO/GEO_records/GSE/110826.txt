TITLE
Human iPSC-derived cells and microengineered Organ-Chip enhance neural development.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We show neural enhancement and induction of vascular interaction genes in iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons that have been incubated in a microengineered chip.

DESIGN
Spinal motor neuron progenitors were plated in a 96 well plate either in neural media or in the presence of iPSC-derived endothelial cell conditioned media, and in a microphysiological chip cultured alone or in direct contact with iPSC-derived endothelial cells.

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
