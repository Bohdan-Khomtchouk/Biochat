TITLE
Drosophila melanogaster small RNA sequence from 14 libraries

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing of Drosophila melanogaster small RNAs. total RNA, ~18-26nt RNAs isolated using PAGE, ligation to adapters requires 5' monophosphate and 3' OH

DESIGN
Small RNAs were sequenced from D. melanogaster heads (male and female), body (male and female), S2 and Kc cells and different stages of embryo. Raw sequences were clipped by 3' linker sequences recognition, and select clipped sequences longer than 18 nt
