TITLE
Gene expression analysis of reprogrammed pancreatic cells, liver and pancreas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We recently generated pancreatic progenitor cells (so-called TiPP cells, TGIF2-induced pancreatic progenitors) by reprogramming adult hepatic cells (HEP). To analyze the extent of reprogramming and to investigate the mechanisms underlying liver-to-pancreas conversion, we analyzed the changes in gene expression in TiPP cells at two time points (day 14 and day 30 after transduction) compared to control HEP cells, mouse embryonic pancreas (E14.5) and adult pancreas and liver tissues.

DESIGN
HEP cells were transduced with a lentivirus expressing TGIF2. RNA was collected 14 and 30 days after transduction from three independent biological samples. Pancreas and liver tissues were isolated from adult mice or embryos as indicated (3 independent biological samples).
