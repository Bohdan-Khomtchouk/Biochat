TITLE
BTG1 and BTG2 Regulate B Linege Commitment by Modulation of EBF1 Activity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The human BTG1 and BTG2 genes are targeted by genetic alterations in hematological malignancies. In this study we examined the unique and overlapping functions of Btg1 and Btg2 in mouse B cell development. Mice deficient for Btg1 and Btg2 displayed the strongest phenotype with a decrease in B cell numbers in bone marrow due to impaired B cell commitment and immature B cell differentiation. To determine the underlying mechanism, microarray expression analyis was performed on  early (B220+ CD43+) and late (B220+ CD43-) B cells of WT and Btg1;Btg2 dKO mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from sorted B220+ CD43+ ( Hardy fractions ABC) and B220+ CD43- (Hardy fractions DEF) BM cells of WT and Btg1-/-;Btg2-/- mice. In total 4 samples were analyzed and no replicates were included.
