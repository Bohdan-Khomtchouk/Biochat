TITLE
Disrupted functional neworks in autism underlie early brain maldevelopment and provide accurate classification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The disrupted genetic mechanisms underlying neural abnormalities in Autism Spectrum Disorder remain mostly unknown and speculative. No biological marker nor genetic signature is currently available to assist with early diagnosis. We identified a blood-based gene expression signature relevant to the brain pathophysiology in autism. Also we identified genes that are differentially expressed in ASD subjects vs controls and gene modules that efficiently classify ASD and TD subjects.

DESIGN
Leukocyte gene expression levels were analysed in autistic and tipically develoing infants and toddlers with the purpose to identify gene expression signatures relevant to the autistic brain and to assist in the classification of subjects.
