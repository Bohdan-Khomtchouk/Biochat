TITLE
Changes in mature mouse primary motor cortex transcriptome after conditional Fezf2 knockdown

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis of mature mouse primary motor cortex in response to conditional knockdown of Fezf2. Analysis of M1 transcriptomes identifies significant changes to gene expression with the knockdown of Fezf2 in mature tissue.

DESIGN
Lentiviral delivery of a control (non-silencing) or Fezf2 shRNA to mouse primary motor cortex in mature animals (P21-P25; n=4 of each) was used to conditionally reduce Fezf2 expression. Paired-end sequencing was used to generate transcriptome profiles of Fezf2-reduced and control samples.
