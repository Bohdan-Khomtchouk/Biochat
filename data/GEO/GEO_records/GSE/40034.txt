TITLE
Drosophila melanogaster Canton-S small RNA sequence: Adult Male Head

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_747 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Eric Lai. For full list of modENCODE projects, see Project Goal: We plan to generate a comprehensive catalog of expressed and functional microRNAs, and generate biological evidence for their regulatory activity. We plan also to delineate the primary transcription units of microRNA genes. Finally, we plan to annotate other classes of non-miRNA expressed small RNAs, as least some of which may define novel classes of small RNA genes.
