TITLE
The Arcuate Estrogenome: Estrogen Response Element-dependent and -independent Signaling of ERα

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used three genotypes of mice: 1) wild-type, 2) KIKO (knock in/knock out), which lack a functional ERE-binding domain, and 3) ERKO (total ERα knockout) to determine ERE-dependent and -independent signaling of E2 in the arcuate nucleus of mice.

DESIGN
Examination of three genotypes (WT, KIKO, ERKO) in two treatments (oil and E2)

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
