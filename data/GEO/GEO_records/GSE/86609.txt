TITLE
The Arcuate Estrogenome: Estrogen Response Element-dependent and -independent Signaling of ERα

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used three genotypes of mice: 1) wild-type, 2) KIKO (knock in/knock out), which lack a functional ERE-binding domain, and 3) ERKO (total ERα knockout) to determine ERE-dependent and -independent signaling of E2 in the arcuate nucleus of mice.

DESIGN
Examination of three genotypes (WT, KIKO, ERKO) in two treatments (oil and E2)
