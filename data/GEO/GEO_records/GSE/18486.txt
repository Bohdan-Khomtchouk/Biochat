TITLE
CDK inhibitors PHA-848125 and PHA-690509 profiling on A2780

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effects of the CDK inhibitors PHA-848125 and PHA-690509 on the A2780 cell line were analysed by gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
The A2780 cell line was treated with PHA-848125 (CDk-125) or PHA-690509 (CDk-509) for 6 hours at a dose equal to 5 times the IC50. Untreated A2780 cells were used as a control. Three replicates per treatment.
