TITLE
T cell receptor dependent transformation of mature memory phenotype T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A fundamental goal in cancer research is identification of the cell types and signaling  pathways capable of initiating and sustaining tumor growth as this has the potential to reveal  features that can be exploited therapeutically. Stem and progenitor cells have been implicated in  the genesis of select lymphoid malignancies but are unlikely to underlie initiation of mature  lymphoid neoplasms, the cellular origin of which remains unclear. Here, we used a conditional  Snf5 model to investigate the origin of peripheral T cell lymphomas. We find that the cell of  origin is a mature CD44hiCD122lo CD8 T cell that resembles a subset of memory cells, a  population with capacities for self-renewal and robust expansion - features shared with stem cells.  We elucidate mechanism by showing that Snf5 loss leads to activation of a Myc network and  stem cell transcriptional program. Finally, we demonstrate that lymphomagenesis depends upon  TCR signaling, establishing a new paradigm for lymphomagenesis. These findings suggest that  the self-renewal and robust proliferative capacities of memory T cells is associated with  vulnerability to oncogenic transformation. Our findings further suggest that agents that impinge  upon TCR signaling may represent an effective therapeutic modality for this class of lethal  human cancers.

DESIGN
Stable mouse Snf5-deficient T cell lymphoma cell lines were established. CD44hi and CD44lo subpopulations were purified and used to evaluate gene expression pattern in these two subpopulations. RNA was isolated from each of these samples and used for gene expression profiling on Affymetrix 430A arrays.
