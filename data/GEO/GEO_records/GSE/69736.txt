TITLE
Bladder cancer analysis by antibody array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bladder cancer tissue from 11 patients diagnosed as superficial and muscle invasive and 7 normal bladder mucoa were analyzed by protein antibody array kit with 656 antibodies

DESIGN
In this study, 18 tissue samples from bladder cancer or normal bladder mucosa were analyzed by protein antlbody array to investigate biomarker for bladder cancer. After the tissue samples were obtained intraoperatively, they were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and expressions of 656 proteins were analyzed using antibody microarray assay kit of Fullmoon Biosystems

PLATFORM
GPL20309 Explorer antibody array (ASB600)
