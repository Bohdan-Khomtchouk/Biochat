TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome and proteome analysis of the global GATA transcription factors AreA and AreB in Fusarium fujikuroi

ORGANISM
Fusarium fujikuroi

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide transcriptome and proteome analyses of the Fusarium fujikuroi wild type and ΔAREA and ΔAREB mutants under nitrogen limitation and excess. Microarray analysis revealed that each transcription factor regulates a total set of about 4200 genes under nitrogen limiting conditions with an enrichment of genes belonging to functional classes of primary/secondary metabolism, transporters, cell defense/virulence and transcription. Under nitrogen excess, AreA is not active as a transcriptional regulator, while AreB affects expression of about 4400 genes. Both transcription factors regulate a common set of about 2100 genes and most of the time work together either as positive or as negative regulators. Our proteomics analysis identified 446 AreA-regulated and 386 AreB-regulated proteins at nitrogen limitation and 138 AreA-regulated and 447 AreB-regulated proteins at nitrogen excess, respectively. Comparison of the proteome and transcriptome data indicates that many post-transcriptional regulations are facilitated by both GATA-factors, for example on enzymes involved in the TCA and glyoxylate cycle and the main glutamate/glutamine cycling.
