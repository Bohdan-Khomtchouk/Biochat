TITLE
Naturally occurring copy-number polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Thomas Hunt Morgan and colleagues identified variation in gene copy number in Drosophila in the 1920s and 1930s and linked such variation to phenotypic differences [Bridges, C. B. (1936) Science 83, 210]. Yet the extent of variation in the number of chromosomes, chromosomal regions, or gene copies, and the importance of this variation within species, remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on copy-number variation in Drosophila melanogaster. We characterize copy-number polymorphism (CNP) across genomic regions, and we contrast patterns to infer the evolutionary processes acting on this variation. Copy-number variation in D. melanogaster is non-randomly distributed, presumably due to a mutational bias produced by tandem repeats or other mechanisms. Comparisons of coding and noncoding CNPs, however, reveal a strong effect of purifying selection in the removal of structural variation from functionally constrained regions. Most patterns of CNP in D. melanogaster suggest that negative selection and mutational biases are the primary agents responsible for shaping structural variation. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from five natural isofemale lines were compared to the sequenced D. melanogaster strain with four replicates per comparison. Controls were self-self and male-female hybridization (three replicates per control).
