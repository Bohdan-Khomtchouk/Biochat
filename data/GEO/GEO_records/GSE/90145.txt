TITLE
Expression data from triple negative breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Treatment of triple-negative breast cancer has been challenging and paclitaxel resistance is one of the major obstacles to the better prognosis. Misregulation of alternative splicing (AS) may contribute to tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance. Human AS factor TRA2 has two separate gene paralogs encoding TRA2A and TRA2B proteins. TRA2B is associated with cancer cell survival and therapeutic sensitivity. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and alternative splicing events underlying paclitaxel treatment and TRA2A upregulation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulate genes as well as alternative splicing genes during this process.

DESIGN
Breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 was given paclitaxel treatment and exogenous TRA2A expression before RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Then we get three groups of samples: Control, PTX (MDA-MB-231 with paclitaxel treatment), 231T (MDA-MB-231 with exogenous TRA2A expression).
