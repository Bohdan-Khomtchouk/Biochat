TITLE
DNA methylation represents one of the key regulator that transcriptional control of highly expressed genes in gastric cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray approach to establish demethylated specific genes profiles in early gastric cancer.

DESIGN
We analyzed 11 gastric cancer cell lines and 32 pairs of gastric cancer and normal samples to discover methylation signatures specific to gastric cancer cells.
