TITLE
CD5 alters gene transcription in Jok-1 B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess the impact of CD5 on the transcriptome in B cells, we studied changes in mRNA levels in Jok-E1A/Jok-E1B cells compared with Jok-1 cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression was performed in untransfected CD5-negative hairy B cell leukemia line (Jok-1), transfected with cDNA for either the membrane isoform of CD5 (E1A; Jok-E1A) or the cytoplasmic E1B isoform (Jok-E1B). Three biological replicates  were performed.
