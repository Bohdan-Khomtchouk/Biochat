TITLE
Gene expression analysis of WT and Tfap4–/– OT-I cells activated by Listeria monocytogenes expressing ovalbumin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression of Tfap4–/– and WT OT-I T cells were compared 4 or 6 days after activation with Listeria monocytogenes infection in vivo with the ERCC spike-in RNA control.

DESIGN
Naive CD8+ T cells from Tfap4–/– OT-I or control WT OT-I TCR transgenice mice were adoptively transferred to congenic host mice that were subsequently infected with Listeria monocytogenes expression ovalbumin. Activated OT-I cells were harvested 4 days or 6 days after infection and gene expression was compared using microarray.  1 μL of 1:1,000 diluted External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) RNA Spike-In Control Mixes (Ambion) was added to total RNA extracted from 1 x 10^5 cells prior to amplification. Gene expression was quantitated by RMA normalization to Signal intensity and signal intensities were further converted by formula obtained from linear regression of signals for spiked-in control RNA between samples to obtain cell number-normalized gene expression.
