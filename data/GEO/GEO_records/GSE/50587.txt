TITLE
H3K27me3 and H3K4me2 profiles along the length of the X chromosome in trophoblast stem (TS) cells and Extra-embryonic endoderm stem cells (XEN), ChIP-chip

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This analysis includes H3K27me3 and H3K4me2 profiles along the length of the X-chromosome in male (F2) and female (F3) TS cells and in male (GHP7/7) and female (GHP7/9) XEN cells.

DESIGN
Analysis of H3K27me3 and H3K4me2 profiles in four different cell populations. Two independent biological replicates for each cell population are provided. The array includes approx. 162,5 Mb of the X chromosome and approx. 14,6 Mb of chromosome 17 as a control.
