TITLE
ChIP-Sequencing of p705 Stat3 in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examine the role of Stat3 in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and determine that direct binding of Stat3 to the Etv6 promoter, and subsequent upregulation, in part, promotes differentiation.

DESIGN
Examination of Stat3 DNA binding in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
