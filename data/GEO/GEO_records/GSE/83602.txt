TITLE
Effect of vaccine administration routes on responses to a Bordetella pertussis outer membrane vesicle vaccine - lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pulmonary immunization with an outer membrane vesicle pertussis vaccine led to improved protection and induction of a completely distinct immune response compared to subcutaneous administration. These adaptive responses were linked to early local and systemic signatures on the transcriptome level.

DESIGN
23 arrays, including replicates and controls, analyzed on Affymetrix genechips

PLATFORM
GPL21382 [HT_MG-430_PM] Affymetrix HT MG-430 PM Array Plate [CDF: HTMG430PM_Mm_ENTREZG, Brainarray version 19]
