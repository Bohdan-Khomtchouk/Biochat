TITLE
High-resolution enzymatic mapping of genomic 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We describe the use of a novel DNA modification-dependent restriction endonuclease AbaSI coupled with sequencing (Aba-seq) to map high-resolution hydroxymethylome of mouse E14 embryonic stem cells. The specificity of AbaSI enables sensitive detection of 5hmC at low occupancy regions. Bioinformatic analysis suggests 5hmCs in genic regions closely follows the 5mC distribution. 5hmC is generally depleted in CpG islands and only enriched in a small set of repetitive elements. A regularly spaced and oscillating 5hmC pattern was observed at the binding sites of CTCF. 5hmC is enriched at the poised enhancers with the mono-methylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1) marks, but not at the active enhancers with the acetylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27Ac) marks. Non-CG hydroxymethylation appears to be prevalent in the mitochondrial genome. We propose that some amounts of transiently stable 5hmCs may indicate a poised epigenetic state or de-methylation intermediate, while others may suggest a locally accessible chromosomal environment to the TET enzymatic apparatus.

DESIGN
Mapping of genomic 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in mouse embryonic stem cell by enzymatic digistion of  AbaSI coupled with high-throughput sequencing, in replicates.
