TITLE
Transcriptome of inner bark in Hevea brasiliensis

ORGANISM
Hevea brasiliensis

SUMMARY
We report transcriptome data of four kinds of bark samples from the Hevea brasiliensis clone CATAS7-33-97 by use of next-generation massively parallel sequencing technologies and de novo transcriptome assembly. The output of sequenced data showed that a total of 323,842,182 clean reads with average length of 90 nt were generated in four samples. Totally 67,873 uingenes with an average length of 750 nt and a N50 of 1,222 nt were assembled through transcriptome de novo assembly. The all assembled sequences were annotated with gene descriptions, gene ontology and clusters of orthologous group terms. The comparative analysis of the transcriptome data performed with the criteria of FDR ≤ 0.001 and |log2 Ratio| ≥ 1. As a result, 15,780 different expression unigenes (8,646 up and 7,134 down ) were detected in early libraries (Control-A versus COR-A) upon coronatine treatment, and 19,824 different expression unigenes (7,711 up and 12,113 down) were detected in late libraries (Control-B versus COR-B) upon coronatine treatment. Functional analysis of different expression unigenes showed that mass of unigenes were annotated in multiple signaling pathways. Comparative transcriptome analysis of inner bark in response to coronatine reveals a new insight into the signal networks for the secondary laticifer differentiation from vascular cambia in rubber tree.
