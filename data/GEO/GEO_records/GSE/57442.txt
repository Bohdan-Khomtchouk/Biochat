TITLE
microRNA atlas of dendritic cell (DC) development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We determined the microRNA profile of conventional DCs, plasmacytoid DCs, in vitro derived conventional DCs, and DC precursors in the bone marrow. We then compared conventional DCs to plasmacytoid DCs, conventional DCs and in vitro conventional DCs. In addition, we used MDS analysis to compare all the profiles.

DESIGN
14 profiles were produced. Duplicates of LSKs, CMPs, CLPs, CDPs, conventional DCs, plasmacytoid DCs, in vitro cDCs were sequenced.

PLATFORM
