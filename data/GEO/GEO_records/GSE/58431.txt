TITLE
TK6 toxicogenomics reference database

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TK6 cells were exposed to various perturbations and then the transcriptome profiles were collected at 4 hours to assemble a reference database to generate a Genotoxic / Nongenotoxic classifier using the nearest shrunken centroids method.
