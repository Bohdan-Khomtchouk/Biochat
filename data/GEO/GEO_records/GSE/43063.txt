TITLE
Genome wide mapping of histone 3 lysine 79 dimethylation in MLL rearranged and control human leukemia cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the genome wide distribution of H3K79 dimethylation in the human MLL-AF6 rearranged cell line ML2 as well as the human MOLM13 and HL60 cell lines

DESIGN
Examination of H3K79 dimethylation in  the MLL-AF6 fusion positive human leukemia cell line ML2 and control cell lines MOLM-13 and HL60. The MLL-AF6 positive ML2 cell line (obtained from DSMZ) and the cell lines HL60 and MOLM 13 were grown under standard conditions and 1 million cells were fixed/crosslinked and used for ChIP-seq with H3K79 dimethylation specific antibody Ab3594 (Abcam)
