TITLE
CD44s transfection in HEK cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to understand the transcriptional effects of CD44s expression in a cell line that does not express CD44 in its native form we transfected CD44s into HEK cells and measured the transcriptional chances compared to native HEK cells

DESIGN
Three biological replicates from each condition (native HEK cells and CD44s transfected cells) were measured using Affymetrix arrays
