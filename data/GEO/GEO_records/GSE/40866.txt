Characteristics of Cross-Hybridization and Cross-Alignment in Pseudo-Xenograft samples by RNA-Seq and Microarrays [Illumina HumanWG-6 v3.0]

SUMMARY
In order to study molecular changes in the stroma from tissue samples it is recommended to separate tumor tissue from stromal tissue. This is particularly relevant to mouse tumor xenograft models where tumor, particularly metastatic tumors, can be small and difficult to separate from the host tissue. In our research we compared qualitatively the ability of high-throughput mRNA sequencing, RNA-Seq, and microarrays to detect tumor (human) and stromal (mouse) expression from mixed tumor-stromal samples in terms of the genes and pathways that are involved in cross-alignment (RNA-Seq) and cross-hybridization (microarrays).
