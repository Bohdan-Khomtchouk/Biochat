TITLE
Validation of chicken array for gene expression analysis in turkey

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus ; Meleagris gallopavo

SUMMARY
To validate the use of chicken array for turkey, the ability of species-specific hybridization (SSH, chicken samples-chicken arrays) and cross-species hybridization (CSH, turkey samples-chicken arrays) were compared in the same biological conditions. Reproductively active laying chickens and reproductively inactive non-laying pullets were used to generate the results for SSH. Similarly, reproductively active laying turkeys and reproductively inactive non-laying photorefractory turkeys were used to generate the results for CSH.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiments, reproductively active laying chickens vs. reproductively inactive non-laying pullets and reproductively active laying turkeys vs. reproductively inactive non-laying photorefractory turkeys. Four biological replicates with dye swap.

PLATFORM
