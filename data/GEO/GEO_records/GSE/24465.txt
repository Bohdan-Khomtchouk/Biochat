TITLE
Mesenchymal Nuclear factor I B regulates cell proliferation and epithelial differentiation during lung maturation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated Nfibf/f mice and then cross with Dermo1-Cre mice to obtain Nfibf/f, Dermo1-Cre mice. In these Nfibf/f, Dermo1-Cre mice, there are defects in sacculation and epithelial cell differentiation. We performed micoarray analysis to find the genes which are possibley regulated by NFI-B and related to lung maturation during lung development.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to performing transcriptional profiling of Nfibf/f, Dermo1-Cre and Nfibf/f lungs at E18.5
