TITLE
Deep sequencing of microRNA present in ejaculated bull spermatozoa

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The objectives of our study were to identify microRNA (miRNA) present in bovine sperm.

DESIGN
Angus bulls (n=6) were assigned to treatments of either toxic or non-toxic fescue seed diets. Semen was collected and subjected to RNA isolation, enriched for miRNA. Three samples from each treatment group were chosen based on RNA quality and pooled for deep sequencing.
