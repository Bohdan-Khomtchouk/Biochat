TITLE
Expression data from HUVEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression profile of HUVEC in response to IgG or HECD-1 treated exosomes We used data from this array to identify differentiatly expressed genes.

DESIGN
RNA extracted form HUVEC treated with IgG / HECD-1 exosomes, processed for Affymetrix microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL16686 [HuGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
