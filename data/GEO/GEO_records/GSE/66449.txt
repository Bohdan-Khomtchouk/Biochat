TITLE
Healthy adults' blood gene expression who ingested Salacia reticulata plant extract

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In human volunteers, we evaluated changes in gene expression profiles, immunological indices, and  intestinal microbiota of blood cells in subjects consuming a S.reticulata extract. Thirty healthy Japanese males were split randomly into a group ingesting 240 mg/day of S.reticulata extract -containing tablets for 4 weeks and a control group ingesting placebo tablets.   Ingestion of the S.reticulata extract improved T cell proliferation and other immunological indices, and changed intestinal microbiota, increasing Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillales and decreasing Clostridium bacteria. Expression levels of many immuno-relevant genes were altered.  We have shown the S.reticulata extract to enhance human immune functions.

DESIGN
In the S.reticulata extract ingestion group, 7 subjects (14 samples) were chosen randomly and subjected to pre- (B) and post-ingestion(T) gene expression analysis.
