TITLE
Effect of Pnpla6 gene silencing in D3 mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pnpla6 gene was silenced in D3 mouse embryonic stem cells and the cells were allowed to spontaneously differentiate. Transcription of the whole genome was analyzed 96 days afterwards and compared against control cells differentiated during the same time without previous silencing.

DESIGN
Comparimg two experimental conditions: control differentiated cells versus Pnpla6 silenced differentiated cells.
