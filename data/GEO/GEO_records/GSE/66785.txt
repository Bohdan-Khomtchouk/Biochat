TITLE
Differential mRNA expression profile regulated by HNF4α in Hep3B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A previous study from this laboratory demonstrated that up-regulating HNF4a could reverse the malignant phenotypes of HCC by inducing redifferentiation of HCC cells to hepatocytes. To study the mechanisms of the hepatic differentiation effect by HNF4α, we used the cDNA microarray to detect differential gene expression profiles of Hep3B infected with AdHNF4α and AdGFP. Expression profile analysis revealed that HNF4α positively regulated 1218 mRNAs and negatively regulated 1411 mRNAs for more than 2 times. The pathway analysis for the differential genes showed that the genes were involved in Complement and coagulation cascades, metabolism, Type II diabetes mellitus, Pathways in cancer etc.

DESIGN
Hepatoma cell lines Hep3B cells were seeded onto culture dishes  and infected with AdHNF4α and AdGFP (as a control) at MOI 100. After Hep3B was infected by AdHNF4α or AdGFP for 72 hours, the cells were collected for cDNA Microarray analysis.
