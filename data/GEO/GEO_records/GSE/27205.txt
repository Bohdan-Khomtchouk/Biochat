TITLE
Global gene expression profile and splicing events of iPS-derived motorneurons from SMA patient, unaffected father and TGC-treated cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease and is the second most common genetic disorder leading to death in childhood. Motoneurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) obtained by reprogramming SMA patient and his healthy father fibroblasts, and genetically corrected SMA-iPSC obtained converting SMN2 into SMN1 with target gene correction (TGC), were used to study gene expression and splicing events linked  to pathogenetic mechanisms. Microarray technology was used to assess the global gene expression profile as well as splicing events of iPS-derived motorneurons from SMA patient, unaffected father and TGC-treated cells.

DESIGN
The microarray data derived from three different groups: SMA patient, healty father and treated SMA patient's cells. Each population consists of three RNA profiling cell samples.
