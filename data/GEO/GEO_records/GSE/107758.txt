TITLE
Additive Effects of Quorum Sensing Anti-activators on Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence Traits and Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
RNA-seq of the previously uncharacterized QslA and QteE regulons revealed overlapping, yet distinct groups of differentially expressed genes. Simultaneous inactivation of qteE and qslA had the largest effect on gene expression with 999 genes induced and 798 genes repressed in the double mutant vs. wild-type. We found that LasR and RhlR-activated QS genes formed a subset of the genes induced in the qteE, qslA, and double mutant. The activation of almost all of these QS genes was advanced from stationary phase to log phase in the qteE qslA double mutant.
