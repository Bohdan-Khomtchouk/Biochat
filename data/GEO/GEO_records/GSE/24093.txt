TITLE
Expression gene (angiocrine) profile of various activated endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Endothelial cells were transduced with different genes modulating signaling pathways and compared to GFP transduced control group to identify changes in the expression of the angiocrine factors.

DESIGN
The experiment compared endothelial genetic changes upon Akt, MAP kinase and PymT activation.
