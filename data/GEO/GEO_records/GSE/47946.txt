TITLE
Transcriptome of embryonic stem cells cultured in enzymatic and mechanic passaging methods [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
hESC have morphologic, genetic and genomic alternatiions when cells cultured in different passaging condition.

DESIGN
Cells had initially mechanic passaging. From the initiating passage p13, cell were switched to enzymatic passaging after 15 passage (p13+EP15). Another sample was from cells after 15 mechanic passages (p13+MP15) which was designed as control. The transcripome of p13, p13+EP15 and p13+MP15 was analyzed with RNA sequencing by Illumina HiSeq2000 next-generation sequencer.
