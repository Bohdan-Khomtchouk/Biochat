TITLE
Gene expression profiling of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas supervised by CD5 expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD5-positive (CD5+) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has a poor prognosis and high incidence of central nervous system (CNS) relapse, even in the rituximab era. To determine the gene expression profile of CD5+ DLBCL, total RNA from 90 patients with DLBCL, including 33 CD5+ DLBCL and 57 CD5-negative (CD5-) DLBCL patients, was examined using Agilent human oligo microarrays. These cases were separated into 78 activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCLs and 12 germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCLs. All cases of CD5+ DLBCL were classified as ABC DLBCLs. The classifier based on gene expression used in a supervised analysis correctly identified CD5 expression in the DLBCL and ABC DLBCL samples. The gene most relevant to CD5 expression was SH3BP5. The enriched GO categories in the CD5+ ABC DLBCL signature gene set were multicellular organismal signaling, transmission of nerve impulse, and synaptic transmission. This present study, which includes the largest reported number of patients with CD5+ DLBCL, confirmed that most CD5+ DLBCLs are ABC DLBCLs, suggesting that therapeutic strategies for ABC DLBCL may be effective for the treatment of CD5+ DLBCL. Our CD5+ ABC DLBCL signature gene set may provide insights into the cause of the high frequency of CNS relapse in CD5+ DLBCL.

DESIGN
This present study involved 90 cases (33 patients with CD5+ DLBCL and 57 with CD5- DLBCL) of de novo consecutive DLBCL diagnosed at Mie University Hospital with available frozen biopsy specimens and total RNA samples. Lymphoma tissue RNA from 90 patients was extracted for target preparation and hybridization onto Agilent microarrays. The expression of CD5 in tumor cells was confirmed by means of immunohistochemistry using frozen sections.
