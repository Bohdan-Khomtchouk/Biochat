TITLE
The Host Response to a Clinical MDR Mycobacterial Strain Cultured in a Detergent-Free Environment: A Global Transcriptomics Approach

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We infect bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) with Mycobacterium cultured with and without Tween 80 and asses the host response to these bacteria through RNAseq

DESIGN
Uninfected BMDMs served as controls, BMDMs infected with detergent-free M.tb (designated RNT), BMDMs infected with Tween cultured m.tb (designated RT). 3 groups with 3 biological replicates, each analysed in triplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL15907 AB 5500xl Genetic Analyzer (Mus musculus)
