TITLE
Identification of new markers of cutaneous melanoma invasion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T1C3 is a clonal cell line from a human melanoma tumor, expressing PNA lectin, and characterized by a high capacity of dermal invasion. IC8 is a clonal cell line from a human melanoma tumor, negative for PNA lectin, and non-invasive. To identify new gene markers involved in the mechanisms of early invasion, oligonuclotide microarrays were used to assess transcriptional chnages between the two cell lines.

DESIGN
Dye-swap hybridization were performed. Slides were scanned with a Genepix 4000 microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Molecular devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For each hybridized spot, the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence values were obtained by using Genepix Pro 4.0 software (Axon Instruments) and were saved as a result file.
