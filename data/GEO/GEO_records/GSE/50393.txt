TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in LIF and LIF plus CHIR99021 in C57BL/6 mouse embryonic stem cells(B6 mESCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of genes induced by CHIR99021 CHIR99021 is a inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and can promote B6 mESC sef-renewal when combined with LIF in serum condition.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from B6 mESCs treated with LIF or LIF/CHIR99021 for 12 hours.

PLATFORM
