TITLE
Temporal transcriptional profiling of polyamine-depleted NIH3T3 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Polyamines are absolutely required for cell growth and proliferation. While polyamine depletion results in reversible cell cycle arrest, the actual mechanism of growth inhibition is still obscure. This work aimed at determining the cellular processes affected by reduction in the intracellular polyamine levels

DESIGN
In order to reveal the general transcriptional responses to polyamine depletion in mammalian cells, NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were treated with 1mM L-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), G1 cellular fractions were collected by sorting at 0,12, 24, 48 and 96 hours upon addition of the reagent, total RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix MoGene 1.0 ST  DNA array.
