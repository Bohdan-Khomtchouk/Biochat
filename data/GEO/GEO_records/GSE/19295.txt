TITLE
HER2 and EGFR dependent activation of RalA in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Activated HER2 and EGFR stimulate the Ras small GTPases, which in turn primarily activate the MAPK, PI3K-Akt and RalGEF-Ral pathways.  While activation of the MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways downstream of HER2 and EGFR promote mammary tumorigenesis, little is known regarding the role of the RalGEF-Ral pathway.  RalGEFs convert the small GTPases RalA and RalB to an active GTP-bound state.  Of the two proteins, only activated RalA is transforming, while RalB is more important for cell motility, and hence we investigated the role of RalA in HER2-overexpressing and EGFR-positive breast cancer.  We now report that shRNA-mediated knockdown of RalA reduced the in vitro transformed growth and in vivo tumorigenic growth of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, while knockdown of RalB reduced migration and invasion.  Lastly, we demonstrate that expression of activated HER2 increases RalA-GTP levels, and that a number of genes associated with activated RalA are elevated in tumor compared to normal mammary tissue.  Taken together, these results suggest a possible role for RalA in mammary tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Four independent cultures of HEK-HT cells stably infected with a retrovirus confirmed to expressed RalAQ72L and four independent cultures of HEK-HT cells stably infected with a control retrovirus RalA activation expression analysis
