TITLE
Gene expression profiling of LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs conditionally expressing MLL-ENL

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have developed a new conditional transgenic mouse showing that MLL-ENL, at an endogenous-like expression level, induces leukemic transformation selectively in LT-HSCs. To investigate the molecular mechanism of leukemic transformation in LT-HSCs conditionally expressing MLL-ENL, we preliminarily performed comprehensive gene expression profiling of CreER-transduced LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs using cDNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
For initial screening of candidate genes invloved in the leukemic transformation, total RNA was extracted from colony-forming cells derived from LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs transduced with CreER or mock. Four samples were analyzed, and CreER-transduced LT/ST-HSC-derived cells were compared with mock-transduced LT/ST-HSC-derived cells, while CreER/mock-transduced LT-HSC-derived cells were compared with CreER/mock-transduced ST-HSC-derived cells.
