TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and ppr10 deletion  Schizosaccharomyces pombe cell Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to compare Wild Type and ppr10 deletion Schizosaccharomyces pombe cell Transcriptomes and to find the cause of cell apoptosis.

DESIGN
Cell mRNA profiles of logarithmic phase wild-type (WT) and ppr10 deletion Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina His4000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrowsâ€“Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat followed by Cufflinks.The goals of this study is to  find the cause of cell apoptosis.
