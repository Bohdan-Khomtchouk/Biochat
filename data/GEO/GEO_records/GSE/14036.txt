TITLE
High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization of genetic deficiencies on chromosome V in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We have extended our array-CGH analysis of genetic deficiencies in Caenorhabditis elegans to a set on LGV (left) balanced by the reciprocal translocation eT1. This set includes 20 deletions and a single duplication. Keywords: C.elegans Deficiencies CGH

DESIGN
20 test samples from heterozygous deficiency containing strains individually hybridized to reference DNA from BC2842 (eT1 balanced strain), BC1999 (sDf72), BC3470 (sDf40) or BC3957 (sDf74)

PLATFORM
GPL4553 Array designs: Whole Genome
