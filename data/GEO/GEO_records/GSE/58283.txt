TITLE
Gene expression profiling of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow (BM) cells were obtained by flushing the long bones of 8-week old  C57BL/6 mice. BM cells were then were plated in macrophage SFM medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and CSF-1 (Peprotech, 100 ng/ml) and cultured for one week to allow macrophage differentiation. BMDMs were polarized by adding IL-4 to the medium (40 ng/ml, Peprotech) for 72h or left untreated.

DESIGN
8 samples total, 2 groups, 4 biological replicates in each group

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
