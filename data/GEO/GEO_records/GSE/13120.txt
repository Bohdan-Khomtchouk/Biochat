TITLE
Age-related gene expression changes in mouse neocortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aging is associated with major nuclear changes affecting genomic integrity and gene expression. Here we compare the gene expression profiles in the neocortex of young (5 months old) and old (30 months old) B6xC3 F1 mice. In a related study, we compare genes that change expression with age to SIRT1 associated genes identified by ChIP on chip (NimbleGen) and find a significant overlap, indicating that SIRT1 target genes are preferentially deregulated with age. Keywords: gene expression comparison, age-comparison
