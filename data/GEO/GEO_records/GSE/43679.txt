TITLE
Identification of DNA palindromes in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA palindromes are implicated as a causative agent in cancer formation due to their association with genomic instability and DNA amplification. However, the unique properties of palindromes render them refractory to current methods of analyses including PCR amplification and cloning into bacterial vectors.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was isolated from 3 million cells. One microgram of genomic DNA was labeled using SNP6 core reagent kit and hybridized onto Genome-wide human SNP Array 6.0.
