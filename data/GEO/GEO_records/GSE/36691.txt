TITLE
Design and use of multiplexed chemostat arrays

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We developed and validated a small-footprint array of miniature chemostats built from readily available parts for low cost. Physiological and experimental evolution results were similar to larger volume chemostats. The ministat array provides a compact, inexpensive, and accessible platform for traditional chemostat experiments, functional genomics, and chemical screening applications.

DESIGN
Three experiments are gene expression comparisons between three ministat cultures and a single Sixfors sample.  The four CGH arrays are individual clones evolved in four sulfate limitation ministats compared to a wt ancestor strain.
