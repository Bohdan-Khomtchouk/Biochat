TITLE
Microarray analysis of epithelial and fibroblast cells in chronic rhinosinusitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps (CRSsNP) is typified by inflammation of the sinonasal epithelium and the development of fibrosis.  The precise pathophysiology of this common condition remains elusive.  Here we aim to investigate the transcriptome (RNA transcripts in the cell) of the component nasal epithelial and fibroblast cells in CRSsNP and health to identify if there are clusters of differentially expressed genes as possible novel CRS therapeutic targets.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling by Illumina BeadArray of primary nasal epithelial and fibroblast cells in heatlh and chronic sinusitis.  Samples from consenting human donors (Epithelial Case, n=13, Epithelial Control, n=11, Fibroblast Case, n=12, Fibroblast Control, n=12).
