TITLE
cis-Expression QTL Analysis of Established Risk Variants for Colorectal Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 19 risk variants associated with colorectal cancer.  As most of these risk variants reside outside the coding regions of genes, we conducted cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) analyses to investigate possible regulatory functions on the expression of neighboring genes.

DESIGN
Forty microsatellite stable and CpG island methylator phenotype-negative colorectal tumors and paired adjacent-normal colon tissues were used for genome-wide SNP and gene expression profiling in our cis-eQTL analyses. This submission represents transcriptome component of study.
