TITLE
Expression data from WT and Aire KO thymic medullary epithelial cells (MECs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to analyze the transcriptional effects of Aire deficiency in the thymus, using the Affymetrix MoGene platform to analyze variation in exon usage

DESIGN
MECs were isolated from 4-6 wk-old WT or Aire KO ((B6xNOD)F1 background) mice. Three WT and three Aire-KO mice taken individually were used.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
