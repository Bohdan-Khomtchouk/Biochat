TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of the basal region of poplar stems during the early gravitropic response

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa x Populus deltoides

SUMMARY
Young poplar stems show a preponderantly primary growth in the top internodes and differential cambium activity in the basal internodes after inclination with some tension wood formed after 45 min. This study was conducted in order to characterize the early changes in gene expression during early stages of the gravitropic response in the poplar.
