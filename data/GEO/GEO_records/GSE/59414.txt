TITLE
Role of areca nut induced TGF-β and epithelial mesenchymal interaction in pathogenesis of precancerous Oral submucous fibrosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the role of areca nut and TGF-β induced gene expression changes in fibroblasts and its contibution in the manifestation of Oral submucous fibrosis, we studied gene expression profile in primary human gingival fibroblast (hGF) cells following treatment with areca nut, TGF-β and both together.

DESIGN
Control Vs Areca nut 5 µg/ml water extract (5H) (2), Contro Vs TGF-β (2), Control Vs Areca nut (5 µg/ml)  and TGF-β (5 ng/ml) (5H+T) (2).     (2)- Biological duplicates.
