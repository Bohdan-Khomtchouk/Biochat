TITLE
mRNA sequence of Drosophila melanogaster heads to evaluate the neurological effects of larval diet on adults

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila melanogaster larvae reared on isocaloric diets with different protein/sugar ratios, exhibit different developmental times and the eclosed adults show different metabolite pools of glycogen and triglycerides (Matzkin et al., 2011, PMID: 21525254).  To investigate the effect of larval diet on adult neurological processes at the gene expression level we performed high throughout RNA sequencing of fly heads reared in two different protein/sugar ratio diets.

DESIGN
The design involved three factors: Diet (fixed), Sex (fixed) and Strain (random).   There were two diets.  One with a high protein/sugar ratio (HPS) and the other with a low protein/sugar ratio (LPS). We collected heads from Males (M) and Females (F) of three Drosophila melanogaster isofemales lines which were collected near University of California San Diego by T. Markow.  The three strains were collected in September of 2010 are referred to as SD2, SD3 and SD6. We performed 12 replicate (2x2x3) treatments. 70-80 heads from 2-6 h post-eclosion flies were dissected per treatment. We performed polyA selection and generated single end 75 bp reads on a total of 12 samples. There are 13 samples in this submission because the first C1 library made failed (data not included) and when the repeat library was made (successful, data represented as GSM2187059) another library was also made for sample C7 (GSM2187065), which is labeled D1 (GSM2187066).
