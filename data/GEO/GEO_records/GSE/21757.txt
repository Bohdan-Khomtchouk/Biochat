TITLE
Expression data throughout reprogramming of MEF to iPS using a Dox-inducible promoter

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
6C secondary MEFs were treated with Dox in mES media to turn on the Oct4, Klf4, cMyc, Sox2. Total RNA was extracted at day 0 (no Dox), day2, 5, 8, 11, 16 and 21 (with Dox) and day 30 (Dox-independent secondary iPS). RNA from Parental MEFs and Primary-iPS cells were also extracted for reference. 1B secondary MEFs were Dox treated for 5-days followed by RNA extraction. Subsequently, a culture removed of Dox treatment for an additional 5days was also analyzed.

DESIGN
Samples from 6C-clones were smoothed using a polynomial fitting. Subsequently, phase analysis was carried out based on point of change greater than 2-fold.
