TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Candida albicans bcr1 knockout.

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Whole genome microarrays were used to compare the transcriptional profile of Candida albicans bcr1 knockout to wild type cells.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from DAY286 (wild type) or bcr1 delete (CJN702) grown in SD medium supplemented with 50 mM glucose and 10% feotal calf serum and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5. Four independent biological replicates were compared. Two dye swaps were perfomed so that two of the four DAY286 cultures were labeled with Cy3, and two were labeled with Cy5.
