TITLE
Comparative Methylome Analyses Reveal Human Brain Specific Methylated Regions Implicated in Transcription Regulation

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
To gain further insights into human brain specific epigenetic changes, we generated whole genome bisulfite sequencing methylation maps (methylomes) of rhesus macaque brains. These were then compared to methylomes of human and chimpanzee brains that were previously generated. We then performed validation experiments using targeted bisulfite sequencing.Â 

DESIGN
Bisulfite-seq in prefrontal cortext of two male Macaca mulatta

PLATFORM
GPL14954 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Macaca mulatta)
