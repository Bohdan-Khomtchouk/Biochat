TITLE
Identification of PM-localized proteins

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In order to assess the quality of alleged PM identifications from Arabidopsis, PM-enriched fractions were compared to PM-depleted fractions using 18O isotopic labeling and mass spectrometry. The two samples submitted are biological replicates. Keywords: Protein Localization via MS

DESIGN
Two biological replicates were analyzed in order to assess sample complexity.  PM-derived vesicles were digested in 18O water and compared to PM-depleted fractions digested in 16O (natural abundance) water.  Relative ion intensities were then used to calculate a heavy/lite ratio with proteins showing enrichment in the upper phase having a ratio greater than 1 or 0 on a log2 scale.
