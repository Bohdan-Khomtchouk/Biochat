TITLE
Global transcriptomic analysis of human pancreatic islets reveals novel genes influencing glucose metabolism [expression array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we harnessed the potential of expression arrays in 89 human pancreatic islet donors (different levels of blood glucose (HbA1c)) to identify genes regulated in this relevant tissue for type 2 diabetes (T2D).

DESIGN
Islets from cadaver donors were provided by the Nordic Islet Transplantation Programme (www.nordicislets.org), Uppsala University. The microarrays were performed using GeneChipÂ® Human Gene 1.0 ST whole transcript according to Affymetrix standard protocol.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
