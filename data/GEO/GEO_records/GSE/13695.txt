TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of wine yeast strains during colombar fermentation

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Comparative gene expression analysis of two wine yeast strains at three time points (days 2, 5 and 14) during fermentation of colombar must. In our study we conducted parallel fermentations with the VIN13 and BM45 wine yeast strains in two different media, namely MS300 (syntheticmust) and Colombar must. The intersection of transcriptome datasets from both MS300 (simulated wine must;GSE11651) and Colombar fermentations should help to delineate relevant and ‘noisy’ changes in gene expression in response to experimental factors such as fermentation stage and strain identity.
