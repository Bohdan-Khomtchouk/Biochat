TITLE
Comparison miRNA expression between atherosclerotic and non-atherosclerotic ischemic stroke patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The difference of circulating miRNA expressions by the presence of atherosclerosis in intra- and extra-cranial vessels were evaluated using serum of ischemic stroke patients.

DESIGN
Serum from atherosclerotic (n=7) and non-atherosclerotic (n=8) patients were collected and miRNAs were extracted for miRNA microarray.
