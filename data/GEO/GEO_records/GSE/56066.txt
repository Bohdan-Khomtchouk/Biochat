TITLE
RNA-seq data from MCF-7 cells (breast cancer model) treated with soy extracts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The MCF-7 were infected with either control adenovirus expressing B-galactosidase (Ad) or adenovirus expressing ERB (AdERbeta) for 72 h.  For knockdown of the endogenous ERa in MCF-7 cells, cells were treated with siRNA for 24h (AdERbeta+SiERalpha).  Then cells were treated with Veh (0.1% EtOH), 10 nM E2 or 1 uM BEs (botanical extracts) for 24h.

DESIGN
Duplicate samples run; treatment after knockdown included a control treatment (V), estradiol (E2) or botanical extracts; genistein (Gen), S-equol, liquiritigenin (Liq)
