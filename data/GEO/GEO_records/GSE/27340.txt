TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures on immunity for bursal peptide BSP-II

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further elucidate the mechanism of BSP-II on immunity on the broad molecular level, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to examine gene expression patterns during BSP-II treatment in a mouse derived hybridoma culture system. Hybridoma cell was treated ex vivo, and robust normalization of the data identified 1279 differentially expressed probe sets exhibiting minimum 1.5-fold changes that distinguished between BSP-II and control samples. Various pathwayswere significantly impacted by BSP-II treatment, and gene Ontology annotations show changes in the expression of molecules involved in immune and immunocyte related cellular processes. Expression of nine genes (MS4A2, CD3D, FGF21, CD80, PTPRC, NFATC4, IL2RB, Fas and LAT) from this signature was quantified in the RNA samples by QRT-PCR, confirming low variability between the predicted response patterns.

DESIGN
BSP-II induced gene expression in hybridoma cell was measured at 4 hours after exposure to doses of 0ug/ml and 5ug/ml.  Two independent experiments were performed using different cells for each experiment.
