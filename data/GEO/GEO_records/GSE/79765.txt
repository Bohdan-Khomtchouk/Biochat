TITLE
Effects of maggot excretions and secretions (ES) on human cultured cells in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Maggot ES is known to induce wound healing in vivo to improve chronic wound repair. The effects have been studies at the protein and molecular level but never before at the transcriptional level. Affymetrix microarrays were used to identify the genes modulated by maggot ES and link these to gene pathways to understand the molecular effects on cells.

DESIGN
Cells were plated in 6 well plates overnight before treating with 8Âµg/mL ES or an equal volume of carrier buffer PBS for 48 hours. Treatments were performed in three biological replicate. After the treatment time total RNA was isolated.
