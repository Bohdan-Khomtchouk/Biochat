TITLE
Gene Expression Profile Modified by TTT

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To study gene expression changes in the rat retina and choroid following transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) and to identify molecular mechanisms that may enhance treatment of choroidal neovascularization, complicating age-related macular degeneration. Keywords: Expression level alteration in the rat retina and choroid after TTT

DESIGN
In Brown Norway rats, one fundus was treated with an 810-nm diode laser while the contralateral fundus received no treatment. The mRNA was extracted and processed for cDNA microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
