TITLE
Gene Expression Profile Modified by TTT

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To study gene expression changes in the rat retina and choroid following transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) and to identify molecular mechanisms that may enhance treatment of choroidal neovascularization, complicating age-related macular degeneration. Keywords: Expression level alteration in the rat retina and choroid after TTT
