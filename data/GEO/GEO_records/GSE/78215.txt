TITLE
Gene expression linked to sleep homeostasis in murine cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Why we sleep is still one of the most perplexing mysteries in biology. Strong evidence, however, indicates that sleep is necessary for normal brain function and that the need to sleep is a tightly regulated process. Surprisingly molecular mechanisms that determine the need to sleep are incompletely described. Moreover, very little is known about transcriptional changes that specifically accompany the accumulation and discharge of sleep need. In this study we present an integrated 2 cross-laboratory analysis of the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) in gene expression in the mouse cortex. We also evaluate changes in gene expression genome-wide following various lengths of subsequent recovery sleep. (RS). We demonstrate that changes in gene expression specifically linked to SD or RS, and not to technical factors (e.g. the assay used), requires a novel analysis methodology not previously utilized in the field of sleep research.

DESIGN
Cortical samples from mice were analyzed, from groups that were sleep deprived, sleep deprived and allowed to recover for 1, 2, 3, or 6 hours, and circadian control animals that were not sleep deprived. The experimental protocol began at lights on (ZT0) with 13 mice: 1 sacrificed, 4 control mice left undisturbed, and 8 mice kept awake with gentle brushing when attempting to sleep.  After 5 hours of sleep deprivation the mice were randomly assigned to recovery sleep or continued sleep deprivation, and at fixed intervals the mice were sacrificed, dissected and the left cortex retained.  The experimental protocol was repeated 7 times, one animal per timepoint per experimental day, so that 7 independent experiments are represented for each timepoint. All animals were acclimated to the brushing and tapping on cages used during sleep deprivationfor 6 days, and dissections and tissue collection were performed by a single experimenter.
