TITLE
miRNA changes after overexpression of uc.372 in HepG2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify putative miRNA targets for uc.372, we overexpressed uc.372 in HepG2 cells and carried out a microarray analysis. A total of 66 miRNAs present in the array demonstrated 1.5-fold upregulation or downregulation of expression upon uc.372 transfection.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were tranfected with ad-uc.372 or ad-NC for 48 h. The RNA was collected and further applied for microarray analysis.
