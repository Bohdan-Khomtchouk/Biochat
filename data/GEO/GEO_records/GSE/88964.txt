TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of SAK-HV treatment caused hepatic genes expression in ApoE knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A novel recombinant fusion protein (SAK-HV) significantly decreased the serum levels of both total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) in apolipoproteinÂ E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice with hyperlipemia and remarkably ameliorated hepatic steatosis. Particularly, its lipid-lowering effect was significantly better than that of atorvastatin during the observation period of 2 weeks. We then collected the liver tissues of SAK-HV-treated ApoE-/- mice (n=7) and liver tissues of PBS-treated ApoE-/- mice to make the transcriptome chip, and analyze the lipid-lowering mechanism of SAK-HV in liver of ApoE-/- mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated liver tissue of SAK-HV-treated ApoE-/- mice (n=7,) compared to that of PBS-treated ApoE-/- mice control (n=5). These male mice aged 14 weeks was injected with SAK-HV or PBS via tail vein every other day for 7 times. Their liver tissue was collected 14 days after administration.
