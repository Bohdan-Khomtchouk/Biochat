TITLE
Tbr2 and Neurog2 transcription factor binding sites in E14.5 WT cerebral cortices

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To date, speculations on the molecular roles of Tbr2 transcription factor during specification, maintenance and differentiation of cortical specific Intermediate Neural Progenitors are coming from the analysis of loss- and gain-of-function experiments. However since its capacity to bind the DNA to extert its function we did Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation followed by deep sequencing to profile its target on the genome. We performed this approach directly in vivo to respect the physiological and peculiar enviroment of its action during cortical development. Moreover we did the same approach for Neurogenin 2 proneural gene. Interestingly the vast majority of the Neurog2 peaks are in common with Tbr2 dataset suggesting a co-operation between the two factors confirmed by biochemical and functional assays. Finally we compared Tbr2 dataset with the DNA regions bound by the H3K27me3 histone demethylase Jmjd3 (NCBI:Kdm6b) obtained by others. Interestingly we were able to find regions in common linked to important genes for neuronal differentiation.
