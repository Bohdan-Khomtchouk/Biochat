TITLE
Global microRNA expression profiling of serum from healthy controls vs serum from ovarian cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global microRNA expression profiling of serum were collected using Agilent miRNA microarrays (G4471A Human, Amadid 29297, Sanger 14)  carrying 887 individual human miRNA probes. Two different sources of RNA were analyzed: serum from healthy controls (N=5) and patients with ovarian carcinoma (CA, n=5)

DESIGN
Two conditions (CA, N), each condition is represented by 5 biological replicates

PLATFORM
