TITLE
A DNA methylation definition of biologically distinct breast cancer subtypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and tumoral tissues of the breast. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450 thousand CpGs in fresh frozen tissue samples (40 primary breast tumours and 17 normal breast tissues). Samples included morphologically normal samples of each tissue and tumor samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 57 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.
