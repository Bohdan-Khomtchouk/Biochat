TITLE
The effect of EDI3 inhibition in MCF7 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EDI3 was shown to be relevant in cell migration, adhesion and spreading. Gene expression analysis was performed to determine the effect of EDI3 silencing in MCF7 cells in order to gain insight into potential underlying mechanisms.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were transfected with either scrambled or EDI3 siRNA. Three biological replicates each with three technical replicates were performed.
