TITLE
Manduca sexta differential gene expression, male & female antenna, larval midgut

ORGANISM
Manduca sexta

SUMMARY
To allow estimation of the complexity of the antennal transcriptome between sexes as well as in comparison with a non-antennal tissue, microarrays were designed based on an assembly of new 454 sequence data from the antenna and publicly available data including 454 data from the larval midgut. The microarrays were hybridized with samples generated from the repsecitve tissues from 3 (antenna) and 5 (midgut) animals per sample, with four independent samples per sex (antenna) and tissue (midgut).

DESIGN
Sequence assembly of included Manduca antennal and gut ESTs (63) and all publicly available Genbank sequences was used with eArray (Agilent Technologies) for the design of 4 x 44K microarrays based on 60mer oligo probes.   For sex-specific antennal microarray hybridizations, RNA of three individuals of one sex was pooled per preparation, and 5 larvae each were dissected for gut tissue isolation with four biological replicates per sex (antennae) and tissue (gut), respectively. Double purified total RNA was added to Agilent Technologies spike-in RNA and labeld using QuickAmp Amplification kit (Agilent Technologies) and the Kreatech ULS Fluorescent Labeling Kit with cyanine 3-CTP dye following the manufacturerÂ´s instructions.  Amplified cRNA samples were used for microarray hybridization, scanned with the Agilent Microarray Scanner and data was extracted from TIFF images with Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.1. Raw data output files were analyzed using the GeneSpring GX11 and GeneSifter microarray analysis softwares.
