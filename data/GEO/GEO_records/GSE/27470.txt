TITLE
Manduca sexta differential gene expression, male

ORGANISM
Manduca sexta

SUMMARY
To allow estimation of the complexity of the antennal transcriptome between sexes as well as in comparison with a non-antennal tissue, microarrays were designed based on an assembly of new 454 sequence data from the antenna and publicly available data including 454 data from the larval midgut. The microarrays were hybridized with samples generated from the repsecitve tissues from 3 (antenna) and 5 (midgut) animals per sample, with four independent samples per sex (antenna) and tissue (midgut).
