TITLE
Analysis of early differentiation fates in human ES cells using diverse dosages of BMP and WNT signaling for the initial induction of differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human ES cells were induced to differentiate by applying differenent concentrations of BMP4 and WNT (CHIR00921) for 24 hours. The resulting differences in global gene expression were then analyzed at 36 hours

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from differentiated in-vitro samples after two weeks of differentiation

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
