TITLE
Expression analysis of Yarrowia lipolytica Y4184 snf1 mutant

ORGANISM
Yarrowia lipolytica

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Yarrowia lipolytica Y4184 snf1 mutant, compared to the Y4184U+.  The Y4184 is an engineered strain to produce eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) via expression of a Δ9 elongase/Δ8 desaturase pathway, and is derived from Yarrowia lipolytica ATCC#20362.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate cultures of Yarrowia lipolytica Y4184Ura+ strains and three separate cultures of Y4184 snf1 mutant strains in which YlSNF1 gene is deleted entirely.  Each chip measures the expression level of 6708 genes from Yarrowia lipolytica ATCC#20362 with fourteen 24-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
