TITLE
Gene expression in epithelial and non-epithelial cells of renal origin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We aimed to define epithelial-specific genes in the kidney. In the developing mouse kidney at E12.5 epithelial cells are restricted to the ureteric bud, while mesenchymal cells surrounding the ureteric bud are non-epithelial. The mouse renal epithelial cell line mIMCD-3 was used to represent kidney epithelia in vitro. Gene expression was analyzed using Affymetrix microarrays in ureteric bud stalks, ureteric bud tips, and mIMCD-3 cells and compared to metanephric mesenchyme.

DESIGN
Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarrays from mouse E12.5 ureteric bud tips, ureteric bus stalks, and metanephric mesenchymes had previously been published (GEO deposition: GDS1583) (Schmidt-Ott, K. M., Yang, J., Chen, X., Wang, H., Paragas, N., Mori, K., Li, J. Y., Lu, B., Costantini, F., Schiffer, M. et al. (2005). Novel regulators of kidney development from the tips of the ureteric bud. J Am Soc Nephrol 16, 1993-2002.). We added a new microarray analysis from a subclone of mIMCD-3 cells and recalculated expression values in the complete dataset by robust multichip analysis.
