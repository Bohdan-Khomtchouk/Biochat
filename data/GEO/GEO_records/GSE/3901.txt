TITLE
Response of quiescent human fibroblasts to different growth factors and serum

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Quiescent human fibroblasts (2091 and Wi-38) were stimulated with different growth factors and serum. Cells were collected at 6 different time points followed by global transcriptional profiling. Keywords: time course, growth factor response, cell line comparison

DESIGN
RNA from cells collected from each time point were compared with universal human reference RNA on microarrays. Time points other than 0 hr were then divided by time point 0, which gives relative expression ratios for each time point to their corresponding time point zero. There are 3 biological repeats for each growth factor treatment, each cell line.
