TITLE
Trancriptome Kinetics of Arsenic-induced Adaptive Response in Zebrafish Liver.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In this study, we performed microarray-based expression profiling on liver of zebrafish exposed to 60 mg/L (192?M) arsenic [As(V)] for 8-96 h, to identify global transcriptional programs and biological networks involved in arsenic-induced adaptive responses in vivo. We identified temporal differentially-expressed gene sets which we have grouped into early, late and all-time arsenic-responsive gene sets. Keywords: compound treatment design
