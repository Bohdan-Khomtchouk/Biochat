TITLE
Whole genome transcriptional responses to aluminum stress in rice roots

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We used RNA-Seq to perform a whole transcriptome analysis in roots of Azucena (tropical japonica), IR64 (indica), and the near-isogenic lines AZU[IR64121] and IR64[AZU12.1] in control conditions and treated with 80 Î¼M Al3+ activity  for 4 hours

DESIGN
Four independent biological replicates per genotype per treatment were analyzed

PLATFORM
GPL13160 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Oryza sativa)
