TITLE
human placenta-derived cell line (JEG-3): Control vs. valproic acid(VPA)-treated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human placenta-derived JEG-3 cell line comparing vehicle control with 7.38 mM of valproic acid(VPA)-treated JEG-3 cells for 48 hr. 7.38 mM valproic acid(VPA) induced the 30% inhibiotion of JEG-3 cell proliferation, G1 phase cell cycle arrest and the reduction of cell size. The Goal was to analyze the mechanism of valproic acid-induced adverse effects in placental cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, JEG-3 cells vs. valproic acid(VPA)-treated JEG-3 cells. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 VPA-treated replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL1708 Agilent-012391 Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray G4112A (Feature Number version)
