TITLE
Differential gene expression in notochord and nerve-cord fate segregation in the Ciona intestinalis embryo

ORGANISM
Ciona intestinalis

SUMMARY
Fertilized eggs are plulipotent and during early embryogenesis, embryonic cells gradually restrict their developmental potential and are eventually destined to give rise to one type of cells. Molecular mechanism underlying developmental fate restriction is one of the major research subjects of developmental biology. Here we address this question by combining a classical technique of blastomere isolation with a modern technique of microarray analysis. During the 6th cleavage of the Ciona intestinalis embryo, from the 32-cell to the 64-cell stage, four mother cells divide into daughter cells with two distinct fates, one giving rise to notochord and the other to nerve-cord precursor cells.  Nearly 500 notochord or nerve-cord precursor cells each were isolated, and difference in the quality of mRNAs between them was compared by microarray. This analysis identified 111 and 69 genes that are differentially expressed in the notochord and nerve-cord precursor cells, respectively. These included not only genes for transcription factors and signalling molecules but also those with functions that many kinds of cells used. In addition, whole-mount in situ hybridization showed complex and dynamic profiles of spatial expression of these genes during the segregation of the two fates. The process is accomplished by that transcripts that have been already present in the mother cell are properly partitioned into either type of cells and that new and preferential expression of genes in either type of cells.
