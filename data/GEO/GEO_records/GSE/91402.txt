TITLE
Molecular distinctions between motor neurons supplying Tibialis anterior (TA), Extensor digitorum longus (EDL), Peroneus longus (PL), Gastrocnemius (GS) and Intrinsic foot (IF) muscles [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To probe molecular distinctions in the specification of motor neurons innervating digit muscles we performed a screen for genetic markers that distinguish digit innervating motor neurons from other motor pools. Here, we compare the gene expression profiles of motor neurons that supply muscles with defined biomechanical functions.

DESIGN
TA, EDL, PL, GS and IF muscles were separately injected at p4 with CTB-555. Pool specific motor neurons were isolated by laser capture from spinal cord sections of p6 wild-type mice.  Each pool was profiled by three biological replicates, with each biological replicate containing 30-40 cells from 2-5 animals
