TITLE
Analysis of Gsk-3-Deficient Embryonic Stem Cells Reveals Large-Scale Alterations in Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The two vertebrate Gsk-3 isoforms, Gsk-3a and Gsk-3b, are encoded by distinct genetic loci and exhibit mostly redundant function in murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Here we report that deletion of both Gsk-3a and Gsk-3b in mouse ESCs results in significant changes in gene expression. In contrast, deletion of either Gsk-3a or Gsk-3b individually had little effect on gene expression. These data support the notion that Gsk-3 isoforms are functionally redundant in embryonic stem cells. In addition, we did not find the expected upregulation of known Wnt target genes. Our data suggests that Gsk-3-meidated regulation of gene expression in embryonic stem cells is complex, and likely involves affects on numerous signaling pathways.

DESIGN
The study was designed to examine the changes in gene expression between wild-type, Gsk-3a-/-, Gsk-3b-/-, and Gsk-3a-/-;Gsk-3b-/- mouse embryonic stem cells.
