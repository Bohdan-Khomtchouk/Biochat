TITLE
A network model of the molecular organization of chromatin in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Chromatin governs gene regulation and genome maintenance, yet a substantial fraction of the chromatin proteome is still unexplored. Moreover, a global model of the chromatin protein network is lacking. By screening > 100 candidates we identify 42 Drosophila proteins that were not previously associated with chromatin, which all display specific genomic binding patterns. Bayesian network modeling of the binding profiles of these and 70 known chromatin components yields a detailed blueprint of the in vivo chromatin protein network. We demonstrate functional compartmentalization of this network, and predict functions for most of the previously unknown chromatin proteins, including roles in DNA replication and repair, and gene activation and repression.

DESIGN
All DamID experiments were done in Drosophila Kc167 cells in duplicate. Samples were hybridized to 380k NimbleGen arrays with 300 bp probe spacing. Every experiment was done in duplicate in the reverse dye orientation, where Dam-fusion material was hybridized over Dam-only material.
