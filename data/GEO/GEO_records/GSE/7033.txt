TITLE
Estimating networks from RNA interference and microarray data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We here used the technology of RNA interference and cDNA microarrays to reconstruct a network between genes known to be disregulated in ER-positive breast cancer diseases. Therefor single genes of high importance were silenced and the effect of this pertubation was measured with cDNA microarrays Keywords: network_reconstruction_RNAi
