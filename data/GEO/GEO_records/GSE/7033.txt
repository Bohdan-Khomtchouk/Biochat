TITLE
Estimating networks from RNA interference and microarray data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We here used the technology of RNA interference and cDNA microarrays to reconstruct a network between genes known to be disregulated in ER-positive breast cancer diseases. Therefor single genes of high importance were silenced and the effect of this pertubation was measured with cDNA microarrays Keywords: network_reconstruction_RNAi

DESIGN
human ER-positive breast cancer cell line was cultivated as described and transfection with chemically synthesized siRNAs was performed according to standard HiPerFect transfection protocol by Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) At least 4 cDNA-microarrays were hybridized in dye-swap method for the silencing of every gene of interest. To minimize off-target effects we used at least two different siRNAs per gene.
