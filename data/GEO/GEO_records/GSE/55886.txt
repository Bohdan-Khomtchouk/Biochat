TITLE
Effect of Spot14 Loss on Gene Expression Profile of MMTV-PyMT Mouse Tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Thyroid Hormone Responsive Protein Spot14 (Spot14) loss on the gene expression profiles of tumors from MMTV-Polyomavirus middle-T antigen (PyMT) mice.  MMTV-PyMT/S14-heterozygous mice were crossed with S14-heterozygous mice and 1 cm tumors from MMTV-PyMT control (wild-type S14) or MMTV-PyMT/S14-null offspring were profiled using Affymetrix gene arrays.  Tumor latency was not different between groups; however, tumors lacking S14 grew significantly slower than control tumors.  Loss of S14 also decreased the levels of de novo synthesized fatty acids in mammary tumors.  In additional studies, performed on MMTV-Neu mice, we found that S14 overexpression was associated with increased tumor cell proliferation and elevated levels of tumor fatty acids.  Gene expression profiling revealed that S14 loss and overexpression in mouse mammary tumors altered pathways associated with proliferation and metabolism.  This study provides important information about the role of S14 in mammary tumorigenesis and tumor metabolism.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed on 4 mammary tumors from MMTV-PyMT mice and 4 tumors from MMTV-PyMT/S14-null mice.
