TITLE
Global microarray analysis of changes of gene expression in the epidermis of K14-caSmad1 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling plays a key role in the control of skin development and postnatal remodelling by regulating keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. To study the role of BMPs in wound-induced epidermal repair, we used transgenic mice overexpressing the BMP downstream component Smad1 under the control of a K14 promoter as an in vivo model, as well as ex vivo and in vitro assays. K14-caSmad1 mice exhibited retarded wound healing associated with significant inhibition of proliferation and increased apoptosis in healing wound epithelium. Furthermore, microarray and qRT-PCR analyses revealed decreased expression of a number of cytoskeletal/cell motility-associated genes including wound-associated keratins (Krt16, Krt17) and Myo5a, in the epidermis of K14- caSmad1 mice versus wild-type controls during wound healing. BMP treatment significantly inhibited keratinocyte migration ex vivo, and primary keratinocytes of K14-caSmad1 mice showed retarded migration compared to wild-type controls. Finally, siRNA-mediated silencing of Bmpr-1B in primary mouse keratinocytes accelerated cell migration and was associated with increased expression of Krt16, Krt17 and Myo5a compared to controls. Thus, this study demonstrates that BMPs inhibit keratinocyte proliferation, cytoskeletal organization and migration in regenerating skin epithelium during wound healing, and raises a possibility for using BMP antagonists for the management of chronic wounds.
