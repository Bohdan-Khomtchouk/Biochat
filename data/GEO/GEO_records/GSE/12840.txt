TITLE
Drosophila melanogaster late embryo, larval, pupal and adult head small RNA libraries

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing of Drosophila melanogaster small RNAs. Total RNA, ~18-26nt RNAs isolated using PAGE, ligation to adapters requires 5' monophosphate and 3' OH For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
Small RNAs were sequenced from D. melanogaster (Canton S) wandering late embryos, first instar larvae, third instar larvae or from 2-4 day old pupae and adult female heads or male heads. Raw sequences were clipped by 3' linker sequences recognition, and select clipped sequences longer than 18 nt.
