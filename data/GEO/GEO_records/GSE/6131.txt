TITLE
Role of E2F3 expression in human bladder and prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Amplification and overexpression of the E2F3 gene at  6p22 in human bladder cancer is associated with increased  tumour stage, grade and proliferation index, and in  prostate cancer E2F3 overexpression is linked to tumour  aggressiveness. We first used small interfering RNA  technology to confirm the potential importance of E2F3  overexpression in bladder cancer development. Knockdown  of E2F3 expression in bladder cells containing the  6p22 amplicon strongly reduced the extent of bromodeoxyuridine  (BrdU) incorporation and the rate of cellular  proliferation. In contrast, knockdown of CDKAL1/  FLJ20342, another proposed oncogene, from this amplicon  had no effect. Expression cDNA microarray analysis  on bladder cancer cells following E2F3 knockdown was  then used to identify genes regulated by E2F3, leading to  the identification of known E2F3 targets such as Cyclin A  and CDC2 and novel targets including pituitary tumour  transforming gene 1, Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and  Caveolin-2. For both bladder and prostate cancer, we have  proposed that E2F3 protein overexpression may cooperate  with removal of the E2F inhibitor retinoblastoma tumor  suppressor protein (pRB) to drive cellular proliferation. In  support of this model, we found that ectopic expression of  E2F3a enhanced the BrdU incorporation, a marker of  cellular proliferation rate, of prostate cancer DU145 cells,  which lack pRB, but had no effect on the proliferation rate  of PC3 prostate cancer cells that express wild-type pRB.  BrdU incorporation in PC3 cells could, however, be  increased by overexpressing E2F3a in cells depleted of  pRB. When taken together, these observations indicate  that E2F3 levels have a critical role in modifying cellular  proliferation rate in human bladder and prostate cancer. Keywords: siRNA knock down
