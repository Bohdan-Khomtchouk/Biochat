TITLE
Partial loss of Rpl11 in adult mice recapitulates Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) and promotes lymphomagenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is characterized by anemia and cancer susceptibility, and is caused by mutations in ribosomal genes, including Rpl11. Here, we report that Rpl11-heterozygous embryos are not viable, and homozygous deletion of Rpl11 in adult mice results in death within a few weeks, accompanied by bone marrow aplasia and intestinal atrophy. Importantly, deletion of a single Rpl11 allele in adult mice results in anemia associated to decreased erythroid progenitors and defective erythroid maturation. These phenotypes are also present in mice transplanted with inducible heterozygous Rpl11 bone marrow, indicating a cell-autonomous role of RPL11 in erythropoiesis. Additionally, fibroblasts lacking one or both Rpl11 alleles show defective p53 activation upon ribosomal stress or DNA damage. Furthermore, fibroblasts and hematopoietic tissues from heterozygous Rpl11 mice present higher basal cMYC levels. Accordingly, heterozygous Rpl11 mice are highly susceptible to radiation-induced lymphomagenesis. We conclude that Rpl11-deficient mice recapitulate DBA disorder, including cancer predisposition.
