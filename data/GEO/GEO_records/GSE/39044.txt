TITLE
Regulon of transcriptional regulator PA2449 in Pseduomonas aeruginosa PAO1

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1

SUMMARY
The putative trancriptional regulator PA2449 was found to be essential for both glycine/serine metabolism and the production of phenazines in P. aeruignosa PAO1. We examined the regulon controlled by PA2449 via microarray analysis between wild-type P. aeruignosa PAO1 and the PA2449-null mutant P. aeruginosa PW5126.  Both strains were obtained from the PA-two allele library (Univ. of Washington, Ref. Jacobs et al. 2003. PNAS 100, 14339).

DESIGN
Strains were grown under conditions known to induce phenazine biosynthesis (peptone broth), and their resulting transcriptomes were compared.  Total RNA was isolated and prepped for Affymetrix GeneChips.
