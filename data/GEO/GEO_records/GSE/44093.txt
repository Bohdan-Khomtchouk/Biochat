TITLE
Platelet micro-RNA expression in type 2 diabetes mellitus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Results Platelets in non-diabetic patients demonstrated miRNA expression profiles comparable to previously published data. The miRNA expression profiles of platelets in diabetics were similar. Statistical analysis unveiled only three miRNAs (miR-377-5p, miR-628-3p, miR-3137) with high reselection probabilities in resampling techniques, corresponding to signatures with only modest discriminatory performance. Functional annotation of predicted targets for these miRNAs pointed towards an influence of diabetes mellitus on mRNA processing. Conclusions/interpretation  We did not find any major differences in platelet miRNA profiles between  diabetics and non-diabetics. Minor differences pertained to miRNAs associated with mRNA processing. Thus, previously described differences in plasma miRNAs between diabetic and nondiabetic patients cannot be explained by plain changes in the platelet miRNA profile.

DESIGN
Platelet miRNA profiles were assessed in clinically stable diabetic and nondiabetic patients (each n=30). Platelet miRNA was isolated from leucocyte-depleted platelet-rich plasma, and miRNA profiling was performed using LNA micro-array technology (miRBase 18.0, containing 1,917 human miRNAs). Effects of diabetes mellitus were explored by univariate statistical tests for each miRNA, adjusted for potential confounders, and by developing a multivariable signature, which was evaluated by resampling techniques. Platelet phenotype was assessed by light transmission aggregometry and impedance aggregometry.
