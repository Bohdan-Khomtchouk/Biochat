TITLE
Social defeat effect on mice prefrontal cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Behavioral analysis confirmed that the 14-day social defeat sessions resulted in induction of depressive-like states measured in social interaction and light/dark tests.  The combined data show that stress-induced depressive states are associated with molecular and structural changes that demyelinate the prefrontal cortex.

DESIGN
CSD and HC male mice (6 per group) were tested in the social interaction test and light/dark test to gauge mood.  One behavioral test was run per day.
