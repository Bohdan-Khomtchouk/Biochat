TITLE
Discovery of Gene Expression Signature in the Overexpression of miR-145 in U87 glioma cell.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole RNA microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify  genes regulated by overexpression of miR-145 in U87 glioma cell. Lentivirus containing miR-145 coding sequence was infected to U87 cell to make U87 overexpressing miR-145. We did genome microarray between U87 and U87 overexpressing miR-145.

DESIGN
Total RNAs from U87 cell or U87 overexpressing miR-145 were extracted. Whole RNA microarray expression profiling was performed between them.
