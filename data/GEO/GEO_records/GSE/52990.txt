TITLE
Expression data after BCLAF1-L knockdown in human RKO cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bcl-2-accociated transcription factor 1(BCLAF1) has been reported to be involved in diverse biological processes. Alternative splicing leads to mutiple transcript virants in human cells and we are interested in functions of its full length isoform(BCLAF1-L) in human colon cancer cells, thus to understanding its role in colon cancer progression. We used microarray to detail the global programme of gene expression after BCLAF1-L knockdown(sh-BCLAF1-L#1) in RKO cells and identified distinct classes of up-regulated or down-regulated genes impaired by its inhibition, when comparing with the control group(sh-Luci).

DESIGN
RKO cells were infected with retroviruses either expressing control (sh-Luci) or BCLAF1-L knockdown (sh-BCLAF1-L#1). Medium was replaced 24h after infection, and infected cells were selected by the addition of puromycin (2ug/ml) for 72-96h. Then cells were havested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
