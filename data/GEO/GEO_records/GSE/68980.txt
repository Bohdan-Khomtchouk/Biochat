TITLE
De novo assembly and transcriptome analysis of Ocimum americanum var. pilosum under low temperature

ORGANISM
Ocimum americanum

SUMMARY
One-month-old Ocimum americanum var. pilosum plants were treated with 4 ÂºC for 12 hours. Total RNAs were extracted from these chilling-treated plant leaves and untreated ones. Two seperate replicates of total RNA samples are from different individuals. The genomic DNA residual in each sample was removed by DNase I digestion.

DESIGN
Our goal is to get a more particlular knowledge of transcriptional regulation after chilling treatment in such a chilling-hypersensitive herb.

PLATFORM
