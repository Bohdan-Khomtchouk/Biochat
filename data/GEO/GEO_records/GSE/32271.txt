TITLE
Pax6 mutant neocortex vs. wild type

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pax6 is a transcription factor with key functional roles in embryonic development. In order to identify downstream effectors of Pax6 in the developing cerebral cortex we performed microarray analysis. We compared gene expression profiles of cortical tissues isolated from wild type and Pax6-/- mouse embryos.

DESIGN
In order to identify Pax6 downstream targets we carried out microarray analysis of Pax6-/-  mutant mice. Pax6 is highly expressed in the mouse cerebral cortex at embryonic day E14.5, therefore we selected this tissue in order to compare gene expression profiles between wild type and Pax6-/- homozygous cortici. RNA samples were isolated from three mutant and three wild type embryos.
