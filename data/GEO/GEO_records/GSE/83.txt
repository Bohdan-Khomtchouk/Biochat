TITLE
Cold stress in sugarcane exp1

ORGANISM
Saccharum sp.

SUMMARY
Tropical and subtropical plants are generally sensitive to cold and can show appreciable variation in their response to cold stress when exposed to low positive temperatures. Using nylon filter arrays, we analyzed the expression profile of 1536 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of sugarcane (Saccharum sp.) exposed to cold for 3-48 h. Thirty-four cold-induced ESTs were identified, of which 23 were novel cold-responsive genes that had not previously been reported as being cold-inducible. This series has the samples from replicate experiment number 1. Keywords = sugarcane, cold, nylon arrays Keywords: time-course
