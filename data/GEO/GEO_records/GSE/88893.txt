TITLE
Gene expression in granulosa cells from cows rated as poor donors of competent oocytes

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to gain better understanding of the follicular conditions associated with low oocyte developmental competence. In summary, we demonstrated that differences in follicle maturity at collection could explain differences in oocyte competence associated with individual animals. We also revealed deficiencies in lipid metabolism and retinol signalling in granulosa cells from donors of mostly incompetent oocytes.

DESIGN
Granulosa cells from 94 Holstein cows in a commercial embryo production facility were collected following ovarian stimulation and coasting, to compare gene expression from donors of mostly competent versus incompetent oocytes

PLATFORM
GPL13226 Agilent-028298 Embryogene Bovine 45K microarray
