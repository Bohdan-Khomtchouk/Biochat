TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of in vitro endotoxin tolerant human monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Monocyte exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces a transient state in which these cells are refractory to further endotoxin stimulation. Here we demonstrate the transcriptome analysis of in vitro generated LPS refractory monocytes upon subsequent re-exposure to LPS for different time points.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human monocyte exposure treated with LPS for 3h, 6h, or 24h, subsequent to endotoxin tolerization or not.
