TITLE
Whole-genome analysis of heat shock factor binding sites in Drosophila melanogaster at room temperature

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Whole-genome analysis of heat shock factor binding sites in Drosophila melanogaster. Heat shock factor IP DNA from non-shock (room temperature) Kc 167 cells compared to whole cell extract on Agilent 2x244k tiling arrays.

DESIGN
Heat Shock Factor IP vs whole cell extract from non-shock (room temperature) Kc cells.

PLATFORM
