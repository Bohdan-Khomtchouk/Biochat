TITLE
Expression data from CD19-positive B-cells isolated from splenocytes from 8 week-old ingeneered mice from the indicated genotypes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Ink4a/Arf tumor supressors play crucial roles in inhibiting cell cycle progression at the G1/S checkpoint.  Activating mutations in the KrasG12D oncogene is one of the most frequent changes in human cancer, with resultant constitutive mitogenic signaling within the cell. We generated cohorts of CD19Cre,  CD19Cre; KrasG12D, CD19Cre; Ink4a/ArfL/+, and CD19Cre; KrasG12D/+; Ink4a/ArfL/+ mice to evaluate the isolated or combined contributions of Ink/Arf loss and KrasG12D activation in B-cell development. In this data set we include the expression data obtained CD19-positive B-cells isolated from premalignant (8 weeks old ) mice.

DESIGN
A total 8 mRNA samples were preppared with two biological of CD19-positive B-cells isolated from the spleen of mice of the indicated genotypes.
