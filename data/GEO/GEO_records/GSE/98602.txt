TITLE
Human umbilical cord­derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC­MSCs) induce a global transcriptional reprogramming in cisplatin­damaged human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insights into the genes involved in the protective effect of human umbilical cord­derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC­MSCs) on cisplatin­injured human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs), we performed a genome­wide differential gene expression analysis by Ion AmpliSeqTM Transcriptome sequencing that targets more than 20,000 human genes. Our data indicated that genes involved in the pathways related to mitochondria and energy homeostasis were strongly upregulated by stem cell treatment in respect to cells treated with cisplatin alone, possibly representing a de novo regenerative response induced by UC­MSCs.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of three RPTECs samples (Control, Cispl, and Cispl+UC­MSCs) were generated by Ion AmpliSeq Transcriptome sequencing, in triplicate, using Ion Proton Sequencer.
