TITLE
ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES ALTER DNA METHYLATION PROFILES IN BLOODSPOTS OF NEWBORN INFANTSÂ 

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450k Beadchip was employed to study the impact of in-vitro fertilization on DNA methylation in peripheral blood of infants.  Using a total of 137 Michigan newborns born through IVF using fresh embryo transfer, IVF using cryopreserved embryo transfer, Intrauterine Insemination, or unassisted conception, DNA from archived Guthrie cards was assayed for methylation profiles.

DESIGN
A study in differential methylation, DNA from 137  archived bloodspots were bisulphite converted and assayed using the  Infinium HumanMethylation 450k Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
