TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human mammary artery media during aging

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our goal was to better understand the genes and pathways implicated during arterial media aging. We therefore compared the gene expression profile of human mammary artery media between Young ( < 60, 8 patients) and old ( > 75, 7 patients) patients. The microarray data, generated using the Illumina sentrix Ref8-V2 platform, was normalized and analyzed using the IlluminaGUI package (Eggle and Schultze, 2007).

DESIGN
We used 8 samples from the " Young " groups and 7 samples from the " old " group. No technical replicates were used.

PLATFORM
