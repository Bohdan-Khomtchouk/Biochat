TITLE
Expression data from HeLa cells treated with RZ2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The newly sinthesized compound RZ2 induces cell death to human cancer cells. To obtain insights into its mechanism of action, the effects on autophagy and apoptosis were examined. Global perturbations in genome-wide RNA expression of HeLa cells treated with RZ2 were measured by gene expression microarray.

DESIGN
Confluent cultures of HeLa cells were treated with 5 Î¼M RZ2 or the vehicle (DMSO) for 24 hours, followed by RNA preparation and hybridization to a GeneChip PrimeView Human Gene Expression Array (Affymetrix)

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
