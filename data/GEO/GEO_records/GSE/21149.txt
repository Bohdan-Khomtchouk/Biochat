TITLE
Mycobacterium bovis-BCG vaccination induces a specific pulmonary transcriptome biosignature in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the present study, we applied microarray technology to define a biosignature from the whole genome expression in lung and spleen samples after BCG vaccination and M. bovis infection of BALB/c mice. The aims were two-fold, namely to define biosignatures that could predict vaccine success before challenge, and biomarker patterns that correlated with anamnestic protective responses following exposure to virulent M. bovis. Further, Our aim was to define these markers to be detectable without in vitro antigenic challenge. After BCG vaccination, we defined a specific pulmonary gene expression signature related to the connective tissue development and function network that predicted vaccine success before M. bovis challenge. In addition, a Th17-related cytokine profile was found that correlated with vaccine-induced protective immunity following infection with virulent M. bovis in the lung as well as additional genes that were up-regulated in the spleens of vaccinated animals post-infection that was related to neutrophil biology and inflammation. This study has therefore prioritized both biomarkers predicting vaccination success before challenge and bio-signatures that are associated with protective immune responses that will be useful to evaluate future vaccine candidates.

DESIGN
Two groups of 20 mice each were immunised by a single intradermal injection of 2 x 10 to 5 CFU of M. bovis BCG (Vaccinated), or Hanks buffered salt solution (HBSS) (Unvaccinated). Six weeks later 5 mice from each group were euthanized for immunological analyses and the remaining mice from each group were challenged with approx 600 CFU M. bovis via the intranasal route. At days 3 and 14 post challenge five mice per group were euthanized and spleens and lungs harvested.
