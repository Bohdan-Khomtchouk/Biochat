TITLE
Comparison between stationary phase S. cerevisiae H155 cells, exponential phase cells and stressed cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The sensibility of the used low-density arrays was tested by applying the lab strain S. cerevisiae H155. Important abiotic parameters were tested as they were introduced as elevated osmotic, pH or ethanol stress to the cells.

DESIGN
Results from one loop including samples from cells in five different conditions are summarized in this study. Microarrays were hybridized in a loop approach.
