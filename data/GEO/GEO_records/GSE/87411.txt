TITLE
Z1031B Paired Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Agilent gene expression arrays were used to compare proliferation signatures between pre-treatment and 2-4 weeks post treatment samples from Z1031B patients.

DESIGN
109 patients from clinical trial NCT00265759 with paired baseline (BL) and 2-4wk (2wk or M) post treatment arrays were analyzed. This series contains re-analyzed samples from GSE29442, GSE35186, and GSE35191.
