TITLE
Molecular analysis of gastric cancer identifies discrete subtypes associated with distinct clinical characteristics and survival outcomes: the ACRG (Asian Cancer Research Group) study [gastric tumors]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gastric cancer, a leading cause of cancer related deaths, is a heterogeneous disease, with little consensus on molecular subclasses and their clinical relevance. We describe four molecular subtypes linked with distinct patterns of molecular alterations, disease progression and prognosis viz. a) Microsatellite Instable: hypermutated intestinal subtype tumors occurring in antrum, best overall prognosis, lower frequency of recurrence (22%), with liver metastasis in 23% of recurred cases b) Mesenchymal-like: diffuse tumors with worst prognosis, a tendency to occur at an earlier age and highest recurrence (63%) with peritoneal seeding in 64% of recurred cases, low frequency of molecular alterations c) TP53-inactive with TP53 loss, presence of focal amplifications and chromosomal instability d) TP53-active marked by EBV infection and PIK3CA mutations. The key molecular mechanisms and associated survival patterns are validated in multiple independent cohorts, to provide a consistent and unified framework for further preclinical and clinical research.

DESIGN
ACRG Gastric cohort: microarray profiles from 300 gastric tumors from gastric cancer patients.
