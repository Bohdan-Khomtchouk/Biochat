TITLE
Expression data from Mus musculus white adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the gene expression profile during WAT -beige transition by treatment of beta adrenergic receptor agonist .

DESIGN
Stromal vascular fractions (SVF) from mice (n = 3/group) that received vehicle or beta3 adrenergic receptor agonist, CL, treatment were served for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We are trying to find out angiogenic factors genes dynamics during white adipose tissues (WAT) - beige transition.
