TITLE
A resource for systems analysis of transcriptional modules involved in drought response in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The severity of impact of drought on crops is contingent on the developmental stage of the plant, with the most sensitive stage being the reproductive stage. Hence, gene expression profiling has been used to understanding drought response and resistance mechanism in rice. Here we present drought transcriptomes of rice in three developmental stages and gain insights into the processes and regulatory mechanisms involved in common and stage specific drought responses.
