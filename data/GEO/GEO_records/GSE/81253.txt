TITLE
A resource for systems analysis of transcriptional modules involved in drought response in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
The severity of impact of drought on crops is contingent on the developmental stage of the plant, with the most sensitive stage being the reproductive stage. Hence, gene expression profiling has been used to understanding drought response and resistance mechanism in rice. Here we present drought transcriptomes of rice in three developmental stages and gain insights into the processes and regulatory mechanisms involved in common and stage specific drought responses.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the rice seedlings, vegetative (V4) and reproductive (R4) tissues of both control and stress treated plants for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Two independent replicates for seedling and reproductive stages, and three replicates for vegetative stages were generated, for both control and stress samples. For drought treatments, plants were gradually subjected to field drought conditions in order to reach 50% field capacity (FC) by regulating water supply, whereas control plants were maintained at 100% FC.
