TITLE
Pairwise Gene Expression Comparison between Gleason 3 and Gleason 4 Prostate Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this dataset, we report the gene expression of adjacent Gleason 3 and Gleason 4 foci microdissected from the same prostate cancer sample. We found a striking similarity between adjacent G3 and G4 tumors, consistent with their clonal origin, but very few recurrently up- or down- regulated genes across patients.

DESIGN
26 samples were analyzed in total: 13 pairs of G3 and G4 tumors. Pairwise comparisons are G4 vs. G3. Total RNA was prepared for hybridization using NuGEN Ovation, Exon and Biotinylation kits.
