TITLE
Identification of lineage-specific cis-regulatory modules associated with variation in transcription factor binding and chromatin activity using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila pseudoobscura ; Drosophila virilis

SUMMARY
Whole-chromatin profile (FAIRE-seq) in three Drosophila species (D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis) in eye-antennal imaginal discs at the stage of third instar wandering larvae.

DESIGN
By the use of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck methods, we assess the evolutionary forces acting on regulatory elements (cis-level) on chromatin activity across Drosophila eye-antennal imaginal discs at the stage of third instar larvae.
