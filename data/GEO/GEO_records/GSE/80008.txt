TITLE
Systemic disease signature of human cutaneous leishmaniasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In addition to the recently published in situ transcriptomics of LCL skin lesions (Novais et al., Khouri et al.), we herein present the first systemic disease signature of localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL), using Affymetrix microarrays (HuGene 1.0) followed by systems biology analysis of the PBMC transciptome of LCL patients (n=18), as compared to healthy controls (n=12).

DESIGN
We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes between PBMCs of healthy controls and localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL) patients.
