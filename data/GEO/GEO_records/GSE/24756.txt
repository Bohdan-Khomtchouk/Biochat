TITLE
Gene expression from beagle dog mandible

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
In this study, beta-TCP was implanted in dog mandibles, after which the gene expression profiles and signaling pathways were monitored using microarray and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA). Following the extraction of premolars and subsequent bone healing, betaâ€‘TCP was implanted into the artificial osseous defect. Total RNA was isolated from bone tissues and gene expression profiles were examined using microarray analysis. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and identified distinct classes of up- and down- regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Waiting 3 months healing after tooth extraction from beagle dog mandibles, we drilled the holes in the dog mandibles, and implanted without and with beta-TCP. And these dog mandibles were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. After implanting beta-TCP in the dog mandibles 4, 7, 14 days, we selected sample at 3 time points: Control_4d, beta-TCP_4d, Control_7d, beta-TCP_7d, Control_14d, beta-TCP_14d.
