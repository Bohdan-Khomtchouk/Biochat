TITLE
Biological control of Wheat take-all disease by earthworms

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
The take-all disease caused by the soilborne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var tritici (Ggt) is one of the most-studied and widespread root diseases worldwide. Here, we investigated the ability of the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa to induce take-all disease tolerance in Triticum aestivum.

DESIGN
In a greenhouse experiment, plants were grown in a sandy soil. Plants were inoculated or not with Ggt and in the presence or absence of earthworms. There was 4 levels of treatment (plants only, inoculated with Ggt, inoculated with earthworms or inoculated with earthworms and Ggt), and 2-3 plants per treatments.
