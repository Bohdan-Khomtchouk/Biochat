TITLE
Highly efficient in vivo delivery of functional RNAs using new versatile MS2-chimeric retrovirus-like particles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA delivery is a method of choice to achieve transient gene expression for research and in cell- or gene-based therapies. To improve retroviral transfer, we designed a dimerization-independent MS2-driven packaging system using MS2-retrovirus chimeras. We delivered RUNX2- or DLX5-mRNA into primary human bone-marrow mesenchymal-stem-cells. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression confirming the effects of pro-osteogenic genes transduced by MS2 chimeric lentiviral particles.

DESIGN
Immature bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were transduced with viral particles containing either MS2RLP-DLX5 or MS2RLP-RUNX2 or IDLV-Luc as control. Thirty hours after the first transduction, cells were transduced again as above. At 58 h, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and harvested. mRNA were then extracted. Please note that data analyses were done in 3 groups; GSM1630700-GSM1630707 GSM1630708-GSM1630715 GSM1630716-GSM1630723
