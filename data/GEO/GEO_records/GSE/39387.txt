TITLE
Discordant cellular response to pre-surgical letrozole in bilateral synchronous ER+ breast cancers with a KRAS mutation or FGFR1 gene amplification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This clinical case resulted from an ongoing trial at Vanderbilt University and abroad where ER+ breast cancer patients are administered 2-3 weeks of aromatase inhibitor therapy leading up to definitive surgical resection of the tumor. In this case, we describe a study patient presenting with bilateral primary ER+ breast tumors. Short term hormonal therapy substantially reduced proliferation in one tumor, while the second was essentially unchanged.  Extensive molecular and genetic workup of the two tumors yielded divergent lesions in the two tumors; an activating KRAS mutation in the responsive tumor, and an amplification of the FGFR1 locus in the treatment-refractory tumor.

DESIGN
Surgical tumor specimens from ER+ breast cancer patient 7603 who was administered letrozole for 16 days leading up to definitive surgery were utilized for RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix Gene expression microarrays.
