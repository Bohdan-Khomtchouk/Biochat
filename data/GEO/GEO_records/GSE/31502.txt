TITLE
Bacitracin upregulates mbrAB transcription via mbrCD to confer bacitracin resistance in Streptococcus mutans

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
Streptococcus mutans is a bacterial cause of dental caries that is resistant to bacitracin. This study aimed to elucidate the mbrABCD-related bacitracin resistance mechanism of S. mutans. Transcriptome data demonstrated that 33 genes were induced more than 2 times in expression by bacitracin. Fourteen genes were selected from the upregulated genes and each defective mutants were constructed for measurement of their sensitivity to bacitracin. Among the mutants, only the mbrA- or mbrB-deficient mutants exhibited 100 to 121-fold greater sensitivity to bacitracin when compared with the wild-type strain. Moreover, knockout of the mbrC and mbrD genes abolished the bacitracin-induced mbrAB upregulation. These results suggest that bacitracin upregulates mbrAB transcription via mbrCD, which confers the bacitracin resistant phenotype on S. mutans.

DESIGN
Single experiment data using Streptcoccus mutans wild-type strain UA159, a comparison of transcriptome between control sample and experimental (bacitracin-treated) one.
