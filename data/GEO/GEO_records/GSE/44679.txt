TITLE
Vibrio vulnificus: Wild type vs. iscR mutant (V. vulnificus iron-sulfur cluster regulator)

ORGANISM
Vibrio vulnificus MO6-24/O

SUMMARY
IscR is a novel global regulator potentially contributing to the overall success in survival and pathogenesis of V. vulnificus by coordinating the regulation of various virulence factors. The profiles of transcripts from the V. vulnificus iscR mutant and the parental wild type were compared by using a V. vulnificus whole-genome microarray.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: Wild type vs. iscR mutant. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 mutant strains, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array. For transcriptome analysis, the V. vulnificus whole genome TwinChip, manufactured and kindly provided by the 21C Frontier Microbial Genomics and Applications Center (Daejeon, South Korea), was used.
