TITLE
Vibrio vulnificus: Wild type vs. iscR mutant (V. vulnificus iron-sulfur cluster regulator)

ORGANISM
Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6

SUMMARY
IscR is a novel global regulator potentially contributing to the overall success in survival and pathogenesis of V. vulnificus by coordinating the regulation of various virulence factors. The profiles of transcripts from the V. vulnificus iscR mutant and the parental wild type were compared by using a V. vulnificus whole-genome microarray.
