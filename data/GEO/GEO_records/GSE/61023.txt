TITLE
ChIP-Seq of H3K4 methylation in neurons isolated from E16.5 mouse embryonic cortices from WT and SMCX KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We conducted ChIP-Seq of H3K4 methylation in neurons isolated from E16.5 mouse embryonic cortices from WT and SMCX KO mice and harvested after 10 days in vitro culture.

DESIGN
We sequenced H3K4me1, H3K4me3 ChIP and Input samples from mouse embryonic cortical neurons cultured in vitro for 10 days. Experiments were performed in biological and technical duplicates.
