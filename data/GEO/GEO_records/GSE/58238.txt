TITLE
Identification of genes enriched in the Arc, VMH, DMH and LH of adult mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify genes selectively expressed in the DMH, we collected RNA samples from four hypothalamic nuclei, namely the Arc, VMH, DMH and LH, using laser microdissection and conducted microarray analysis to compare their gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
The Arc, VMH, DMH, and LH were dissected from C57BL/6 females at 3 month of age by laser microdissection using the Leica 6000 system (n=2 each group).
