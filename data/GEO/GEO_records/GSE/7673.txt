TITLE
BCL6 ChIP on chip using a Nimblegen custom tiling array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine whether BCL6 binds to the certain locus we performed genomic localization studies by chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) using a densely tiled custom oligonucleotide microarray covering the genomic loci of different genes. Keywords: ChIP-chip, Transcription Factor localization

DESIGN
The experiment was performed in Ramos cell. Triplicate ChIP with BCL6 or actin (negative control) antibodies were cohybridized to the arrays versus the respective input chromatin.The fold enrichment for each oligonucleotide was calculated as the ratio of Cy5 vs. Cy3. Any peaks involving > 5 oligonucleotides and with > 2.5 fold enrichment were considered potentially positive hits.
