TITLE
Gene profiling of the zone of altered morphology of choriodecidua overlying the cervix before labor in preterm samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the molecular signature of the choriodecidua remodeling in third trimestry of pregnancy before labour, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling. Fetal membranes were collected from women undergoing a emergency cesarean delivery before term (before 32 weeks of gestation and between 33-35 weeks of gestation), for preeclampsia and/or in utero growth retardation. During surgery, a Kocher's forceps was placed on membranes overlying the cervix and the area surrounding the forceps was dissected in the operating room under sterile conditions, the site, pinched by the forceps, being discarded. Fetal membranes in a remote zone were also sampled. Isolated RNAs were hybridized to the Aligent SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was conducted on four distincts groups overlying the cervix and remote from the cervix before 32 weeks of gestation (XPZ) or between 33 and 35 weeks of gestation (PZ) composed of three pools for the XPZ samples and two pools for the PZ samples, each pool consisted of three samples from three different women.
