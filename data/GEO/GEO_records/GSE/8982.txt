TITLE
Mating response - six alpha factor concentrations (0.06, 0.2, 0.6, 6, 60 and 600 nM)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We examined the mating response of W303 bar1delta a-type cells to six alpha-factor concentrations (0.06, 0.2, 0.6, 6, 60 and 600 nM). In each alpha factor concentration between five to seven time points were collected. The time points in all experiments (except for concentration 600 nM were time point 15 min was omitted) were 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min. In some of the concentrations also time points 120 and 150 min were considered. The expression of cells before and after addition of alpha-factor were compared using S. cerevisiae cDNA microarrays, in all experiments the same sample before adding alpha factor was used as a control. Keywords: yeast mating response, comparison among alpha factor concentrations

DESIGN
The six time courses were processed in two groups, in each group all samples were processed in parallel. The group were: 0.06, 0.6, 60 nM and 0.2, 6, 600 nM. In all microarrays the same control sample was used (cells before adding alpha factor). All samples were measured by hybridization to S. cerevisiae cDNA microarray.
