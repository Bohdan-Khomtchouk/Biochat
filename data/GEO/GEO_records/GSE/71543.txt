TITLE
Next generation sequencing identifies small RNA expression in FLT3-ITD+ AML (MV4-11) cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression level of microRNAs in FLT3-ITD+ AML is unknown. Using empty vector (EV) lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 infected FLT3-ITD+ AML cell lines (MV4-11 cells), we performed next generation RNA sequencing on small RNAs to determine microRNA expression level in these cells. We found a variety of evolutionarily conserved and non-conserved microRNAs expressed in our cells of interest.

DESIGN
Small RNAseq on EV lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 infected MV4-11 cell lines was performed on triplicate cultures.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
