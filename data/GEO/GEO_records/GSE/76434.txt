TITLE
tRNA Modification Identification and Quantification through High Throughput Sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the identification and quantification of Watson-Crick modifications in tRNA and rRNA through the use of high throughput sequencing. We apply the recently published DM-tRNA-Seq method to generate demethylase treated and untreated 293T samples, and using computational methods we are able to flag sites using a modification index. This index allows us to generate site-resolved information about modification that we can use to identify and quantify Watson-Crick face modifications in tRNA and rRNA. With the demethylase treated samples, we are able to validate numerous nucleotide modifications from demethylase substrates, and the absence of demethylase action also serves to aid in identification. We find numerous novel modification sites in tRNA as well as striking comparisons between tissues cultures lines. Our study reports a comprehensive analysis of the tRNA modification landscape by identifying sites of modification as well as quantifying modification levels.

DESIGN
