TITLE
Expression data from Adam10 knock out mice and wild type

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adam10, a cell surface protease, cleaving many proteins including TNF-alpha and E-cadherin. Here we investigate the genome wide effects of Adam10 knock out on the transcriptome. Commercial microarrays (Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 1.0) were used to generate genome wide mRNA profiles.

DESIGN
Mouse tissue samples from n=4 wiltype skin and n=4 Adam10 knockout skin were used in the study.
