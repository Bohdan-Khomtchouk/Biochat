TITLE
Expression data from Adam10 knock out mice and wild type

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adam10, a cell surface protease, cleaving many proteins including TNF-alpha and E-cadherin. Here we investigate the genome wide effects of Adam10 knock out on the transcriptome. Commercial microarrays (Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 1.0) were used to generate genome wide mRNA profiles.
