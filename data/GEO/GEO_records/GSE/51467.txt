TITLE
Expresion profile of TGR-1 (Myc+/+) and HO15.19 (Myc-/-) infected with a retrovirus expressing Hhex or GFP (controls)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this experiment is to determine Hhex targets in the presence and absence of Myc.

DESIGN
TGR-1 or HO15.19 cell lines were infected with a retrovirus expressing IRES-GFP (control) or Hhex-IRES-GFP. After infection, cells were GFP-sorted and total RNA extracted by a combination of Trizol and Rneasy columns.

PLATFORM
