TITLE
Expression and differential expression analysis of HFF cells in G0 phase compared to cells in G1 using nONCOchip 2.0 array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression and differential expression analysis of long non-coding RNAs and protein-coding genes. HFF cells were synchronised by serum starvation and reside in G0 phase or G1 phase of mitotic cell cycle.

DESIGN
We analyzed three arrays each for HFF cells in G0 phase and cells in G1 phase
