TITLE
Gene expression signatures for primary tumor and tumor-derived exosomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the different gene signatures between primary tumor and tumor-derived exosomes, we have employed RNA-sequencing as a discovery platform to identify gene signatures of tumor-derived exosomes, taking the original tumors as a control. We subcutaneously inoculated C57BL/6 mice with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). Three weeks later, tumor tissues were cut and tumor-derived exosomes were isolated as described in the " treatment protocol " . Then, both exosomal RNA and tumor RNA were extracted and sequenced. From sequencing, we found that exosomal RNAs showed quite different transcript profiles from tumor RNAs.

DESIGN
Examination of different gene signatures between primary tumor and tumor-derived exosomes. 2 replicates each.

PLATFORM
