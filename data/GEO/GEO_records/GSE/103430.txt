TITLE
Expression data from wheat spike

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of hormone response genes in wheat spike In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome responses in wheat spike to seven phytohormones, including IAA, GA (GA3), ABA, ET, CK (trans-zeatin), SA and MeJA, to identify responsive genes, to investigate cross-talk of hormones in spike, and to develop RT-qPCR markers for hormone signaling in wheat spike.

DESIGN
Only flowering heads were used for hormone treatments. Two florets of each fully developed spikelet of a whole spike at the mid-anthesis stage were treated with 10 Î¼l of a 10% methanol: water solution supplemented or not (control) with either 2 mM IAA, 1 mM SA, 1 mM MeJA, 0.38 mM ABA, 0.5 mM GA3 or 0.5 mM trans-zeatin (one kind of cytokinins). For ethylene treatment, each head was sealed in a plastic bag with 2 ml of freshly prepared 25 mM ethephon solution (pH=11). All of these chemical solutions were inoculated into the florets in less than 1 h after preparation. These heads were collected 24 h after hormone application, and then were ground to fine powder in liquid nitrogen. Three biological replicates were performed with 7 heads per treatment. No unusual symptom was observed in the treated heads by the time of collection.
