TITLE
Spontaneous Nf1 deletion and recurrent copy number alterations in mammary tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women 1, and most cases are believed to have a sporadic, rather than heritable basis 2.  To identify breast cancer driver genes, we exploited the C3H-Mcm4Chaos3/Chaos3 (“Chaos3”) mouse model that, by virtue of bearing a defective DNA replicative helicase subunit that causes elevated genomic instability (GIN), sustains somatic alterations ultimately causing mammary adenocarcinomas 6.  Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) analysis of Chaos3 mammary tumors revealed recurrent copy number alterations (CNAs), most notably deletion of the Neurofibromin 1 (Nf1) tumor suppressor gene in all cases.  NF1, a negative regulator of RAS, is traditionally recognized for its role in driving the development of neurofibromas in the context of the human disease Neurofibromatosis Type 1, but not breast cancer. Genomic DNA from tumor and reference samples were hybridized to NimbleGen 3x720K mouse CGH arrays.  Two reference samples were used independently.  CNAs were visualized using Nimblegen, IGV, and KCsmart software 32.  Select genes were validated via qPCR.  Critical regions within each Chaos3 CNA were identified as the region with the greatest overlap across multiple Chaos3 tumors.

DESIGN
Recurring Copy Number Variations (CNVs) for 12 Chaos3 tumors and 2 MMTV-Neu mammary tumors analyzed by aCGH are indicated.  Samples analyzed are primary tumors except where indicated.
