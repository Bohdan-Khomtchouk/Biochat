TITLE
p/CIP gene regulation in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
p/CIP binds to many nuclear receptors and plays a major role in hormone dependent transcription of genes. Recently, p/CIP was shown to affect mouse stem cell pluripotency. Microarray gene expression analysis was conducted to assess the role of p/CIP in mouse embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
p/CIP was downregulated using two different siRNAs and total RNA was extracted and hybridized to a microarray. As control, wild type cells were transfected with pooled non specific siRNAs. The expression difference was calculated between the control wild-type cells and cells having p/CIP downregulation. The experiments were carried out at London Regional Genomic Centre ( http://www.lrgc.ca/ ).
