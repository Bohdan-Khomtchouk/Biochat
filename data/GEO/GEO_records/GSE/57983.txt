TITLE
Short Read Sequencing Data of the Transcriptome of the Rheumatoid Arthritis Rat Model Treated with Acupuncture or Placebo [tissue 1]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report the application of Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of the transcriptome of the rheumatoid arthritis rat model induced by collegen with acupuncture and placebo treatments, at time points before, 1 hour and 34 days after.

DESIGN
10 rats in total: 2 replicates before treatments (RA_0); 2 replicates receiving acpuncture at 1 hour (AP_1h); 2 replicates receiving placebo at 1 hour (PLA_1h); 2 replicates receiving acpuncture at 34 days (AP_34d); 2 replicates receiving placebo at 34 days (PLA_34d).
