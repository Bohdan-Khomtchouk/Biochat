TITLE
Differential expression of mRNAs in porcine endometrium

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The study allowed for the determination of the mRNAs that were differentially expressed in porcine endometrium on different gestational day and breed. The majority of the mRNAs were differentially expressed during the implantation stage. This study will provide the information to better understanding of the role of these differently expressed mRNAs in the porcine endometrium during pregnancy. Affymetrix mRNA arrays were used to generate mRNA profiles of on the endometrium of Meishan and Yorkshire pigs on days 15 (implantation stage), 26 (post-implantation stage) and 50 (mid-gestation stage) of gestation.

DESIGN
The endometrium from different gestational day and breed were collected. In order to determine the mRNA expression profile of these tissue, RNA was extracted, labeled and hybridized on an Affymetrix mRNA array.
