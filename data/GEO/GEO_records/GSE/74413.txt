TITLE
dCAP-D3 ChIP-seq in Drosophila S2 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to identify genomic dCAP-D3 binding sites in Drosophila S2R+ cells

DESIGN
dCAP-D3 was immunoprecipitated in two separate experiments with antibody YZ834 which was developed in the Longworth lab.  IgG immunoprecipiation was performed alongside the dCAP-D3 immunoprecipitation to serve as controls for each experiment.  Input chromatin was also harvested from each of the two experiments.
