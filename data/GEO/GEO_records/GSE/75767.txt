TITLE
Type I and type II interferon coordinately regulate suppressive dendritic cell fate and function during viral persistence

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified a population of immunosuppressive dendritic cells (iregDCs) that arises during LCMV-Cl13 infection. IregDCs have a distinct lineage, functional activity, and RNA expression profile compared to stimulatory dendritic cells (stimDCs) that are present within the same environment. While both are CD11b+ DCs, iregDCs develop from monocytes and stimDCs develop from conventional DC (cDC) precursors. IregDCs and stimDCs also respond differently to type I interferon (IFN-I) stimulation. IregDCs respond to IFN-I by upregulating the expression of immunosuppressive ligands while IFN-I blunts the expansion and proliferation of the stimDC population. The gene expression profiles of iregDCs and stimDCs overlap in many areas, however the production of many chemokines and cytokines as well as stimulatory and inhibitory cell surface ligands are quite distinct resulting in two dendritic cell populations with drastically different functions.

DESIGN
The comparison of RNA expression profiles between immunosuppressive and stimulatory dendritic cells together with their naïve progenitors (monocytes and naïve dendritic cells, respectively)
