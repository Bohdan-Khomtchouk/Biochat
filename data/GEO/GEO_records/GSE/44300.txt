TITLE
DNA profiling of human normal colon tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the field cancerization effect, we screened systemic metastasis-related CNVs from morphologically normal colon tissues adjacent to colon cancer that had systemic metastasis. 89 systemic metastasis-related CNVs, mainly consisting of migration and invasion-, morphology-, cell death and survival-related pathways, were selected. Noticeably, LIM and senescent cell antigen-like domains 2 (LIMS 2, PINCH2) showed copy number amplification and up-regulation of mRNA expression in the non-relapsed group compared to the systemic relapse group. Colon cancer cells had lower expression of PINCH2 protein and mRNA compared with normal epithelial colon cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: 41 colon normal tissue vs. control gDNA.
