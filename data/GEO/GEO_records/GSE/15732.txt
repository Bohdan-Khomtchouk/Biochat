TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples at diagnosis: Xba SNP array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide profiling of Copy Number Alterations (CNA) and Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH), gene expression and resequencing of pediatric AML. This study characterizes the CNA and LOH in a representative cross-section through subtypes of pediatric AML. Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from cryopreserved diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood samples.

DESIGN
111 pediatric AML samples were studied using either Affymetrix 100K + 500K 5.0 SNP arrays, 65 of the samples had paired germ line material. The supplemental file 'GSE15732_AML_175_SNP_Xba_signal.txt' contains the raw signals generated by dChip without normalization. The CNA and LOH data can be found in the Supplemental Information of the associated manuscript.
