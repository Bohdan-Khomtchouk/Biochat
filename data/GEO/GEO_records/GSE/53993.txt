TITLE
Comparative total RNA and mRNA sequencing and systems analysis reveals nascent transcriptional response to early HIV-1 infection in a CD4+ T cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Human immunodeficiency virus 1

SUMMARY
To systematically investigate early host transcriptional response to HIV-1 infection, including polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated transcripts, we separately sequenced Total RNAs (Total RNA-seq) from HIV-1-infected SupT1 cells, a human CD4+ T cell line. We show many non-polyadenylated RNAs were also differentially expressed upon HIV-1 infection, as expected only detected by Total RNA-seq. Interestingly, we identified 8 times more differentially expressed genes at 12 hour post-infection by Total RNA-seq than by mRNA-seq, mostly protein-coding genes.

DESIGN
6 Total RNA sample sets were sequenced. Samples were either Mock infected, HIV-1 infected, or UV-inactivated viron infected for either 12 hours or 24 hours. Each sample set contains replicates. mRNA-seq data was processed previously and is part of a different study. It was referenced in this study. The mRNA-seq data can be found in GSE38006. This data set refers to the Whole Transcriptome data from similar samples.
