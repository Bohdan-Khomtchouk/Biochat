TITLE
Exosomal miRNA in liver disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aiming to develop novel biomarker for cancer prediction after successful treatment of interferon therapy SVR-HCC is HCC appearance after IFN treatment. Each sample was collected 3 times; before IFN treatment, after IFN treatment, and appearance of HCC in SVR-HCC group. HCV-CHC is not HCC appearance after interferon treatment. Each sample was collected three times, before IFN treatment, after IFN treatment, and observation period after IFN treatment. For example, the sample which is SVR-HCC002-1 is the patient who suffered from HCC after IFN treatment, was collected before IFN treatment. SVR-HCC001-3 is missing.

DESIGN
42 HCC related patients

PLATFORM
GPL21263 3D-Gene Human miRNA V21_1.0.0
