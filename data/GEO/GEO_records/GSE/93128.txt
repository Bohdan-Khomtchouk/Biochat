TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Drosophila melanogaster photoreceptors following nuclei affinity enrichment

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study was to globally characterize the transcript levels of genes in Drosophila photoreceptor neurons. Using transcriptome profiling of isolated photoreceptor nuclei from day 10 flies, we identified genes with enriched or reduced transcript levels post nuclei isolation relative to the starting pre-isolation material (whole head RNA extracts).

DESIGN
Method: RNA extracted from photoreceptor nuclei of flies aged from 10 days post-eclosion was used to generate cDNA libraries using NuGen Ovation Drosophila RNA seq system. Samples were sequenced using  Illumina HiSeq2500 next generation sequencer. Three paired biological replicates were sequenced for post and pre-isolation samples.
