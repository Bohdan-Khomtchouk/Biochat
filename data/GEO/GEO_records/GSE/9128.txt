TITLE
Expression data from heart failure vs control peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inflammatory mediators play a role in the pathogenesis/progression of chronic heart failure (CHF). The aim of the present study was to identify diagnostic/prognostic markers and gene expression profiles of CHF vs control. Keywords: CHF patients profiling vs controls.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed in three patients' groups: 1) Ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM)- (n=12) and 2) Non ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM)- (n=12) NYHA III-IV CHF patients ; 3) Age- and gender matched controls (n=12) by Affymetrix microarrays. Data were then subjected to informatic analysis.
