TITLE
Role of Notch signaling on hematopoietic stem cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although Notch signaling has been clearly implicated in lymphoid differentiation, its role in myeloid lineages differentiation is unclear. Expression data from hematopoietic stem cells plated on OP9 stroma expressing or not the Notch ligand Delta-like1. Results provide insight into the role of Notch signalling in megakaryocyte fate specification. Keywords: Gene expression array-based (RNA / in situ oligonucleotide)
