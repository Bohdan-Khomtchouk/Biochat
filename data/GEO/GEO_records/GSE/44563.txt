TITLE
Expression data from C2C12 myotubes infected with RML prions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prion infection in animals results in neurodegeneration and eventually death. To examine the cellular impact of Prion disease, we profiled non-proliferative fully differentiated C2C12 cells, which can replicate prions to high levels. Results suggest that accumulation of high levels of PrPSc in C2C12 myotubes does not cause any overt cellular dysfunction or molecular pathology.

DESIGN
C2C12 cells were differentiated into confluent myotubes. Cells were infected or not with 100ul of 10% brain homogenate obtained from a C57BL/6 mouse clinically affected with RML prions. 16 days after infection, cells were collected by scraping and RML was purified.
