TITLE
Expression data from adult Onecut2 WT and KO animals

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we examine the consequences of the loss of two related factors, Onecut1 and Onecut2, during mouse retinal development and maturation.

DESIGN
To investigate potential phenotypes in Onecut2-KO retinas, microarrays were performed on retinas isolated from mature OC2-KO mice and WT littermates.
