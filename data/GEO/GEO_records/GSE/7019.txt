TITLE
Total RNA from EPC derived microvescicles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA present in EPC derived microvescicles were detected using a RNA quantity curve, in order to evaluate if these vescicles were shuttling a specific subset of mRNAs Keywords: Microvescicles, endothelial progenitor cells, angiogenesis, NOS

DESIGN
Respectively 0.25, 1 and 2.5 micrograms of total RNA extracted from two different preparation of EPC derived microvescicles were retrotranscribed, labelled and hybridized on the microarray.
