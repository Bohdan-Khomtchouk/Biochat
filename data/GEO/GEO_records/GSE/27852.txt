TITLE
Integrative genomic analysis of sporadic clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a common cancer of the kidney. We applied an integrated approach to identify important factors that influence carcinogenesis in ccRCC.

DESIGN
33 frozen ccRCC samples were subject to copy number analysis. The data was analyzed to identify factors affecting tumorigenesis. The samples were also stained for HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha expression. The tumors were subtyped based on HIF expression and investigated for differences in genetic aberrations.
