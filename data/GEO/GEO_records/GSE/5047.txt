TITLE
Genomic comparison of vancomycin susceptible and vancomycin intermediate Staphylococcus aureus pairs

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
To determine if significant genomic changes are associated with the development of vancomycin intermediate Staphylococcus aureus, genomic DNA microarrays were performed to compare the initial vancomycin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (VSSA) and a related vancomycin intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) isolate from five unique patients (five isolate pairs). Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
A single 2-channel array was performed for each isolate pair using genomic DNA. Raw data was compiled using IMAGENE. Normalisation and statistical analysis was undertaken using BASE. Statistics were performed using the Wilcoxon signed ranked test.

PLATFORM
GPL3866 TIGR Staphylococcus aureus version2 array
