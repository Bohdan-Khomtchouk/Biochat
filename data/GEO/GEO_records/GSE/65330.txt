TITLE
A microRNA blueprint for early atrial remodeling in a porcine model of paroxysmal atrial fibrilation

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Spontaneous paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is one of the very common heart rhythm disorders. The molecular mechanisms underlying PAF susceptibility and persistence are multiple and incompletely understood. To study the contribution of microRNAs (miRNAs) to the development and perpetuation of PAF, we used microarray/qPCR analyses to search for changes in miRNA expression in atrial myocardium upon pacing-induced PAF.  The miRNA microarray analysis was performed at LC Sciences (Houston, TX, USA). Following screening-microarray, several miRNAs were selected for detailed real-time qPCR assay.  Our results suggest that immediate-early miR remodeling of LAA underlies the development and persistence of PAF. A closed-chest model of PAF was established in postnatal pigs via a rapid atrial electrical stimulation with a controlled ventricular response rate. A pacing catheter (delivered into the right atrium via femoral vein access under fluoroscopic guidance) was connected with an external pulse generator for programmed pacing rates. The burst-pacing stimuli were repeated several times, and the induced PAF occurrence rates and durations were recorded. Burst pacing was not performed in sham-operated group. Animals were euthanized 24 hours after cessation of pacing. Given that the right atrium might have been damaged by catheter insertion, we studied miRNA expression changes associated with PAF in the left atrial appendage (LAA) from paced vs control pigs.

DESIGN
Six piglet were randomized in two groups, the PAF group (3 replicates) and the sham-control group (3 replicates)
