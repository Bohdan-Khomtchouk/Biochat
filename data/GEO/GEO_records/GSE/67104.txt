TITLE
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor reprograms bone marrow stromal cells to actively suppress B lymphopoiesis in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
G-CSF treatment targets CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells to suppress their production of a number of B trophic factors, including CXCL12, IL-6, IL-7, IGF-1, and Flt3 ligand.

DESIGN
CAR cells were sorted from the bone marrow of Cxcl12-gfp mice treated with G-CSF or saline alone for 5 days
