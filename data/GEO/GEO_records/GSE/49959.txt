TITLE
Expression data from larvae body wall expressing LaminC transgenes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Expression of mutant lamins in human muscle causes muscular dystrophy.  We have generated a drosophila model that expresses mutant lamins, modeled after those that cause disease in humans. We used affymetrix microarrays to determine the global changes in gene expression caused by mutant lamins.

DESIGN
Dissected 3rd instar larval body wall from transgenic Drosophila expressing either a full length wildtype Lamin C, an N-terminal Lamin C truncation of the first 42 amino acids or a single amino acid substitution in Lamin C at position 489 from a G residue to a V residue under control of the Gal4-UAS. RNA was extracted from 3rd instar larval body wall expressing these mutant Lamin C transgenes and microarray analysis using Affymetrix microarrays.
