TITLE
Gene expression analysis of sickle cell disease patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a devastating hemoglobinopathy prevalent in Chhattisgarh and other states of central India. Clinical features in SCD arise mainly due to anemia and vaso-occlusion and inflammation leading to gradual multiple organ failure. Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is a common cause of sudden death among SCD patients. Aim of the study was to evaluate gene expression in patients of SCD in a quest to search up-regulated genes in VOC.

DESIGN
20 subjects were enrolled in the study, 7 each from sickle cell steady (HbSS SS) and crisis state (HbSS CS) and 6 healthy controls (HbAA). Whole blood transcriptome was compared between the study groups.
