TITLE
Expression data in Arabidopsis upf1-1 and upf3-1 mutants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We applied the tiling arrays to study the Arabidopsis whole-genome transcriptome in Arabidopsis upf1-1 and upf3-1 mutants. Keywords: untreated condition

DESIGN
Fifteen-day-old Arabidopsis plants grown on the agar plates. The total RNA was prepared from 15-day-old Arabidopsis plants (wild type (WT, UPF), upf1-1 and upf3-1) and used for the microarray hybridization. Three replicative hybridization experiments for each strand array were carried out using the independent biological RNA samples.
