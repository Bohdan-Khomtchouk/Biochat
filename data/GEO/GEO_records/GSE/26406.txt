TITLE
Transcription factors expressed in olfactory bulb local progenitor cells revealed by genome-wide transcriptome profiling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used transcriptional profiling to monitor gene expression of whole olfactory bulbs at daily intervals from embryonic day 11 through birth, generating a compendium of gene expression encompassing the major developmental events of this tissue.

DESIGN
OBs from CD1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), were isolated from embryos daily between E11 and postnatal day zero (P0), for a total of nine time points. RNA was purified with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), subjected to two rounds of amplification, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430.2 GeneChip microarrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) using Affymetrix reagents and protocols ( http://www.affymetrix.com ). One microarray for each time point using RNA from the OBs of one individual embryo.
