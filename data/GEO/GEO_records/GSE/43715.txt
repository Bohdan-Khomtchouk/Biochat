TITLE
affy_med_2011_10- Comparison of plant responses upon Aphanomyces euteiches infection in wild type (A17) line and in the lyr3-1 and lyr3-2 mutants

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
affy_med_2011_10 - affy_med_2011_10 -   LYR3 encodes a lysin motif-receptor-like kinase (LysM-RLK) that consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain composed of three LysM domains, a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain. A reverse genetic approach was undertaken to study the role of this gene in the pathosystem Medicago truncatula â€“ Aphanomyces euteiches (Ae). Results suggest that lyr3-1 and lyr3-2 mutants are more susceptible to the root pathogen Aphanomyces euteiches than the A17 wild type (WT) line.  In this study, we want to compare the early plant responses, 3 days post inoculation (dpi), between WT and the lyr3-1 and lyr3-2 mutants, in order to identify LYR3-dependent gene networks during infection.-Fourteen days old A17, lyr3-1 or lyr3-2 plants were grown in vitro on M medium. The entire roots were then inoculated (or not = controls) with A. euteiches zoospores (105/ml) and harvested three days after inoculation. Three independent repeats were performed.
