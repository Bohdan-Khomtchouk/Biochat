TITLE
Genomic Array Footprinting of Shewanella oneidensis grown under aerobic conditions

ORGANISM
Shewanella oneidensis

SUMMARY
We undertook a genomic array footprinting to identify genes important for aerobic growth of S. oneidensis. The data revealed that removal of 96 genes resulted in significant impacts on aerobic growth.

DESIGN
Experimental cells collected 5 days after competition started; Control cells collected 1 day after competition started. In total, 6 samples were studied (3 for 5 days and 3 for 1 day, 3 replicates).

PLATFORM
GPL3253 ORNL Shewanella oneidensis 11.5k array
