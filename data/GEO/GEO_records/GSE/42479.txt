TITLE
Genomic Array Footprinting of Shewanella oneidensis grown under aerobic conditions

ORGANISM
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1

SUMMARY
We undertook a genomic array footprinting to identify genes important for aerobic growth of S. oneidensis. The data revealed that removal of 96 genes resulted in significant impacts on aerobic growth.
