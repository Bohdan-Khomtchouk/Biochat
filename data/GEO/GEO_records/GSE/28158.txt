TITLE
IL-22 down-regulates filaggrin expression and affects expression of profilaggrin processing enzymes by keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression after stimulation with cytokines to assess the main processes, molecular functions and cellular components affected as well as genes related to skin barrier function.

DESIGN
HaCaT cells were exposed to IL-22 (200ng/ml) for 12h. The cells were lysed, total RNA was extracted and microarray study was performed on Illumina HT12 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
