TITLE
Gene expression patterns in allergen-driven CD4 T cell responses from human atopics with or without asthma.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PBMC from house dust mite (HDM) sensitized atopics with or without asthma (or nonallergic controls) were cultured in the presence or absence of HDM extract for 24 hours. At the termination of the cultures, immunomagnetic separation was performed to purify CD4 T cells. Gene expression was profiled on microarrays.

DESIGN
The study design consisted of 72 subjects, and two experimental conditions (medium control, HDM stimulation).
