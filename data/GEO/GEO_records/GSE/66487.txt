TITLE
RNA polymerase II ChIP-seq in HSV-1 and mock infected cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Human herpesvirus 1 strain KOS

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine how RNA poymerase II (Pol II) occupancy changed in response to herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection using ChIP-seq of Pol II. ChIP assays were performed 4 hours after cells were infected (or mock infected) with HSV-1. Because host cell Pol II transcribes the HSV-1 genome, the ChIP-seq data also reveal polymerase occupancy on the viral genome.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of Pol II in mock infected and HSV-1 infected cells
