TITLE
Ecogenomic assessment of soil toxicity associated with the production chain of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), a candidate bio-based green chemical building block

ORGANISM
Folsomia candida

SUMMARY
2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is the top-12 value-added chemicals derived from biomass that may serve as a 'green' substitute for terephthalate acid (TPA) in polyesters. FDCA can be synthesized chemically from 5-(hydroxymethyl) furfural (HMF), which is produced from fructose or glucose. To investigate impact of the production chain of FDCA on terrestrial ecosystem and unravel molecular pathways invoked and the biological process affected in the animal, a microarray analysis was applied to measure the transcriptome-wide response in soil invertebrates Folsomia candida. Microarrays examined transcriptional changes at EC50 concentrations of FDCA, HMF and TPA spiked in sterilized LUFA 2.2 soils. The results indicated FDCA and TPA caused no significant change in gene expression, which may due to the low chemical water solubility leading to slow uptake by the animal from the pore water after. A substantial number of genes were significantly regulated in F. candida after exposure to HMF. Gene Ontology analysis showed many biological process were significantly affected, such as nucleic acid metabolism, transcriptional metabolic process, cell developmental process and oxidation-reduction process. Transcriptional profile also indicated HMF can be biotransformed by F. candida into SMF which is genotoxic and mutagenic. The current research shows that environmental risk of the FDCA production chain from biomass is not due to the final product but to the intermediate HMF.

DESIGN
We used a one-color microarray design where each sample was hybridized to a single array
