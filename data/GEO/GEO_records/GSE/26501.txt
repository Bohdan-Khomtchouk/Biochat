TITLE
Regulation of nucleosome landscape and transcription factor binding at enhancers by BRG1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Enhancers of transcription activate transcription via binding of sequence-specific transcription factors to their target sites in chromatin. In this report, we identify GATA1-bound enhancers genome-wide and find a global reorganization of the nucleosomes at these enhancers during differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to erythrocytes. We show that the catalytic subunit BRG1 of BAF complexes localizes to these enhancers during differentiation and generates a longer nucleosome repeat length surrounding the GATA1 sites by shifting the flanking nucleosomes away. Intriguing, we find that the nucleosome shifting specifically facilitates binding of TAL1 but not GATA1, which subsequently activates transcription of target genes.
