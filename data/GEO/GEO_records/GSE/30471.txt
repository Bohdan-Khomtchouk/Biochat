TITLE
The nucleosome remodeler SNF2L modulates WNT signaling for cellular homeostasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ISWI is an evolutionary conserved ATPase that catalyzes nucleosome remodeling in several different complexes. Two mammalian ISWI orthologs, SNF2H and SNF2L, have specialized functions despite their high similarity. Due to the lack of reagents the functions of SN2L in human cells had not been established. Newly established specific monoclonal antibodies and selective RNA interference protocols now enabled a comprehensive characterization of loss-of-function phenotypes in human cells.  Contrasting earlier results obtained in the mouse model, we found SNF2L broadly expressed in primary human tissues. Depletion of SNF2L in HeLa cells led to enhanced proliferation, morphological alterations and increased migration. These phenomena were explained by transcriptome profiling, which identified SNF2L as a modulator of the Wnt signaling network. The cumulative effects of SNF2L depletion on gene expression portray the cell in a state of activated Wnt signaling characterized by increased proliferation and chemotactic locomotion. High levels of SNF2L expression in normal melanocytes contrast to undetectable expression in malignant melanoma. In summary, our data document an anti-correlation between SNF2L expression and several features characteristic of malignant cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples from human HeLa cells. Transcript levels were analyzed after luciferase, SNF2H and SNF2L RNAi.
