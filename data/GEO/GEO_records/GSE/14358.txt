TITLE
Gene regulation in parthenocarpic tomato fruit

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
To evaluate the role of seeds in fruit quality, we induced parthenocarpy in tomato by regulating ovule-specific auxin synthesis or responsiveness using the INO promoter from A. thaliana, which is expressed in the outer layer of the integuments during early stages of ovule development. We compared these to fruit where the same coding regions were expressed from the DeFH9 promoter which is expressed in carpel tissues during early stages of ovule development. Expression of auxin synthesis or responsiveness genes by both of these promoters produced seedless parthenocarpic tomato fruit. We compared fruit samples using the Affymetrix tomato GeneChip (GPL4741) to determine how gene regulation and expression differed between wild-type and transgenic fruit. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Wild-type fruit with seeds was compared with transgenic lines INO-IaaM, DefH9-IaaM, INO-RolB, and DefH9-RolB. To find genes with seed-specific expression, we also compared the control with wild-type fruit from which seeds had been manually removed. We had three biological replicates for each treatment and control except DefH9-RolB, for which only two replicates were available. Each CEL file from the microarray represents one plant from each line.
