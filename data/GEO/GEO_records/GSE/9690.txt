TITLE
SAOS-2 cells, RBP2 knockdown or pRB overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RBP2 is downstream of pRB pathway We used gene expression profiling experiments to investigate if gene expression changes in cells with RBP2 knockdown significantly overlap with gene expression changes in cells overexpressing pRB, consistent with the data that knockdown of RBP2 phenocopies reintroduction of pRB in SAOS-2 (RB-/-) cells Keywords: epistatic experiment

DESIGN
Knockdown of RBP2 by siRNA to RBP2 (RBP2siRNA) in SAOS-2 (RB-/-) cells in comparison to overexpression of pRB in the SOAS-2 (RB-/-) cells and scrambled version of the RBP2 siRNA (RBP2scsiRNA)
