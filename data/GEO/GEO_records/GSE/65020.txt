TITLE
Gene expression profiles in E3.0 WT and Klf5 KO embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Klf5 has essential functions during early embryogenesis and in the derivation of ES cells from inner-cell mass of blastocyst. Among Kruppel-like factor (Klf) family members, only Klf5 shows peri-implantation lethal phenotype, but the precise mechanisms still remain unknown. To understand and identify molecular mechanisms, we performed microarray analysis by using E3.0 WT and Klf5 KO embryos when first phenotype of Klf5 deficiency appears.

DESIGN
Wild type (WT) and Klf5 knock-out (KO) embryos were collected from oviduct at E3.0. cDNAs were synthesized from individual embryos in accordance with the protocol described by Kurimoto et al., 2007. Gene expression analysis was performed by GeneSpring GXsoftware
