TITLE
BAFF engages distinct NFkappaB effectors in maturing and proliferating B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identify genes which are induced in wild type B cells under antigenic stimuli, anti-IgM vs pro-survival stimuli, BAFF. Also find the differential expressed genes which are distinct from in co-stimulated conditions.

DESIGN
RNAseq analysis of wild type primary B cells stimulated with anti-IgM alone, BAFF alone, or co-stimulated with both anti-IgM and BAFF for 8 and 30 hours

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
