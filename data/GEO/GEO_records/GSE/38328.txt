TITLE
Comparison of transcript abundance in aerial mycelium of the Magnaporthe oryzae FLB4-deleted mutant and its parental strain 70-15

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe oryzae

SUMMARY
Genes potentially regulated by the Flb4p transcription factor were identified by microarray-based transcriptome analysis of the flb4- mutant and the parental strain 70-15.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wild-type vs. FLB4-deleted mutant. 6 biological replicates with dye-swaps

PLATFORM
GPL9203 Agilent-015060 Magnaporthe grisea 2.0 4 X 44K (Probe name version)
