TITLE
Whole transcriptome characterization of the effects of dehydration and rehydration on Cladonia rangiferina, the grey reindeer lichen.

ORGANISM
Cladonia rangiferina

SUMMARY
We have utilized the raw sequence data from our earlier investigation of the lichen transcriptome to design a custom DNA microarray for C. rangiferina in order to study the transcripts expressed in lichen thallus during dehydration and rehydration. The aim of this study was to identify the genes most differentially expressed during the rehydration and drying processes and also to get a more integrative view of the molecular players who may play roles in the processes required for lichen desiccation tolerance and the rapid re-establishment of photosynthesis through functional annotation.

DESIGN
8 samples with three biological replicates for each sample, altogether 24 samples. D1h samples have been drying for 1 hour, D3h samples for 3 hours, D6h samples for 6 hours and Dry samples for 24 hours. W15m samples have been wetted for 15 minutes, W30m samples for 30 minutes, W1h samples for 1 hour and Wet samples for 3 hours.

PLATFORM
GPL17237 Agilent-024164 C. rangiferina array
