TITLE
Tet2-mediated DNA demethylation controls T cell cytokine expression [seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by ten-eleven translocation (Tet) family has recently been identified as a key process for active DNA demethylation, whose effects in the immune response is currently unknown.

DESIGN
Examination of both 5mC and 5hmC modifications in 5 Th cell types. CD2(Cre)Tet2(f/f) mice (previously described in Moran-Crusio et al.,2011) and wild-type littermates on the mixed background were used in experiments.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
