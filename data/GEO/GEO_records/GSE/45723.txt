TITLE
A new approach for the study of lung smooth muscle phenotypes and its application in asthma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We developed a new method for the isolation of bronchial smooth muscle cells. This method is built upon a double fluorescent mouse SMA-GFP;NG2-DsRed and cell sorting. Using this method, we isolated bronchial smooth muscle cells from control and asthmatic C57BL/6J mice for gene profiling.

DESIGN
Double fluorescent mice were induced to develop asthma using OVA.  Bronchial smooth muscle cells were purified from asthmatic and control mice for mRNA array.
