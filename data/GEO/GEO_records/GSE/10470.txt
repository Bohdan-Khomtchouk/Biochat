TITLE
Gene Expression Study in WT and ATF4 KO embryonic neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oxidative stress is pathogenic in neurological diseases including stroke. The identity of oxidative stress-inducible transcription factors and their role(s) in propagating the death cascade are poorly understood. Microarray analysis of neurons undergoing oxidative stress showed significant induction of prodeath genes. These genes have been shown to be regulated by the bZip transcription factor, ATF4. ATF4 protein localized to the promoter of a putative death gene in neurons in vitro and in vivo. Germline deletion of ATF4 in neurons resulted in a reduction in oxidative stress-induced gene expression and resistance to oxidative death. ATF4 knockout mice experienced significantly smaller infarcts and improved behavioral recovery as compared to wild-type mice subjected to the same reductions in blood flow in a rodent model of stroke. ATF4 modulates an early, upstream event in the death pathway, as resistance to oxidative death by ATF4 deletion was associated with decreased consumption of  the antioxidant glutathione. Restoration of ATF4 protein in knockout neurons was sufficient to restore sensitivity to oxidative death and to reaccelerate loss of glutathione. Together, these findings establish ATF4 as a redox-regulated, pro-death transcriptional activator in the nervous system that propagates death responses to oxidative stress in vitro and to stroke in vivo. Keywords: ATF4, oxidative stress, gene expression, neuroprotection, stroke

DESIGN
WT and ATF4 KO embryonic neurons were studied. Untreated neurons (no=8 per genotype) and neurons challenged with oxidative stress with the glutamate homolog homocysteate (HCA, no=4 per genotype) were studied, for a total of 24 samples.
