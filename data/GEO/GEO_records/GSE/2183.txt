TITLE
Gene expression profiling of mussels treated with two chemical mixtures

ORGANISM
Mytilus galloprovincialis

SUMMARY
We examined gene expression profiling of mussels treated with two chemical mixtures composed by heavy metals or organic compounds, both including genotoxic agents (cadmium, benzo[a]pyrene, 1-nitro/amino-pyrene) and other contaminants (cupper, mercury, fluoranthene, TCDD). For  digestive gland one RNA sample from control mussels and one from each treatment group (7 mussels) were competitively hybridized on the MytArray 1.0. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed and labeled using a Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP direct incorporation. We carried out two separate hybridizations for each treatment conditions.
