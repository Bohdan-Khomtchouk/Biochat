TITLE
The splicing activator DAZAP1 integrates splicing control into MEK/Erk regulated cell proliferation and migration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DAZAP1 was depleted in culterd HEK 293T cells using shRNA and the resulting poly A RNA were isolated  c-DNA library constructed and paired end sequenced on illumina Hi-seq 2000 platform the data was compared to a control shRNA depleted cell

DESIGN
Gene expression and splicing switches upon DAZAP1 knockdown

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
