TITLE
Differential miroRNA expression in myostatin knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify microRNAs involved in myostatin-deficient muscular hypertrophy, we compared miRNA expression in wild-type and myostatin knockout mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA, isolated from three wild-type or myostatin knockout mice, was pooled and then used for microarray analysis.
