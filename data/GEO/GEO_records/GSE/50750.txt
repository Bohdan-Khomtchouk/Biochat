TITLE
Drug Synergy Screen and Network Modeling in Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma (DDLS) part 2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of DNA copy number variations in two DDLS tumor-derived cell lines DDLS8817 and LPS141 growing in culture in basal conditions The goal of this DNA copy number analysis was to determine if genes used in signaling network modeling in DDLS were amplified or deleted

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was isolated from asynchronously growing DDLS8817 and LPS141 cultures growing in basal conditions using the Qiagen DNAy kit.
