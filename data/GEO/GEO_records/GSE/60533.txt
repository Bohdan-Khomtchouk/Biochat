TITLE
complex i-Analysis of complex I mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs12-03_complex-i - complex i - Can we identify differences between mutants affecte din different subunits of complex I - direct comparison between col-0 (wild type) and 4 mutants, each mutants having different levels of residual complex I. Three biological replicates were processed

DESIGN
12 dye-swap - gene knock out The levels of residual complex I for the 4 mutants are as follows: mwfe (5%), 18K (traces), ca2 (10%), and 51K (0%).
