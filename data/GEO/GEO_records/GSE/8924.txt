TITLE
Effects of FSH on testicular mRNA transcript levels in the hypogonadal mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the normal mouse the pituitary gonadotrophins determine development, maturation and physiological regulation of the testis with follicle-stimulating  hormone (FSH) activating the Sertoli cell and luteinising hormone (LH) the Leydig cell. To look at the potential interaction of cell types within the testis following hormone stimulation we have investigated the effect of rFSH on testicular gene expression in the hypogonadal (hpg) male mouse. Due to a deletion in the gene encoding gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), FSH and LH levels are at the lower limit of detection in the circulation and mice remain in a pre-pubertal state throughout life unless given exogenous hormone. Here we have addressed important question of changes in the global gene expression profile of testicular tissue following hormone stimulation (rFSH) for 12, 24 and 72h following injections compared to control untreated hpg males of the same age.
