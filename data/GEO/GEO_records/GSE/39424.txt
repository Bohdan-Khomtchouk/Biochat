TITLE
Continuous gene expression profile of root at daytime throughout the entire growth of rice in the field

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
A continuous gene expression profiling of roots was performed during daytime at regular interval from transplanting until harvesting to characterize the transcriptional and physiological changes in the root system of rice throughout the entire growth under natural field conditions.
