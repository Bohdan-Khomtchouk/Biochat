TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Tg(hsp70:dn-xBrg1) and wild-type sibling hearts Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to compare the NGS-derived heart transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) between Tg(hsp70:dn-xBrg1) and wild-type sibling injured hearts.

DESIGN
Total heart mRNA profiles of Tg(hsp70:dn-xBrg1) and wild-type sibling hearts after heat-shock daily from 5 to 14 dpa were caried out by using Illumina HiSeq 2500
