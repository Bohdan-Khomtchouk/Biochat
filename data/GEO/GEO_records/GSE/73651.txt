TITLE
Comprehensive gene expression analysis of a MESP1-progenitor derived cardiac lineage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A hESC MESP1 reporter line was used to isolate MESP1 expressing pre-cardiac progenitors. These progenitor were replated and fulter differentiated in culture. At four sequential timepoints upon further differentiation, samples were isolated for gene expression analysis, in order to identify key cardiac transcription factors and molecules.

DESIGN
hESCs were differentiated towards the cardiac lineage. MESP1-mCherry expressing progenitors were isolated at day 3 of differentiation and replated as aggregates, in presence of Wnt-inhibitor Xav939. Two days after replating (D5), four days (D7), seven days (D10), ad 11 days (D14), total RNA of each sample was isolated for gene expression analysis. MESP1-mCherry positive derivatives were compared to MESP1-mCherry negative derivatives, in order to identify cardiac-specific regulators and cell surface markers.
