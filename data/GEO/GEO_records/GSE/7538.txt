TITLE
Treatment of primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) specimens with parthenolide (PTL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effects of 7.5 micromolar parthenolide (PTL) were assessed on primary CD34+ acute myelogenous leukemia specimens obtained from 12 patients. Keywords: drug response, gene expression search agent

DESIGN
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) specimens were obtained from 12 patients and CD34+ cells were isolated.  For each patient, cells were cultured in vitro and exposed to either 7.5 micromolar parthenolide (PTL) or left untreated (UT) for 6 h.  Total RNA was then harvested for global gene expression analysis.
