TITLE
CD40 in thymic DC maturation and Treg cell development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim is to determine which genes are distinctively expressed in each of the subsets of DCs Four subsets of dendritic cells in mouse thymus were sorted based on their expression of Sirpa and their maturation status: Sirpa+ immature DCs, Sirpa+ mature DCs, Sirpa- immature DCs, and Sirpa- mature DCs

DESIGN
the four subset were compaired to each other, there were 2 samples per group

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
