TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in testis of mouse inter-subspecific hybrids

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MiRNA expression profiling on 14.5 day old testis from sterile (PWD x B6)F1, (PWK x B6)F1 and fertile (B6 x PWD)F1 inter-subspecific hybrids were performed to study the genome wide variation in miRNA expression between different inter-subspecific hybrids during meiosis.

DESIGN
The total RNA (120 ng) samples were extracted from 14.5 days juvenile testes (pool of 4 samples), converted to cDNA using the Affymetrix 3 IVT Express Kit and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse miRNA Gene 1.0ST GeneChips (core facility of the Institute of Molecular Genetics AS CR, Prague, Czech Rep.)
