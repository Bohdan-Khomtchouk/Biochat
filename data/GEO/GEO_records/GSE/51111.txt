TITLE
Potential biomarkers tah could help to determine the prognosis of azoospermia treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed gene expression profiles of human testicular biopsies in men with idiopathic nonobstructive azoospermia who underwent therapy with hCG/rFSH. Using new generation oligonucleotide microarray platform GeneChipÂ® Human Gene 1.0 ST,  we identified genes which could be potential prognostic biomarkers of azoospermia treatment.

DESIGN
We analyzed 6 testicular biopsy samples with Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST microarrays. 3 of them were obtained from patients with NOA, who positively responded to hormonal therapy and 3 non-respoders.
