TITLE
The maize silks transcriptome

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
P1 encodes an R2R3-MYB transcription factor responsible for the accumulation of insecticidal flavones in maize silks and red phlobaphene pigments in pericarps and other floral tissues, which contributed to making P1 an important visual marker since the dawn of modern genetics. We conducted RNA-Seq using from maize silks obtained at 2-3 days after emergence. High-throughput sequencing using the Illumina platform resulted in the generation of ~14 million high quality reads, corresponding to ~7 million reads for each sample, from which 76% aligned to the maize genome.

DESIGN
