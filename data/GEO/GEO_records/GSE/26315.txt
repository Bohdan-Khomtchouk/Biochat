TITLE
Expression data from human amnion mesenchymal cells treated with interleukin-1-beta for 1hr and 8hr

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Premature birth continues to be a challenging pregnancy complication, and a body of literature indicates that inflammation can contribute to premature delivery by converting a receptive uterine environment to a hostile one.  Cytokines have been demonstrated to provoke up-regulation of inflammatory genes (e.g. interleukin-1, 6, and 8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, cyclooxygenase-2, and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1). Using monolayer cultures of human amnion mesenchymal cells (AMCs) as a model, we aimed to detail the global programme of gene expression that occurs in response to cytokine challenge.

DESIGN
Human amnion mesenchymal cells were challenged with 10 ng/ml of interleukin-1-beta for 1 hour (1h) or 8 hours (8h) in serum-free media, while control cells were treated with serum free medium only (veh).  The cells (veh, 1h and 8h) were subjected to RNA extraction, quantification, and evaluation, followed by hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Human Genome U133A 2.0 Arrays (Platform GPL571).  Experiments were repeated three times for a total of nine samples used for microarray analysis.  Three biological replicates were used to ensure that any results were not biased by day-to-day variation in RNA extraction.
