TITLE
The effect of type-I interferon signaling directly on CD8+ T cells following LCMV infection in the presence or absence of NK cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the effect of type-I IFN signaling directly on CD8+ T cells following an LCMV infection we compared the overall gene expression of WT and Ifnar1-/- T cells following an LCMV infection.

DESIGN
WT and Ifnar1-/- P14 cells were sorted from infected mice (day 3) that were depleted of NK cells or left untreated. Each sample and condition (WT or IFNAR) was performed in triplicates
