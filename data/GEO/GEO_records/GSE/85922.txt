TITLE
WRKY transcription factors in early MAMP-triggered immunity (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We determined on a genome-wide scale the flg22-induced in vivo DNA-binding dynamics of three of the most prominent WRKY factors, WRKY18, WRKY40 and WRKY33. The three WRKY factors each bound to more than 1000 gene loci predominantly at W-box elements, the known WRKY binding motif. Transcriptional analysis also revealed that WRKY18 and WRKY40 function redundantly as negative regulators of flg22-induced genes.

DESIGN
We analysed for each of two biological replicates 8 samples: non HA-tagged WT seedlings served as negative controls while binding  to DNA of three different WRKY-HA complementation lines were investigated ChIP-seq using an anti-HA antibody.
