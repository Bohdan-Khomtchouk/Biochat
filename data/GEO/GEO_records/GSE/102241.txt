TITLE
Microarray data from e4.5 mouse trophectoderm on high fat vs control diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Maternal obesity can lead to altered outcomes for offspring, and it is believed that the placenta plays a role in this fetal programming. We sought to examine the effects on maternal diet-induced obesity on changes in gene expression at the earliest stages of placenta development using microarray

DESIGN
e4.5 blastocyts were flushed from female mice exposed to a control or high fat diet.  The trophectoderm was removed, and the trophectoderm from 5 blastocyts was pooled to produce a single sample.  RNA was isolated  from 4 replicates each from control or high fat diet mice.  cDNA was generated and samples were hybridized to an Affymetrix array

PLATFORM
GPL6096 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
