TITLE
JMJD2B knockdown treatment in normoxia and hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Estrogen receptor alpha plays a critical role in breast cancer and is a major target in endocrine therapy. HIF-1 alpha have been associated with ER alpha and predict a worse outcome. Recent studies indicate that histone demethylase JMJD2B is a HIF-1 alpha target. However, little is known about the biological functions of JMJD2B, especially in breast cancer. To elucidate the mechanism by which JMJD2B reguates gene expression in normoxia and hypoxia,  MCF-7 breast cancer cells were depleted forJMJD2B in normoxia and hypoxia. Our results provide insight into JMJD2B regulation of gene expression in breast cancer cells in normoxia and hypoxia.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were subjected to transfection with siRNA controls and two different siRNA oligos against JMJD2B for 24 hours. Cells were treated in normoxia and hypoxia for another 16 hours.
