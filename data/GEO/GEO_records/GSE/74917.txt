TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas aeruginosa ∆sbrR and ∆sbrIR mutants versus wild type

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1

SUMMARY
SbrI and SbrR are an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor and its cognate anti-sigma factor, respectively. To identify the SbrIR regulon, we measured gene expression in wild type PAO1 , PAO1 ∆sbrR, and PAO1 ∆sbrIR mutants using microarrays.

DESIGN
WT PAO1 pPSV38 (empty vector), PAO1 ∆sbrR pPSV38, PAO1 ∆sbrR pSbrR, and PAO1 ∆sbrIR pPSV38 were grown to mid-log. RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into cDNA. The cDNA was biotinylated and hybridized to Pseudomonas aeruginosa Affymetrix microarrays.
