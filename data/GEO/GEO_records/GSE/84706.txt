TITLE
Experimental validation of candidate regulators of KRAS transcriptional components.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from HCC44 and YAPC cell lines stably expressing Cas9, and infecting with indicated gRNAs against regulators of KRAS transcriptional components.

DESIGN
KRAS mutant cell lines HCC44 and YAPC stably expressing with Cas9 were infected with three independent gRNAs targeting indicated genes or controls (GFP, RFP, random gRNAs) and harvested 8 days after infection.
