TITLE
Expression data from canine B-cell lymphomas

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Pet dogs may provide a useful large-animal model of spontaneously occuring non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but complete molecular characterization is lacking. We used gene expression microarrays to molecularly characterize canine lymphoma, and found similarities between canine B-cell lymphoma and human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

DESIGN
We isolated RNA from pre-treatment biopsies from dogs with B-cell lymphoma and performed gene expression profiling.
