TITLE
Transcriptional profile of an eca39∆ mutant fission yeast

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
An branched-chain amino acids auxotroph eca39∆ mutant fission yeast exhibits an unusual adaptive growth phenotype on solid minimal media containing Ile, Leu and Val when other strains are growing nearby. The transcriptional profiles of an eca39∆ mutant before and after the adaptation were determined using Affymetrix DNA microarrays.
