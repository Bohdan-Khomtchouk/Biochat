TITLE
Transcriptional profile of an eca39∆ mutant fission yeast

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
An branched-chain amino acids auxotroph eca39∆ mutant fission yeast exhibits an unusual adaptive growth phenotype on solid minimal media containing Ile, Leu and Val when other strains are growing nearby. The transcriptional profiles of an eca39∆ mutant before and after the adaptation were determined using Affymetrix DNA microarrays.

DESIGN
Wild-type, the eca39∆ mutant, and the adapted eca39∆ mutant fission yeasts were inoculated in YE+2mM Ile, Leu and Val, and harvested at OD ~ 1. Total RNAs were purified from the 3 samples.
