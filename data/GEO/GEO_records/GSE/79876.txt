TITLE
Regulatory Landscape and Clinical Implication of MBD3 in Human Malignant Glioma [low-grade glioma and glioblastoma screening]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A comprehensive study is conducted to inspect the role and function of methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 3 (MBD3) in human malignant glioma, as well as to test its potential as a novel prognostic biomarker. Using whole-genome microarray for transcriptome, the MBD3-mediated epigenetic regulation in glioma was profiled.

DESIGN
A negative correlation between the glioma WHO grade and the MBD3 protein level was first revealed in our collected patient biopsies. Therefore,  the differentiated expressed genes between low-grade glioma (WHO grade II) and glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) were screened. Four patients with characterized glioma grade were enrolled in each group.
