TITLE
Human smooth muscle cells at 2 hr post-stimulation with IL-1beta

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this data set is to measure the effect of IL-1beta stimulation on the transcription profile in an in vitro inflammation model. Transcription profiling was carried out using Affymetrix HG U-133A v2 microarrays.

DESIGN
Human aortic smooth muscle cells (3F1243) were pre-treated with DMSO for two hours and subsequently exposed to IL-1beta (10 ng/ml). Transcription profiling was carried out at 0h and 2h points of IL-1beta exposure, with four samples at each time point 0hr and 2hr. 8 samples in total.
