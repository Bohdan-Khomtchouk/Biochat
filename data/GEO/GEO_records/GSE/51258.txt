TITLE
ERG induced mesenchymal like gene signature

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ERG overexpression was conducted in stably transfected K562 cell line with a tet-on inducible plasmid habouring ERG3. Prolonged induction of ERG (8 days) produced spindle cell shape changes whereas non-induced cells retained the round morphology. In oder to determine the genes responsible for inducing cell shape changes, a genome wide transcriptional screen was conducted.

DESIGN
Three clones that potently induced ERG overexpression (8 days) with the corresponding non-induced cells were hybridized.
