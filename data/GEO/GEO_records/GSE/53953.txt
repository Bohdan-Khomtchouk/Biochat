TITLE
Heme oxygenase-1 knocked down rat mesangial cells treated with hydrogen peroxide

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
HO-1 cells denote the cultured rat mesangial cells with heme oxygenase-1 knocked down by RNA interference (using lentiviral vector). GFP cells denote the cultured rat mesangial cells that are transfected with empty lentiviral vector containing GFP cassette. Cells are treated with hydrogen peroxide 100 micromolar for 2 hours, or without. RNA are then harvested for array analysis. Biological replicates are performed (two independent experiment sets).

DESIGN
GFP cell and HO-1 cell are untreated, or treated with hydrogen peroxide (100 micromolar for 2 hours).
