TITLE
C57BL/6J WT mice liver and adipose: normal diet (ND) vs.  high-fat diet (HFD)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling for screening olfactory receptor expressions in C57BL/6J mouse liver and adipose tissue under either ND and HFD

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Liver ND vs. HFD and Adipose ND vs. HFD. RNA samples from 10 mouse livers and 10 mouse adipose tissues were pooled from both ND and HFD and single microarray experiments were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
