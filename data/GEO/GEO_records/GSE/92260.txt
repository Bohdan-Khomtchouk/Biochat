TITLE
Development of zebrafish medulloblastoma model by TALENs induced somatic gene inactivation methods

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
we developed the zebrafish cancer models by TALENs mediated somatic inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, rb1, induced brain tumors in tp53 mutation background. Using RNA sequencing analysis in addition to histopathology and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that the brain tumors induced by rb1 gene somatic inactivation have a molecular feature of MB-like PNETs

DESIGN
QuantSeq 3â€™ mRNA sequencing with whole brain tissue wild type (WT) zebrafish and tumors induced by rb1 TALENs injected zebrafish at 5 month post fertilization

PLATFORM
GPL20828 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Danio rerio)
