TITLE
The function of the Hedgehog signaling pathway in the colon

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The morphogen Indian Hedgehog plays a very important role during intestinal embryogenesis, but also maintains homeostasis in the adult gut. Intestinal Hedgehog is expressed by the intestinal epithelium and signals in paracrine manner to fibroblasts in the stromal compartment. We studied the colonic changes upon activation of the Hedgehog pathway by deleting the Hedgehog receptor Patched1 in order to alleviate its repressive function.

DESIGN
By using Rosa26CreERT2-Ptch1 fl/fl mice we deleted exon 8 and 9 of the Patched1 receptor in a body-wide fashion to activate the Hedgehog pathway. 12 days after the start of the induction with tamoxifen, colons were isolated.
