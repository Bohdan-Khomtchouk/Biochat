TITLE
Scleral miRNA profiles in adult and fetal eyes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Introduction: In human eyes, ocular enlargement/ growth, reflects active scleral extracellular matrix remodeling. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by base pairing with target sequences, and serve as nodes of signaling networks. We hypothesized that the sclera, like most tissues, expresses miRNAs, some of which modulate genes regulating ocular growth. In this study, the scleral miRNA expression profile of rapidly growing human fetal eyes was compared with that of stable adult donor eyes using high-throughput microarray and quantitative PCR analyses.  Results: Human sclera expressed several miRNAs. Microarray comparison of adult and fetal samples revealed many to be differentially expressed (p < 0.01, min p= 6.5x10^11), with increased expression of collagen specific mir-214, let-7c, let-7e, mir-103, mir-107, and mir-98 in fetal sclera subsequently confirmed (1.5 to 4 fold changes, p < 0.01). For both adult and fetal samples, no significant differences in miRNA expression profiles of sclera from posterior and peripheral ocular regions were observed.   Conclusion: This is the first study to catalogue miRNA expression in human sclera. The sclera expresses several miRNAs, some of which show age-related differential regulation, higher in rapidly growing fetal eyes, consistent with a role in ocular growth regulation. These findings may be useful for linking scleral miRNA expression with potential manipulation in disorders such as scleral ectasia/ axial myopia.

DESIGN
Scleral samples from normal human fetal (24 wk) and normal adult donor eyes (n=4 to 6, each group) were obtained, and RNA extracted. Genome-wide miRNA profiling was performed using the Agilent miRNA microarray platform. miRNA target predictions were obtained using Microcosm, TargetScan and PicTar algorithms.
