TITLE
Global transcriptomic analysis of the response of Corynebacterium glutamicum to vanillin

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032

SUMMARY
Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant and renewable resource for biofuels and bio-based chemicals. Vanillin is one of the major phenolic inhibitors in biomass production using lignocellulose. To assess the response of Corynebacterium glutamicum to vanillin stress,  a global transcriptional response analysis was performed by using microarray.

DESIGN
Samples were collected during the mid-logarithmic growth phase in minimal medium with added glucose (control sample 100mM) or vanillin as the sole carbon source (3mM), respectively. Two-condition experiment, glucose vs. vanillin. Biological replicates: 4 control replicates, 4 treatment replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL22357 Agilent-045822 Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 8X15K array [Probe Name Version]
