TITLE
Effects of demethylation on lung cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify those genes that are commonly silenced by DNA-methylation in lung cancer cell lines. Keywords: cell line comparison, stress response

DESIGN
Ten lung cancer cell lines (Calu 1, Hotz, U1752, Calu 6, ZL25, Calu3, SW2, A549, H125, and H 460) were analyzed before and after the treatment with 5-aza-2â€™deoxycitidine and trychostatin A (5AzaC/TSA).
