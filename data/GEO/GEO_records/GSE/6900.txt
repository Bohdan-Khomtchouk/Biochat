TITLE
ENCODE ChIP-chip for Rel A (p65) using polyclonal antibody (N-) on TNF-alpha-stimulated HeLaS3 Cells [unpublished]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rel A (p65) ChIP-chip using polyclonal antibody (N-terminus) performed on TNF-alpha-stimulated HeLaS3 cells for Nimblegen ENCODE arrays which comprise 50mer oligonucleotides spaces every 38bps (overlapping by 12nts). Goal was to identify p65-binding regions in the inflammatory and immune response of human cells. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
DNA from immunoprecipitated chromatin using p65 antibody (N-terminus) or normal rabbit IgG was hybridized to a Nimblegen ENCODE tiling array containing overlapping 50nt oligonucleotide probes. Samples are three biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL2533 Nimblegen ENCODE tiling array (HG17) with 50mer probe at 38bp interval for RenLab
