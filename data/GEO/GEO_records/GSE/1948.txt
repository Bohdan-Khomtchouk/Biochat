TITLE
SRF-VP16 overexpression in ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Empty vector, SRF-dM-VP16 (control construct lacking the SRF DNA binding domain), or SRF-VP16 were expressed in wild-type ES cells (E14wt), SRF heterozygotes (E99-/+) or two SRF ko cell lines (E81-/-,E100-/-). RNA was harvested 72h after transfection. Each condition was performed in duplicate, except E100-/- vector transfected. Keywords: ordered
