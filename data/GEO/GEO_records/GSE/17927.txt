TITLE
Analysis of five species of Gossypium allotetraploids and a synthetic F1 hybrid compared to model diploid projenitors

ORGANISM
Gossypium

SUMMARY
We compare gene expression among petals tissues in 5 species of natural allotetraploid and F1 hybrid cottons to  the antecedent conditions existing prior to genome merger and duplication, thus revealing the effects of genome merger and polyploidy on gene expression evolution
