TITLE
Genome-wide baseline microRNA expression quantification in HapMap phase I CEU and YRI samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Baseline microRNA (miRNA) expression was evaluated in 107 HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs; 53 CEU and 54 YRI) using Exiqon miRCURY LNA arrays v10.0 (Exiqon array).

DESIGN
Total RNA from each of the 107 HapMap sample was labeled and hybridized onto an Exiqon array
