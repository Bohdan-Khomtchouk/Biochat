TITLE
iMir: An integrated pipeline for high-throughput miRNA-Seq data analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a novel modular pipeline (iMir) for comprehensive analysis of miRNA-Seq data, from linker removal and sequence quality check to differential expression and biological target prediction, integrating multiple open source modules and resources linker together in an automated flow.

DESIGN
Development of an integrated pipeline (iMir) for comprehensive analysis of miRNA-Seq experiment.
