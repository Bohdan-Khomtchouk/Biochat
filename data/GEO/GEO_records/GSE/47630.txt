TITLE
Agilent 244K CGH data for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number analysis of primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) from 40 patients in Japan. Integrative analysis of gene expression profiles and genomic alterations obtained from array-CGH and NGS provided us new insight into the pathogenesis of ESCC.

DESIGN
40 tumor samples were prepared for aCGH analysis. For genome profiling, labeling and hybridization of genomic DNA onto the Agilent-014693 Human Genome Microarray Kit 244K (Agilent Technologies) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.

PLATFORM
GPL9128 Agilent-014693 Human Genome CGH Microarray 244A (Probe name version)
