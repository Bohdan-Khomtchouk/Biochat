TITLE
Gene expression for transformed YAMC clones

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
YAMC murine colonic epithelial cells were repeatitively treated with commensal bacteria-polarized macrophages or 4-HNE. Following 10 treatments, 25 clones were selected to engraft immunodeficient mice, and 10 out of 25 clones grew tumors in these mice. To explore gene expression associated with cellular transformation, whole-genome profiling was performed on 10 transformed clones and compared with untreated YAMC controls using Illumina Mouse WG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 10 transformed clones and compared to untreated YAMC controls.
