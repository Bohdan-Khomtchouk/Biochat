TITLE
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase modulation of trophoblast cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rcho-1 trophoblast stem cells can be maintained in a trophoblast stem cell state or induced to differentiate into trophoblast giant cells.  During the differentiation process the PI3K pathway is constitutively activated. Microarray analysis of  stem, differentiated and differentiated Rcho-1 trophoblast stem cells treated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002.

DESIGN
We used gene profiling to determine changes in gene expression between stem and differentiated Rcho-1 trophoblast stem cells.  We also identified genes regulated by PI3K in Rcho-1 trophoblast stem cells.
