TITLE
Deciphering the genetic architecture of variation in the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (genotype)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of genetic polymorphisms associated with inter-individual variation in immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.

DESIGN
We performed a genome-wide mapping study of loci that are associated with functional variation in immune response to MTB (This dataset). We characterized transcript and protein expression levels and mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in primary dendritic cells from 65 individuals, before and after infection with MTB (see GSE34151).
