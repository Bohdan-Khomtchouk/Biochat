TITLE
Gene expression and survival changes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during suspension culture.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
This study explores the connection between changes in gene expression and the genes that determine strain survival  during suspension culture, using the model eukaryotic organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  The Saccharomyces cerevisiae homozygous diploid deletion pool, and the BY4743 parental strain were grown for 18 hours in a rotating wall vessel, a suspension culture device optimized to minimize the delivered shear. In addition to the reduced shear conditions, the rotating wall vessels were also placed in a static position or in a shaker in order to change the amount of shear stress on the cells. Keywords: shear stress, time course
