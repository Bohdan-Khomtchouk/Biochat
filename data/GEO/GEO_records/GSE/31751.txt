TITLE
Regulation of gene expression by mir-493

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes that are inhibited by mir-493, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes that are down-regulated after expression of mir-493.   HCT116 colon cancer cells were transfected with control or mir-493 mimic for 24 hrs, and total RNA extracted from the transfected cells were labeled with Cy3 and used for microarray analyses with Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays.

DESIGN
gene expression in HCT116 cells was measured after transfection of control or mir-493.  Three independent experiments were performed for each transfection.
