TITLE
Effects of resistance exercise and resistance training on the skeletal muscle transcriptome in young and old adults

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global microarray (HG U133 Plus 2.0) was used to investigate the effects of resistance exercise and resistance training on the skeletal muscle transcriptome profile of 28 young and old adults. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained pre and 4hrs post resistance exercise in the beginning (untrained state) and at the end (trained state) of a 12 wk progressive resistance training program.

DESIGN
A total of 28 subjects were included in this investigation.  The young (n=16, 24±1y) participants included 8 males and 8 females.  The old (n=12, 84±1y) participants included 6 males and 6 females.  All subjects participated in 12 wks of progressive resistance training consisting of bilateral knee extensions with 3x10 reps at 70% of 1-RM, and 3d/wk for a total of 36 training sessions.  Vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained in conjunction with the 1st and 36th (last) training session and included a basal biopsy and another biopsy 4hrs post the resistance exercise session (for a total of 4 biopsies per subject).  The RNA integrity for all samples was very good with an average RIN number of 7.6.  All 110 samples were analyzed on a separate microarray chip, and samples were not pooled between subjects.  The study design allowed us to examine the acute effects of resistance exercise on the skeletal muscle transcriptome in the untrained and trained state.  The design also provided information on the effects of resistance training on basal level gene expression and the effects of age on basal level gene expression
