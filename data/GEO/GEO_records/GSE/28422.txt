TITLE
Effects of resistance exercise and resistance training on the skeletal muscle transcriptome in young and old adults

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global microarray (HG U133 Plus 2.0) was used to investigate the effects of resistance exercise and resistance training on the skeletal muscle transcriptome profile of 28 young and old adults. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained pre and 4hrs post resistance exercise in the beginning (untrained state) and at the end (trained state) of a 12 wk progressive resistance training program.
