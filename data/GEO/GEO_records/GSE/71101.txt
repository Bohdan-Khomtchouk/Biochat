TITLE
Expression data from C3H10T1/2 cells treated with 3.3 nM BMP7 vs vehicle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Multipotent C3H10T1/2 cells can be induced to differentiate into mature brown adipocytes by 3-days BMP7 pretreatment followed by standard adipogenic induction. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in C3H10T1/2 cells after 3-day BMP7 (3.3 nM) treatment.

DESIGN
C3H10T1/2 cells were treated with 3.3 nM BMP7 for 3 days, and then total RNAs were extracted for microarray using Affymetrix GeneChip mouse 430A.
