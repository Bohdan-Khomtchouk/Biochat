TITLE
Expression data from murine cardiac fibroblasts and endothelial cells following Transverse Aortic Constriction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Accumulation of activated cardiac fibroblasts plays a key role in heart failure progression. These cells deposit excessive extracellular matrix that leads to mechanical stiffness, myocyte uncoupling and ischemia. To investigate whether two developmentally distinct cardiac fibroblast populations exhibit distinct expression profiles in response to cardiac injury, and therefore might necessitate distinct therapeutic targeting, we performed microarray analysis on FACS sorted cells. Tie2cre lineage traced CFs, non Tie2cre lineage traced cardiac fibroblasts and endothelial cells were isolated from left ventricle of SHAM operated and banded hearts at the onset of fibrosis, one week after surgery. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in cardiac fibroblasts and endothelium following pressure overload. Tie2cre lineage traced, non-tie2cre lineage traced fibroblasts and endothelial cells were sorted from left ventricle of 3 SHAM operated and 3 TAC operated adult male Black Swiss mice.

DESIGN
Tie2cre lineage traced, non-tie2cre lineage traced fibroblasts and endothelial cells were sorted from left ventricle of 3 SHAM operated and 3 Transaortic Constriction (TAC) operated adult male Black Swiss mice for RNA extraction and Affymetrix microarray analysis. Hypertrophy in TAC animals, an lack of hypertrophy in SHAM operated animals, was evaluated by hemodynamic measurements before surgery and one week after surgery. Cells were isolated one week after surgery.
