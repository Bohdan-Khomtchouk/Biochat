TITLE
Infection of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (Col-0, UBQ10::YFP-TCP14-4, tcp14-6 and coi1-16) with the Pseudomonas syringae strain DC3000 cor-

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study evaluates the transcriptome of four genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana infected at the seedling stage with the Pseudomonas syringae strain DC3000 cor-.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were grown under short day conditions (9h of light at 21°C - 15h of dark at 18°C) for two weeks. Plants were sprayed with a suspension of the Pseudomonas syringae strain DC3000 cor- and harvested after 24h. A mock treatment was also included. Lines Col-0 (3 replicates), UBQ10::YFP-TCP14-4 (3 replicates), tcp14-6 (3 replicates) and coi1-16 (3 replicates) were used in the experiment. Each replicate corresponds to approximately 30 seedlings grown in the same pot.
