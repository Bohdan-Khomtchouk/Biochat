TITLE
Evaluation of gene expression data generated from expired Affymetrix GeneChip® microarrays using MAQC reference RNA samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Affymetrix GeneChip® system is a commonly used platform for microarray analysis but the technology is inherently expensive. Unfortunately, changes in experimental planning and execution, such as the unavailability of previously anticipated samples or a shift in research focus, may render significant numbers of pre-purchased GeneChip® microarrays unprocessed before their manufacturer’s expiration dates. Researchers and microarray core facilities wonder whether expired microarrays are still useful for gene expression analysis. Our results demonstrated that microarray data generated using U133A microarrays, which were more than four years past the manufacturer’s expiration date, were highly specific and consistent with those from unexpired microarrays in identifying DEGs despite some appreciable fold change compression and decrease in sensitivity. Our data also suggested that the MAQC reference RNA samples, stored at -80°C, were stable over a time frame of at least four years.

DESIGN
The new gene expression data were generated with 12 microarrays (2 types of microarrays × 2 samples × 3 replicates). Three replicates for each of the two MAQC samples (A = Stratagene’s Universal Human Reference RNA; B = Ambion’s Human Brain Reference RNA) were profiled in 2009 by using both the expired U133A microarrays (expired in 2004) and the unexpired U133Plus2 microarrays. In addition, gene expression data generated with unexpired U133Plus2 microarrays (AFX), other microarray platforms, and TaqMan® assays by the MAQC project in 2005 were used as references to assess the stability of the MAQC samples stored at -80°C for four years by comparing new microarray data with those obtained four years ago. The MAQC reference data also allowed for further evaluation of the usefulness of the data generated with expired U133A microarrays.
