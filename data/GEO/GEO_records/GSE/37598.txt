TITLE
Linalool-responsive genes in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The plant volatile linalool plays important roles in the regulation of defense responses in rice. To clarify the response to linalool in rice at gene expression level, we performed a microarray analysis using the Agilent Rice Oligo Microarray (44k, custom-made; Agilent Technologies, Redwood City, CA, USA). As a result, treatment of linalool caused high upregulation of many defense-related genes including pathogenesis-related (PR) genes in rice.
