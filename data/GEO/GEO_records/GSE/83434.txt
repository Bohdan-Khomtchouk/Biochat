TITLE
Latrophilin 2 specifies cardiac lineage commitment and heart development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of lineage-specific markers is pivotal for understanding developmental processes and developing cell therapies. Recently, there has been increasing demand for cardiomyocytes (CMCs) for research on cardiovascular disease and toxicology of drug metabolites. To identify specific markers of cardiac lineage during differentiation of stem cells, we sequentially analysed and compared microarray data during differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) toward cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). We here report a new cardiac-specific and cell surface-expressing marker, latrophilin 2 (LPHN2), and demonstrate its functional significance in cardiac differentiation and heart development. LPHN2 expressed selectively on CPCs and CMCs during differentiation of PSCs in vitro, and exclusively in the heart during embryonic development in mice. LPHN2 knockout mice were embryonically-lethal due to severe heart defects, but not vascular defects. When transplanted into the infarcted heart, PSC-derived LPHN2-positive cells differentiated into CMCs and regenerated myocardium, whereas LPHN2-negative cells did not. Our findings provide a valuable tool for isolating cardiomyogenic progenitors and CMCs from PSCs and give insights into heart development and regeneration.

DESIGN
12 samples are analyzed (4 groups, triplicates) and 1 group (piPS cell_0day) is control.
