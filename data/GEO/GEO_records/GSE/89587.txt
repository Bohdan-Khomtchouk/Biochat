TITLE
MicroRNAs expression different in Serum between Trauma-induced  osteonecrosis  of  the  femoral  head (TIONFH) and healing patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We recently showed that microRNA different profile from Trauma-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (TIONFH) and healing patients.

DESIGN
Ten patients in each group had been employed to observe. Serum collected and extract microRNA using reagent kit , then assayed by microassay chip
