TITLE
Microarray gene expression profiling of isolated class I and class IV Drosophila dendritic arborization sensory neurons

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Class I and IV Drosophila dendritic arborization sensory neurons were isolated via magnetic bead sorting and total RNA isolated from the samples was used for gene expression profiling. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms controlling dendrite development is key to understanding the pivotal role these structures play in influencing synaptic integration and neural function.  Despite significant advances in this field, genetic pleiotropy remains a significant impediment to investigating such complex developmental processes.  To circumvent this problem, we have applied class specific neuron transcriptional expression profiling coupled to an in vivo RNAi functional validation screen in order to dissect the molecular bases of Drosophila class I and class IV dendritic arborization (da) neuron dendritogenesis.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of class I and IV da neurons, isolated via magnetic bead sorting (using protocols as described in Iyer et al., 2009), was performed at the third instar larval stage of development from independent cell isolations from 40-50 age-matched third instar larvae expressing mCD8::GFP under the control of either  GAL4ppk.1.9 driver or Gal80ppk; GAL4221. For controls, age matched whole larval homogenate RNA was used.
