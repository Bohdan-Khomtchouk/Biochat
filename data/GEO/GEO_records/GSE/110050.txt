TITLE
PRMT1 and CSNK1a1 control epidermal progenitor maintanence (PRMT1 ChIP-seq data set)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we determine the genome-wide binding sites of PRMT1 in primary human keratinocytes. We also investigated the impact of casein kinase inhibitor D4476 on PRMT1 genomic binding.

DESIGN
HA-PRMT1 was expressed at near endogenous level in primary keratinocytes. Two independent HA antibodies were used for PRMT1 ChIP-seq. The CSNK1a1 inhibitor D4476 was added to keratinocyte culture to characterize the role of CSNK1a1 on controlling PRMT1 genomic binding.
