TITLE
CREB ChIP-chip and HaloCHIP-chip experiments

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Regulation of gene expression is essential for normal development and cellular growth.  Transcriptional events are tightly controlled both spatially and temporally by specific DNA-protein interactions. In this study we finely map the genome-wide targets of the CREB protein across all known and predicted human promoters, and characterize the functional consequences of a subset of these binding events using high-throughput reporter assays.  To measure CREB binding, we used HaloCHIP, an antibody-free alternative to the ChIP method that utilizes the HaloTag fusion protein, and also high-throughput promoter-luciferase reporter assays, which provide rapid and quantitative screening of promoters for transcriptional activation or repression in living cells.

DESIGN
CREB ChIP-chip two biologcal replicates. HaloCHIP-chip three biological replicates with and without Forskolin
