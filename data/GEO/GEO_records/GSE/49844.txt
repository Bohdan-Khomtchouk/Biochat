TITLE
Transcriptomics analysis of gene expression in normal and Smg6 deficient mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from control and Smg6 deficient ES cells using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent by following the company manual. For all samples the RNA integrity was checked using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. All samples showed a RIN (RNA integrity number) of higher than 9. Approximately 2.5 µg of total RNA was then used for library preparation using a TruSeq™ RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.The libraries were sequenced using HiSeq2000 (Illumina) in single-read mode, creating reads with a length of 50 bp. Sequencing chemistry v2 (Illumina) was used and samples were multiplexed in two samples per lane.
