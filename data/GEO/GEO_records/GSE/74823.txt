TITLE
Genome-wide occupancy profiling of Ronin (Thap11) in retinal development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Conditional knockout of the transcription factor Ronin (Thap11) in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) results in a profound failure cell proliferation resulting in a hypoplastic adult retina that also suffers from photoreceptor degeneration.  The goal of this study was to determine the genes that are transcriptionally regulated by Ronin during retinogenesis. P0 wild type retinae (CD-1 background) were pooled ( > 10 each) in ice-cold 1X PBS and immediately processed for chromatin extraction, fragmentation and immunoprecipitation using custom antibodies against Ronin G4275 (Dejosez et al., 2010), G4275 preimmune serum or normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz, sc-2027). The immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were then sequenced using the Ion Torrent PGM system.

DESIGN
Examination of Ronin binding sites throughout the postnatal day 0 (P0) retinal genome.
