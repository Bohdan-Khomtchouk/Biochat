TITLE
Cellular generation of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine by redox-active chemicals via an unprecedent non-enzymatic mechanism

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We proposed that besides TET family dioxygenase oxidizing 5mC to 5hmC, there is a non-enzyme pathway which is due to hydroxyl radica l(OH) or OH-like species also involvement in demethylation of 5mC forming 5hmC. This pathway includes classical fenton reagents such as H2O2 and Fe2+, and more important redox-activity quinoid compounds, especially, tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone (TCBQ), which was reported producing hydroxyl radicals independent of transition metal

DESIGN
Examination of 5hmC and transcriptome levels with TCBQ and DMSO in human MRC-5 cell lines
