TITLE
Expression data from normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cell lines K562 and HL60

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We did microarray to compare the gene expression profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC from normal volunteer) and two leukemic cell lines that is K562 (Chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line), HL60 (Promyelocytic leukemia cell line) in order to find differentially expressed genes in these samples.

DESIGN
We used three RNA samples 1. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from normal volunteer 2. HL60 cell line (This cell line is used to study promyelocytic leukemia) 3. K562 cell line (This cell line is used as a model to study Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia). Total RNA was extracted from normal PBMC, K562 and HL60 and quality was checked by running it on 1.2% formaldehyde agarose. The RNA was used as a starting template to synthesize double-stranded cDNA with random hexamers tagged with T7 promoter sequence. The fragmented DNA was labeled and used for overnight hybridization with Gene ST 1.0 arrays, followed by washing, staining and scanning. The normalized data for the normal PBMC as control was compared with the two cancer cell lines K562 and HL60.
