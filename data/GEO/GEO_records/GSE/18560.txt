TITLE
Deciphering the Wnt-dependent gene signature in colorectal cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray-based gene expression data were generated from RNA from Ls174T colorectal carcinoma cell lines in which Wnt-dependent transcriptional activity can be abrogated by inducible overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Tcf4 or siRNA against β-catenin.

DESIGN
shRNA against β-catenin, or a dominant-negative Tcf4 transgene, were induced in Ls174T cells for 72 or 24 hours, respectively. Uninduced cells were used as a control. Three replicates per condition.
