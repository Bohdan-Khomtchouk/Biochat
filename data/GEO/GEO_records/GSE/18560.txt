TITLE
Deciphering the Wnt-dependent gene signature in colorectal cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray-based gene expression data were generated from RNA from Ls174T colorectal carcinoma cell lines in which Wnt-dependent transcriptional activity can be abrogated by inducible overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Tcf4 or siRNA against Î²-catenin.
