TITLE
MicroRNA expression profile of platelets in sickle cell disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Circulating platelets from Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients express distinct gene expression patterns that regulate function. The objective of this study is to identify a role of post-transcriptional regulation of the platelet transcriptional signaling by microRNAs.

DESIGN
Comparison of microRNA expression in platelets from SCD patients and control subjects, from 2 cohorts-University of Pittsburgh and National Institutes of Health.
