TITLE
Ofd2+/-hypoxia

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe 972h-

SUMMARY
Investigation of mRNA expression level changes in S. pombeOfd2 (SPAP8A3.02c) deletion strain compared to wild-type strain at both normal oxygen (normoxia) and low oxygen (hypoxia) growth conditions.

DESIGN
Four samples in total consisting of two S. pombeyeast strains, wild type (WT) and a gene deleted strain for Ofd2 (SPAP8A3.02c), analysed for gene expression under two growth conditions, normal oxygen (normoxia) and low oxygen (hypoxia). Five micrograms of total RNA from two independent experiments were pooled and mRNA levels were quantified by Roche NimbleGen using the S. pombe 72K array service

PLATFORM
GPL10720 Nimblegen S. pombe 10K
