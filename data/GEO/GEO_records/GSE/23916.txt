TITLE
Diurnal Regulation of Gene Expression in Immature Ear Over a 72-Hour Period

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Background: Plant diurnal rhythms are vital environmental adaptations to coordinate internal physiological responses to alternating day-night cycles.   A comprehensive view of diurnal biology has been lacking for maize (Zea mays), a major world crop. Methodology: A photosynthetic tissue, the leaf, and a non-photosynthetic tissue, the developing ear, were sampled under natural field conditions. Genome-wide transcript profiling was conducted on a high-density 105K Agilent microarray to investigate diurnal rhythms.

DESIGN
The top-most immature ear, 4-5 cm in length, was collected.  Plants were sampled every 4 hours over 3 days. Our sampling times were: 6 am (dawn), 10 am, 2 pm, 6 pm, 10 pm and 2 am. Tissues were collected from three field reps and within each field rep we collected samples from three individual plants
