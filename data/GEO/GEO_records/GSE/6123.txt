TITLE
Amplification and overexpression of E2F3 in human bladder cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that, in human bladder cancer, amplification of the E2F3 gene, located at 6p22, is associated with overexpression of its encoded mRNA transcripts and high levels of expression of E2F3 protein. Immunohistochemical analyses of E2F3 protein levels have established that around one-third (33/101) of primary transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder overexpress nuclear E2F3 protein, with the proportion of tumours containing overexpressed nuclear E2F3 increasing with tumour stage and grade. When considered together with the established role of E2F3 in cell cycle progression, these results suggest that the E2F3 gene represents a candidate bladder cancer oncogene that is activated by DNA amplification and overexpression. Keywords: Tumour vs normal comparison, array CGH

DESIGN
10 samples  - 4 Bladder Cancer Cell lines and 2 Primary Bladder Tumours compared with Male Genomic DNA
