TITLE
miRNA expression profiles of estrogen-dependent and estrogen deprivation-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
A series of MCF-7 variants were previously developed that are estrogen-dependent for growth (MCF-7:WS8 cells), or resistant to estrogen deprivation/vulnerable to fast (MCF-7:5C) and delayed (MCF-7:2A) E2-inducible apoptosis. To identify miRNAs associated with aromatase inhibitor (AI)-resistance and vulnerability to E2-induced apoptosis, estrogen deprivation-resistant 5C and 2A cells were compared to estrogen-dependent WS8 cells and among each other.
