TITLE
Transcriptional changes in the secretome of S. mansoni during early development and in the presence of erythrocytes

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
We have examined the gene expression profile of the transformation of the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni  from the cercarial to schistosomula stages. Specifically cercariae were mechanically transformed and then cultured for 3 hours or 5 days, and then total RNA was isolated and microarray analysis performed. A second experiment compares the effect that the presence of red blood cell in the culturing conditions has over the 3 hour and 5 day periods have on the parasite.
