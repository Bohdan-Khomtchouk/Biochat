TITLE
Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells: control vs. safrole oxide treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Safrole oxide (SFO) at 50 Î¼g/ml could most effectively induce EndoMT within 12 h. Transcriptional profiling of control and SFO-treated Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells was analyzed to understand the underlying molecular mechanism

DESIGN
Two groups were used. One is control group, the other is SFO treatment group. 6 dishes of cells in each group  were used for microarray analysis.
