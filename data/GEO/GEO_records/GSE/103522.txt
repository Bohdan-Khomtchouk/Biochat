TITLE
RNase 7 strongly promotes TLR9-mediated DNA sensing by human plasmacytoid dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We show here that the antimicrobial peptide RNase 7 enables human pDCs to recognize self-DNA, and promotes their rapid sensing of bacterial DNA.

DESIGN
The microarray design is based on a dual-color approach comparing mRNA expression in treated versus untreated cells of one donor, giving rise to one dual-color microarray experiment. A second microarray experiment was performed with samples from a second donor including a dye-swap. In order to enable inspection of intensity values, dual-colour results were integrated into a single-color GEO matrix.
