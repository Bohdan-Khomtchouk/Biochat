TITLE
Altered Epigenetic Regulation of Homeobox Genes in Human Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the molecular changes during OSCC carcinogenesis, we performed unbiased, whole genome deep sequencing (RNA-seq) using RNA isolated from cultured, human TERT-immortalized, non-tumorigenic OKF6-TERT1R and OSCC SCC-9 cells.

DESIGN
OKF6-TERT1R cells and SCC-9 cells were  plated in 10 cm2 tissue culture plates at the density of 2 × 106 cells/plate and treated with 1 μM RA or vehicle (0.1% ethanol) for 48 hours. Experiment includes 3 independent biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
