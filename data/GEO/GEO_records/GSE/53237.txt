TITLE
Gene expression signatures in uteri from nuclear and membrane effects of Estradiol on Estrogen receptor ERα

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further study gene expression regulated by 17b-estradiol in uteri, we have employed whole gene microarray profiling to identify genes specifically regulated by the Estrogen receptor ERα localized either at the plasma membrane or in the nucleus. Two mice models have been used, the mice named ERa-AF2° (named AF2_KO and on C57BL6/J background) in which 7 aminoacids have been deleted in the AF2 domain and the mice C451A-ERa (named MISS_KO and on C57BL6/N background) mutated for the C451 into Ala on ERa. Control littermates were used for each mutant mice respectively name AF2_WT or MISS_WT.

DESIGN
17b-estradiol induced gene expression in  uteri from ovariectomized mice was measured after 6 hours exposure to 0 (PLB) and 8µg/kg of 17b-estradiol (E2) injected subcutaneously in castor oil.
