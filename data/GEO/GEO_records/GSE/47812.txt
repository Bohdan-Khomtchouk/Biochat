TITLE
Gene expression data for rice grain (Oryza sativa L.) aroma performed using bulk pools of aromatic and non-aromatic RILs derived from a cross between Pusa 1121 and Pusa 1342

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile was studied to complement fine mapping studies. Genes co-located in the previously reported three aroma QTLs viz. qaro3.1, qaro4.1 and qaro8.1 were identified. Microarrays were used to study gene expression profile to reduce the number of up- and down regulated genes co-located within the reported aroma QTLs. These genes are the most suitable candidates for further validation studies and development of molecular markers to assist in Marker assisted Breeding for the development of new improved fragrant rice varieties.

DESIGN
Six extreme aromatic RILs and six extreme non-aromatic RILs were identified on the basis of their sensory aroma scores. The RILs were pooled together to make two different bulk groups: aromatic bulk (VA) and non-aromatic bulk (VN). The two parents, Pusa 1121, the aromatic parent (VPA) and Pusa 1342, the non-aromatic parent (VRN) were also taken as two groups. RNA was isolated from fresh leaves  after about 20-25 days of transplanting seedlings into experimental field, stage at which grain aroma develops. Four biological replicates (1-4) for each group were taken making a total of 16 samples.
