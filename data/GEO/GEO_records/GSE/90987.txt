TITLE
RNA-seq of inguinal adipose tissue of mice with selective ablation of Hdac3 in adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Selective ablation of Hdac3 in adipose tissue switches the metabolic signature of white adipose tissue by potentiating oxidative capacity and boosting browning. To investigate the genome-wide consequences of the lack of Hdac3 in adipose tissue, we used RNA-seq to profile the gene expression program of inguinal adipose tissue from mice with selective ablation of Hdac3 in adipose tissue (H3atKO) and their respective control (floxed).

DESIGN
We examined two experimental groups: H3atKO and floxed mice, fed with chow diet (LFD) and maintained in standard housing conditions. For each experimental group we examined 3 RNA sample replicates, each consisting in a pool of RNAs extracted from inguinal adipose tissue of 2/3 mice.
