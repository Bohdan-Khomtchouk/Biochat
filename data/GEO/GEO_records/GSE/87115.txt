TITLE
miRNAs in RPE cells treated by clusterin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clusterin has been indicated to protect human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. This study was conducted to identify aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) downstream clusterin in RPE cells.

DESIGN
RPE cell line D407 were treated with clusterin and cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay. Genome-wide expression analysis of transcriptome and small RNA identified from D407 cells treated with clusterin or not was performed using next generation sequencing, followed by identification of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs as well as gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses. The miRNA-regulated gene expression network was constructed to explore the regulatory role of miRNAs.
