TITLE
Expression data from  human chondrosarcoma cells resistance to ET-743 and PM00104

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ET-743 (trabectedin, Yondelis®) and PM00104 (Zalypsis®) are marine derived compounds that have antitumor activity.  ET-743 and PM00104 exposure over sustained periods of treatment will result in the development of drug resistance, but the mechanisms which lead to resistance are not yet understood.    Human chondrosarcoma cell lines resistant to ET-743 (CS-1/ER) or PM00104 (CS-1/PR) were established in this study.  The CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR exhibited cross resistance to cisplatin and methotrexate but not to doxorubicin.  Human Affymetrix Gene Chip arrays were used to examine relative gene expression in these cell lines.

DESIGN
Three samples CS-1/ER, CS-1/PR and CS-1 were compared.
