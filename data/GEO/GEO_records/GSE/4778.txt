TITLE
Acid-Shifted Time Course of Gene Expression Profiles of Aerobically Grown Escherichia coli K-12

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
The effect of an extracellular acid shift on gene expression profiles of Escherichia coli K-12 W3110 was observed using Affymetrix E. coli arrays. In order to maximize aeration and maintain logarithmic growth, the overnight culture (LBK broth medium) was diluted 500-fold into a 250-ml baffled flask containing 55 ml of 20mM HOMOPIPES buffered medium (pH 7.6). Cultures were grown to OD600=0.2. A shift to acid external pH was conducted by rapid addition of 840 Âµl 1M HCl, which lowered the pH of the medium to pH 5.5. For each of five biological replicates, 10-ml samples were taken at times 0, 1, 5, and 10 min post addition of HCl. Each sample was added to 1 ml 10% phenol-ethanol stop solution in < 5 sec. For each sample, cDNA synthesized from total RNA was hybridized onto Affymetrix E. coli arrays. Model-based gene expression intensities were determined using GCOS software. Gene-by-gene temporal differential expression was analyzed as a mixed-effects model using polynomial time functions as fixed effects and flask variation as a random effect. Keywords: Time Course
