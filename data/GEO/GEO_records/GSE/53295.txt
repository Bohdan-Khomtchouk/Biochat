TITLE
Gene expression of HCT116 cells after stimulation with oncostatin M (OSM)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate gene expression profiles in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) after OSM stimulation, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify relevant genes which are potentially of interest to reveal the role of OSM in intestinal inflammation.  The most strongly up-regulated genes were SERPINS, which belong to the family of serin peptidase inhibitors with antiprotease activities, most of them serine and cysteine proteases. SERPINB4, SERPINB3 and SERPINA3 were the genes with the strongest up-regulation, also verified in qPCR. OSM-induced SERPIN up-regulation may contribute to anti-apoptotic and proliferative effects of OSM in IEC.

DESIGN
HCT116 cells were starved overnight with medium containing 1% FCS after reaching 70% confluency. On the next day, cells were stimulated in quadruplicates with 100 ng/mL OSM or left unstimulated. RNA was isolated 6 hours after stimulation and RNA concentration and purity was measured.
