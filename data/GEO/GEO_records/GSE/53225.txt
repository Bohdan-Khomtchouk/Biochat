TITLE
Expression data from miR-92 over-expressing R26MER/MER mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miR-92 enhances c-Myc induced apoptosis. In the R26MER/MER mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), a switchable variant of Myc, MycERT2, was knocked into the genomic region downstream of the constitutive Rosa26 promoter, allowing acute activation of c-Myc by 4-OHT-induced nuclear translocation. This in vitro system nicely recapitulates c-Myc-induced apoptosis, as activated MycERT2 induces strong p53-dependent apoptosis in response to serum starvation. Enforced miR-92 expression in three independent R26MER/MER MEF lines significantly enhanced Myc-induced apoptosis. We used microarrays to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying miR-92 functions.

DESIGN
Three independent R26MER/MER MEF lines were infected by MSCV vector alone or by MSCV vector encoding miR-92. These MEFs were serum starved and 4-OHT treated to trigger strong Myc-induced apoptosis.
