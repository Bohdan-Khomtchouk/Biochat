TITLE
MicroRNAs related with metastasis in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and their clinical significance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found miRNA expression profiling of uterine cervical squamous cell carcinoma by miRNA microarray and validated the genes as clinical significance of squamous cell carcinoma, especially in metastasis.

DESIGN
MiRNA obtained from uterine cervical squamous cell carcinoma, with (SC38, 38 and 41) or without metastasis (SC34, 35 and 37), compared with normal uterine cervical squamous epithelium (NC2 and 13)
