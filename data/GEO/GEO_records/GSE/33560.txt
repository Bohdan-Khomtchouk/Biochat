TITLE
Expression profiling of Notch constitutive activation in the liver of mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is the active form of the Notch receptor. In this mouse model, NICD is inserted in the Rosa26 locus downstream of a loxP-STOP-LoxP (lsl) sequence and therefore NICD expression is dependant on Cre recombinase expression (Mono transgenic control Rosa26-lsl-NICD) . These mice are crossed with the AFP-Cre strain that expresses Cre in hepatoblasts due to its regulation by the AFP promoter and albumin enhancer (Double transgenic mutant AFP-Cre/Rosa26-lsl-NICD). Newborn mice at day 0 and day 2 are sacrificed and liver RNA samples from control monotransgenic Rosa26-lsl-NICD and from bitransgenic AFP-Cre/Rosa26-lsl-NICD (AFP-NICD) are obtained. Whole genome expression profiling of these samples is submitted.

DESIGN
Five liver samples from Control mice and six liver samples from Mutant mice are analyzed using the Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarray G4122A platform. Array data was preprocessed and analyzed using GenePattern software and R.
