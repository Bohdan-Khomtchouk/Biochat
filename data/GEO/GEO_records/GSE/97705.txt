TITLE
Differential innate immune signaling in macrophages by wild type vaccinia virus and mutant virus deleting A26 protein

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We infected bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) with wild type vaccinia virus Western Reserve (WT-WR) and mutant virus deleting A26 protein (WRΔA26) and analyzed transcriptional profiling of cellular genes at 1, 2, 4 and 8 hours post-infection times (p.i.).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, WT-WR VS WRΔA26 infected BMDM cells at 4 time points. Biological replicates: 3 infection replicates.

PLATFORM
