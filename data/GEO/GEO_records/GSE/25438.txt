TITLE
Gene expression data in murine nasal mucosa following nanoemulsion adjuvant exposure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Antigen uptake, processing, trafficking and presentation in nasal mucosal tissues are regulated by complex intra- and inter-cellular signalling events.  Typical vaccine adjuvants lead to the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which relate to immune induction. We used microarrays to detail the global expression of genes in murine nasal mucosa underlying immune induction with a non-inflammatory nanoemulsion nasal adjuvant.
