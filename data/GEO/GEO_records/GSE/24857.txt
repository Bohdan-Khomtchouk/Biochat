TITLE
Expression analysis of Candida albicans WO-1 grown in glucose or xylose

ORGANISM
Candida albicans WO-1

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Candida albicans WO-1 grown aerobically in xylose, compared to the same strain grown aerobically in glucose.

DESIGN
A six array study using total RNA recovered from three separate cultures of Candida albicans WO-1 grown in glucose and three separate cultures of Candida albicans WO-1 grown in xylose.  Each array measures the expression level of 373,067 probes (average probe length 55.2 +/- 4.0 nt) tiled across the Candida albicans WO-1 genome with a median spacing distance of 31 nt.  During data processing, probes are filtered to include only those probes corresponding to annotated protein-coding genes.
