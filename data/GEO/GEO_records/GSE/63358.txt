TITLE
Expression data from invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in spleen and adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adipose tissue iNKT cells have different functions than iNKT cells in the blood and other organs. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression profiles that might underlie these phenotypic and functional differences in adipose iNKT cells compared to splenic iNKT cells.

DESIGN
We isolated iNKT cells from adipose tissue and spleen from the same C57/B6 mice by cell sorting on a flow cytometer (Facs Aria). We pooled iNKT cells from ~50 together and sent it for Affymetrix microarray analysis through the Immune Genoa Project pipeline.
