TITLE
Highly Recurrent MYD88 Mutations That Promote Human Lymphoma Cell Survival

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The ABC subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains the least curable form of this lymphoma despite recent advances in therapy. We have combined structural and functional genomics to triangulate on new oncogenic mechanisms and devise new therapeutic strategies. RNA interference screen revealed a dependence of ABC DLBCL cell lines on MYD88 and IRAK1. High throughput resequencing of RNA (RNA-Seq) revealed frequent somatic mutations in MYD88 that preferentially occurred in the ABC DLBCL subtype. Remarkably, one third of ABC DLBCL tumor samples harbored the same amino acid substitution, L265P, in the MYD88 TIR domain at an evolutionarily invariant residue in its hydrophobic core. This mutation was rare or absent in two other DLBCL subtypes, but was observed in 9% of MALT lymphomas. At a lower frequency, multiple other mutations were observed in the MYD88 TIR domain, occurring in both the ABC and GCB subtypes of DLBCL. Survival of ABC DLBCL lines bearing the L265P mutation was sustained by the mutant but not wild type MYD88 isoform, demonstrating that this MYD88 mutant is oncogenic and gain-of-function. The MYD88 L265P mutant assembled a protein complex that spontaneous triggers the phosphorylation of IRAK1, leading to NF-kB signaling, secretion of the cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and interferon-b, and JAK kinase signaling. These findings demonstrate that the MYD88 signaling pathway is integral to the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL, providing a genetic rationale for therapeutic targeting of the MYD88 signaling pathway in this lymphoma subtype.

DESIGN
To generate a gene expression signature of MYD88 signaling in ABC DLBCL, the HBL-1 cell line was transduced with retroviral vectors expressing either shMYD88-4 or shMYD88-7. Following puromycin selection, shRNA expression was induced for 24 or 48 hours and gene expression was measured, comparing uninduced (Cy3) to induced (Cy5) cells, using genome-wide Agilent 4x44K oligonucleotide microarrays. A signature of NF-kB signaling in ABC DLBCL was generated by treating HBL-1 cells with the IkB kinase beta inhibitor MLN120B for 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 16h, and 24h (Cy5), and comparing their gene expression to untreated cells (Cy3). A signature of JAK signaling in ABC DLBCL was generated by treating HBL-1 cells with JAK inhibitor I (5 micromolar; Calbiochem) for 2h, 4h, 6h, and 8h (Cy5) and comparing their gene expression to vehicle-treated cells (DMSO, Cy3). RNA-Seq data not provided.
