TITLE
Mouse Models of Alveolar/Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma & Spindle Cell Sarcomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A series of conditional mouse models of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and spindle cell sarcoma were generated and validated for relavence to corresponding human cancers.

DESIGN
Conditional mouse models of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and spindle cell sarcoma were created by activation or deletion of Pax3:Fkhr, p53, Ptch1 or Rb1 genes.
