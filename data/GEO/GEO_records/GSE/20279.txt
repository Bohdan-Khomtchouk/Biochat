TITLE
Blumeria graminis fsp hordei effects on translation initiation in compatible and incompatible barley

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to examine the effects of Blumeria gramins f. sp. hordei (Bgh) on the host process of translation initiation in both incompatible and compatible interactions with Hordeum vulgare. This was done by using Bgh isolate 5874 (AVRa6) on the resistant host CI 16151 (Mla6) and fast-neutron derived, loss-of-function mutant m9472 (mla6). Plants were grown 7 days in the greenhouse and then inoculated or non-inoculated and transferred to an 18Â°C growth chamber with an 8 hr dark, 16 hr light photoperiod. At 32 hours after infection the tissue was harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. From the same tissue, total RNA was isolated using a Trizol method, while polysomal RNA was isolated by sucrose density centrifugation. Three biological replications were conducted.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Jackson Moeller.
