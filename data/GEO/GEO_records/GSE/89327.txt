TITLE
Expression data from Tnrc6a (GW182) mutant E18.5 lungs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GW182 (Tnrc6a) is a key component of RISC (miRNA-Induced Silencing Complex) that plays a critical role in miRNA-mediated gene silencing. Here, we show that GW182 is expressed in airway multiciliated cells (MCCs), and that gene-trap disruption of GW182 leads to defective multicilia formation and downregulation of broad miRNA targets To investigate roles of GW182 in  airway multiciliated cells (MCCc), we assessed changes in mRNA expression in E18.5 Tnrc6a mutant lungs using microarrays (Affymetrix).

DESIGN
E18.5 lung of wild type littermates and GW182gt/gt embryos were collected for total RNA isolation using Trizol (Invitrogen). RNAs were purified according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol before subjected to  Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Whole Genome Array (Affymetrix) for  mRNA expression profiling. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Differentially expressed mRNAs were identified using a two-sample t-test (P < 0.05 considered significant).
