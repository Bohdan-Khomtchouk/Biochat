TITLE
Total transcriptome profiling of the Atclb1-1 loss of function mutant and wild type of Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Since AtCLB act as a negative regulator of abiotic stress response, we asked the question as to what additional factors might be contributing towards stress tolerance in Atclb1-1 loss of function mutants. One approach to find answers to this question would be to see which pathways or genes are being affected in mutant plants due to the disruption of AtCLB gene function. To achieve this, we sought a global transcriptome profiling of the mutant plant in comparison to its wild type counterpart.

DESIGN
We analyzed the Atclb1-1 loss of function mutant and wild type Arabidopsis transcriptomes by RNA sequencing in an Illumina genome analyzer platform. From the analysis, we grouped all differentially expressed genes into various functional categories based on their biological process, molecular function and cellular component

PLATFORM
GPL11221 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Arabidopsis thaliana)
