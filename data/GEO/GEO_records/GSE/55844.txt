TITLE
Gene expression in FIH-1 silenced human nucleus pulposus cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate the effect of Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha inhibitor (HIF-1) in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells, human NP cells were lentivirally transduced with either control or FIH-1 targeted shRNA. Gene expression changes between samples from control and FIH-1 silenced cells were evaluated using a microarray.

DESIGN
Primary NP cells were isolated from human discs and grown in culture. Cells were transduced with either control or FIH-1 targeting shRNA constructs. Silencing of FIH-1 was confirmed for each set using qRT-PCR and Western blot. Total RNA from NP cells was used for RNA extraction and hybridization on the Affymetrix microarray. Control samples: C1, C2, and C3 and FIH-1-silenced samples: E1, E2, and E3.
