TITLE
Gene expression of ultra violet irradiation of silk worm Bombyx mori larvae

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
3 day of fifth instar larvae were treated with ultra-violet (UV) rays using UVL-56 (1350Î¼W/cm2, UVP) for 6 and 12 hours (29.2 and 58.32 J/cm2). Since, larvae of each group rare on artificial diet for 24 hour and dissected fatbody. We examined gene expression profile in these groups.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in 3 day of fifth instar larvae of ultra violet irradiation.
