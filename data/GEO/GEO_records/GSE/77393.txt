TITLE
EphA4 is Involved in Sleep Regulation But Not in the Electrophysiological Response to Sleep Deprivation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we investigated the role of EphA4 in the molecular response to sleep deprivation by measuring forebrain gene expression in EphA4 KO mice. More precisely, we measured the effect of the mutation and of a 6-h sleep deprivation on genome-wide forebrain gene expression using microarray.

DESIGN
Molecular response of EphA4 knockout (KO) mice and littermates were studied under a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle, under undisturbed conditions or 6 h sleep deprivation (SD) by using a Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) *** WARNING : The Sample data tables report incomplete data.***
