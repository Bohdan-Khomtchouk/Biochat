TITLE
Somatic copy number variation profiling in matched brain and extracranial metastases of melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of brain metastases, one of the most common and devastating complications of advanced melanoma, may identify and prioritize rational therapeutic approaches for this disease. In particular, the identification of molecular differences between brain and extracranial metastases would support the need for the development of organ-specific therapeutic approaches. Hotspot mutations, copy number variations (CNV), global mRNA expression patterns, and protein expression and activation, quantitatively analyzed by mass-array genotyping, molecular inversion probe arrays, microarrays and reverse phase protein array (RPPA) were evaluated in pairs of melanoma brain metastases and extracranial metastases from patients who had undergone surgical resection for both types of tumors.

DESIGN
Somatic copy number variation (CNV) in 47 melanoma brain metastases (BM, except for patient 01, who had a spinal cord metastasis) and extracranial metastases (EM) were analyzed by molecular inversion probe (MIP) array (Affymetrix OncoScan FFPE Express 2.0). DNA were extracted from regions with > 70% viable tumor cells from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Of the 47 tumor samples, 22 were matched BM and EM from the same patients. In addition, 24 DNA samples from normal tissues were included as diploid controls.
