TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation in cervical tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify new candidate genes that are differentially methylated in squamous cell carcinoma compared to the DNA samples from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) and normal cervical scrapes. The Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip method identifies genome-wide DNA methylation changes in CpG islands, CpG shores and shelves.

DESIGN
In this study 20 normal cervical samples (HPV negative), 18 samples with CIN3 lesions (HPV positive) and 6 cervical cancer tissues (HPV positive) were included.
