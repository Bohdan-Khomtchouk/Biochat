TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human adipose-derived stem cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional activity was identified in all categories of genes expressed by ADSC, including collagens, ECM and basement membrane constituents, adhesion molecules involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and proteases involved in degradation of the ECM and their inhibitors. Importantly, it was observed that ADSC synthesize and secrete all three collagen VI chains, suggesting suitability of ADSC for collagen VI congenital muscular dytrophy treatment.

DESIGN
We developed a procedure for isolation of human stem cells from adipose layer of neonatal foreskin skin. The adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) were examined for expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) and related genes using gene expression array analysis.
