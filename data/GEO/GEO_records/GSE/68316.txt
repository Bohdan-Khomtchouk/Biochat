TITLE
Microarray Profiling of Long Non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Associated with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Approximately 1426 lncRNAs (965 up-regulated and 461 down-regulated) and 1715 mRNAs (896 up-regulated and 819 down-regulated) were aberrantly expressed in HCM patients with fold change > 2.0

DESIGN
Myocardial tissues were obtained from 7 HCM patients and 5 disease-free individuals, and lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles were analyzed using the CapitalBio Human LncRNA Microarray v2.0.

PLATFORM
GPL20113 CapitalBio Human LncRNA Microarray v2.0
