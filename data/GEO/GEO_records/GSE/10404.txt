TITLE
Embryonic stem cells differentiated into embryoid bodies. vs cells grown in regular growth conditions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Embryonic stem cells differentiated into embryoid bodies. Their expression pattern will be compared to that of the same cells grown in regular growth conditions. A study of the differential gene expression of these two populations should reveal genes whose expression is necessary for the maintenance of the stem cell phenotype. Keywords: other
