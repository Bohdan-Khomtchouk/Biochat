TITLE
ChIP-chip of Hmt1-9myc from S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
A comprehensive genome-wide binding profile for Hmt1 was obtained through the method of ChIP-chip using NimbleGen high-resolution tiling microarrays.  Of the approximately 1000 Hmt1-binding sites found, the majority fall within or proximal to an ORF.  However, Hmt1 occupancy is found at a number of other genomic features such as tRNA and snoRNA genes, thereby implicating a regulatory role in the biogenesis of these non-coding RNAs.  RNA hybridization analysis shows that Hmt1 loss-of-function mutants display higher steady-state tRNA abundance relative to the wild-type.  Co-immunoprecipitation studies show that Hmt1 interacts with the TFIIIB component Bdp1, suggesting a role for Hmt1 in modulating RNA pol III transcription to regulate tRNA production.
