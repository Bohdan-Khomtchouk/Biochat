TITLE
Human cerebellum, frontal cortex [BA4, BA9] and caudate nucleus HD tissue experiment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Post mortem human brain tissue comparison between HD patients and controls from 3 brain regions - cerebellum, frontal cortex [BA4, BA9] and caudate nucleus.  Gene expression analysed using linear models from LIMMA package in Bioconductor suite. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Large sample sizes were used to examine brain tissue gene expression at various stages of HD pathology.  Three brain regions were profiled, compared and analysed for differential gene expression.  The broad aim was to capture early stage gene expression changes in HD brains.
