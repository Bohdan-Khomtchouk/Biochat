TITLE
Response of swine lung to H1N1 swine influenza virus infection revealed by transcription analysis

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
As a mild, highly contagious, respiratory disease, swine influenza always damages the innate immune systems, and increases susceptibility to secondary infections which results in considerable morbidity and mortality in pigs. Nevertheless, the systematical host response of pigs to swine influenza virus infection remains largely unknown. To explore these, a time-course gene expression profiling was performed to detect comprehensive analysis of the global host response induced by H1N1 swine influenza virus in pigs.

DESIGN
At the age of day 35, 15 pigs were randomly allocated to the non-infected group and 15 to the infected group. Each piglet of the infected group was intranasaly challenged with A/swine/Hubei/101/2009(H1N1) strain and Each piglet of the non-infected group was treated similarly with an identical volume of PBS as control.
