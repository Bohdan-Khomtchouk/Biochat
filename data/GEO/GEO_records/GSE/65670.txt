TITLE
G-CSF mobilizes CD34+ regulatory monocytes that inhibit Graft-versus-Host Disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Administration of G-CSF mobilizes a unique population of CD11b+Ly6C+CD34+mature monocytes that can inhibit GVHD in murine models of BMT via an iNOS-dependent mechanism.  The transcriptional profiles of flow sorted lineage-CD11b+CD34+ cells from G-CSF treated mice were compared with conventional splenic Ly6C+ and Ly6C- monocytes, progenitor cells and cultured myeloid-derived suppressor cells.  Further comparisons were made with lineage-CD11b+CD34+ cells from G-CSF treated mice that had been grown in culture or that were derived from iNOS ko mice. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying diffrenetiation of each of these cell types

DESIGN
Lin-CD11b+CD34+ populations were isolated directly from the spleens of G-CSF-treated C57BL/6 mice or iNOS ko mice.  In untreated C57BL/6 mice, Lin-CD11b+CD115+Ly6C+ and Lin-CD11b+CD115+Ly6C- monocytes were isolated from the spleen and Lin-CD117+CD115+CD135-Ly6C+CD11b- common monocyte progenitors were isolated from the bone marrow.  Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Ly6C+CD11b+ cells derived from G-CSF, GM-CSF and IL-13 cultured C57BL/6 bone marrow) were also isolated and compared with the above populations.  Lin-CD11b+CD34+ spleen cells derived from G-CSF-treated C57BL/6 mice were cultured for 3 days in Flt3 ligand and SCF and then compared to the original input population.
