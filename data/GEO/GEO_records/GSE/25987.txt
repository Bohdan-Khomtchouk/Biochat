TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Hodgkin lymphoma cell line KMH2: Comparison of CIITA-BX648577 knockdown cultures with non-silencing controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Description of differentially expressed genes between KMH2 CIITA-BX648577 knockdown cultures and non-silencing controls

DESIGN
To determine the change in gene expression after siRNA interference with the fusion transcript CIITA-BX 648577 identified in KMH2 cells.
