TITLE
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) sequencing of messenger RNAs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with and without knockdown of FTO

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify potential mRNA targets of FTO whose m6A levels are influenced in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, we conducted m6A-seq for mRNA isolated from MA9.3ITD cells with and without knockdown of FTO

DESIGN
We lentivirally transduced pLKO.1-shFTO (i.e., shFTO) or pLKO.1 empty vertor (i.e., shNS) into human MA9.3ITD (human CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenetor cells stably infected by MLL-AF9 and FLT3-ITD) AML cells and then selected positively infected cells under selection of puromuycin (0.5ug/ml). Two stable lines including one FTO-knockdown cell line (i.e., shFTO) and one control line (i.e., shNS) were selected for genome-wide m6A-sequencing (m6A-Seq) assays. The m6A-seq procedure was performed as detailed in Dominissiniâ€™s method (Dominissini D., et al. Nat Protocols. 2013; 8: 176-189.). Polyadenylated RNA was extracted using FastTrack MAG Maxi mRNA isolation kit (Life technology). RNA fragmentation Reagents (Ambion) was used to randomly fragment RNA. M6A antibody (Synaptic Systems) was applied for m6A pull down. And final library preparation was constructed by TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). Final library was quantified by BioAnalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip then deeply sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500.
