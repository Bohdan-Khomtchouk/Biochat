TITLE
Regulation of alkaloid biosynthesis by miRNAs in opium poppy

ORGANISM
Papaver somniferum

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are ~21 nucleotide long, small endogenous non-coding RNAs that functioning in regulation of gene expression found in many eukaryotes. In this study, small RNA libraries of opium poppy from four different tissues (leaf, root, capsule, stem) were sequenced using high-throughput next generation Illumina sequencing (Solexa) technology to investigate potential mode of actions of miRNAs in alkaloid biosynthesis. A total of 27 opium poppy miRNAs which have roles in regulation of alkaloid biosynthesis were identified in this study.

DESIGN
A six chip study using miRNA isolated from four separate tissues (capsule, leaf, stem, root). small RNA libraries of opium poppy tissues were sequenced using high-throughput next generation Illumina sequencing (Solexa) technology to investigate potential mode of actions of miRNAs in alkaloid biosynthesis.  Furthermore, the novel opium poppy miRNAs were also confirmed by a direct small RNA cloning strategy. The microarray platform were performed to measure and analyze the mirnome of the different opium poppy tissues.
