TITLE
Expression data from wildtype adult Drosophila males and females

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Wild-type laboratory strains of model organisms are typically kept in isolation for many years, with the action of genetic drift and selection on mutational variation causing lineages to diverge with time.  Natural populations from which such strains are established, show that gender-specific interactions in particular drive many aspects of sequence level and transcriptional level variation.  Here, our goal was to identify genes that display transcriptional variation between laboratory strains of Drosophila melanogaster, and to explore evidence of gender-biased interactions underlying that variability. Keywords: expression analysis; gender and genotype effects
