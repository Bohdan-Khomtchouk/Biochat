TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of copper-stressed Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Anthropogenic pollution has increased the levels of heavy metals in the environment.  Bacterial populations continue to thrive in highly polluted environments and bacteria must have mechanisms to counter heavy metal stress.  We chose to examine the response of the environmentally-relevant organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa to two different copper treatments.  A short, 45 min exposure to copper was done in the Cu shock treatment to examine the immediate transcriptional profile to Cu stress.  The Cu adapted treatment was designed to view the transcriptional profile of cells that were actively growing in the presence of Cu. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
We analyzed 2 biological replicates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exposed to a 45 min Cu shock as compared to a control that was exposed to HCl to bring the pH to similar levels.  We analyzed 2 biological replicates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were grown in the presence of Cu for approx. 6h (Cu adapted) as compared to an untreated control.
