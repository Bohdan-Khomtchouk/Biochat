TITLE
Nitrosative stress response in uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC)

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli CFT073

SUMMARY
A strain of UPEC CFT073 lacking the three known NO detoxifiaction mechanisms, Hmp, FlRd and Nrf is used to study the global effect of NO on the pathogen

DESIGN
Cultures were anaerobically grown in triplicates under two conditions: Without nitrosative stress or with nitrosative stress, induced by anaerobic growth on nitrate. RNA was extracted from the samples and following rRNA depletion, samples were analyzed by RNA-seq for genome wide transcriptional differences.
