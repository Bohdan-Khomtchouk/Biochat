TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of mouse RNA secondary structures reveals key features of the mammalian transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By using a novel high-throughput method, named chemical inference of RNA structures (CIRS-seq), that uses dimethyl sulfate (DMS), and N-cyclohexyl-N'-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate (CMCT) to modify RNA residues in single-stranded conformation within native RNA secondary structures, we investigated the structural features of mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) transcripts.  Our analysis revealed an unexpected higher structuring of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) compared to the coding regions, a reduced structuring at the Kozak sequence and stop codon, and a three-nucleotide periodicity across the coding region of messenger RNAs. We also observed that ncRNAs exhibit a higher degree of structuring with respect to protein coding transcripts. Moreover, we found that the Lin28a binding protein binds selectively to RNA motifs with a strong preference toward a single stranded conformation.
