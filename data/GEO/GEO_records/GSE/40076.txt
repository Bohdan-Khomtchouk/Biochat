TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis roots and shoots grown with or without iron

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Iron-deficiency repsonses in Arabidopsis are controlled by several bHLH transcription factors.  FIT, for example has been shown to direct iron-uptake responses.  However, the role of shoot and root expressed genes bHLH100 and bHLH101 has not be clarified.  We used microarray to study what genes might be miss-regulated in the double mutant bhlh100/bhlh101 background

DESIGN
10-day-old Arabidopsis plants were divided into root and shoot tissues and harvested for RNA extraction.
