TITLE
Gene atlasing of digestive and reproductive tissues in Schistosoma mansoni

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
This study provides a detailed transcriptomic analysis of the reproductive tissues (ovary, vitelline and testes) and gastrodermis S. mansoni. The results obtained will help direct future research on the functional aspects of these specific tissues, and will allow the characterisation of currently unannotated genes in S. mansoni

DESIGN
Quantification of gene expression within specific, biologically important tissues of S. mansoni was achieved by a combination of laser microdissection microscopy (LMM) and oligonucleotide microarray analysis. We compared the gene expression profile of the adult female gastrodermis and male and female reproductive tissues with whole worm controls. This is complemented by a set of data from macrodissected samples from different regions of the worm.
