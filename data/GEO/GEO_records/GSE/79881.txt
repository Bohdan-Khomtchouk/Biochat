TITLE
Auxin signaling in the epidermis regulates stem growth via interactions with the brassinosteroid pathway

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana ; Brassica rapa

SUMMARY
Growth of a complex multicellular organism requires coordinated changes in diverse cell types.  These cellular changes generate organs of the correct size, shape and functionality.  During plant development, the growth hormone auxin induces stem elongation; however, which cell types of the stem perceive the auxin signal and contribute to organ growth is poorly understood.  Here, we show that auxin signalling is required in many cell types for correct hypocotyl stem growth, with a key role for the epidermis.  Combining genetic manipulations in Arabidopsis thaliana with transcriptional profiling of the hypocotyl epidermis from Brassica rapa, we show that auxin functions in the epidermis in part by inducing activity of the locally-acting, growth-promoting brassinosteroid pathway.  Our findings clarify cell-specific auxin function in the hypocotyl, and highlight the complexity of cell-type interactions within a growing organ.

DESIGN
We performed whole-genome transcriptome (mRNA-Seq) on 5 d-old W light-grown Arabidopsis thaliana plants (CER6pro > > axr3-1::mCit experimental plants and UAS::axr3-1::mCit hemizygous control plants; whole-seedling tissue) treated for 4 h W light or low R:FR shade. In addition, we performed mRNA-Seq on 4 d-old Brassica rapa plants (FPsc strain) treated for 9 h W light or shade. Brassica tissues collected were hypocotyl epidermal peels or whole hypocotyls.
