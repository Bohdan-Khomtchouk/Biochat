TITLE
Native Elongating Transcript sequencing (NET-seq) in wild-type and three members of the CAF-I complex

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We performed a fluorescent reporter based screen to identify factors determining transcriptional directionality from bidirectional promoters that give rise to a coding and a non-coding transcript. Promoters like these are most frequent in many organisms and non-coding transcription from this origin represents a large fraction of total long non-coding transcripts. We applied NET-seq to compare nascent transcription in yeast wild-type and mutations in the three members of the CAF-I complex. This technique avoids the technical issue of co-transcriptional RNA degradation and is a powerful approach to address questions concerning non-coding transcription. We find divergent non-coding transcription to be elevated in CAF-I mutants.

DESIGN
One condition, yeast grown in YPD media to mid-log phase. 8 NET-seq libraries are deposited, 2 biological repeats of the wild-type and two biological repeast each of the CAF-I complex member mutants (CAC1, CAC2, CAC3).
