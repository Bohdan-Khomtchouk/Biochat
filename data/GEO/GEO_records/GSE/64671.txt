TITLE
Genome-wide identification of Bacillus subtilis Zur-binding sites.

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
The transcriptional factor Zur plays a key role in regulating zinc homeostasis in Bacillus subtilis. The genomic sites bound by Zur were mapped using a chromatine immunoprecipitation approach. This allowed the identification of 80 inter- and intragenic chromosomal sites bound by Zur.

DESIGN
This data set contains 2 samples. Immunoprecipitated (IP) DNA from Bacillus subtilis BSAS36 strain (BSB1, a tryptophan-prototrophic derivative 168 strain expressing a SPA-tagged Zur protein) were extracted from bacterial cells in the exponential growth phase. IP and whole-cell extract DNA were hybridized on tiling array to generate ChIP-on-chip profiles. Two biological replicates were anlyzed.
