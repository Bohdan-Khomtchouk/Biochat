TITLE
Intralipid protects the heart in late pregnancy against ischemia/reperfusion injury

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The heart of late pregnant (LP) rodents is more prone to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury compared to non-pregnant rodents. We hypothesized that Intralipid (ITLD) protects the heart in LP rodents against I/R injury.  We performed genome-wide expression profiling to identify the underlying mechanisms.

DESIGN
Female LP rat hearts were subjected to ischemia followed by reperfusion with vehicle or ITLD (one bolus of 5mg/kg).
