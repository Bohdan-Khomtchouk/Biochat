TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of E17.5 pituitary gland gene expression of control and Insm1 mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Insm1 gene encodes a zinc finger factor expressed in many endocrine organs. We show here that Insm1 is required for differentiation of all endocrine cell types in the pituitary. Thus, in Insm1 mutant mice, hormones characteristic of the different pituitary cell types (thyroid, follicle and melanocyte stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotrope hormone, growth hormone and prolactin) are absent or produced at markedly reduced levels. The differentiation deficit is accompanied by an up-regulated expression of components of the Notch signaling pathway. Further, skeletal muscle-specific genes are ectopically expressed, indicating that Insm1 blocks a muscle-specific expression program. Since Insm1 is also essential for differentiation of endocrine cells in the pancreas, intestine and adrenal gland, it is emerging as a transcription factor that acts in a pan-endocrine manner. The Insm1 factor contains a SNAG domain at its N-terminus, and we show here that the SNAG domain recruits histone modifying factors (Kdm1a, Hdac1/2 and Rcor1-3) and other proteins implicated in transcriptional regulation (Hmg20a/b and Gse1). Deletion of the SNAG domain in mice disrupted differentiation of pituitary endocrine cells, and resulted in an upregulated expression of components of the Notch signaling pathway and ectopic expression of skeletal muscle-specific genes. Our work demonstrates that Insm1 acts in the transcriptional network that controls differentiation of endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary gland, and requires the SNAG domain to exert this function in vivo.

DESIGN
Analysis of genes regulated by Insm1 in embryonic day 17.5 pituitary gland. Total RNA from pituitary glands of E17.5 control embryos was compared to E17.5 Insm1 mutant embryos.
