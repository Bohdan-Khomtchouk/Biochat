TITLE
Temporal gene expression profiling of murine epididymal adipose with different diet regimens [epididymal adipose]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the present study, we used C57BL/6J mouse, as a model for studying diet-induced diabetes and obesity, since this strain accumulates adipose tissue mass, insulin resistance, hyper-insulinemia, and hyper-lipidemia similar to humans fed on an high-fat high-sugar diet (HFHSD).

DESIGN
This dataset consists of gene expression changes in epididymal adipose. It consists of three biological replicates for the low-fat control diet (LFC), high-fat diet (HFC), and three different doses (5 µg, 20µg and 75 µg) of ethano-botanical formulation Kal-1 with HFC diet.

PLATFORM
