TITLE
Genome Wide Expression of Mammary Epithelial Populations in Slug (SNAI2) WT vs Slug Null Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment shows differential expression of genes in the luminal, basal and stromal subpopulations from SNAI2+/+ and SNAI2 LacZ/LacZ mammary epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Luminal, basal and stromal populations were sorted from SNAI2+/+ and SNAI2 LacZ/LacZ mammary epithelial cells based on expression of CD49f and Epcam.
