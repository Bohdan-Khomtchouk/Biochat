TITLE
cTag-PAPERCLIP Reveals Alternative Polyadenylation Promotes Cell-Type Specific Protein Diversity and Shifts Araf Isoforms with Microglia Activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is increasingly recognized to regulate gene expression across different cell-types, but obtaining APA maps from individual cell-types typically requires prior purification, a stressful procedure that can itself alter cellular states. Here, we describe a new platform, cTag-PAPERCLIP, that generates APA profiles from single cell populations in intact tissues; cTag-PAPERCLIP requires no tissue dissociation and preserves transcripts in native states. Applying cTag-PAPERCLIP to profile four major cell-types in the mouse brain revealed common APA preferences between excitatory and inhibitory neurons distinct from astrocytes and microglia, regulated in part by neuron-specific RNA-binding proteins NOVA2 and PTBP2. We further identified a role of APA in switching Araf protein isoforms during microglia activation, impacting production of downstream inflammatory cytokines.  Our results demonstrate the broad applicability of cTag-PAPERCLIP and a previously undiscovered role of APA in contributing to protein diversity between different cell-types and cellular states within the brain.

DESIGN
Samples GSM2467568-GSM2467582: cTag-PAPERCLIP libraries were generated from brain or liver samples of different mouse strains. Samples GSM2683273-GSM2683281: RNA-seq libraries were generated from isolated mouse brain microglia or dissected mouse embryonic brain cortex.
