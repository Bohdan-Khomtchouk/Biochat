TITLE
Identification of IL4 dependent genes involved in reinforcement stage of Th2 differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T helper cells differentiate to many different subclasses depending upon the stimulus and the microenvironment where the cells were stimlated. IL4 is known to polarize the cells towards Th2 differentiation pathway. In this study we aim to identify IL4 dependent genes during late stage of Th2 differentiation.

DESIGN
There are in all 10 samples, two replicates of each 5. Two samples, namely U_1 and U_2 (replicates of one) are control. Cells have been cultured for either five days or six days. For each of these, we have two groups, one where we add IL4 and IL4R neutralizing antibodies either on days 3 and 4 (For five day culture) [D5ABS_1 and D5ABS_2] or on days 3,4 and 5 (For six day culture) [D6ABS_1 and D6ABS_2] and next where we don't add neutralizing antibodies [D5_1 & D5_2 and D6_1 & D6_2].
