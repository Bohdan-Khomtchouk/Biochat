TITLE
In vitro knockdown of LAMP3 leads to down-regulation of  interferon-inducible genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified LAMP3 as a key driver gene of anti-viral subnetwork genes in cervical cancer patients. Therefore we tested this prediction using an in vitro system. This is the first direct demonstration of LAMP3 regulatory role in interferon-dependent immune response.

DESIGN
We first pretreated HeLa cells with control siRNA or LAMP3 siRNA overnight and then added 1 ng/ml of interferon alpha to the cultures for 3 and 4 days
