TITLE
Gene expression signatures following nerve injury in a rat model (0.5h-9h)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to distinguish the gene expression differences among different time points after injury

DESIGN
We generated L4-6 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) tissues (0.5cm) at 0.5h, 3h, 6h and 9h after sciatic nerve resection

PLATFORM
GPL4135 Agilent-014879 Whole Rat Genome Microarray 4x44K G4131F (Feature Number version)
