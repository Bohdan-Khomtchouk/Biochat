TITLE
Cbx8 acts non-canonically with Wdr5 to promote mammary tumorigenesis [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we found that Cbx8 knockdown in MMTV-Myc and MDA-MB-231-Luc cells reduces H3K4me3 mark on Notch-network genes

DESIGN
Mononucleosomes from MMTV-Myc and MDA-MB-231-Luc cells were isolated and ChIP with H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac antibodies. DNA from Input and ChIP samples was purified and sequenced on Illumina Hiseq.
