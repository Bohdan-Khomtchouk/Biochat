TITLE
SOX11 Gene Expression Profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The neural transcription factor SOX11 is overexpressed in aggressive lymphoid neoplasms mainly in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), but its functional role in malignant B-cells is unknown. To identify target genes transcriptionally regulated by SOX11 in malignant lymphoid cells, we have used Gene Expression Profiling (GEP) after SOX11 silencing in MCL cell lines.

DESIGN
Differential gene expression between Z138-shSOX11 and Z138-shControl MCL cell lines. To determine the transcriptional programs regulated by SOX11, we first generated an MCL cellular model with reduced SOX11 protein levels by infecting MCL cell lines with lentiviral particles carrying shRNA plasmids specifically targeting SOX11 (shSOX11.1 and shSOX11.3). Next, we compared the GEP of shSOX11 and shControl Z138 stable transduced clones using the Affymetrix U133+2.0 microarrays.
