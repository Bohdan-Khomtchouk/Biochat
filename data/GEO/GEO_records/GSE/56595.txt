TITLE
Significance of SALL4 as a drug resistant factor in lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the mechanism by which SALL4 regulates drug sensitivity, approximately 65,000 molecules on a microarray chip were analyzed using lung cancer cells transduced with a SALL4 vector (pCMV6-SALL4) or a control vector (pCMV6-Mock) .

DESIGN
SALL4 mRNA and protein expression markedly increased after 24 hr of SALL4 vector transduction, unlike that in the cells transduced with the control vector; these cells were used for microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
