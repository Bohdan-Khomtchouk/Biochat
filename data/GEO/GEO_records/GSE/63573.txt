TITLE
Transcription factor Runx1 cooperates with MyoD and c-Jun to regulate the balance of myoblast proliferation/differentiation [ATAC-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Runx1 is expressed in regenrating muscle, specifically in the muscle adult stem cells- the satellite cells. Its exact role and target genes were yet to be identified. We report here the genome wide open chromatin paatern, as established by ATAC-seq

DESIGN
Examination ofgenome wide pattern  naked and therefore trhansposase accecible genomic DNA in primary myoblasts (PM)

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
