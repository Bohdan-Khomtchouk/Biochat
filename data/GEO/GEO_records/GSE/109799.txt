TITLE
Expression profile of miRNAs in PBMCs infected with PPRV in goat

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
Using high-throughput technology, we aim to identify the expression of miRNAs  for understanding the pathogenesis of PPR.

DESIGN
PBMCs were collected after 9 day post infection of  Izatnagar94  PPRV virulent virus infection to identify the global gene expression changes vis - a - vis the control

PLATFORM
GPL21299 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Capra hircus)
