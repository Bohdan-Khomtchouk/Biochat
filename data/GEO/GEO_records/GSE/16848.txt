TITLE
TIME-COURSE GENE EXPRESSION OF Metharizium anisopliae GROWING IN PLANT ROOT EXUDATE

ORGANISM
Metarhizium anisopliae

SUMMARY
The presence of genetic groups of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae in soil is shaped by its adaptability to specific soil and habitat types, and by soil insect populations.  Although the entomopathogenic life style of this fungus is well studied, its saprophytic life style has received little consideration. While a set of functionally related genes can be commonly expressed for the adaptability of this fungus to different environments (insect cuticle, insect blood and root exudates), a different subset of genes is also expected for each environment. In order to increase the knowledge of the potential use of M. anisopliae as a rhizosphere competent organism, in this study we evaluated the genetic expression of this fungus while growing on plant root exudates in laboratory conditions during a time course.

DESIGN
One fungal strain: Metarhizium anisopliae ARSEF 2575; Five time conditions: 0h, 1h, 4h, 8h, 12h; Five-condition experiment: Time0h vs. Time1h, Time1h vs. Time4h, Time4h vs. Time8h, Time8h vs. Time12h and Time12h vs. Time0h. Two Biological replicates: independently grown and harvested. Three replicates per array. Dye-swap was performed on replicate 2.
