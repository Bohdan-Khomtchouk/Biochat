TITLE
Towards understanding breast cancer mechanisms to metastasize

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
How organ-specific metastatic traits accumulate in primary tumors remains unknown. We identified a role of the primary tumor stroma in selecting breast cancer cells that are primed for metastasis in the bone. A fibroblast-rich stroma in breast tumors creates a microenvironment that is similar to that of bone metastases in its abundance of the cytokines CXCL12 and IGF1. Heterogeneous breast cancer cell populations growing in such mesenchymal environment evolve towards a preponderance of clones that thrive on CXCL12 and IGF1. Fibroblast-driven selection of bone metastatic clones in mammary tumors is suppressed by CXCL12 and IGF1 receptor inhibition. Thus, a fibroblast-rich stroma in breast tumors can pre-select bone metastatic seeds, promoting the evolution of metastatic traits and the interplay between a primary tumor and its distant metastases.

DESIGN
Affymetrix U133 Plus2 arrays were hybridized according to the manufacturer's procedure using RNA extracted from 47 primary breast tumors. Specific gene sets were evaluated in this cohort.
