TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of matched Ductal Carcinomas in Situ and Invasive Breast Tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is a matched-pair analysis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive component (IDC) of nine breast ductal carcinoma to identify novel molecular markers characterizing the transition from DCIS to IDC for a better understanding of its molecular biology. Keywords: Affymetrix-based Microarrays in Mamma carcinoma
