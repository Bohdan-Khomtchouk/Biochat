TITLE
Genome-wide microRNA expression induced by TNF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced microRNAs from bone marrow derived macrophages derived from the control (WT) and RBP-J conditional knockout mice (RBP-J KO; Rbpjf/f; LysM Cre).

DESIGN
Examination of differential microRNA expression levels induced by TNF as well as regulated by RBP-J in bone marrow derived macrophages.
