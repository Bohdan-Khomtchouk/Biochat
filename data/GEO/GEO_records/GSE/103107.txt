TITLE
Gene expression assessed by genome wide hybridization bead array in T84 polarized tight monolayers after challenge with celiac disease-associated bacteria [CTR 22 28 27]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the influence of celiac disease-associated bacteria on intestinal epithelial cells

DESIGN
Stimulation with CD-associated bacteria was done from the apical side of polarized tight monolayers of T84 cells by replacing the medium in the upper chamber with 0.5 mL challenge medium containing 5x10^7 bacteria. For each stimulant three parallel wells were used to carry out the experiment and wells treated with challenge medium only served as experimental controls. The challenge was done under anaerobic condition and at 37Â°C for four hours. T84 tight monolayers were challenged with two isolates of Prevotella jejuni (CD3:27 and CD3:28) and Lachnoanaerobaculum umeaense.
