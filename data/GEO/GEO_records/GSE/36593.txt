TITLE
Gene expression of SLNs (Synthetic Lethal with Nutlin-3) on HCT116 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A subset of our SLNs would be upregulated by Nutlin-3 and down-regulated by 5-FU and that this differential regulation could potentially explain how cell fate choice is determined SLNs as a group were largely members of pathways parallel to p53, in the sense that very few of them displayed significant changes in mRNA expression after Nutlin-3 or 5FU treatment

DESIGN
RNA was harvested from cells treated with Nutlin-3, 5FU, or DMSO, for 12 hours using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNAs were synthesized and labeled with the Genechip Whole Transcript Sense Target Labeling Kit (Affymetrix) per the manufacturerâ€™s instructions and hybridized to Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays (AffyMetrix)
