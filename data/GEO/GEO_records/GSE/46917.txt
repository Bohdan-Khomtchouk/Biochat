TITLE
Differentially expressed transcripts in SLE blood monocytes according to their capacity to induce mixed lymphocytic reaction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We screened SLE monocytes from 19 SLE patients and selected 4 that induced CD4+ T cell proliferation in vitro and 4 that did not. CFSE labeled CD4-T cells (105) were incubated with SLE monocytes (2 x 104). Cells were harvested at 6 hours for RNA extraction.
