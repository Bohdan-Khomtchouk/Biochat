TITLE
Screening  of influenza A virus infection related microRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the study presented here,  A549 cells infected with influenza virus A /JingFang/86-1(H1N1) for 4 and 24 hours and intervention by Flutide,  was used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 471 standard mature miRNAs based on Sanger miRBase Release 9.2.

DESIGN
4 samples: uninfected, 4 h and 24 h after infection, and 24 h infection then treated with Flutide

PLATFORM
