TITLE
Gene-resolution analysis of DNA copy number variation using oligonucleotide expression microarrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We present a novel method of using commercial oligonucleotide expression microarrays for aCGH, enabling DNA copy number measurements and expression profiles to be combined using the same platform. This method yields aCGH data from genomic DNA without complexity reduction at a median resolution of approximately 17,500 base pairs. Due to the well-defined nature of oligonucleotide probes, DNA amplification and deletion can be defined at the level of individual genes and can easily be combined with gene expression data. Keywords: genomic DNA, CGH, Copy Number Variation
