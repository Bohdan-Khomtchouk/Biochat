TITLE
Profiling of Esg genomic binding in the Drosophila midgut with DamID

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Tissue stem cells divide asymmetrically to self-renew and generate differentiated progeny to maintain tissue homeostasis. Escargot (Esg) is a transcriptional repressor that is expressed in multiple stem cell populations in Drosophila melanogaster. Reduced esg function in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) causes a loss of ISCs and a biased differentiation of the daughter enteroblasts (EBs) toward the enteroendocrine (EE) cell fate. Loss of esg leads to an upregulation of differentiation factors and reduced Notch activity within EBs, indicating that Esg is a pivotal regulator of homeostasis in the intestine, supporting self-renewal to maintain a healthy stem cell pool as well as differentiation of progenitor cells. To identify potential transcriptional targets that mediate these phenotypes, in vivo DamID was used to generate the data deposited herein.

DESIGN
3 biological relicates were performed for Esg (with one dye-swap).
