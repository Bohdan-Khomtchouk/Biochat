TITLE
Expression data from replicating and quiescent liver cells isolated from mice young liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have developed a new transgenic mouse strain, expressing a CyclinB1-GFP fusion reporter, which marks replicating cells in the S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle to isolate live replicating and quiescent cells from the liver. We used microarrays to compare the transcriptome of relicating and quiescent liver cells and reveal gene expression programs associated with cell proliferation in vivo

DESIGN
Livers of three individual 3.5 week old, weaned CyclinB1-GFP mice were dissociated into single cells.Replicating (GFP-positive) and quiescent (GFP-negative) liver cells were FACS-sorted  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
