TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of chronic lung disease for the Lung Genomics Research Consortium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These subjects were diagnosed as being controls or having interstitial lung disease (ILD) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as determined by clinical history, CT scan, and surgical pathology. There was no intervention, these are cross-sectional data. All samples are from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC) and are indexed by their LTRC tissue label.

DESIGN
These are 319 total subjects, 183 have ILD and 136 have COPD, who went for surgery for the investigation of a nodule and have no chronic lung disease by CT or pathology. Each sample is total RNA extracted from flash frozen human whole lung homogenate. Between the two platforms were analyzed. Samples are titled by source (LT=LTRC), 6-digit tissue label, lobe of extraction, and major disease state.
