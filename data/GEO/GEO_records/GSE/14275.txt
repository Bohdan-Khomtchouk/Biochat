TITLE
Expression data for heat shock in rice seedlings

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In this study, we have analyzed the expression profiles of rice genes under control and heat shock conditions using microarray technology to identify the genes differentially expressed. Keywords: Heat shock

DESIGN
14-day-old light-grown rice seedlings grown under controlled conditions and those subjected to heat shock were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Three technical replicates of each sample were used for microarray analysis. For heat shock treatment, the seedlings were kept in a chamber at 42 degree C. The seedlings kept at 28-30 degree C, served as control (Seedling).

PLATFORM
GPL2025 [Rice] Affymetrix Rice Genome Array
