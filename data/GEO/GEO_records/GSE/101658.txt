TITLE
DNA methylation in demyelinated multiple sclerosis hippocampus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of genomic DNA isolated from hippocampus of multiple sclerosis patients were hybridized to Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip arrays.  DNA methylation profiles across approximately 45,000 CpGs were compared between 8 myelinated and 7 demyelinated tissues .

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 15 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Human Methylation450 Beadchip arrays

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
