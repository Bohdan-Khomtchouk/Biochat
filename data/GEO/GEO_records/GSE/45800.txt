TITLE
Expression Profiles of microRNAs of HepG2 cells treated with Cyclosporin A and solvent control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The microRNA changes induced in the human liver cell line HepG2 by Cyclosporin A after treatment for 12h, 24h, 48h and 72h

DESIGN
The study investigated differential microRNA expression in HepG2 cell line following 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours of exposure to Cyclosporin A and solvent. Three biological replicates per compound/solvent. In total 36 arrays .
