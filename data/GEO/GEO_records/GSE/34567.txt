TITLE
The transcription factor CDX2 maintains active enhancer in intestinal villus cells in vivo (expression data)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We established whether partner transcription factor binding, chromatin structure, or gene expression is compromised upon loss of partner factors cdx2 or hnf4a in mouse intestinal villi This metadata file describes the gene expression componant of that data

DESIGN
Intestinal epithelia were collected from mouse jejunum using EDTA-based chelation and RNA was made using trizol. RNA was checked for quality and then processed for affymetrix arrays, 430 2.0.
