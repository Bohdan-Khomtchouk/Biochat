TITLE
Regulation of cardiac cushion endocardial cells by KLF2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of differential gene expression between controls and mice that lack the transciption factor KLF2 from the cardiac endocardium following Nfatc1 Cre deletion.

DESIGN
E12.5 cardiac atrio-ventricular cushion mRNA profiles were generated from KLF2 fl/fl and Nfatc1 KLF2 fl/fl mice.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
