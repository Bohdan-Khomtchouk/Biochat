TITLE
Microarray Profiling of Circular RNAs in Human Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Non-coding circular RNAs (circRNAs) have displayed dysregulated expression in several human cancers. Here, we profiled the circRNA expression of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) tumors to improve our understanding of PTC pathogenesis as well as to identify potential circRNA biomarkers for PTC.

DESIGN
A total of 18 thyroid samples – consisting of six PTC tumors, six matching contralateral normal samples, and six benign thyroid lesions (i.e., three follicular adenoma samples and three multinodular goiter samples) – were finally included in the study.
