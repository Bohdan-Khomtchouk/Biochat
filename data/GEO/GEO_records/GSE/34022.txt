TITLE
Expression data of interferon-alpha treated Huh-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is primarily treated with a pegylated interferon alpha based therapy, a regime that induces antiviral effects through the upregulation of many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Whilst a number of anti-HCV ISGs have previously been identified, others may also be involved. Micorarrays were used to validate the presence of ISGs within subtracted libraries generated using the related techniques of suppression subtractive hybridisation and mirror orientation selection, which had  initally been impllemented to isolate clones of ISGs following the interferon-alpha treatment of Huh-7 cells.

DESIGN
Microarray data was generated for both untreated and interferon-alpha treated Huh-7 cells. No replicates were performed, however the microarray data was verified via the use of non-parametric (spearman) correlation analysis with RT-PCR data that had been generated using the same Huh-7 cell total RNA samples as the microarray experiments earlier.
