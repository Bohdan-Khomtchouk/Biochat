TITLE
affy_infection_medicago-Comparison of plant responses upon Aphanomyces euteiches infection in wild type (A17) line and in the Mtnf-ya1-1 mutant

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
affy_infection_medicago - affy_infection_medicago - MtNF-YA1 is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of nitrogen fixing nodule organogenesis. Mtnf-ya1-1 mutant has been shown to be more resistant to Aphanomyces euteiches (Ae), a root pathogen, than the A17 wild type (WT) line. In this study we want to compare both WT and mutant plant responses, 1 and 6 days post inoculation (dpi) between WT and the Mtnf-ya1-1 mutant, in order to identify MtNF-YA1-dependent gene networks during infection. Data about non inoculated A17 control plants and infected A17 at 1 dpi have been already obtained in another experiment in which the conditions of in vitro culture of M. truncatula plants and ofA.euteiches(Ae) inoculation were exactly the same than the ones used in these experiments.-Fifteen-day-old A17 or Mtnf-ya1-1 plants were grown in vitro on M medium. The entire roots were then inoculated (or not = controls) with a A. euteiches zoospores (105/ml) and harvested one or six days after inoculation. Three independent repeats were performed.
