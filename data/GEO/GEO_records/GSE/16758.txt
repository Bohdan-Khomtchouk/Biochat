TITLE
Topo mutants psoralen photobinding

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We present a DNA array-based method for the genome-wide analysis of Psoralen photobinding in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. PB was found reduced in subtelomeric regions and increased in the subset of genes with smallest nucleosomal density.

DESIGN
The analysis includes 3 repeats of the wild type strain (JCW25) at 30ºC and 3 more at 37ºC, 3 repeats of the double top1 (delta) top2ts mutant at 37ºC and 3 repeats of naked genomic DNA treated with trimethyl psoralen (TMP) in the same way to be used as a control of unspecific binding.
