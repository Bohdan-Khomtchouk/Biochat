TITLE
Expression data from Drosophila  Btk29A mutant and revertant neuronal tissue

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In Drosophila melanogaster, Btk29A displays a dynamic pattern of expression through the embryonic to adult stages. Complete loss-of function of both splice-forms is lethal, whereas selective absence of the type 2-form reduces the adult lifespan of the fly and causes male genitalial developmental abnormalities. Here, we investigated the role of Btk29A type 2 on a transcriptomic level in the larvae CNS and adult heads. We used samples either selectively defective in Btk29A type 2 (Btk29AficP) or flies were the Btk29A type 2 gene has been reintroduced (ficExc.1-16).

DESIGN
Adult heads and larvae CNS  were dissected  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
