TITLE
Expression data from leaf of (P. tomentosa x P. bolleana) x P. tomentosa under elevated CO2 concentrations

ORGANISM
(Populus tomentosa x Populus bolleana) x Populus tomentosa

SUMMARY
The atmosphere CO2 concentration keeps increasing every year. Use the Affymetrix poplar gene chip to confirm the expression changes in key genes in the triploid white poplar due to the influence of elevated CO2 concentrations. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression under normal and elevated CO2 concentrations.

DESIGN
Gene expression of triploid white poplar ((P. tomentosa × P. bolleana）× P. tomentosa) leaves were investigated by using the Affymetrix poplar genome gene chip, after grown in controlled environment chambers under three different CO2 concentrations. Poplar leaves were subjected to normal CO2 concentrations (T0) and elevated CO2 concentrations (T1, 550 ppm and T2, 720 ppm) treatments three months.
