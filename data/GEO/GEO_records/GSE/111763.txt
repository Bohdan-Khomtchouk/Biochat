TITLE
Expression profiling of lncRNAs/mRNA for H.pylori infected normal gastric epithelial cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, cultured H.pylori was used to infect the normal gastric epithelial cell line GES-1, to construct the H.pylori infection model. lncRNA microarray was applied for detecting the lncRNA in H.pylori infection model.

DESIGN
A three chip study using total RNA extracted from  GES-1 cells infected with H.pylori . Each chip measures the expression level of 45,697 genes  collected from the authoritative data source including NCBI
