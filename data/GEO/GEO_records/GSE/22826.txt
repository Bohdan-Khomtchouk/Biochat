TITLE
Ferulic Acid Challenge of Lactobacillus brevis

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus brevis

SUMMARY
The presence of anti-microbial phenolic compounds, such as the model compound ferulic acid, in biomass hydrolysates poses significant challenges to the widespread use of biomass in conjunction with whole cell biocatalysis or fermentation. Currently, these inhibitory compounds must be removed through additional downstream processing to create feedstock suitable for most industrially important microbial strains. This study explores the high ferulic acid tolerance in Lactobacillus brevis (L. brevis), a lactic acid bacteria often found in fermentation processes, by global transcriptional response analysis. The transcriptional profile of L. brevis under ferulic acid stress reveals that the presence of ferulic acid primarily triggers the expression of membrane proteins to counteract ferulic acid induced changes in membrane fluidity and ion leakage, in the midst of a generalized stress response. Several promising routes for understanding phenolic acid tolerance have been identified based upon these findings. These insights may be used to guide further engineering of model industrial organisms to better tolerate phenolic compounds in processed biomass.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were utilized for each time point. Total RNA was extracted using the Zymo Research Bacterial/Fungal RNA extraction kit Microarrays were indirectly labeled, hybridized, and washed according to the Fairplay III Kit protocol. Slides were scanned using the Axon GenePix 4200A scanner. Data normalization (LOWESS) was carried out on each array separately. The arithmetic average of probe signals was used to compute Log2 values.

PLATFORM
GPL10674 Agilent custom Lactobacillus brevis Microarray (condensed version)
