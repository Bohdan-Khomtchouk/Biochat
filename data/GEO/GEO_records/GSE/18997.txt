TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of testicular biopsies with Sertoli-cell-only and spermatogonial presence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to identify in vivo spermatogonial gene expression within the context of their biological niche. Identification of spermatogonial genes was done by t-testing on the replicates of Score 3 (Spermatogonia) and Score 2 (SCO) testicular biopsies.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates with spermatogonial presence in the tubuli seminiferi, 5 biological replicates with Sertoli-cell-only syndrome.
