TITLE
Expression profiles of amniotic fluid from human fetuses with Down syndrome and euploid controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to characterize the differences between second trimester Down syndrome (DS) and euploid fetuses, we compared gene expression in uncultured amniotic fluid supernatant samples. We identified individually differentially expressed genes via paired t-tests in the matched samples, and a set of differentially expressed genes on chromosome 21 using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.  Functional pathway analysis of the resulting genes highlighted the importance of oxidative stress, ion transport, and G-protein signaling in the DS fetuses.

DESIGN
We profiled seven DS expression samples and seven controls matched for gender and approximate gestational age..
