TITLE
Chromatin IP for Mcm2-7, Rec8, Hop1 and Red1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Mcm2-7 ChIP in pre-meiotic and pre-mitotic cells, axis factor ChIP in wild-type and replication compromised strains in meiosis

DESIGN
Multiple studies of meiotic chromosomes were undertaken. To study DNA replication, the locations of replicative helicase (Mcm2-7) were mapped in pre-meiotic and pre-mitotic cells, and DNA replication profiles were created for pre-meiotic S (meiS) and pre-mitotic S (mitS) phases. Early origins were mapped in hydroxyurea for wild-type cells in mitS + 200mM HU, and meiS +20mM HU for wild-type, sml1, rec8 and spo11 deletion cells. Rec8, Hop1 and Red1 binding to meiotic chromosomes was evaluated using ChIP-chip in wild-type cells with and without 20 mM HU, and in cdc6-mn and clb5 clb6 delete cells. Finally, meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were mapped in cdc6-mn dmc1 delete cells by measuring the ssDNA that accumulates at DSB hotspots.
