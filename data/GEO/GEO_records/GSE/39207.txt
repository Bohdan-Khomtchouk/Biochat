TITLE
DDR1 knockdown in BXPC3 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Examination of effect of stable DDR1 knockdown by shRNA on transcriptional profile in BXPC3 cell line to understand role of DDR1 in tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiles of parental BXPC3 cell line was compared to BXPC3 cells stably transfected with non-target shRNA or DDR1 shRNA, N=3 for each condition.

PLATFORM
