TITLE
Exon-level analyses of neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, mRNA expression profiles of 113 primary untreated human neuroblastoma samples were compared with the aim to identify prognostic exon and gene sets as well as parameters associated with alternative exon use. The primary neuroblastoma specimens were from tumor banks in Cologne or Essen, Germany, Ghent, Belgium and Valencia, Spain. All patients were diagnosed between 1998 and 2007 and treated according to the German Neuroblastoma trials NB97, NB 2004 or the SIOPEN protocol.

DESIGN
This submission contains 87 exon array profiles and are used together with exon array data from 26 Samples in GSE21713 (see 'Relation' links below) to predict the outcome of patients with neuroblastoma. The resulting dataset, which is linked below as a supplementary file ('GSE32664_complete_RMA_data.txt'), was used for the subsequent analyses.
