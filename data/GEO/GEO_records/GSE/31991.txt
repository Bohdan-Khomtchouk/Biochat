TITLE
To identify alterations induced in gastric mucosa of mice exposed to Pteridium aquilinum and/or infected with Helicobacter pylori

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to identify alterations induced in gastric mucosa of mice exposed to Pteridium aquilinum and/or infected with Helicobacter pylori, in order to identify genes that are induced by bracken fern exerts exacerbating effects on gastric lesions associated to the infection.

DESIGN
Six groups of C57Bl/6 mice were be used:  1) control, 2) infected Helicobacter pylori, 3) treated with Bracken fern extract orogastrically, 4) treated with Bracken fern extract in drinking water, 5) infected Helicobacter pylori + treated with Bracken fern extract orogastrically, 6) infected Helicobacter pylori + treated with Bracken fern extract in drinking water. The infection procedure was performed using an orogastric inoculation of H.pylori (strain SS1) twice in the first week.  The RNA isolation was done in triplicate (3 mice per each condition). Further evaluation of morphological alterations on gastric mucosa, proliferative index and induction of DNA strand breaks will be performed in the mice stomach exposed to Pteridium aquilinum infected or not with Helicobacter pylori. Alterations of glycosylation in gastric tissues will also evaluated.
