TITLE
Gene expression signatures for MMP19 full length cDNA transfection in A549 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further understand the role of MMP19 in IPF, particularly in genotype and phenotype changes, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify the target genes of MMP19 in epithelial cells. Gene expression analysis showed that 8358 genes were differentially expressed at p-value 0.05 level and 748 genes were significantly changed with MMP19 expression, which covers matrix protien and cell proliferation, motality and phenotype changes (EMT). Among them, PTGS2 was revealed as one of the most significantly up-regulated genes. And PTGS2 up-regulation in IPF lungs was verified by immunohistochemical (IHC), qRT-PCR and Western-blot as well.

DESIGN
A549 is a typical epithelial cell line from ATCC which are widely used in the lung cell biology studies in vitro. To define the role of MMP19 in epithelial cells, we employed Agilent whole genome gene expression microarray profiling to identify genotype alteration with overexpression of MMP19 to find the target genes of MMP19, further to explore the function of MMP19 in the unique microenironment of IPF
