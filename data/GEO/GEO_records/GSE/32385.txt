TITLE
Human PC-3 prostate cancer cells: Control (shNTC; non-target shRNA) vs. shETV4 knock down (shETV4)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human PC-3 prostate cancer cells lentivirally infected with non-target control (NTC) short hairpin (sh)RNA comparing with lentivirally shRNA mediated human ETV4 knock-down. Cells were either cultured for 24 hours at 20% oxygen tension or 0.2% oxygen. Goal was to determine (i) genes affected by hypoxia in PC-3 NTC cells and (ii) identification of hypoxically induced genes requiring ETV4 for hypoxic regulation.

DESIGN
four condition experiment, shNTC at 20% and 0.2% oxygen and shETV4 at 20% and 0.2% oxygen for 24 hours. Biological replicates: 3 for each of the 4 conditions

PLATFORM
