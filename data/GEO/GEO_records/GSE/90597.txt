TITLE
Molecular heterogeneity of NK/T-cell lymphoma (expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate if biologically distinct subsets exists in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL), we performed unsupervised integrative analyses of gene expression profiling (GEP), miRNA profiling, and copy number aberration (CNA) on 66 cases of NKTL from diverse anatomical sites. This series is the GEP data.

DESIGN
Unsupervised analysis of FFPE NKTL samples.
