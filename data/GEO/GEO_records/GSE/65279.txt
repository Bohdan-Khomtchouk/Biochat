TITLE
Acute heat stress induces differential gene expressions in the testes of a broiler-type strain of Taiwan country chickens

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To realize the gene expression in response to acute heat stress in chicken testis, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a tool to identify genes response to acute heat stress. Male B strain Taiwan country chickens were subjected to acute heat stress (38℃) for 4 h, and then exposed to 25℃, with testes collected 0, 2, and 6 h after the cessation of heat stress, using non heat-stressed roosters as a control group (n = 3 roosters per group). Based on a chicken 44K oligo microarray, 163 genes significantly differed in the testes of the heat-stressed chickens from those of the control chickens. The mRNA expressions of upregulated genes, including HSP25, HSP90AA1, HSPA2, and LPAR2, and downregulated genes, including CDH5, CTNNA3, EHF, CIRBP, SLA, and NTF3, were confirmed through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).

DESIGN
Acute heat stress induced testicular gene experssion in B strain Taiwan country chicken was measured at 0, 2, and 6 h of recovery after 4 h of 38 degree acute heat stress.
