TITLE
Expression data of ileal Peyer's patches from Salmonella Typhimurium infected pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
This study couples a swine experimental model of non-typhoid salmonellosis to laser capture microdissection and microarray analysis to dissect the mechanisms carried out in the follicles of ileum Peyer’s Patches in response to Salmonella Typhimurium infection. Affymetrix GeneChip® Porcine genome array was used to study the gene expression profiles of Peyer's Patches grom control and infected pigs at acute phase of infection.

DESIGN
Eight crossbred weaned piglets of approximately four weeks of age and confirmed to be fecal-negative for Salmonella were randomly allocated to control or infected groups (four animals each). Control (0 day post-infection) pigs were necropsied 2 h before the experimental infection, whereas infected group was orally challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium phagetype DT104 and subsequently necropsied at 2 dpi. Ileum samples were collected from all experimental animals and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Laser-capture microdissection was performed and RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip® Porcine genome arrays. Results of infected samples were compared to those of controls to obtain differentially expressed genes.
