TITLE
A novel epigenetic regulated gene and involved in phenotypic switch classifies primary melanomas depending on the aggressiveness grade (gene expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Loss of methylation of a GTPase-activating protein in melanoma mediates higher proliferation, lower migration, and agressiveness of primary melanomas.

DESIGN
