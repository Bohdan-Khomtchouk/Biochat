TITLE
Arabidopsis Col-5 challenged with Ralstonia solanacearum BCCF401

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis plants were challenged with Ralstonia solanacearum isolate BCCF401 and expression profiles investigated during early and late wilt symptom development. Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
A direct comparison was performed. Two replicate biological experiments were performed and two technical replicates with dye swap were included in each biological replicate.

PLATFORM
GPL9720 University of Cape Town Arabidopsis thaliana 7200 cDNA array
