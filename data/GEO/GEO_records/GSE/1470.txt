TITLE
Epithelial stem cells co-cultured with the dermal papilla

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clonogenic keratinocyte stem cells isolated from the bulge area of human telogen follicles were co-cultured with dermal papilla cells in a transwell system. RNA was isolated from stem cells for different periods of time (day 0, 1, 2, and 5) after co-culture with DP and analyzed for changes in gene expression using Genechip microarrays. Keywords = epithelial stem cells Keywords = DP Keywords = co-culture Keywords: other
