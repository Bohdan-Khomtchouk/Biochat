TITLE
Alternative splicing in tomato pollen in response to heat stress

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Alternative splicing caused by exposure of pollen to high temperatures leads to the generation of transcripts with pre-mature termination codon targeted for degradation or mRNAs putatively coding for truncated proteins with altered functions thereby controlling important cellular pathways including transport and localization, heat stress response, gene expression and various biosynthetic processes.

DESIGN
8 samples including 2 tomato cultivars und 2 conditions in two replicates each
