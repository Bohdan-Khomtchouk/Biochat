TITLE
Mutations in Multidrug Efflux Pumps of Eshcerichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The number and overlapping substrate repertoire of multidrug efflux pumps in the E. coli genome suggest a physiological role apart from multidrug resistance.  This role was investigated using transcriptomic analyses of cDNAs labeled from E. coli AG102 mRNA (hyper drug resistant, marR1) and its isogenic major efflux pump mutants. Keywords: Mutation Analysis

DESIGN
For each mutant analysis, at least fivefold redundancy was employed in culture preparation and mRNA isolation.  In addition, each microarray slide contains three complete copies of the array design giving at least 15 data points (5 slides X 3 copies per slide) for each oligonucleotide probe spot.  Respective E. coli mRNA pools were harvested at mid-log phase from cells grown in Luria-Bertani (Miller) medium at 37C.
