TITLE
Mutations in Multidrug Efflux Pumps of Eshcerichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The number and overlapping substrate repertoire of multidrug efflux pumps in the E. coli genome suggest a physiological role apart from multidrug resistance.  This role was investigated using transcriptomic analyses of cDNAs labeled from E. coli AG102 mRNA (hyper drug resistant, marR1) and its isogenic major efflux pump mutants. Keywords: Mutation Analysis
