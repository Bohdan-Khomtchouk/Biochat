TITLE
Stress and adaptation of Listeria monocytogenes 08-5923 exposed to a sublethal dose of carnocyclin A

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes 08-5923

SUMMARY
This study investigated the alternative gene, protein expression and morphological changes of L. monocytogenes 08-5923 following 15min, 4h and 30h exposure to bacteriocin carnocyclin A (cclA). The microarray experiment studied the gene expression of untreated and treated Listeria cells following 4h exposure to cclA.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from six separate cultures of L. monocytogenes 08-5923; three grown in TSB (untreated) and three grown in TSB with cclA (treated); Each chip measures the expression level of 2,857 genes from L. monocytogenes 08-5923 with five 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with 1-fold technical redundancy.
