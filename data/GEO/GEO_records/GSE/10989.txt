TITLE
Expression data of cystic renal epithelial tissue from mice deficient for fumarate hydratase.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fumarate hydratase (FH) mutations cause hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC). We have conditionally inactivated the murine ortholog (Fh1) in renal tubular epithelial cells in order to generate an in vivo model of HLRCC. Fh1 knockout mice recapitulates important aspects of HLRCC including the development of renal cysts that overexpress hypoxia inducible factor alpha (Hifa) and Hif-target genes. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene  expression underlying cyst development in Fh1 knockout mice and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: gene expression, comparison (wild-type n=3 vs knockout n=3)

DESIGN
Renal epithelial tissue was macro-dissected from Fh1 knockout mice and sex-matched litter mate control disease-free animals for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
