TITLE
RNA expression data from Halobacterium NRC-1 in varied extracellular salinity conditions

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
Halobacterium salinarum is an extreme halophilic archaeon adapted to total salinities upwards of 4 M. Here we studied gene expression in H. salinarum grown in ten ion composition media that vary in two major aspects of ion composition: [NaCl] and Mg:K ratio.

DESIGN
Samples were taken from the Î”ura3 parental strain cells at mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.4-0.5) during growth in ten different media. RNA from growth in each media was compared with a standard RNA reference, extracted from H. salinarum NRC-1 grown in batch culture in the standard growth media to OD = 0.471. Two biological replicates were performed for each media, with the exception of one replicate only for M12.
