TITLE
Differential methylation between mouse embyronic stem cell states

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated RRBS data between Rex1-high and Rex1-low cells to identify differentially methylated promoters. We observe bimodal methylation levels in both subpopulations, and that Rex1-low cells accumulate increased levels of methylation, frequently as a function of local CpG density

DESIGN
We sorted Rex1 high and low cells using a GFP-knockin reporter cell line (kindly provided by Austin Smith), and performed RRBS on the subpopulations

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
