SUMMARY
We cultured hESC and hiPSC lines and compared the transcriptome of untreated cells with cells treated with Activin or BMP4 during 5 days

DESIGN
Pluripotent cell lines cultured in feeder-free conditions were treated with 100 ng/ml of activin or 50 ng/ml BMP4 daily during 5 days and collected for analysis
