TITLE
Gene Expression of ESC and iPSC lines after specific differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We cultured hESC and hiPSC lines and compared the transcriptome of untreated cells with cells treated with Activin or BMP4 during 5 days

DESIGN
Pluripotent cell lines cultured in feeder-free conditions were treated with 100 ng/ml of activin or 50 ng/ml BMP4 daily during 5 days and collected for analysis
