TITLE
Gene expression profiles of bladder cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bladder cancer is among the five most common malignancies worldwide, and it is the second most common tumor of the genitourinary tract and the second most common cause of death in patients with genitourinary tract malignancies. To identify target genes of human bladder cancer, five cell lines were subject to Agilent whole genome microarray.

DESIGN
Five bladder cancer cell lines (BOY, J82, KK47, T24, and UMUC) were compared to human normal bladder RNA

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
