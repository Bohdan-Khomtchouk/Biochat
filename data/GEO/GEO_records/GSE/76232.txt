TITLE
The Analysis of Genes that Influence Sheep Follicular Development by Different Nutrition Levels during the Luteal Phase using Expression Profiling

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Purpose: Nutrition is an important factor that regulates reproductive performance of sheep and affects follicle development. However, the correlation between nutrition and follicle development is poorly understood at molecular level. In order to study its possible molecular mechanisms, we performed expression profiling of granulosa cells isolated from sheep that were fed with different nutrition levels during luteal phase. Methods: To do this, ewes received a maintenance diet (M) and their estrus was synchronized by intravaginal progestogen sponges for 12 days. Ewes were randomly divided into the short-term dietary restricted group (R; 0.5×M) and nutrient-supplemented group (S; 1.5×M). RNA samples were extracted from granulosa cells. Transcriptome libraries from each group were constructed by Illumina Sequencing. Results: In 18,468 detected genes, 170 genes were significantly differentially expressed; of which, 140 genes were up-regulated and 30 genes were down-regulated in group S relative to group R. These genes could be candidates regulating follicular development in sheep. GO, KEGG and Clustering analyses were performed. Conclusions: These data in our study are abundant genomic recourse to expand our understanding of the molecular and cellular events underlying follicle development.

DESIGN
Sixteen multiparous Hu sheep (3-4 years; 42.2 ± 1.2 kg) were randomly assigned to two groups: the short-term nutrient-supplemented group (S; n=8), and the dietary restricted group (R; n=8).Expression profiling of granulosa cells were performed by Illumina sequencing platform (HiSeq 2000).
