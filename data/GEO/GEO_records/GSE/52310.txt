TITLE
Long RNA Seq on Sham Adult Mouse Heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Enhancers are the key information processing units within the cardiac gene regulatory network. We have demonstrated that cardiac enhancers generate non-coding RNAs. RNA sequencing demonstrates that some of these transcripts are polyadenylated, multi-exonic long non-coding RNAs.

DESIGN
1 conditions, 4 biological replicates per condition

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
