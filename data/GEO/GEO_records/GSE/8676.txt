TITLE
PrV/PK15 kinetics_SLA/PrV slides

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To study in vitro the epithelial cells and PrV interactions during infection, we followed PrV and PK15 cells transcriptome modifications during time-course infection (I) and mock-infection (MI).Six time points were studied: just after I and MI, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h and 12h post-I and MI. For this study, a pig DNA/cDNA microarray containing genes of the SLA region, additional genes encoding other important immunological molecules and all the PrV genes was constructed. Keywords: infection time course

DESIGN
48 samples  - The hybridization scheme which can be define as dye-switch was chosen. A balanced loop design with two independent loops, each loop containing 2 replicates of PrV infection and MI, was used. In total, 24 SLA/PrV slides (containing 2 networks)  were used in this experiment.
