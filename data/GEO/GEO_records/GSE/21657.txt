TITLE
BP1 Expression Promotes Tumorigenesis and Aggression in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was designed to identify genes that are differentially expressed when BP1 homeobox gene is overexpressed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The goal is to understand the functional role of BP1 in breast tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
MCF-7 overexpressing pcDNA3.2-BP1 clones, O1 and O4 as replicates vs. MCF-7 transfected with pcDNA3.2 vector clones, V1 and V2 as replicates
