TITLE
Inflammatory gene expression in response to sublethal phosgene exposure in Balb/c mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Phosgene is a lung damaging chemical warfare agent which can cause death by the inhalation route. In this study the inflammatory response to phosgene was mapped over a 96h time-course using a custom microarray in the Balb/c mouse.

DESIGN
Three groups of six mice were exposed to phosgene and a three groups exposed to an air only control. Following exposure mice were culled at 6 timepoints (1, 4, 7, 24, 48 and 96h). RNA was extracted and run on the custom array.
