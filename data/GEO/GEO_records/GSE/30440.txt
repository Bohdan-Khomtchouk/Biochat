TITLE
Toward synaptic transcriptomes: Direct sequencing and identification of RNAs actively transported by the kinesin complex from the cell body to synapses in Aplysia neurons

ORGANISM
Aplysia californica

SUMMARY
Specific mRNAs are transported from the cell body to synapses where their translation can modify communication of pre-existing synapses and induce formation of new synaptic connections in response to learning.  Little is known, however, about the identity of the RNAs that are actively transported and when and how these RNAs are utilized during learning. By focusing on RNAs that are associated with kinesin, a motor protein that transports gene products from the cell body to synapses, we have now applied microarrays and 454 sequencing to identify actively transported RNAs from the Aplysia central nervous system. Using a library prepared from the kinesin complex immunoprecipitated from the central nervous system (CNS), we have identified thousands of unique transcripts, of which ~600 mRNAs were annotated.

DESIGN
Two sample comparison: kinesin IP vs. control.
