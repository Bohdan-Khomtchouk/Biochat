TITLE
Drosophila melanogaster small RNA sequence: female heads

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing of Drosophila melanogaster small RNAs. total RNA, ~18-26nt RNAs isolated using PAGE, ligation to adapters requires 5' monophosphate and 3' OH Keywords: High-throughput solexa sequencing

DESIGN
Small RNAs were sequenced from D. melanogaster female head. Raw sequences were clipped by 3' linker sequences recognition, and select clipped sequences longer than 18 nt Quality scores in the supplementary file for GSM240749 are undefined.  Quality of the bases assessed by (1) identifying for the sequenced linker, which is a known sequence, and (2) mapping the clipped sequence to the genome and taking only perfect hits.
