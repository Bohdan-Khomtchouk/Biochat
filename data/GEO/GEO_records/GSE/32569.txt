TITLE
Expression data for Cediranib in Metastatic ASPS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression from pre- and post- Cediranib treated patients with metastatic Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS)

DESIGN
Paired tumor biopsies from 6 patients were collected. Samples were collected at baseline and 3 to 5 days following treatment. The patients are all enrolled in the replicate cohort of a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsered investigational new drug application with institutional review board approval, and all participants provided written informed consent. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00942877. The timing of the tumor biopsies was based on clinical observations of increased tumor pain associated with an inflammatory-like response in peripheral tumor lesions, usually within the second week of treatment.  Tumor biopsies were obtained in the first week of treatment before the development of clinical signs and symptoms to evaluate gene expression changes. The time points are labeled " pre " and " post " to denote their relationship to treatment.
