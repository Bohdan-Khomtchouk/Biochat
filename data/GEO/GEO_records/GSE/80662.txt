TITLE
Identification of TWIST1 transcriptional targets in the cranial mesoderm [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor is essential for the development of cranial mesoderm and cranial neural crest-derived craniofacial structures. Our previous work showed that, in the absence of TWIST1, some cells within the cranial mesoderm adopt an abnormal epithelial configuration. Here, we show by transcriptome analysis that loss of TWIST1 in the cranial mesoderm is accompanied by a reduction in the expression of genes that are associated with cell-extracellular matrix interactions and the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics. By comparing the transcriptional profiles of cranial mesoderm-specific Twist1 loss-of-function mutant and control mouse embryos, we identified a set of genes that are both TWIST1-dependent and predominantly expressed in the mesoderm. By ChIP-seq in a cell line model of a TWIST1-dependent mesenchymal state, we identified, among the downstream genes, three direct transcriptional targets of TWIST1: Ddr2, Pcolce and Tgfbi.  Our findings show that the mesenchymal properties of the cranial mesoderm is likely to be regulated by a network of TWIST1 targets genes that influence the extracellular matrix and cell-matrix interactions, and collectively they are required for the morphogenesis of the craniofacial structures.

DESIGN
Chromatin extracts were subject to chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti TWIST1 monoclonal antibody (ChIP-seq). Input chromatin, not subject to ChIP was used as the negative control. Two independent replicate experiments were performed. Purified, immunoprecipitated DNA was sequenced at Australian Genome Research facility.
