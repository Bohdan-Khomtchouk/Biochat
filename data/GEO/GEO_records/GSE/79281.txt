TITLE
Gene expression data from epididymal fat of A/J mouse and A/J-12SM consomic mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SMXA-5 mouse shows a high-fat induced fatty liver. The QTL for fatty liver was mapped on mouse chromosome 12, designated as Fl1sa. The liver weight and liver triglyceride content of A/J-12SM consomic mouse was lower than that of A/J mouse. In contrast, the epididymal fat weight tended to be higher in A/J-12SM consomic mouse than that in A/J. We compared the epididymal fat's gene expressions between A/J mouse and A/J-12SM consomic mouse.

DESIGN
Total RNA of male A/J mice and A/J-12SM consomic mice fed a high-fat diet for 7 weeks were extracted from epididymal fat of three mice. The RNAs form three mice were pooled and hybridized on one Affymetrix microarry.
