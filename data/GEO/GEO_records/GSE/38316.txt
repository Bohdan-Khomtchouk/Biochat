TITLE
Myocardin-like Protein (MKL)-2 Regulates TGF-β Signaling in Embryonic Stem Cells and the Developing Vasculature

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Signal transduction from the extracellular matrix to the arterial wall plays a critical role during development of the vasculature.  We now report the discovery of a Myocardin-like Protein (MKL)2/TGF-β signaling pathway that is required for maturation and stabilization of the vasculature.  Mkl2-/- null embryos exhibit profound derangements in the tunica media leading to aneurismal dilation, dissection and hemorrhage. TGFβ expression, signaling and TGF-β-regulated genes are down-regulated in Mkl2-/- ES cells and in the vasculature of Mkl2-/- embryos.  Transcription of Tgfβ2 is activated via binding of a MKL 2/SRF complex to a conserved CArG element in the Tgfβ2 promoter. In this data set we include expression data from wild type and Mkl2-/- ES cells

DESIGN
A total of 5 samples with mRNA of sufficient quality were analyzed.  Samples consisted of mRNA from independent cell culture of 2 wild-type and 3 Mkl2-/- undifferentiated Embryonic Stem Cells
