TITLE
RNA-Seq transcriptome profiling of in vitro cultures of migrating porcine primordial germ cells and porcine fetal fibroblasts of mini pig embryos between days 17-24 of gestation

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Porcine embryonic germ cells (EGC) are cultured pluripotent cells derived from primordial germ cells (PGC). This study explored the possibilities to establish porcine EGC lines in the domestic breed pig more efficiently and from earlier embryonic stages than reported to date. In vitro culture of PGC from both pooled and individual embryos at days 17-24 of gestation resulted in the successful derivation of putative EGC lines from days 20-24 with high efficiency, while no lines could be established from days 17-18. The EGC-like colonies had characteristic morphology and electron microscopy revealed tight junctions and presence of primary cilia on the cell surfaces.  The cells formed simple embryoid bodies in suspension culture and further differentiated into epithelial-like, mesenchymal-like, and neuronal-like cells. Our results show that putative porcine EGC can be derived from migrating PGC with high efficiency using individual embryos from different genetic backgrounds.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq profiling of 2 different in vitro cultures of pig embryonic cells. The cells, both the pig Embryonic Germ cells (pEGCs) and the pig Fetal Fibroblasts (pFF) show properties of pluripotency and self renewal.
