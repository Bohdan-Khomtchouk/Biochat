TITLE
The impact of anaerobiosis on expression of the iron-responsive Fur and RyhB Regulons [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
As descirbed in the manuscript " The impact of anaerobiosis on expression of the iron-responsive Fur and RyhB Regulons " we mapped the locations of Fur DNA binding in E. coli K12 under aerobic or anaerobic growth conditions and anerobic iron deficient growth conditions.

DESIGN
We performed ChIP-Seq to map the locations of Fur DNA binding in E. coli K12 under aerobic or anaerobic growth conditions and anerobic iron deficient growth conditions.
