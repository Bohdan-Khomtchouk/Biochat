TITLE
Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans strain CB1190 during growth on THF or succinate

ORGANISM
Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans strain CB1190 during growth on THF (tetradhydrofuran) or succinate, and re-analysis of GSE33197 published expression data.

DESIGN
Two new treatments, based on carbon/energy source used for growth: THF and succinate. Three previously published treatments (pyruvate, dioxane, and glycolate) from GEO Series GSE33197 were also reanalyzed. Triplicate microarrays (biological replicates) were prepared for each treatment. Gene expression changes were compared directly between the new treatments (THF vs. succinate) and to previously published data during growth on pyruvate (GEO accession numbers GSM821862-GSM821864) in order to yield THF vs. pyruvate and succinate vs. pyruvate contrasts. Included as part of the re-analysis of GSE33197 were data from dioxane and glycolate treatments (GSM821865-GSM821870). The complete dataset representing: (1) the THF- and succinate-treated CB1190 Samples and (2) the pyruvate-, dioxane- and glycolate-treated CB1190  Samples from Series GSE33197 (re-processed using RMA), is linked below as a supplementary file (GSE48814_complete_data.txt).
