TITLE
The ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Hebeloma cylindrosporum undergoes early waves of transcriptional reprogramming prior to symbiotic structures differentiation

ORGANISM
Hebeloma cylindrosporum

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq2000 technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from Hebeloma cylindrosporum pre-infectious stages (2 and 4 days) compared to control mycelium. Pre-infectious and control mycelia were harvested after 2 and 4 days and used for RNA extraction. Reads of 150 bp were generated and aligned to Hebeloma cylindrosporum reference transcripts  ( http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Hebcy2 ) using CLC Genomics Workbench 8.5.1.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Hebeloma cylindrosporum pre-infectious and control mycelium were generated by Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing (150bp). Three biological replicates were sequenced for Hebeloma cylindrosporum mycelium in contact for 2 and 4 days with Pinus pinaster seedlings as well as for control mycelium at the same time-points.
