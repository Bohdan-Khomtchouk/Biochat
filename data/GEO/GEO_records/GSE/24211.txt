TITLE
Genome-wide H3K9 acetylation state before and after VPA treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide maps of the H3K9 acetylation state in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) before and after treatment with low levels of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA).

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for 3 samples: untreated E14 cells, cells treated with VPA for 4 hrs and cells treated with VPA for 16 hrs. Unprecipitated DNA was used as the input control (Input).

PLATFORM
GPL9318 AB SOLiD System 3.0 (Mus musculus)
