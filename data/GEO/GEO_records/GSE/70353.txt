TITLE
Subcutaneous adipose tissue gene expression from men that are part of the METSIM study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed samples from 770 male human subjects who are part of the METSIM study. Ethics Committee of the Northern Savo Hospital District approved the study. All participants gave written informed consent. The population-based cross-sectional METSIM study included 10 197 men, aged from 45 to 73 years, who were randomly selected from the population register of the Kuopio town in eastern Finland (population 95000). Every participant had a 1-day outpatient visit to the Clinical Research Unit at the University of Kuopio, including an interview on the history of previous diseases and current drug treatment and an evaluation of glucose tolerance and cardiovascular risk factors. After 12 h of fasting, a 2 h oral 75 g glucose tolerance test was performed and the blood samples were drawn at 0, 30 and 120 min. Plasma glucose was measured by enzymatic hexokinase photometric assay (Konelab Systems reagents; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Vantaa, Finland). Insulin was determined by immunoassay (ADVIA Centaur Insulin IRI no. 02230141; Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA). Height and weight were measured to the nearest 0.5 cm and 0.1 kg, respectively. Waist circumference (at the midpoint between the lateral iliac crest and lowest rib) and hip circumference (at the level of the trochanter major) were measured to the nearest 0.5 cm. Body composition was determined by bioelectrical impedance (RJL Systems) in subjects in the supine position.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from subcutaneous fat biopsies from 770 people participating in the METSIM study
