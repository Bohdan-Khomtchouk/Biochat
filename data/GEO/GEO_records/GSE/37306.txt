TITLE
CGH of Plasmodium falciparum selected with DSM1

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Continual challenge of 107 ARMD Dd2 parasites with 0.3µM DSM1, a novel dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor, reproducibly generated ~5-fold resistance and 3-fold amplification of 30-100Kb DNA, always including the DHODH gene.  Subsequent  3-10µM DSM-1 pressure selected for ~10-fold amplification of the copy number variant (CNV), and over 100-fold resistance.  Target-specific and genome-wide DNA sequencing revealed no additional mutations contributing to DSM1 resistance.

DESIGN
Each DSM1-resistant clone is compared to the Dd2 parent reference sample.
