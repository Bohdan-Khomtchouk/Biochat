SUMMARY
Examine the possible pro-inflammatory gene effects of alloantibody and complement on endothelial cells Microarray 3

DESIGN
Experiment performed three times on three separate microarrays using three separate HUVEC and PRA donors. In each experiment, there are four groups of HUVEC with three replicates per group treated for 4 hours in gelatin veronal buffer containing either complement-inactivated PRA serum, vehicle (gelatin veronal buffer), PRA serum, or non-PRA serum
