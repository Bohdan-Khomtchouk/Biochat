TITLE
Pseudogene INTS6P1 regulates its cognate gene INTS6 through competitive binding of miR-17-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the novel tumor suppressors in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform in HCC and paired normal liver tissues to identify genes which down-regulated in HCC. Among which, INTS6 and its pseudogene, namely INTS6P1, were found to be dramatically down-regulated in HCC. The down-regulated expression of INTS6 and INTS6P1 in HCC was further confirmed by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 3 pairs of HCC and normal liver tissue harvested from patients to undergo microarray study.
