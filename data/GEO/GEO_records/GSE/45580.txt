TITLE
Does Phosphatidylserine (PS) affect gene expression in FD mice?

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genes associated with transcription regulation and development processes were up-regulated in the cerebrum of PS-treated mice.

DESIGN
at 4 months of age 6 FD mice were gavaged with either 200mg/kg PS (3 mice) or medium-chain triglycerides (MCT, 3 mice) every other day for a period of 3 months
