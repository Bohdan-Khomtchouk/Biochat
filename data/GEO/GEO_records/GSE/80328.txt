TITLE
LaminB1 DamID in undifferentiated mouse C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC, Lot 59501261) and differentiated C2C12 myotubes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Maps of genomic regions in proximity to the nuclear lamina were determined in undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts (MBs) and 6 day differentiated C2C12 myotubes (MTs) using DamID with a Dam-Lamin B1-encoding lentivirus.

DESIGN
Examination of Lamin B1-chromatin contacts in one cell line in undifferentiated myoblast and differentiated myotube conditions.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
