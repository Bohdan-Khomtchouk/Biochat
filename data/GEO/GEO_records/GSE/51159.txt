TITLE
Qualitative modeling identifies IL-11 as a novel regulator in maintaining self-renewal in human pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A systems biology approach in which qualitative modeling based on combining boolean networks and in silico perturbation experiments were employed to identify 15 pluripotency regulating cytokines or cytokine related genes. IL-11 was validated as a novel factor capable of maintaing the undifferentiated state of human embryonic stem cells in the absence of exogenously added bFGF to the culture acting via a different mechanims than bFGF.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic microarray data of eight overexpression and knock-down experiments were used for qualitative modeling based on boolean networks to predict novel factors - mainly cytokines - that maintain pluripotent human embryonic stem cells in the absence of bFGF in culture. The culture was maintained for at least 9 passages using and stained positive for alcaline phosphatase staining, OCT3/4, SOX2, NANOG, TRA1-60. Microarray based gene expression profiling showed that the IL-11 treatment occupies an intermediate state, between bFGF treatment and the negative control which is no cytokine treatment as judged by hierarchical clustering. Moreover, KEGG pathway analysis indicates common and additional distinct mechanisms of bFGF and IL-11 dependant pluripotency dependant mechanisms.
