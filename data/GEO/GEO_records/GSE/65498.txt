TITLE
Purification and transcriptomic analysis of mouse fetal Leydig cells reveals candidate genes for disorders of sex development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine the transcriptome of early testicular somatic cells during gonadogenesis at 12.5dpc RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on murine primary testicular cell lineages isolated from the Sf1-eGFP line by FACS. The three main somatic cell lineages of the testis were isolated: the Sertoli cells which direct male development; the fetal Leydig cells (FLCs) that produce steroid hormones and virilise the XY individual and a heterogenous population of interstitial cells, some of which give rise to the adult Leydig cells (ALCs). This dataset provides a platform for exploring the biology of FLCs and understanding the role of these cells in testicular development and masculinization of the embryo, and a basis for targeted studies designed to identify causes of idiopathic XY DSD.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq of 3 enriched cell populations from 12.5dpc mouse gonad (Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and Interstitial cells isolated by FACS-sorting) on an Illumina HiSeq 1500, in triplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL18480 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Mus musculus)
