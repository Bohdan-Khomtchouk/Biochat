TITLE
Rat gene expression in the Nucleus Accumbens in Incubation of Cocaine Craving

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of nucleus Accumbens of rats that self administered cocaine and were subjected to 1 or 30 withdrawal days with or without extinction tests.

DESIGN
The groups consist of 1. Saline rats (Sal.) 2. Rats that self-administered cocaine for 10 days and that were subjected to a withdrawal period of 1 day (1W) 3. Rats that self-administered cocaine for 10 days and that were subjected to a withdrawal period of 1 day and to an extinction test for assessment of cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior (1C) 4. Rats that self-administered cocaine for 10 days and that were subjected to a withdrawal period of 30 days (30W) 5. Rats that self-administered cocaine for 10 days and that were subjected to a withdrawal period of 30 days and to an extinction test for assessment of cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior (30C)
