TITLE
Molecular Characterization of Heat Intolerance in Mice (microRNA data)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prolonged exposure to high temperatures may cause heat-related illnesses, such as cramps, syncope, exhaustion or even stroke in some individuals.  Heat-related injuries remain a threat to the health and operational effectiveness of military personnel, athletes and the general public. Heat injury victims experience long-term complications that may include multi-system organ (liver, kidney, muscle) and neurologic damage, as well as reduced exercise capacity and heat intolerance.  Findings from our laboratory using a developed heat stress model show that about 1/3 of mice are heat-intolerant and vulnerable to heat injury even though they are from the same mice litter. We examined if there is any genetic causation to this pattern of observation between the two groups of mice classified (Heat Intolerant and Heat Tolerant). We would like to screen Heat Tolerant and Heat Intolerant mice samples using microarray technology and examine their microRNA and mRNA for possible gene-specific differences between the two groups (6 mice per group). The results from this proposed animal research will help identify and select potential markers that can be used as a pre-screen to identify heat intolerance and assess heat injury recovery in humans.

DESIGN
Heat-induced physiological and biochemical changes were assessed to determine heat tolerance levels in mice. We performed mRNA and microRNA expression profiling on mouse gastrocnemius muscle tissue samples to determine novel biological pathways associated with heat tolerance.
