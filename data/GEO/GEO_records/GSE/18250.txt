TITLE
Profiling of small RNA populations in rice total extract and purified AGO1 complexes

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small silencing RNAs that have regulatory roles in gene expression. miRNAs interact with Argonaute (AGO) proteins to form effector complexes that can cleave target mRNAs or repress their translation. Rice encodes four AGO1 homologs (AGO1a, AGO1b, AGO1c, and AGO1d). We used an RNAi approach to knock down the four AGO1s. The RNAi lines displayed pleiotropic developmental phenotypes and had increased accumulation of miRNA targets, suggesting the involvement of AGO1s in the miRNA pathway. Three of the AGO1s (AGO1a, AGO1b, and AGO1c complexes) were purified and further characterized. We showed that the three AGO1s all have a strong preference for binding small RNAs (sRNAs) with 5â€™ U and have Slicer activity. We catalogued the sRNAs in each AGO1 complex by deep sequencing, and found all three AGO1s predominantly bound known miRNAs. Most of the miRNAs were evenly distributed in the three AGO1 complexes, suggesting a redundant role for the AGO1s in the function of these miRNAs. Intriguingly, we also found a subset of miRNAs were specifically incorporated into or excluded from one of the AGO1s, suggesting that there is also functional specialization among the rice AGO1s.

DESIGN
