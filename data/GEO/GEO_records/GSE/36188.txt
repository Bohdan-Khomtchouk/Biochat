TITLE
Gene expression analysis in pre- and early post-anthesis stage ovules of Citrus sinensis

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
Nucellar embryony is a form of apomixis found in citrus where somatic nucellar cells differentiate into embryos and are included in the seed resulting from the normal sexual process.  The nucellar cells giving rise to adventive embryo start proliferating prior to anthesis and fully differentiate obtaining nourishment from sexually derived endosperm.  To identify transcripts differentially expressed during nucellar embryo initiation we have taken RNA samplesfrom different developing stages of ovules from polyembryonic (cv. Vaniglia Sanguigno) and monoembryonic (cv. Temple) cultivars. We used microarray for a detailed analysis of global gene expression during nucellar embryony initiation and development. We have further validated the differentially expressed genes using qRT-PCR.

DESIGN
Citrus ovules were harvested from the excised ovaries of different flower developmental stages. These developing stages were decided on the basis of morphological and histological characteristics of flower and female gametophyte, respectively. We selected, Pre anthesis, post anthesis, and initial fruit set stage of flower to excise ovules from Polyembryonic cultivar Vaniglia Sanguigno and  Monoembryonic cultivar Temple. Leaf tissue of Vaniglia Sanguigno was used to check the overall transcriptome level differences between leaf and ovule tissues. For each sample,  three technical replicates were used.
