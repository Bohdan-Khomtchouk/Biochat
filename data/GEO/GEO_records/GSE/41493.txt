TITLE
Expression data from Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines L-428 and L-1236: L-428 and L-1236 cells were transduced with tGFP-EBF1 or as control tGFP-only.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor network in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) represents a unique composition of proteins found in no other hematopoietic cell. An aberrant downregulation of the B cell transcription factor EBF1 is observed in the B cell-derived Hodgkin and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) tumor cells. Herein, we elucidated the consequences of the down regulation of this factor in HL. To obtain a more comprehensive overview of EBF1 regulated genes in cHL cell lines, we performed a gene chip analysis comparing gene expression in tGFP-EBF1-transduced L-1236 and L-428 cells compared to samples transduced with vectors encoding only tGFP.

DESIGN
12 total samples were analyzed. Three independent samples were analyzed per condition and cell line.We generated the following pairwise comparisons using Bioconductor: tGFP-EBF1 L-428 < tGFP L-428;  tGFP-EBF1 L-1236 < tGFP L-1236. Genes with an FDR≤ 5 % and a fold-change ≥ 2.0 and ≤ -2.0 were selected.
