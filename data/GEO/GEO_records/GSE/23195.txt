TITLE
The Streptomyces coelicolor DegS-DegU-like regulon

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)

SUMMARY
The Streptomyces coelicolor two genes operon SCO5784-SCO5785 encodes a two-component system which functions in a similar manner to that of the Bacillus subtilis DegS-DegU system. Propagation of the regulatory gene in high copy number results in the overproduction of several extracellular enzymes, among them the major extracellular protease, as well as in a higher level of synthesis of the antibiotic actinorhodin. This two-component system seems to control various processes characterised by the transition from primary to secondary metabolism in S. coelicolor, as determined by proteomic and transcriptomic analices. The presence of the regulatory gene in high copy number in S. coelicolor additionally seems to elicit a stringent response in the bacterial cell. Therefore, we propose renaming S. coelicolor genes SCO5784 and SCO5785 as degS and degU, respectively.
