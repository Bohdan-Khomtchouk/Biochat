TITLE
Identification of Sc and Esg chromatin-binding sites by ChIP-Seq analysis in progenitor cells of Drosophila midgut

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To study the antagonism between Esg and Sc, we compared their direct binding sites identified by 3HA-esg and 3HA-sc ChIP-Seq. Through ChIP-Seq analysis, 14347 binding sites of Sc and 2765 binding sites of Esg were identified through p-value cutoff 1.00e-05. Among Sc binding sites, 10675 were protein-coding genes and 2678 localized to promoter region. For Esg, 2036 were protein-coding genes and 846 localized to promoter region. Through comparison, 2153 common binding sites were identified, and among these, 1620 were protein-coding genes and 659 localized to promoter region. A common binding region at the promoter of pros was identified.

DESIGN
3HA-esg or 3HA-sc transgenes were expressed in progenitor cells by esg-Gal4. Anti-HA antibody was used for ChIP, followed by deep sequencing analysis.
