TITLE
Fine mapping of regulatory loci for mammalian gene expression using radiation hybrids (control II)

ORGANISM
Cricetulus griseus

SUMMARY
We have mapped regulatory loci for nearly all protein coding genes in the mammalian genome using microarray measurements from a panel of mouse/hamster radiation hybrids. Keywords: regulation of gene expression

DESIGN
A control array to examine the copy number of the A23 Hamster fibroblast cell line vs. Chinese Hamster Kidney Genomic DNA

PLATFORM
GPL4092 Agilent-014695 Mouse Genome CGH Microarray 244A (G4415A) (Feature Number version)
