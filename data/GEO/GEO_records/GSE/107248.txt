TITLE
Genome wide identification of MCM7 binding sites as replication origins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we precisely determined MCM7 binding sites inHeLa cells by ChIP-Seq, classified them into firing and dormant replication origins using SNS data deposited, and analyzed their association with various chromatin signatures.

DESIGN

PLATFORM
GPL18460 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Homo sapiens)
