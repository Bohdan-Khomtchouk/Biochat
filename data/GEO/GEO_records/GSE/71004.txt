TITLE
Identification of the different miRNA expression in Hep-12 Cells compared with Hep-11 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To find miRNAs that regulate the stemness of LTICs, we took advantage of the TIC-enriched Hep-12 and the non-tumorigenic Hep-11 cell lines by genome-wide profiling of miRNA expression with miRNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Two samples are analyzed.
