TITLE
Gene expression in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocyte tissue culture treated with cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid(c9t11 CLA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Trans-10, Cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12 CLA) causes fat loss in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocyte tissue culture; however cis-9, trans-11 CLA does not (this series). The early transcriptome changes were analyzed using high-density microarrays to better characterize the signaling pathways responding to c9t11 CLA.  Their gene expression responses between 8 to 12 hr after treatment showed no gene expression changes indicative of an integrated stress response (ISR). Keywords: control/treatment time course

DESIGN
Mouse 3T3-L1 RNA for each time point was isolated from control and treatment samples for analysis on microarrays; there are four biological reps for the controls for each timepoint, and only one rep for the treatment.
