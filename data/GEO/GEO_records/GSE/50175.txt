TITLE
Expression data from human Th1 and Th1Th17 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We previously demonstrated that Th1Th17 cells are highly permissive to HIV-1, whereas Th1 cells are relatively resistant. Here, we investigated molecular mechanisms underlying these differences. Superior HIV replication in Th1Th17 vs. Th1 cells was regulated by entry and post-entry mechanisms. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression signatures caracterizing Th1 cells from Th1Th17.

DESIGN
Primary human Th1 (CXCR3+CCR6- phenotype) and Th1Th17 (CXCR3+CCR6- phenotype) CD4+ T-cells were isolated by flow cytometry from HIV-uninfected, healthy donors. Cells were stimulated via CD3/CD28 for 3 days. The RNA was extracted and hybridized on the GeneChipÂ® Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix).
