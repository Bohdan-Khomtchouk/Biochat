TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the effects of the rs4919510C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effects of the rs4919510C > G SNP on miRNA-608 target gene expression. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that the rs4919510C > G SNP may influence the expression of miRNA-608 target genes. Results provide important information of the effects of the rs4919510C > G SNP on miRNA-608 target genes, including immunity and defense genes, DNA repair genes, cell growth-related genes, tumor invasion and metastasis-related genes, cancer stem cell-related genes, and cell death-related genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells in both experimental (CNE-1-miRNA-608-C and CNE-1-miRNA-608-G) and control (CNE-1-empty vector) groups.
