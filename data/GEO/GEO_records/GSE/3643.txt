TITLE
Poorly differentiated, human liposarcoma LiSa-2 cell line response to the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of poorly differentiated LiSa-2 liposarcoma (LS) cells treated with the synthetic triterpenoid, 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) or DMSO or a combination of CDDO and DMSO for up to 11 days. Synthetic triterpenoids exert a variety of actions, including anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects, making them potentially useful in cancer therapy. Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of LS. Keywords: disease state analysis, CDDO effect, time course

DESIGN
Temporal analysis of human liposarcoma cell line LiSa-2 subjected to treatment with a synthetic triterpenoid.
