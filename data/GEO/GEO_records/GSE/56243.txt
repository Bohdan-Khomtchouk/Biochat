TITLE
Differentially expressed genes after miRNA or siRNA transfection in human cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes by anti cancer treatments (microRNAs or siRNAs) in human cancer, several cell lines (bladder cancer, prostate cancer, hypopharyngeal cancer and lung squamous cell carcinoma) were subjected to Agilent whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Human cancer cell lines (BOY, BOY-GFP, T24, PC3, FaDU, LNCap, DU145, EBC-1 and SK-MES-1 ) were treated with miRNAs (miR-218, miR-24, miR-144, miR-451, miR-221, miR-222, miR-224, miR-1, miR-133a and miR-452), siRNAs (si-LASP1 and si-FOXM1).
