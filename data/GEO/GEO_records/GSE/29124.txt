TITLE
Sch9 regulates ribosome biogenesis via Stb3, Dot6 and Tod6 and the histone deacetylase complex RPD3L (ChIP-Seq data)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
TORC1 is a structurally and functionally conserved multiprotein complex that regulates many aspects of eukaryote growth including the synthesis and assembly of ribosomes. The protein kinase activity of this complex is responsive to environmental cues and is potently inhibited by the natural product macrolide rapamycin. Insights into how TORC1 regulates growth have been provided with the recent identification of the rapamycin-sensitive phosphoproteome in yeast. Building on these data, we show here that Sch9, an AGC family kinase and direct substrate of TORC1, promotes ribosome biogenesis (ribi) and ribosomal protein (RP) gene expression via direct inhibitory phosphorylation of three transcription repressors, Stb3, Dot6 and Tod6. Dephosphorylation of these factors allows them to recruit the RPD3L histone deactelyase complex to ribi/RP gene promoters. Since rRNA and tRNA transcription are also under its control, Sch9 appears to be well positioned to coordinately regulate transcriptional aspects of ribosome biogenesis.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq of 8 S. cerevisiae strains treated with 1NM-PP1, a small molecule inhibitor for analog-sensitive kinases such as sch9-as.
