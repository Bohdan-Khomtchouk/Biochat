TITLE
To identify novel metastasis-associated gene candidates in colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A gene expression profiling suggested some gene candidates associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis, which were validated by qPCR investigation of the mRNA levels in clinical specimens

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment,  tumor tissue versus the adjacent non-tumor tissue. Biological replicates: 4

PLATFORM
GPL1708 Agilent-012391 Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray G4112A (Feature Number version)
