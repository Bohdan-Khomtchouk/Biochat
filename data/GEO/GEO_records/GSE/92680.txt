TITLE
Expression data from CD4+ T cells isolated from inguinal lymph nodes 7 days post MOG immunization

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We isolated CD4+ T cells from draining lymph nodes 7 days post EAE from DA rats treated with vitamin D supplemented, vitamin D deprived or regular diet

DESIGN
EAE was induced with MOG in age matched DA rats. After isolation of CD4+ T cells with FACS, RNA was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis. We were interested in the effect of vitaimin D on the transcriptome of CD4+ T cells. Thus we did microarray analysis on 3 different groups: DA rats treated with vitamin D supplemented, vitamin D deprived or regular diet
