TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of Prokineticin-1-regulated genes in human term myometrium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Infiltration of human myometrium and cervix with leukocytes and formation of a pro-inflammatory environment within the uterus has been associated with the initiation of both term and preterm parturition. The mechanism regulating the onset of this pro-inflammatory cascade is not fully elucidated. We demonstrate that prokineticin 1 (PROK1) is up-regulated in human myometrium and placenta during labour. Gene array analysis identified 65 genes up-regulated by PROK1 in human myometrium, mainly cytokines and chemokines including: Interleukin-1beta (IL1B), chemokine C-C motif ligand 3 (CCL3) and Colony Stimulating Factor 3 (CSF3). We additionally demonstrate that PROK1 increases expression of chemokines C-C motif ligand 20 (CCL20), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), prostaglandin synthase 2 (PTGS2) and prostaglandin E2 and F2Î± secretion. We propose that PROK1 is a novel inflammatory mediator that can contribute to onset of human parturition at term and partially mediate premature onset of inflammatory pathways during bacterial infection.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from human term non-labour myometrium explants treated with prokineticin for 6 and 24 hours compared to vehicle-treated explants. Six biological replicates were analyzed for each treatment and time point. Two of the 6-hour vehicle samples failed a quality-control analysis and were substituted with a 4-hour vehicle treatment from the same tissue sample in each case.
