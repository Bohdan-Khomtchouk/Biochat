TITLE
Expression data from healthy smokers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about alteration of the global gene expression by cigarette smoke (CS) and few biomarkers for smoking-related harm are available. We used Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChips to measure the transcriptomes in lymphocytes of 23 current healthy smokers. When heavy smokers were compared with light smokers, 311 genes demonstrated a significant difference in mRNA expression of their blood lymphocytes. Keywords: dose response

DESIGN
The goals of this study were to evaluate novel gene expression profiles and pathways affected by cigarette smoking, and to identify potential biomarkers for cigarette smoke exposure and harm. To this end,  we isolated the PBMC from 10 heavy and 13 light smokers, determined their gene expression profiles with Affymetrix microarray and analyzed their relationship with cigarette smoking.
