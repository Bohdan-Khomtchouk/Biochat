TITLE
Repeated monthly epicutaneous challenges with diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The level of reactivity in pre-sensitized individuals following repeated epicutaneous challenges with diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) remains unknown. We studied the kinetics and time-course of the developing reactivity to this potent contact sensitizer using genome-wide gene expression data

DESIGN
Ten healthy human volunteers were sensitized to DPCP. Five or six elicitation challenges were performed and punch biopsies were selected from vehicle control and challenge sites for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
