TITLE
ISR target genes in muscle of hSA::Fv2E-PERK

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the target genes of integrated stress reponse (ISR) in skeletal muscle, we have employed whole genome microarray expression in muscle specific Fv2E-PERK transgenic mice and C2C12 myotubes expressed in Fv2E-PERK. As a result, we identified that Fgf21 mRNA expression was commonly induced in skeletal muscle and C2C12.

DESIGN
The hSA::Fv2E-PERK transgenic mice were injected by AP20187 or mock. C2C12-Fv2E-PERK was also stimulated with AP20187.
