TITLE
The influence of snRNA and ER stress on alternative splicing in B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
B cells treated with LPS undergo stress and Ire1 phosphorylation by 18 hours. We measured the effect of inhibiting the Ire1 phosphorylation with the drug 4u8c on gene expression and RNA splicing.

DESIGN
We analyzed 10 wild type C57BL/6 mouse B cell samples. Four of these samples were replicates for wild type unstimulated B cells, three were stimulated with LPS and collected at 18 hours, and three were stimulated with LPS + the RIDD inhibitor 4u8c and collected at 18 hours.
