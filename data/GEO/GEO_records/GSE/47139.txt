TITLE
Expression data from pig oviduct in response to X or Y chromosome bearing spermatozoa

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The objective of the present study is to investigate if females have the ability to recognise X or Y chromosome bearing spermatozoa and present a different response to different spermatozoa.

DESIGN
In order to investigate if females have the ability to recognise X or Y chromosome bearing spermatozoa and present a different response to different spermatozoa. Samples of semen were sorted for chromosomal sex by ï¬‚ow cytometric-sorting. Using laparoscopic insemination one oviduct was inseminated with X spermatozoa and the contralateral oviduct was inseminated with Y spermatozoa.This allowed us to obtain samples from the oviduct in contact with X sperm and Y sperm in the the contrlateral oviduct from the same sow. Oviduct pig samples were collected for RNA isolation and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Four biological replicates were performed (n= 4 sows) and a total of 8 arrays were used for microarrays study (4 arrays for oviduct samples in contact with X spermatozoa and 4 arrays for oviduct samples in contact with Y spermatozoa.
