TITLE
Molecular Effects of Doxycycline Treatment on Pterygium from Caucasian Patients as Revealed by Massive Transcriptome Sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genes were identified which modified their expression in a dose-dependent manner upon exposure to doxycycline. The more represented cellular pathways included all mitochondrial genes, the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, integrins and extracellular matrix components, and growth factors.

DESIGN
Examination of 4 different doses of doxycycline in three human pterygium samples.
