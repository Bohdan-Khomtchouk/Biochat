TITLE
ChIP-seq of AP4 binding in human colorectal cancer cells DLD-1.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to comprehensively identify genes directly regulated by AP4, a genome-wide chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP) followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed after activation of a conditional AP4 allele in DLD-1 cells.

DESIGN
One DLD-1 Sample was sequenced.
