TITLE
Expression data from mouse mast cell progenitors, mature mast cells and innate lymphoid cells of type 2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mast cells originate from the bone marrow and develop into c-kit+ FcεRI+ cells. As both mast cell progenitors and mature mast cells express these cell surface markers, ways validated to distinguish between the two maturation forms with flow cytometry have been lacking. We identified and sorted two distinct populations of mast cells from mouse peritoneum. Gene expression microarray analyses were used to confirm the maturation statuses of the mast cell populations.

DESIGN
Gene expression microarray analyses were performed on mast cell progenitors, mature mast cell, and innate lymphoid cells of type 2. The cells were extracted from the peritoneal cavity of five naïve BALB/c mice. Individual variations were minimized by pooling the cells from all mice. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to isolate the mast cell progenitors, the mature mast cells, and the innate lymphoid cells of type 2. Innate lymphoid cells of type 2 were included in the study as they are distantly related to mast cells.
