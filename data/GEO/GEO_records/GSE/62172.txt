TITLE
Poplar-Laccaria: A Timecourse of Mycorrhizal Root Tip Development

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
This study characterizes the transcriptomic alterations of P. trichocarpa during interaction with the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor S238N. Four time-points were analyzed, two weeks, four weeks , six weeks and twelve weeks after inoculation.

DESIGN
We performed 32 hybridizations (NimbleGen) with samples derived from Populus trichocarpa control roots and P.trichocarpa mycorrhizal root tips. Samples were taken after 2,4,6 and 12 weeks of interaction (four biological replicates).  All samples were labeled with Cy3.

PLATFORM
