TITLE
Epidermis-specific ribosome profiling to describe the translational landscape of SOX2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SOX2 signalling is required SCC initiation and maintenance. Ribosome profiling was used to describe the translational landscape of WT and SOX2 overexpressing P4 epidermis.

DESIGN
Mouse P4 WT and SOX2 epidermis was isolated for ribosome profiling and RNAseq. Furthermore, cultured WT, SOX2 and HRASG12V; TGFBR-2 KO keratinocytes were used for ribosome profiling.

PLATFORM
