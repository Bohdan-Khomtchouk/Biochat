TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiles for paediatric brain tumours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we screened a cohort of 57 paediatric brain tumours, with a wide range of pathologies to identify microRNA profiles

DESIGN
We analysed the microRNA profiles in paediatric brain tumours as compared to normal adult brain. Our cohort included 14 pilocytic astrocytomas, 3 diffuse astrocytomas, 2 anaplastic astrocytomas, 5 glioblastomas, 14 ependymomas, 9 medulloblastomas, 5 atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumours, 4 choroid plexus papillomas, 1 papillary glioneuronal, and 7 adult brain controls.
