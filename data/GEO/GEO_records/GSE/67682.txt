TITLE
A genome-wide analysis of MDS and MDS/MPN patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the molecular changes in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and to explore novel genetic abnormalities occurring in these disorders through a genome-wide study in a series of MDS and MDS/MPN patients. A total of 285 abnormalities were identified in 71 patients. Three high-risk MDS cases displayed chromothripsis. In addition, cryptic deletions were identified in genomic regions where MDS-related genes, such as DNMT3A (2p23.3), TET2 (4q24), RUNX1 (21q22) and BCOR (Xp11.4), are located.

DESIGN
A genome-wide analysis of molecular changes in a series of 301 MDS and MDS/MPN patients
