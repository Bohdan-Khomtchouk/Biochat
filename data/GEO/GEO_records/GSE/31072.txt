TITLE
Structural genomic variation among soybean NIL's using CGH approach

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
CGH was used to map structural variation (introgressed regions) among soybean iron-inefficient NIL IsoClark with its iron-efficient recurrent parent Clark and donor parent T203. Another NIL series HiPro, LoPro was also used in the study.

DESIGN
CGH Comparisions were made among a NIL IsoClark with its parents Clark and T203; also comparisions were made among HiPro and LoPro NIL series. The soybean tiling array consists of 700k probes, spaced at approximately 1.1 kb intervals.
