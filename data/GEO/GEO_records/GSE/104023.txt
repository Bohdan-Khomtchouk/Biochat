TITLE
Transcriptional signature of human pro-inflammatory TH17 cells [TH17 clones]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human IL-10– and IL-10+ TH17 clones maintained their pro- or anti-inflammatory characteristics after long-term culture. There were similarities between human IL-10– vs. IL-10+ TH17 clones and mouse pathogenic vs. non-pathogenic TH17 cells.

DESIGN
From healthy donors (n=5), CD4+ T cells clones were established from CCR6+CCR4+CXCR3– memory CD4+ T cells that were enriched for TH17 cells 14, 18 and screened for clones producing IL-17 with or without co-secretion of IL-10.
