SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Yin Shen ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track shows a comprehensive survey of cis-regulatory elements in the mouse genome by using ChIP-seq (Robertson et al., 2007) to identify transcription factor binding sites and chromatin modification profiles in many mouse (C57Bl/6) tissues and primary cells, including bone marrow, cerebellum, cortex, heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) and embryonic stem (ES) cells. In specific, the Ren lab examined RNA polymerase II (PolII), co-activator protein p300, the insulator protein CTCF, and two chromatin modification marks H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 due to their demonstrated utilities in identifying promoters, enhancers and insulator elements (Barski et al., 2007; Blow et al., 2010; Heintzman et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2005a; Visel et al., 2009). Enrichment of H3K4me3 or PolII signals is a strong indicator of active promoter, while the presence of p300 or H3K4me1 outside of promoter regions has been used as a mark for enhancers. CTCF binding sites are considered as a mark for potential insulator elements. For each transcription factor or chromatin mark in each tissue, ChIP-seq was carried out with at least two biological replicates. Each experiment produced 20-30 million monoclonal, uniquely mapped tags. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
