TITLE
Modulation of TET2 expression and 5-methylcytosine oxidation by the CXXC domain protein IDAX

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Idax/Cxxc4 is the CXXC domain protein that preferentially binds unmethylated CpG sites in vitro. By performing genome-wide mapping of Idax/Cxxc4, we report here that Idax is preferentially enriched in CpG-rich regions in genome including the promoters containing CpG islands.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq binding site detection of Myc-Idax and Myc-IdaxDBM over cells expressing an empty vector in stable HEK293T cell lines; two replicates per condition (2x ChIP Myc-Idax, 2x ChIP Myc-IdaxDBM, 2xChIP empty vector)

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
