TITLE
WRKY45-dependent rice genes

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
WRKY45-dependent rice genes:  Mock- and benzothiadiazole (BTH)-treated wild-type (Nipponbare NB) rice and mock- and BTH-treated WRKY45-knockdown (W45-kd) rice (line #15) were analyzed in four biological replicates at 12 and 24 h after the treatment.  Mock- and benzothiadiazole (BTH)-treated wild-type (Nipponbare NB) rice and mock- and BTH-treated WRKY45-knockdown (W45-kd) rice (line #3) were analyzed in four biological replicates at 24 h after the treatment.

DESIGN
Mock- and benzothiadiazole (BTH)-treated wild-type (Nipponbare NB) rice and mock- and BTH-treated WRKY45-knockdown (W45-kd) rice (line #15) were analyzed in four biological replicates at 12 and 24 h after the treatment.  Mock- and benzothiadiazole (BTH)-treated wild-type (Nipponbare NB) rice and mock- and BTH-treated WRKY45-knockdown (W45-kd) rice (line #3) were analyzed in four biological replicates at 24 h after the treatment.
