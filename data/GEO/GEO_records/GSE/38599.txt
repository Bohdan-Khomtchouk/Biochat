TITLE
Global microRNAs profile and signaling pathways in the development of hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aberrantly expressed differences of microRNAs in the cardiac hypertrophy model between sham surgery and TAC surgery methods were successfully detected. The global miR expression profile, comprehensive prediction of miR targets and signaling pathway analysis during cardiac hypertrophy were conducted in depth.
