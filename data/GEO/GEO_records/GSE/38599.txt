TITLE
Global microRNAs profile and signaling pathways in the development of hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aberrantly expressed differences of microRNAs in the cardiac hypertrophy model between sham surgery and TAC surgery methods were successfully detected. The global miR expression profile, comprehensive prediction of miR targets and signaling pathway analysis during cardiac hypertrophy were conducted in depth.

DESIGN
In this study, the aberrantly expressed situation of microRNAs in the cardiac hypertrophy model with TAC surgery was compared with the one in the sham surgery model, which was used with MicroRNA microarray assay. Besides, related bioinformatics analyses including miR targets and signaling pathway were finished.

PLATFORM
