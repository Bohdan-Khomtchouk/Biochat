TITLE
Expression profiling of MLL-AF10 myeloid leukemia cellular subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Leukemia cells from mice with MLL-AF10 AML were fractionated into separate sub-populations on the basis of c-kit expression, which correlates with MLL LSC frequency (Somervaille and Cleary, 2006).  The sorted AML sub-populations exhibited substantial differences in their frequencies of AML CFCs/LSCs (mean 14-fold) and morphologic features, consistent with a leukemia cell hierarchy with maturation through to terminally differentiated neutrophils.

DESIGN
Leukemic splenocytes from four mice with MLL-AF10 AML were sub-fractionated in to c-kit high and c-kit negative sub-populations by FACS.
