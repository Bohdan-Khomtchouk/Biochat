TITLE
The microbial functional structure along an elevation gradient of the Shennongjia Mountain as characterized by GeoChip

ORGANISM
uncultured soil microorganism

SUMMARY
Known as “The Oriental Botanic Garden” and the natural gene bank of biological species, Shennongjia is one of the most biologically diverse areas in China and a member of UNESCO's World Network of Biosphere Reserves. The macro-organism resources of shennongjia have been deeply explored. However, the microbial community structure was scarcely detected. In this study, we aim to detedect the microbial community along six sites of Shennonajia Mountain and explore the major controlling factor in shaping microbial community with a microarray-based metagenomics tool named GeoChip 4.2.

DESIGN
Seventy-three samples were collected from six sites along the Shennongjia Mountain, with 5-15 replicates in every site

PLATFORM
