TITLE
Identification of TRIM24-dependent gene expression programs in prostate cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this experiment we are exploring which genes are regulated by TRIM24 in androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.

DESIGN
LNCaP and LNCaP-abl were transfected with siRNA targeting either control or TRIM24 for 48h. The cells were additionally stimulated with 10nM DHT or vehicle for 24h.
