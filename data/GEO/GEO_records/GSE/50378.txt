TITLE
Expression data of HUVEC cells after PPARβ/δ agonist and/or hypoxia treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recently the role of PPARβ/δ in angiogenesis has been revealed, and we hypothesized that the crosstalk between hypoxia and PPARβ/δ on endothelial cells may exsist. To elucidate the interaction between two signalings, we report the comprehensive change of transcripts induced by PPARβ/δ agonist (GW501516) and/or hypoxia. We used microarray analysis of HUVECs treated with PPARβ/δ agonist (GW501516) and/or hypoxia (1% O2) for 24-hours, and we identified a group of consistently up- or down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
HUVECs were used within the first 6 passages. HUVECs were treated with PPARβ/δ agonist (GW501516) at a concentration of 100 nM and/or hypoxia (1% O2) for 24-hours. Same concentration of DMSO was used as a control sample, and as to the oxgen, normoxia was used as a control condition.
