TITLE
Circadian rhythms of sense and antisense transcription in a highly polyploid crop.

ORGANISM
Saccharum hybrid cultivar (mixed)

SUMMARY
Sugarcane plants were grown in soil in a 12h light/ 12h dark photoperiod and 26oC for 3 months. Then, the plants were transferred to constant light conditions and 24 h later, leaves were harvested every 4 h for 48 h.

DESIGN
Samples were collected from 24 h in constant light to 68 h in constant light and were labelled accordingly. Two biological replicates of each time point were made, with a dye swap with the reference. The reference used was a equimolar solution of all samples.
