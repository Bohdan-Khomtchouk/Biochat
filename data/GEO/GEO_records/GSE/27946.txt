TITLE
Effect of hpyAVIBM, a C5 cytosine methyltransferase deletion on the Helicobacter pylori transcriptome

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori ; Helicobacter pylori 26695 ; Helicobacter pylori SS1

SUMMARY
Helicobacter pylori genome is rich in restriction - modification (R-M) systems. Around 4 % of the genome codes for components of R-M systems. hpyAVIBM, which codes for a putative phase-variable C5 - cytosine methyltransferase (MTase) from H. pylori lacks a cognate restriction enzyme.

DESIGN
To analysis the effect of deleting hpyAVIBM on the Helicobacter pylori transcriptome, microarray analysis was done with the wild type strains and corresponding hpyAVIBM deletion strains.
