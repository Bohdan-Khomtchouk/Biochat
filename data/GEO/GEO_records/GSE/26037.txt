TITLE
Gene expression analysis in the absence of Creb in Pomc-expressing neurons of the hypothalamus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Brain-derived serotonin favors appetite in mice following its binding to the Htr1a and Htr2b receptors in arcuate neurons of the hypothalamus. In this study, we identified that CREB is the transcriptional effector of brain-derived serotonin control of appetite in arcuate nuclei.

DESIGN
In this dataset, we identified the downstream genes of CREB in arcuate neurons of the hypothalamus controling appetite. We isolated hypothalami of wild type and Creb-pomcCre-/- (deleted for Creb selectively in arcuate neurons of the hypothalamus) mice and performed microarray experiments.
