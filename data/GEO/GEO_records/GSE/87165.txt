TITLE
Sequencing analysis for 5hmC pull-down DNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The gene body regions of cardiomyocyte-specific genes in cardiomyocytes are hypomethylated. We confirmed that the DNA methylation in gene body regions were demethylated during development. We speculated that the demethylation of gene body regions in cardiomyocyte-specific genes might be associated with active demethylation by Tet oxidation.To explore 5hmC distribution in cells and tissues, we performed 5hmC-specific chemical labeling-mediated pull-down DNA sequencing (hMe-Seal)(Song 2011 Nat genet, PMID:21151123). We found that the 5hmC in gene body regions are associated with demethylation, but not exclusively, and also with transcriptional activity. We concluded that gene body DNA hypomethylation in cardiomyocyte specific genes were mediated by oxidative demethylation.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from ESC and heart and liver tissues from different developmental periods was used for the analysis.
