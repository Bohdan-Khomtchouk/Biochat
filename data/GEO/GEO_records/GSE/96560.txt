TITLE
Effect of BET bromodomain inhibition with JQ1 in stressed human derived iPS cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile of endothelin-1 (ET-1) stressed human derived iPS cardiomyocytes (from Cellular Dynamics) with or without the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1

DESIGN
Human derived iPS cardiomyocytes from Cellular Dynamics were cultured according to manufacturers protocol with a 4 day serum starvation following by pre-treatment with either JQ1 ( ) or DMSO for 3 hours then stimulation with endothelin-1

PLATFORM
