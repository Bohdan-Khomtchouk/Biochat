TITLE
DNA methylation profiles of human saliva

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to analyze n=259 human saliva samples from Caucasians (non-Hispanic whites) and Hispanics collected from the PEG study (directed by Dr Beate Ritz). The main goal of the study was to measure the epigenetic age (also known as DNA methylation age) of saliva. To measure DNA methylation age, we used the epigenetic clock software described in Horvath S (n=2013) DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types. Genome Biology.2013, 14:R115. DOI: 10.1186/10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115 PMID: 24138928.

DESIGN
The data set contains men and women of two ethnic backgrounds: Hispanics and Caucasians. Sex: Indicates whether the sample came from a female or male human subject. Age: Chronological age at the time of the DNA sample collection. Ethnicity: Two values: Hispanic (living in the US) and Caucasian (living in the US).
