TITLE
Renal allograft dysfunction (kidney tissue data set)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study comprises various components:  Samples TD:  We aims to screen out different gene expression profile in donor biopsies after revascularization ,  We aims to predict renal allograft dysfunction early after transplantation.  Samples AR, ATN, Tx:  We aim to screen out different gene expression profile in acute rejection on the kidney.  We aim to screen out different gene expression profile in acute tubular necrosis on the kidney.  Results from the various study components can help to diagnose renal allograft dysfunction with different causes by distinct gene expression profile.  Keywords: acute rejection, acute tubular necrosis, donor biopsies, renal allograft dysfunction

DESIGN
Samples AR1-AR17: This study has been accomplished with 17 patients of acute rejection on the kidney.Technical replicates: 2 replicates  Samples ATN1-ATN5: This study has been accomplished with 5 patients of acute tubular necrosis on the kidney. Technical replicates: 2 replicates  Samples Tx1-Tx14: This study has been accomplished with 14 patients of stable renal function on the kidney.Tecnical replicates:2 replicates(except Tx12)  Samples TD1-TD12: This study has been accomplished with 12 patients of donor tissue with stable function early after transplantation on the kidney.Technical replicates: 2 replicates  Samples TD13-TD21: This study has been accomplished with 9 patients of donor tissue with renal dysfunction early after transplantation on the kidney.Technical replicates: 2 replicates
