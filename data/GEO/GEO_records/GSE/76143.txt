TITLE
Zscan10 is dispensable for maintenance of pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Zinc finger and SCAN domain-containing 10 (Zscan10, also known as Zfp206) encodes a transcription factor that has been reported to be involved in the maintenance of pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here we generated inducible knockout ES cells for Zscan10 using the Cre-loxP system and analyzed its function. We succeeded in establishing Zscan10-null ES cells and confirmed their pluripotency by the generation of chimeric embryos. Our results clearly indicate that Zscan10 is dispensable for the ability of self-renewal and differentiation in ES cells.

DESIGN
An inducible knockout ES cell line of Zscan10 with the Cre-loxP system was generated and gene expression was measured without Zscan10 deletion or constitutive knocked out cells. Each sample was prepared in triplicate.
