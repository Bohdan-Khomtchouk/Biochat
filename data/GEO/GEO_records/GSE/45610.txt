TITLE
Gene expression profile of mouse ES cells treated with 1mM valproic acid for 8 hours

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) cause hyperacetylation of bulk histones and H3K4 hypermethylation in a variety of cell types. They find clinical application as anti-epileptics and chemotherapeutic agents, but the pathways through which they alter cell physiology remain unclear. Surprisingly, changes in gene expression caused by HDACi are often limited in extent and can be positive or negative. Here we have explored the ability of the clinically important HDACi valproic acid (VPA) to alter gene expression in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.

DESIGN
CCE/R mouse embryonic stem cells were treated with 1mM valproic acid for 8 hours.  Four biological replicates were carried out. Treated cells were labelled with Cy5 and untreated controls with cy3 except in replicate 4 which was a dye-swap.
