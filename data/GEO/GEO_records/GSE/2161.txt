SUMMARY
The Dlx homeodomain transcription factors are implicated in regulating the function of inhibitory neurons; therefore understanding their functions will provide insights into disorders such as epilepsy, mental retardation, autism and cerebral palsy. Identify genes that are dysregulated in the telencephalon of Dlx1/2 mutants. I am sending separate samples of the Basal Ganglia (BG) and cortex (Ctx). Comparing gene expression in the embryonic basal ganglia and cortex in wild type and dlx1/2 mutant mice will provide information regarding the types of genes that are downstream of Dlx1/2 function. Perform gene array analyses in duplicate or triplicate; compare expression profile of total RNA from wild type and dlx1/2 telencephalons. I am sending separate samples of the Basal Ganglia (BG) and cortex. I want to perform gene expression comparison between: 1) wild type and dlx1/2 basal ganglia (BG) 2) wild typee and dlx1/2 cortex (ctx) Age of all mice has been indicated as 14 days to satisfy system requirements, however all mice are embryonic day 14.5.
