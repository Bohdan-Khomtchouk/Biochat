TITLE
Time course of oxidative stress responses in yeast, caused by Menadione or hydrogen peroxide

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Oxidative stress caused by Menadione or Hydrogen peroxide in synchronized Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures. Alpha factor synchronized cultures (0.2-0.4 OD), treated at the beginning of S phase (25 min after release from G1 arrest) with either 2 mM Menadione (MD) or 0.24 mM Hydrogen peroxide (HP), show cell cycle effects. Cells treated with MD arrested at G1. Cells treated with HP delayed at S and then, after removal of HP at 135 minutes , continued the cell cycle, only to arrest at G2/M. Growth was carried out in 30C with shaking (295 rpm). Two time course experiments were performed with each oxidative stress agent, designated as H2O2 and H2O2_II,  MD and MD_II.
