TITLE
Expression data from mouse ES and iPS cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were produced from reprogramming of somatic cells, and they are shown to possess pluripotent properties similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here we used microarrays to detail the global expression pattern among the ES cells and iPS cells, as well as the original mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF), to identify important players involved in the reprogramming process.

DESIGN
Mouse ES cell cultures, as well as selected iPS cell lines and the original MEF cells they were derived from, were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Three biological replicates for each sample were processed.  GeneChips were processed and data were analyzed as previously described (Zeng et al., Dev Biol 20004).
