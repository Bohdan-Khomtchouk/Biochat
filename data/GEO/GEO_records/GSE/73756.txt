TITLE
Gene expression analysis between CD20- CD138- and CD20+ CD138+ subpopulations using sorted MWCL-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For the complete cure of tumors, it is essential to eliminate cancer-initiating cells (CICs). Immunohistochemically, most tumor cells were CD20 and/or CD138 positive in clinical samples of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL), and CD20- CD138- cells were hardly detected. Therefore, useful positive markers expressing in a candidate of CICs of LPL are necessary. First, we performed gene expression microarray analysis between CD20- CD138- and CD20+ CD138+ subpopulations using sorted Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia cell line (MWCL-1).

DESIGN
Two dye-swap experiment was performed onto Human GE 4Ã—44K V2 arrays (G4845A; Agilent Technologies).
