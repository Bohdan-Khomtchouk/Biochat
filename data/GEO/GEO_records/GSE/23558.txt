TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene Expression Profiling of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) was performed to delineate candidate genes clusters with potential to distinguish normal and tumor tissue from oral cavity. All tissue samples were collected after obtaining written informed consent.

DESIGN
The RNA profile of 27 OSCC patients was compared with 4 independent controls and 1 pooled control oral cavity tissue from healthy donors. Agilent one-color experiment, Organism: Human, Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F
