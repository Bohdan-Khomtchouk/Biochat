TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of post-positive selection thymocytes from HOIL- and SHARPIN-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice lacking components of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) exhibit defects in thymocyte differentiation. To determine how two LUBAC components, HOIL and SHARPIN, mediate their effects, we purified thymocytes from CD4Cre Hoil-fl/fl or Sharpin-cpdm mice and compared their transcriptional profile to WT controls. We focused on the CD69+ MHCI low and CD69+ MHCI high subsets that follow positive selection.

DESIGN
Thymocytes were prepared from 3 wildtype mice, 3 Cd4Cre Hoil-floxed mice and 3 Sharpin-cpdm mutant mice. CD69+ MHC I high and CD69+ MHC I low cells from each mouse were FACS purified on a MoFlo cell sorter.
