TITLE
Expression data from in vitro and ex vivo Th1- and Th17-polarized TRP1 TCR transgenic CD4+ cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Serial comparison between Th1 and Th17 tumor-specific cells cultured in vitro and ex vivo after transferred into sublethaly irradiated B6.PL mice. Th17-derived cells acquire Th1-like properties in vivo but maintain a distinct molecular profile.

DESIGN
TRP1 CD4+ T cells were peptide stimulated under Th1 and Th17 conditions for 7 days. mRNA was collected on the day of adoptive transfer and from multiple replicates on day 5 and 15 after adoptive transfer from pooled spleens and inguinal lymph nodes. Tissues were enriched for CD4 by negative selection and sorted by flow cytometry for the expression of Thy1.2.
