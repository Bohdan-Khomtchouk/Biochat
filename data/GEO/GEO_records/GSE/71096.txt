TITLE
PAR-CLIP analysis of YTHDC1, SRSF1, SRSF3, SRSF7, SRSF9 and SRSF10 in human HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Label the cells overexpressed Flag tagged YTHDC1, SRSF1, SRSF3, SRSF7, SRSF9 and SRSF10 with 4-SU, the RNA bound by YTHDC1 and SRSF proteins can be got by Flag IP followed by RNA isolation by using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent by following the company manual.the RNA was then used for library preparation using a TruSeq™ RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.The libraries were sequenced using HiSeq2000 (Illumina) in single-read mode, creating reads with a length of 101 bp. Sequencing chemistry v2 (Illumina) was used and samples were multiplexed in two samples per lane.

DESIGN
Discovery of the binding motif of YTHDC1, SRSF1, SRSF3, SRSF7, SRSF9 or SRSF10  in overexpressed Human HeLa cells

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
