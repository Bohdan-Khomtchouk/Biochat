TITLE
Gene expression during testis development in Duroc boars

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to combine understanding between a timeline for molecular and macroscopic functions in the testis of the Duroc boar.  To achieve this, cluster and pathway analysis was performed based on microarray transcripts from four pubertal timepoints with known steroidogenic status and known morphological maturation status.

DESIGN
Gene expression study of testes biopsies from Duroc boars, taken at age 12, 16, 20 and 27 weeks of age, using in-house printed porcine two-colour cDNA microarrays.
