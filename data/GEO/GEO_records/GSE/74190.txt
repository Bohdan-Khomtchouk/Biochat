TITLE
The miRNA expression profiles in three subtypes of lung carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify unique miRNA profiles in lung carcinomas, we evaluated the expression levels of 723 miRNAs in LCM-selected small cell lung carcinoma(SCLC), adenocarcinoma(AC) and squamous cell carcinoma(SQ) cells derived from 82 snap-frozen surgical specimens using microarrays. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that 16 of 16 SCLC, 28 of 36 AC, and 29 of 30 SQ were correctly classified using 16 differentially expressed miRNAs.

DESIGN
Expression profiles of 723 human miRNAs were investigated in selected LCM cancerous cell populations and normal cells derived from 16 SCLC, 36 AC, 30 SQ and 44 adjacent normal tissues.
