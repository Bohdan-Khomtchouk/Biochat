TITLE
Chronic low dose-rate versus acute ionizing radiation induced gene expression in primary derived prostate fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using a novel flood source construct, we performed a direct comparison of genome-wide gene expression regulations resulting from exposure of primary human prostate fibroblast cultures to acute (10cGy and 200cGy) and longer-term chronic (1.0-2.45cGy cumulative over 24hr) exposures.

DESIGN
Samples were collected at 24 hours after an acute 10cGy or 200cGy exposure (48cGy per minute) versus immediately after an accumulated 24 hour chronic 1.0 to 2.45cGy low dose-rate exposure (7 to 17µGy per minute).  Control 0cGy samples were collected at the same time.  A total of 4 independent experimental replicates were used for each sample resulting in (2 individuals × 4 experimental conditions × 4 experimental replicates) 32 microarrays.
