TITLE
A rapid and scalable system for studying gene function in mice using conditional RNA interference

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Four libraries were analyzed to assess the level and effects of inducing the ectopic expression of a luciferase targeting miRNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Here, we find low level, leaky expression in the absence of ROSA-rtTA and doxycyclin. When expression is effectively induced, the Luciferase miRNA is expressed as the 8th most abundant species in the cells. Keyword(s): Epigenetics
