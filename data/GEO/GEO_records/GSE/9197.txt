TITLE
Gene expression in E.coli K-12 MC4100 at 37˚C and 23˚C in M9 glycerol exponential phase growth

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Because many virulence genes in E. coli and other pathogens are regulated by temperature, we wanted to determine on a genome-wide scale which genes are modulated in adapting to both human host temperature (37˚C) and ambient room temperature (23˚C).  Overall, 126 genes were found to be more highly expressed at 37˚C (1) whereas 297 genes were more highly expressed at 23˚C (2).  Genes involved in the uptake and utilization of amino acids, carbohydrates, and iron dominated the 37˚C list, supporting a model in which temperature serves as a host cue to increase expression of bacterial genes needed for growth. 122 of the 297 genes more highly expressed at 23˚C are RpoS-controlled, confirming genome-wide the model that low temperature serves as a primary cue to trigger the general stress response.  Several genes expressed at 23˚C overlap with the cold shock response, suggesting that strategies used to adapt to sudden shifts in temperature also mediate long-term growth at 23˚C.  Another category of genes more highly expressed at 23˚C are associated with biofilm development, implicating temperature as an important cue influencing this developmental pathway. 1.)

DESIGN
Growth and medium conditions were chosen (M9 glycerol medium with aeration) that maximize papBA transcription at 37˚C so we could use this operon as a temperature-regulated positive control in our microarrays.  Parallel cultures grown at 37˚C and 23˚C were harvested in exponential phase (OD600=0.2-0.6) at 9-11 generations growth after inoculation.  Thus, the results presented here reflect the adapted state and signify genes whose expression is differentially maintained over long-term growth at a given temperature. 1.) White-Ziegler, C. A., A.
