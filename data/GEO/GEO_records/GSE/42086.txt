TITLE
Two isoforms of Fs(1)h ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq was performed using Drosophila Kc167 cells using antibodies against the two isoforms of Fs(1)h, the Brd4 homologue. Differences in binding patterns between the two isoforms are described.

DESIGN
We examined the differences in Fs(1)h isoform binding across the genome and describe the short isoform to be correlated with transcription at enhancers and promoters. The long isoform is found predominately at insulator binding sites where multiple insulators are bound.
