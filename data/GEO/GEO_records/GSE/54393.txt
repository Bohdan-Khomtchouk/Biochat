TITLE
Novel markers of gonadectomy-induced adrenocortical neoplasia in the mouse and ferret

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gonadectomy (GDX) induces sex steroid-producing adrenocortical tumors in certain mouse strains and in the domestic ferret. Complementary approaches, including DNA methylation mapping and microarray expression profiling, were used to identify novel genetic and epigenetic markers of GDX-induced adrenocortical neoplasia in female DBA/2J mice. Markers were validated by quantitative RT-PCR, laser capture microdissection, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. Two genes with hypomethylated promoters, Igfbp6 and Foxs1, were upregulated in post-GDX adrenocortical neoplasms. The neoplastic cells also exhibited hypomethylation of the fetal adrenal enhancer of Sf1, an epigenetic signature that typifies descendants of fetal adrenal rather than gonadal cells. Expression profiling demonstrated upregulation of gonadal-like genes, including Spinlw1, Insl3, and Foxl2, in GDX-induced adrenocortical tumors of the mouse. One of these markers, FOXL2, was detected in adrenocortical tumor specimens from gonadectomized ferrets. These new markers may prove useful for studies of steroidogenic cell development and for diagnostic testing.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from whole adrenal glands of gonadectomized and non-gonadectomized mice.
