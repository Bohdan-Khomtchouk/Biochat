TITLE
Epigenetically regulated Fibronectin leucine rich transmembrane protein 2 (FLRT2) shows tumor suppressor activity in breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of FLRT2 in breast cancer, its expression was knocked down and upregulated in mammary cell lines. Our results show that FLRT2 has tumor suppressor activity in breast cancer.

DESIGN
Total RNA is obtained from MCF-10A and 7 where FLRT2 is knocked down and upregulated using lipofectamine 2000
