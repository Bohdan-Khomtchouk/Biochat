TITLE
Cadiac GATA-4 overexpression in vivo

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The objective of the study was to find cardiac GATA-4 target genes by overexpressing GATA-4 transcription factor in the left ventricle by adenoviral gene transfer.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles three days after GATA-4 gene transfer were compared with those of Lac Z â€“treated animals by screening Affymetrix Rat Expression Set 230_2.0 Arrays (there are 5 samples in both group). Strain:Sprague-Dawley; Gender, Male; Weight 250-300g; tissue, left ventricle.
