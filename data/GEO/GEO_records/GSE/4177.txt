TITLE
Macaca mulatta spleen sample exposed to SHIV 89.6 strain

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Splenic tissue was isolated from four adult male Indian-origin Rhesus monkeys serologically positive for non-pathogenic SHIV 89.6 and from matched uninfected four adult male Indian-origin Rhesus monkeys respectively. The corresponding RNA was processed by cDNA microarray analysis. Keywords: SIV infection

DESIGN
Sample RNA extracted from the tissue samples. Reference RNA was prepared from a pool of Rhesus monkeys' RNA. Microarray hybridization was carried out by labeling Reference RNA as Cy3 and sample RNA as Cy5. The sample was incubated at 55C for 16hr.
