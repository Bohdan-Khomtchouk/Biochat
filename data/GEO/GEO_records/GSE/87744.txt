TITLE
RNA-Seq Gene Expression Analysis in Rat Metanephric Mesenchyme overexpressing Transcription Factor Tfcp2l1

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We identified genes regulated by Tfcp2l1 overexpression in Rat Metanephric Mesenchyme

DESIGN
Rat E13.5 metanephric mesenchyme was microdissected and transduced with Tfcp2l1 or GFP adenoviruses,  48 hours later RNA was isolated and analyzed by RNA-Seq

PLATFORM
