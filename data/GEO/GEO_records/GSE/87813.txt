TITLE
gene expression level study of nurse like cells (NLC) derived from CLL cancer patients in homosapiens.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NLC are generated from the in vitro culture of PBMC from CLL patients. These NLC derived from the differentiation of blood monocytes in contact with blood leukemic cells, We used microarrays to detail the global programme of NLC gene expression compared to monocytes gene expression.

DESIGN
19 NLC were purified from cultures of PBMC from 19 untreated patients for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
