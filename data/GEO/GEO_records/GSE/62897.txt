TITLE
p53 and ATF4 Mediate Distinct and Additive Mechanisms to Skeletal Muscle Atrophy During Limb Immobilization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
p53 regulates a distinct subset of skeletal muscle mRNAs during immobilization-induced skeletal muscle atrophy For additional details see Fox et al, p53 and ATF4 mediate distinct and additive pathways to skeletal muscle atrophy during limb immobilization. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. 2014 Aug 1;307(3):E245-61.

DESIGN
Bilateral tibialis anterior muscles were harvested at three days for the following conditions: 1) hindlimb immobilization of C57BL/6 mice; 2) hindlimb immobilization of p53 mKO and littermate control mice; 3) transfection of wild type mice with p53 plasmid or control plasmid
