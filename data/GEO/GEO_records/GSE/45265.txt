TITLE
Effect of lentiviral-based shRNA-mediated knockdown of ZFX on the human medulloblastoma (MB) cell-line DAOY

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway regulates normal development and cell proliferation, whereas its aberrant activation causes tumor formation. Hh-induced tumors can arise from different tissues and can be indolent or highly aggressive, such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin and neural progenitor-derived medulloblastoma (MB), respectively. Little is known about cell-intrinsic factors that control the development of such diverse Hh-dependent tumors. Transcription factor Zfx is required for the self-renewal of several stem cell types, whereas its role in malignant transformation remains controversial. We found that the deletion of Zfx prevented BCC formation and significantly delayed MB development caused by Hh activation in vivo. In contrast, Zfx was dispensable for the development of Hh-independent brain tumor glioblastoma. We used genome-wide expression and chromatin binding analysis in a human MB cell line to identify direct, evolutionarily conserved targets of Zfx. These targets included the Hh signal transducer Smoothened (Smo), suggesting that Zfx may directly control Hh pathway activation in tumors. Two additional targets of Zfx, Dis3L and Ube2j1, were also required for the growth of MB cells in vitro. These results identify a common cell-intrinsic regulator of diverse Hh-induced tumors, and suggest Zfx and Zfx-controlled genes as possible therapeutic targets in these malignancies.

DESIGN
DAOY cells were transduced for 16-24 hours with lentivirus encoding shRNA targeting ZFX (H2, H3, H4) or scrambled non-targeting shRNA (SCR). Cells were allowed to recover for 48 hours, and then were replated in 2 ug/mL puromycin selective media. Cells were collected in TriZol LS reagent for RNA for microarrays ~48 hours after start of puromycin selection.
