TITLE
A vaginal tract signal detected by the GBS SaeRS system elicits transcriptomic changes and enhances murine colonization.

ORGANISM
Streptococcus agalactiae A909

SUMMARY
Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) can colonize the human vaginal tract leading to both superficial and serious infections in adults and neonates. To study bacterial colonization of the reproductive tract in a mammalian system, we employed a murine vaginal carriage model. Using RNASeq, the transcriptome of GBS growing in vivo during vaginal carriage was determined. Over one-quarter of the genes in GBS were found to be differentially regulated during in vivo colonization as compared to laboratory cultures. A two-component system (TCS) homologous to the staphylococcal virulence regulator SaeRS was identified as being up-regulated in vivo. One of the SaeRS targets, pbsP, a proposed GBS vaccine candidate, was shown to be important for colonization of the vaginal tract. A component of vaginal lavage fluid acted as a signal to turn on pbsP expression via SaeRS. These data demonstrate the ability to quantify RNA expression directly from the murine vaginal tract and identify novel genes involved in vaginal colonization by GBS. They also provide more information about the regulation of an important virulence and colonization factor of GBS, pbsP, by the TCS SaeRS.

DESIGN
RNASeq data from WT and mutant GBS samples taken from liquid culture or the murine vaginal tract
