TITLE
CDK12 regulates alternative last exon mRNA splicing and promotes invasion of a breast cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed mRNA sequencing on 184-hTert and SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines treated with siRNA directed to CDK12 (Cyclin dependent kinase 12) or a scrambled siRNA control. For each cell line, we generated 6 RNA-seq libraries (3 treatment replicates and 3 control replicates) to study the differential expression and the differential splicing patterns regulated by CDK12.

DESIGN
Examination of differential mRNA abundance and splicing patterns between the CDK12 siRNA treated samples and control samples for SK-BR-3 and 184-hTert and MDA-MB-231 cell lines.
