TITLE
Gene expression data from arbuscular mycorrhizal and phosphate-treated Medicago truncatula roots.

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) interactions between plants and Glomeromycota fungi primarily support phosphate aquisition of most terrestrial plant species. To unravel gene expression in Medicago truncatula root colonization by AM fungi, we used genome-wide transcriptome profiling based on whole mycorrhizal roots. We used GeneChips to detail the global programme of gene expression in response to colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and in response to a treatment with phosphate and identified genes differentially expressed during this process.

DESIGN
Medicago truncatula roots were harvested at 28 days post inoculation with the two different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Glomus intraradices (Gi-Myc) and Glomus mosseae (Gm-Myc) under low phosphate conditions (20 µM phosphate) or after a 28 days treatment with 2 mM phosphate in the absence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (2mM-P). As a control, uninfected roots grown under low phosphate conditions (20 µM phosphate) were used (20miM-P). Three biological replicates consisting of pools of five roots were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChips.
