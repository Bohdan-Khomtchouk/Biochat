TITLE
Gene expression data from arbuscular mycorrhizal and phosphate-treated Medicago truncatula roots.

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) interactions between plants and Glomeromycota fungi primarily support phosphate aquisition of most terrestrial plant species. To unravel gene expression in Medicago truncatula root colonization by AM fungi, we used genome-wide transcriptome profiling based on whole mycorrhizal roots. We used GeneChips to detail the global programme of gene expression in response to colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and in response to a treatment with phosphate and identified genes differentially expressed during this process.
