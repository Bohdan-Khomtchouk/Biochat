TITLE
Expression data from tumors and adjacent normal tissue from clinical oral cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oral cancer kills about 1 person every hour each day in the United States and is the 6th most prevalent cancer worldwide. In this study we utilized existing microarray data from a prior oral cancer study to examine the role of chronic pro-inflammatory mediators in oral carcionogenesis by comparing gene expression in oral tumors with adjacent non-tumor oral tissue from the same patient

DESIGN
Oral tumors and adjacent non-involved oral tissue were obtained from oral squamous cell carcinoma patients (N = 6) enrolled in a Phase 0 clinical trial study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01465776) approved by the Internal Review Board at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Gene regulation was determined by comparisons of mRNA expression in tumor tissue relative to adjacent non-tumor tissue from the same patient
