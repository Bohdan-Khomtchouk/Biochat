TITLE
Expression data from primary term human decidual cells treated with interleukin-1-beta for 6 hours.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Preterm birth is an important unsolved clinical problem.  Despite advanced treatments, infants who survive prematurity remain at increased risk for permanent disabilities.  In approximately one-third of cases, prematurity is related to infection and/or inflammation, which renders hostile the normally receptive intrauterine environment.  Proinflammatory cytokines provoke up-regulation of genes that promote uterine contractions.  Using monolayer cultures of human decidual cells as a model, we profiled the global pattern of gene expression in response to cytokine challenge.

DESIGN
Decidualized human endometrial stromal cells were treated with 1 ng/ml of interleukin-1-beta for 6 hours, while control cells were treated with 0.1% PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (vehicle).  The cells were subjected to RNA extraction, quantification, and evaluation, followed by hybridization on Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Arrays (Platform GPL16686). Three biological replicates were used (6 total samples).
