TITLE
Interaction between ROS and miR-451

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) could be a stress factor that affects microRNA regulation and function in macrophages. The production of microRNAs (miRNA) is influenced by various stimuli, including environmental stresses. We hypothesized that ROS-associated stress could regulate macrophage miRNA synthesis. p47phox-/- mice have deficient NADPH oxidase activity resulting in decreased ROS production. We cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from wild type (WT) and p47phox-/- mice and profiled miRNA expression using microarrays. The microarray data reveals that there are differences in the expression levels of different miRs, and our studies suggest functional crosstalk between ROS and miR-451 in the regulation of macrophage oxidant stress.

DESIGN
Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were obtained from WT (wild type) and p47phox-/- mice. MicroRNAs were isolated by using the mirVana miRNA kit, and a TaqMan rodent microRNA array (consisting of Megaplex RT Primers, Rodent Pool-A, Applied Biosystems) was used for microarray. The array enables quantitation of the expression levels of up to 380 microRNAs and controls. Rodent Pool A contains reverse transcription (RT) primers for 335 and 238 unique microRNAs for mouse and rat, respectively, plus 4 species-specific controls. The data were analyzed on RQ manager software (Qiagen, SA Biosciences) and normalized to the endogenous controls, and analyzed for fold change of miRs in WT compared to p47phox-/-.
