TITLE
Identification of mRNAs enriched in G3BP immunoprecipitation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A phosphorylation-dependent endoribonuclease G3BP localizes in cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). G3BP promotes SG assembly, oligomerizes, binds mRNA, and regulates levels of certain mRNAs. Transcripts bound to G3BP were identified through expression profiling of a total of 12,135 genes by immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-G3BP or control IgG from S2-013 cells, converting the immunoprecipitated transcripts to cDNA by reverse transcription, and hybridizing these products to cDNA microarrays. Five G3BP-associated transcripts were identified.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, 1 immunoprecipitated sample with control IgG and 1 immunoprecipitated sample with anti-G3BP were used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 8,644 unique genes. The supplementary file 'GSE17056_higher_aG3BP.txt' lists the differentially expressed genes.
