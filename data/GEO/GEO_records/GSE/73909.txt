TITLE
Chronic cardiac contractile dysfunction without hypertrophy does not provoke a compensatory transcriptional response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA-sequencing from ribosomal RNA-depleted cardiac total RNA was performed 9 weeks after injection of rAAV6-PLCb1a, rAAV6-PLCb1b or rAAV6-blank viri into the tail vein of C57BL/6 male mice (7-8 weeks of age at time of injection).

DESIGN
6 biological replicates each of rAAV6-PLCb1a, rAAV6-PLCb1b or rAAV6-blank-treated mice.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
