TITLE
Argentinean high altitude adaptation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study evaluates genetic and phenotypic variation in the high altitude Colla population living in the Argentinean Andes above 3500 m. They were compared to the Wichí population living in the nearby lowlands of the Gran Chaco region. This study attempts to pinpoint evolutionary mechanisms underlying adaptation to hypobaric hypoxia. We have genotyped 25 individuals from both populations for 730,525 SNPs.

DESIGN
DNA from 25 saliva samples from Collas living > 3500 m and 25 saliva samples from Wichí living < 500 m from the Province of Salta in Argentina was genotyped
