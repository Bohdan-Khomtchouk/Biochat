TITLE
Altered microRNAs expression and gene expression in allicin-treated ileal tissues revealed their potential roles in regulating host responses to antimicrobials

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Allicin is a natural extract from garlic that has been used as an antibiotic alternative in livestock production. Limited knowledge is known about the effects of allicin on gut microbiota and tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of allicin on the expression of ileal miRNAs and the tissue-associated total bacterial density in pre-weaned calves. Different doses of allicin (0 mg, 0.5 mg, 5 mg, 50 mg and 500 mg) were used to treat in vivo ileal loop tissues in pre-weaned calves for different periods (1 day, 3 days and 12 days). A total of 15 miRNAs showed allicin dose-dependent differential expression patterns. Four miRNAs (miR-132, miR-423-5p, miR-429 and miR-6529a) were upregulated in 50 mg or 500 mg treated gut tissues, while 11 miRNAs (miR-190a, miR-193a-3p, miR-196a, miR-196b, miR-2285aa, miR-2285o, miR-2887, miR-2904, miR-409a, miR-6523a and miR-96) were downregulated in 50 mg or 500 mg treated gut tissues. Functional analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs showed that the upregulated mRNAs regulate functions that may be involved in “disrupted microtubule function”, and the downregulated miRNAs may be associated with the “inhibited leukocyte transendothelial migration” and “promoted cell phagocytosis”.
