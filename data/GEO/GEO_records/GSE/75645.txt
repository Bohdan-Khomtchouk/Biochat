TITLE
Next generation sequencing of Coccinella septempunctata L. with non-diapause, diapause, and diapause-terminated states

ORGANISM
Coccinella septempunctata

SUMMARY
The most common ladybird beetle, Coccinella septempunctata L., is an excellent predator of crop pests such as aphids and white flies, and it shows a wide range of adaptability, a large appetite and a high reproductive ability. In this study, we collected female adults in three different states, i.e., non-diapause, diapause and diapause termination, for transcriptome sequencing.

DESIGN
The experimental insects consisted of three different states as follows: Non-diapause female insects were reared at 24±1°C, with a RH of 70±10% and a 16:8 h light: dark (L: D) photoperiod and collected after their first oviposition. Female adults in diapause were reared at 18±1°C at an RH of 70±10% and a 10:14-h (L:D) photoperiod. The experimental diapause insects were collected after 30 days. Diapause-terminated adults were transferred to another climatic cabinet with the 30-day diapause insects and reared under the same conditions as the non-diapause insects. After their first oviposition, the female insects were collected and stored at -80°C. Three biological replicates per treatment (non-diapause, diapause, diapause-terminated) were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500.
