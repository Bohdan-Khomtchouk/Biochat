TITLE
Wildtype, miR-1-1 KO, miR-1 Double het P2 mixed strain heart analysis (MoGene 2.0 ST Arrays).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neonatal hearts (P2) from wildtype, miR-1-1 null and miR-1-2 +/-: miR-1-1 +/- double heterozygote animals were isolated and total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s suggested protocol. Genomic DNA was removed using a gDNA eliminator column (Qiagen).  Samples were hybridized to Affymetrix mouse genechip ST 2.0 arrays. Mouse strain for all samples is: Mixed 129 x C57BL/6

DESIGN
Three groups: miR-1-1, miR-1 double het, wildtype, all compared against each other. Samples are all from neonatal hearts.
