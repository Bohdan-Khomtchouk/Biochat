SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of EYA2 non-expressing pancreatic cancer cell lines with stable transfectant overexpressing EYA2

DESIGN
We analyzed Panc2.5 and Panc3.014 stable transfectant (overexpressing EYA2) and control (empty pcDNA6.2/cLumio-DEST vector) cell transcriptomes using the Affymetrix Exon Array ST1.0 platform. Statistical analysis of gene expression array data was completed with Partek Genomic Suite 6.4 software.

PLATFORM
GPL5188 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
