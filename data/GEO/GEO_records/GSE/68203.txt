TITLE
Genome-wide RNA Pol II-CTD occupancy in wild type and mutant worms

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We used RNA Pol II-CTD occupancy assay to identify mRNA isoform switch in mutant animals compared to wild type animals.

DESIGN
Examination of RNA Pol II-CTD Ser5P recognized by 4H8 in wild type, sydn-1(0), ssup-72(0) and ssup-72(0);sydn-1(0)
