TITLE
Transcriptome changes in 35S::KLU

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptome changes in 35S::KLU shoots at stage 1.03 compared to wild-type (WT) Col-0 shoots

DESIGN
35S::KLU and WT seedlings were grown on 1/2 MS medium, and 5 seedlings of each were harvested at stage 1.03. Samples were obtained from three independent experiments, and both genotypes were grown on the same plate. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground with a Retsch machine and 3-mm metal balls. RNA was extracted with TriZol (Invitrogen) and further purified with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). DNA digestion was done on columns with RNase-free DNase I (Roche). One Âµg of pure RNA samples were hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays at the VIB Microarray Facility (Leuven, Belgium).
