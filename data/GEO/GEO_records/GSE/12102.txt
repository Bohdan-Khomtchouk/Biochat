TITLE
Overcoming resistance to conventional drugs in Ewingâ€™s sarcoma and identification of molecular predictors of outcome.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The improvement of Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) therapy is currently linked to find strategies to select patients with  poor and good prognosis at diagnosis and to generate modified treatment regimens. In this study, we analyze the molecular factors governing  EWS response  to chemotherapy  in order to identify genetic signatures that may be used for risk-adapted therapy. Keywords: Gene Expression Analysis.
