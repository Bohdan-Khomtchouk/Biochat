TITLE
Differential gene expression of Appresorium vs Vegetative mycelium of Magnaporthe using oligoarray

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe grisea

SUMMARY
Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, is a devastating disease causing tremendous yield loss in rice production. The public availability of the complete genome sequence of M. grisea provides ample opportunities to understand the molecular mechanism of its pathogenesis on rice plants at the transcriptome level. To identify all the expressed genes encoded in the fungal genome, we have analyzed the mycelium and appressorium transcriptomes using MPSS, RL-SAGE and oligoarray methods. Keywords: RL-SAGE, oligoarray

DESIGN
The M. grisea oliogoarray chip containing 60-mer oligos representing a total of 21,885 probes was obtained from Agilent (G4137A; Wilmington, Delaware). Of the 21,885 probes, 13,666 are from the annotated genes of M. grisea and 7,144 probes are from the rice ESTs ( http://www.chem.agilent.com/scripts ). The remainder 1,075 probes include quality controls, positive controls and negative controls.The oligoarray hybridization experiments included six technical replicates, of which three were dye-reversal.
