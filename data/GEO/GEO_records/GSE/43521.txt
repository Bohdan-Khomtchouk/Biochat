TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling of SGTA knockdown in  C4-2B prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identifying the effect of the co-chaperone SGTA on global androgen receptor transcriptional activity in C4-2B prostate cancer cells with view to further elucidating the broader biological role of SGTA on other signaling pathways within prostate cancer cells Knockdown of SGTA for 72 hours in C4-2B cells significantly altered the expression of approximately 1900 genes in both vehicle and DHT treated cells. The effect of SGTA knockdown was to suppress the expression of approximately 60% of those transcripts. The regulation of 35% of DHT target genes was also affected by SGTA knockdown, with gene-specific effects on basal, or DHT-induced expression, or both.

DESIGN
C4-2B cells were transfected with 5nM non-specific control siRNA (NS) or with a pool of three commercially avaliable SGTA specific siRNA (SGTA) for 72hrs. Cells were subsequently treated with either ethanol vehicle control or 1nM DHT for 16hr.  Total RNA was extracted. Five independent vehicle and 2 DHT siNS and siSGTA samples were hybridized to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array chips.
