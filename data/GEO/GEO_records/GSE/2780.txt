TITLE
Radiation-induced Dmp53-dependent expression profile

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Embryos were collected, aged, mock-treated/treated with 40Gy gamma radiation, and allowed to recover for 1.5 hours.  Targets from 3 sets of wild type (yw, w1118) and 2 sets of mutant (Dmp53NS) biological replicates were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Drosophila Genechip 1 arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes with radiation-responsive and Dmp53-dependent expression patterns. Keywords: stress response, genetic modification

DESIGN
3 sets of paired control and irradiated Wild Type and 2 sets of paired control and irradiated Mutant (Dmp53NS) biological replicates were analyzed
