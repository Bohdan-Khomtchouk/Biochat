TITLE
Expression analysis of single and double knockdown of UBE4B and LSD1 in HEK293T cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ubiquitin Ligase (UBE4B) and Lysine-Specific Demethylase (LSD1) are post-translational modifying enzymes affecting lysine ubiquitination and methylation of several important regulatory proteins, and are synergisticaly important for protein quality control. To inwestigate their role in cell signaling, we analyzed global mRNA levels in HEK293T cells that were knocked down with shRNAs against UBE4B, LSD1, both UBE4B and LSD1, and non-targeting control (CTRL).

DESIGN
HEK293T cells were transfected with knockdown shRNA plasmids to reduce protein levels of UBE4B, LSD1, both UBE4B and LSD1, or none (control  knockdown with non-targeting shRNA plasmid). After 78h of knockdown, we isolated total RNA. We pairwise compared mRNA levels from control samples to single UBE4B, LSD1, and double UBE4B+LSD1 knockdown samples.
