TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of porcine hypothalamic samples

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Purpose: Identification of genes regulating growth and fatness traits in pig. Methods: Hypothalamic transcriptome analysis through RNA-seq and differential expression analysis of divergent pigs for growth and fatness traits. Results: Characterization of the transcripts expressed in the porcine hypothalamus and identification of differentially expressed genes, some of them located within previously described QTL regions. Conclusions: Characterization of porcine hypothalamic transcriptome and identification of relevant genes and transcription factors related to the traits of interest.

DESIGN
Transcriptome sequencing of 10 hypothamic samples of two groups of divergent pigs for growth and fatness (five per group).
