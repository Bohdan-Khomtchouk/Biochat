TITLE
Leveraging natural variation in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae stress response to understand lignocellulosic hydrolysate toxicity

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Here, we explored natural variation in stress tolerance and in transcriptomic responses to synthetic hydrolysate, mimicking chemically pretreated plant material, to dissect the physiological effects hydrolysate components.  Using six different Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains that together maximized phenotypic and genetic diversity, we explored transcriptomic differences between resistant and sensitive strains.  We identified both common and strain-specific responses.  Comparing responses of resistant and sensitive strains provided insights about primary cellular targets of hydrolysate toxins, implicating cell wall structure, protein and DNA stability, energy stores and redox balance.  Importantly, we uncovered lower expression of thiamine genes while in the presence of toxins, which we argue are most likely an indirect effect that increases sensitivity.    We also demonstrate synergistic interactions between the nutrient composition, osmolarity, pH, and classes of hydrolysate toxins.  Together, this work provides a platform for further dissecting hydrolysate toxins and strain responses.

DESIGN
RNA-seq and transcriptome analysis of six S. cerevisiae natural isolates having different resistant to lignocellulosic hydrolysate. Two biological replicate cell samples (collected on different days) were harvested for RNAseq analysis.    Strains were grown in YPD, synthetic hydrolysate without toxins (SynH -HTs), and synthetic hydrolysate with toxins (SynH).  Cells were grown for at least three generations to log phase (OD600 ~0.5) and collected by centrifugation.
