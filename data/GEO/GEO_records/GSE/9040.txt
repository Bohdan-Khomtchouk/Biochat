TITLE
Fine mapping of regulatory loci for mammalian gene expression using radiation hybrids (control I)

ORGANISM
Cricetulus griseus

SUMMARY
We have mapped regulatory loci for nearly all protein coding genes in the mammalian genome using microarray measurements from a panel of mouse/hamster radiation hybrids. Keywords: regulation of gene expression

DESIGN
Five replicas of RNA from the A23 cell line vs. itself.  These arrays serve as a control to determine the power to detect cis ceQTLs in this experiment.

PLATFORM
