TITLE
Fine mapping of regulatory loci for mammalian gene expression using radiation hybrids (control I)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have mapped regulatory loci for nearly all protein coding genes in the mammalian genome using microarray measurements from a panel of mouse/hamster radiation hybrids. Keywords: regulation of gene expression
