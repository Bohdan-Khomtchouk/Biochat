TITLE
Expression data of Pioglitazone-, Rosiglitazone-, GW1929- and vehicle-treated CD4+FoxP3- T cells transduced with Foxp3+Pparg1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pioglitazone treatment of CD4+FoxP3- T cells transduced with Pparg and Foxp3 up-regulated a set of genes whose products have been implicated in lipid metabolism pathways. To verify the specificity of this treatment, we performed microarray analysis on Foxp3+Pparg1-transduced CD4+FoxP3- T cells after treatment with other PPARg agonists such as Rosiglitazone (TZD) and GW1929 (non-TZD).

DESIGN
All gene expression profiles were obtained from highly purified (double-sorted) T cell populations sorted by flow cytometry. To reduce variability, cells from multiple mice were pooled. Triplicates were generated for all groups. Raw data were preprocessed with the RMA algorithm in GenePattern and averaged expression values were used for analysis.
