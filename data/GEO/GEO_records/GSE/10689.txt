TITLE
Transcriptional profiling and comparative genomic analysis of an invasive and non-invasive strain of Candida albicans

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Invasion of host tissue by the human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans is an important step during many forms of candidosis. However, not all C. albicans strains possess the same invasive and virulence properties. It is known for example that the two clinical isolates SC5314 and ATCC10231 differ in their ability to invade into host tissue and to cause infections. Strain SC5314 is invasive whereas strain ATCC10231 is non-invasive and strongly attenuated in virulence as compared to SC5314. In this study we compare the in vitro transcriptional profiles and the genotypic profiles of these two widely used laboratory strains in order to determine the principal biological and genetic properties which may govern the different potential for invasiveness and virulence. Keywords: transcriptional profiling, comparative genomic hybridisation, invasive vs. non-invasive C. albicans strain

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from C. albicans strains SC5314 and ATCC10231 hybridisations were done in duplicate including one dye swap. Total RNA from C. albicans strains SC5314 and ATCC10231 strains were compared in triplicate including one biological replicate and one dye swap.
