TITLE
Patterns of cancer development and progression in the protein-protein interaction network

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For this study we selected a gene, Î±-synuclein (SNCA), that is consistently under-expressed in MCF7 cells and breast tumors. Following transfection with an SNCA expression construct, two stable MCF7 clones (named MCF7-SNCA #1 and 2) were selected and examined for expression differences relative to the parental MCF7 cells.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were transfected with an expression vector containing the full-length SNCA sequence. After selection with blasticidin, two different clones were isolated and examined for expression differences relative to the parental MCF7 cells.
