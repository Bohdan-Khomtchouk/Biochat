TITLE
Expression analysis for detection of mycobacterial transcripts present in exosomes derived from M.tb infected macrophages

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Mycobacterial transcripts were identified in exosomes released from M.tb infected RAW264.7 macrophages that were not present in uninfected exosomes suggesting export of mycobacterial RNA via exosomes Mycobacterial RNA was used as positive control and RNA from exosomes released from uninfected macrophages was used as negative control

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from exosomes or mycobacteria was reverse transcribed to ds cDNA which wa slabeled with Cy3 and hybridized to custom whole M.tb genome array from Nimblegen 120910_Mtub_AD_expr.ndf
