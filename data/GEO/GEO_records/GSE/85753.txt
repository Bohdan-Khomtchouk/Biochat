TITLE
miRNA expression in rat medial entorhinal cortex layers during postnatal development

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To examine how miRNAs differ between medial entorhinal cortex layers during postnatal development, we analyzed the miRNA expression in layer II and the deep layers (III-VI) at postnatal ages P2, P9, P23 and P45 in wildtype Long Evans rats. The expression of the two most significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by in situ hybridization.

DESIGN
miRNA expression was measured in medial entorhinal cortex layer II and the deep layers (III-VI) at postnatal ages P2, P9, P23 and P45
