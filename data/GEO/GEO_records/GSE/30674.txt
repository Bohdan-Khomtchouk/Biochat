TITLE
Profiling of Jurkat T cells activated with CD3, CD28 and PMA and multiple kinase inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T lymphocytes are orchestrators of adaptive immunity. Na√Øve T cells may differentiate into the Th1, Th2, Th17 or iTreg phenotype, depending on environmental co-stimulatory signals. In order to identify the genes and pathways involved in differentiation of Jurkat T cells towards Th1 and Th2 subtypes we performed comprehensive transcriptome analyses of Jurkat T cells stimulated with various stimuli an pathway inhibitors

DESIGN
Jurkat T cells were treated with CD3, CD28 and PMA and all pairwise combinations, in the presence of DMSO (control) or kinase inhibitors. RNA was isolated after 8 hrs incubation.
