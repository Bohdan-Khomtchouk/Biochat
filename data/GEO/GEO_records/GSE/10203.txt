TITLE
L. lactis ΔlmrCD and cholate-adapted L. lactis ΔlmrCDR

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiling of a L. lactis strain lacking the MDR transporter genes lmrCD and the same strain adapted to cholate was performed. As compared to the parental strain, the cholate-adapted strain showed 124 genes that were significantly differentially expressed more than 1.8-fold . These genes could be grouped into four major functional classes: i.e., genes involved in (i) cell envelope biogenesis;  (ii) stress response and molecular chaperones; (iii) general metabolism and house-keeping function; and (iv) the chromosomally embedded sex-factor. Keywords: Mutant versus wild type comparison, stress response, cholate
