TITLE
Mycobacterium tuberulosis H37Rv strains: Control vs. Chelerythrine

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strains comparing control DMSO treated strains with chelerythrine treated strains. Goal was to determine the effects of chelerythrine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strains.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment,control DMSO treated strains vs. Chelerythrine treated strains. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 Chelerythrine replicates. The file showing raw and normalized data (~4645 rows) extracted from Agilent Feature Extraction Software is linked below. Samples details are described in PDF file linked below (NOTE: The samples 'Plumbagin' and 'chelerythrine' represent the submissions to GEO).
