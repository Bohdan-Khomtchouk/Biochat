TITLE
Expression profile of select inflammation-related genes after miR-466l overexpression or knockdown in human macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy human whole blood by density gradient centrifugation using Histopaque®-1077 and cultured in RPMI (containing 10% FBS) with 10 ng/ml human recombinant GM-CSF at 37 °C for 7 days. These cells are confirmed as human macrophages. These macrophages were transfected with vector control, miR-466l,anti-miR-negative or anti-miR-466l (37 °C, 72h). After transfection, total RNA was extracted for reverse transcription. The product cDNA was collected for real-time PCR with respective primers.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, lentiviral vector control (VC), miR-466l, anti-miR-negative (anti-miR-neg) or anti-miR-466l transfected human macrophages were used to acquire expression profiles of a total of  60 unique genes related to inflammation
