TITLE
Digitoxin treatment versus control in HEK293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We treated HEK293 cells with the cardiotonic steroid digitoxin to identify alternative splicing changes as compared to DMSO treatment alone.

DESIGN
In this set, 6 total samples were analyzed.  There were three biological replicates for each of two conditions: DMSO treatment and Digitoxin treatment.  Arrays were analyzed for gene expression using GeneBase and for alternative splicing using MADS+ and OmniViewer software.
