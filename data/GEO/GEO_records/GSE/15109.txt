TITLE
BG02 hESC Exposed to Butyrate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess the effect of sodium butyrate exposure on human ESC grown without culture support for self-renewal (I.e. without conditioned medium and added bFGF) in support of data generated on H1 hESC - two groups were compared - BG02 culture in feeder conditioned versus on sodium butyrate - in triplicate and compared on Agilent whole human genome array

DESIGN
BG02 hESC were grown under two conitions - A. for 31 passages on Matrigel in feeder conditioned medium and B. for 29 passages on Matrigel in feeder conditioned medium followed by 20 passages in 0.2 mM sodium butyrate without conditioned medium and in human ES cell medium containing no added bFGF
