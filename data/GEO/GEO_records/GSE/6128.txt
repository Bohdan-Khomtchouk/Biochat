TITLE
EGFR signaling varies with breast tumor subtype

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our research data suggest that almost all basal-like tumors have an EGFR-activation profile, however, few may respond to the direct inhibition of EGFR due to ligand independent activation of the EGFR-RAS-MEK pathway via CRYAB or KRAS function. Thus, for those tumors that show a ligand independent EGFR-activation profile, alternative strategies that target downstream components like MEK may prove to be viable alternatives.
