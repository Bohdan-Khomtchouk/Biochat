TITLE
In vivo identification of solar-responsive gene network

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Solar radiation is one of the biggest threats to the skin, eliciting a specific protective cellular response. To descipt the underlying mechanisms, we have chosen to study in vivo, epidermis gene expression of surface solar radiation (SSR)-irradiated skin using whole genome microarray (Agilent 44K).

DESIGN
We studied epidermis samples from five healthy Caucasian patients, with phototype II or III, using two different doses (2J/m2 and 4J/m2) and sham-irradiated.
