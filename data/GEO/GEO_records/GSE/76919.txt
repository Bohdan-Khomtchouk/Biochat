TITLE
miRNA gene expression in the pseudoglandular phase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression levels were assessed during the pseudoglandular phase of normal fetal lung development at the critical time, when the the conducting airways are formed. Precise miRNA regulation is important for proper pulmonary organogenesis, supporting the delicate balance between expansion of progenitor cells and their terminal differentiation. Microarray analyses could indicate the potential involvement of miRNAs important for human pulmonary hypoplasia.

DESIGN
Two replicates of pooled RNA from two 9 week old fetal lung samples
