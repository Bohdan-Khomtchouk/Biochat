TITLE
Gene expression profiling in allele replacement panel strains containing all combinations of four sporulation QTN in S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We study the effect of four QTN in RME1, IME1 & RSF1 that are causative for variation in sporulation efficiency. We investigate the relationship between genotype, gene expression and phenotype and whether the amount of gene expression variation explained by the sporulation QTN is predictive of the amount of phenotypic variation explained by them.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq analysis of 4 replicates each of 16 allele replacement panel strains containing all combinations of the four sporulation QTN after 2 hours in sporulation medium.

PLATFORM
