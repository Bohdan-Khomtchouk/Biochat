TITLE
Effect of TET1 overexpression on hydroxymethylcytosine levels of HEK293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared TET1 overexpressing cells to uninduced cells with endogenous TET1 transcript levels to determine changes of hydroxymethylcytosine levels using RRHP.

DESIGN
TET1 overexpression
