TITLE
Comparative transcriptomics allows defining mononuclear phagocyte subset homology across vertebrate species (Pig)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Characterization of swine blood immunocyte subpopulations by means of global expression analysis

DESIGN
We analysed the gene expression of blood plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC) from 3 control pig, blood SIRPa+ conventional DC (cDC) from 3 control pig, blood CADM1+ cDC from 1 control pig, splenic B lymphocytes from 4 control pig, splenic monocytes/macrophages from 3 control pig and in vitro Monocyte-derived DC from 3 control pig
