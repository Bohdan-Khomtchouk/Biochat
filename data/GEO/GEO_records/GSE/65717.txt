TITLE
Alternative RNA processing events in a double NSR mutant Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We analyze the effect of a double deletion mutant for alternative-splicing regulators nsra and nsrb (Nuclear Speckle RNA binding proteins), on the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome.

DESIGN
RNA-seq experiments (polyA+ RNA) in triplicates for each condition WT and nsrab mutants.
