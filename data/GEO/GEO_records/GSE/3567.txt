TITLE
Listeria infection of Caco-2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment set contains all of the arrays described in Baldwin et al., Genome Biology, 2002.  All experiments are time courses, with the exception of multiple measurements for the zero time point in the parallel time course for the purpose of zero transformation.  The parallel four hour time course was performed on a single day and three independent measurements were taken prior to infection.  The eight hour time courses were each performed on different days, with single time zero measurements.  Each array represents a measurement of human mRNA from cultured intestinal epithelial cells (red channel), relative to the control reference pool of mRNA (green channel), at different time points during the course of an infection by Listeria monocytogenes, or the mutants actA (defective in actin-based motility) and prfA (defective in virulence factor gene expression). Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
