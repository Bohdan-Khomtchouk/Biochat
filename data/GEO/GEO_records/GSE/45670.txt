TITLE
Expression data from esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and normal esophageal epithelia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT)  followed by surgery has been proved to improve esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patientsâ€™ survival in comparison with surgery alone. However, the outcomes of CRT are heterogeneous, and no clinical or pathological method could predict CRT response. We aim to identify mRNA markers for ESCC CRT-response prediction through gene expression analyses.

DESIGN
Gene expression analyses were performed on pretreatment cancer biopsies from 28 ESCCs who received neoadjuvant CRT and surgery and 10 normal esophageal epithelia using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.
