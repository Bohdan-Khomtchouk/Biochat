TITLE
Comparisson between tumour and healthy prostate glands

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the gene expression differences between the normal peripheral zone glands compared to the moderatly and poorly differentiated tumor glands of the prostate.

DESIGN
Laser microdissection of prostate cancer tissues to separate glands from stroma followed by RNA extraction from the glands and whole Genome Microarray. We have pooled normal glands from 10 patients, moderately differentiated tumor from 5 patients and poorly differentiated tumors from 4 patients with prostate carcinomas.
