TITLE
Targeted inhibition of human breast cancer cell line selected as model system of ERBB2-positive breast cancer [RPPA-Longterm-BT474]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EGFR-inhibition is required for targeted therapies of ERBB2-positive/EGFR high breast cancer. Approximately 30% of human ERBB2-positive breast tumors also express EGFR.

DESIGN
Three therapeutics were analyzed in five combinations plus control. Each experiment was performed in three biological replicates. This resulted in 180 samples. Exceptionally, time point 18 has just two biological replicates, and time point 48 just one. A dilution series of control lysated was included as control.
