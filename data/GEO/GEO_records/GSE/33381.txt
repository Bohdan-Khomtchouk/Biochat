TITLE
The effect of sleep restriction on transcriptome rhythmicity in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Timed sleep restriction designed to mimic human shift work was performed over a 2 week period in mice. On the final day, tissues were collected at 6 hour intervals to exmaine the effects of sleep restriction on circadian gene expression.

DESIGN
