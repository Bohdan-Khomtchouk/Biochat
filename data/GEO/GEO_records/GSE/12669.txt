TITLE
Gene expression in the human mammary epithelium during lactation: the milk fat globule transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The 24h gene expression profile in the lactating mammary gland was demonstrated using the Human Ref-8 BeadChip array (Illumina, Inc).  Of the 22,184 gene transcripts on the array, 14,070 genes were consistently expressed and represented the milk fat globule transcriptome.  Milk protein genes were among the most highly expressed along with genes involved in the milk syntesis processes. Keywords: time course analysis
