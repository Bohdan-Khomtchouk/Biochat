TITLE
Normal gene expression in male and female Sprague-Dawley rat nasal respiratory and olfactory epithelium

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The nasal epithelium is an important target site for chemically-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity.  Human epidemiological investigations and experimental laboratory animal studies show that the nasal olfactory epithelium is selectively damaged by inhalation exposure to several chemicals, including vinyl acetate and hydrogen sulfide.  The reason for the relative sensitivity of the nasal olfactory epithelium is not known.  To better understand and predict the response of the nasal epithelium to inhaled xenobiotics, gene expression profiles from naїve male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were constructed.  Epithelial cells were manually collected from the nasal septum, naso- and maxillo-turbinates, and ethmoid turbinates of 9 male and 9 female rats.  Gene expression analysis was performed using the Affymetrix Rat Genome 430 2.0 microarray.  Gene ontology enrichment analysis identified several functional categories including xenobiotic metabolism, cell cycle, apoptosis, and ion channel/transport with significantly different expression between tissue types. Surprisingly, there were few gender differences in gene expression. This baseline data will contribute to our understanding of the normal physiology and selectivity of the nasal epithelial cells’ response to inhaled environmental toxicants. Keywords: Comparative
