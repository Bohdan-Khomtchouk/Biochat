TITLE
microRNA expression levels in human primary fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory non-coding RNAs that affect the production of a significant fraction of human mRNAs via post-transcriptional regulation. Inter-individual variation of miRNA expression levels is likely to influence the expression of miRNA target genes, and may therefore contribute to phenotypic differences in humans, including susceptibility to common disorders. The extent to which miRNA levels are genetically controlled is largely unknown. In this report, we assayed the expression levels of miRNAs in primary fibroblasts from 180 European newborns of the GenCord project, and performed association analysis to identify eQTLs (expression quantitative traits loci). We detected robust expression for 121 miRNAs out of 365 interrogated. We have identified significant cis- (10%) and trans- (11%) eQTLs. Furthermore, we detected one genomic locus (rs1522653) that influences the expression levels of five miRNAs, thus unraveling a novel mechanism for co-regulation of miRNA expression.

DESIGN
Primary fibroblasts were derived from the umbilical cord of 180 newborns of Western European origin recruited for the GenCord project. Mature miRNA expression phenotypes were generated using the micro-fluidics-based TaqManÂ® Human MiRNA Array v1.0 (Applied Biosystems). For each sample, expression levels for 365 known human mature miRNAs were assayed .
