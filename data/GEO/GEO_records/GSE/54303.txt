TITLE
Genomic alterations of 332 malignant lymphoma using BAC array CGH analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clonal heterogeneity in lymphoid malignancies has been recently reported in adult T-Cell lymphoma/leukemia, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).   Our analysis was extended to other types of lymphoma including marginal zone lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We examined the results of array comparative genomic hybridization analysis for 332 cases to determine if clonal heterogeneity existed in each case. Results showed that frequencies of clonal heterogeneity varied from 25% to 69% among different types of lymphoma. Multivariate analysis indicated that MCL and DLBCL with clonal heterogeneity showed a significantly poorer prognosis. Interestingly, 9p21.3 (CDKN2A/ 2B) loss and 17p13 (TP53, ATP1B2, SAT2, SHBG) loss were common regions among various types of lymphoma with clonal heterogeneity, suggesting at least in part that loss of these genes may play a role in clonal heterogeneity.

DESIGN
We analyzed previously untreated 332 cases of lymphoma (comprising 29 cases of mantle cell lymphoma, 117 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 79 cases of Follicular lymphoma, 24 cases of Burkitt lymphoma, 31 cases of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, and 51 peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS)).
