TITLE
Rapamycin induces chromosome reorganization and increases cytokine production in normal human fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the effects of Rapamycin treatment on the transcriptome of normal human dermal fibroblasts isolated from foreskin (designated 2DD). We sequenced mRNA from 2 replicates of proliferative (PRO) quiescent (QUI, serum starved) or treated with 500nM Rapamycin for 5 days (RAP). Comparative analyses with PRO transcripts a baseline indicate that genes that changed expression from Rapamycin treated fibroblasts are significantly different from those of quiescence cells. Rapamycin treated cells showed a significant enrichment for cytokines from the Il-6 cascade.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNAs from proliferative, quiescent (serum starvation) and Rapamycin (5oonM, 5days) treated 2DD normal human dermal/foreskin fibroblasts.
