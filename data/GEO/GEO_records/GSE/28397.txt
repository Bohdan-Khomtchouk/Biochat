TITLE
Copy number alteration in Wilms' tumor with custom-designed miRNA probes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to discover loss of specific miRNA loci in Wilms' tumors using array CGH. Custom arrays were designed based on the Agilent 2x105K Human Whole Genome Genomic microarray with Agilent’s eArray program (https://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray/), with additional probes that cover all miRNA regions (200 bps before, within and after each miRNA from miRBase v13, with  each probe in triplicates to enhance the reliability). All custom-designed probes were designed in UCSC hg18. Probes from Agilent’s database were lifted-over from hg19 to hg18 (LiftOver tool: http://genome.ucsc.edu ).

DESIGN
The Agilent 2x105K custom-design whole genome microarray was used to analyze genomic alterations in Wilms' tumor samples compared to normal human genomic DNA (Promega p/n G1523).
