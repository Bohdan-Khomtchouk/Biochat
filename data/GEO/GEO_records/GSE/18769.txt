TITLE
Whole-Genome Gene Expression Profiling of Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Ovarian Tumor Tissue Samples: Dilutions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Performance assayed with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) ovarian tumor tissues.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from two human ovarian FFPE tumors (DFCI 120, DFCI 129) using six different RNA input amounts (250 pg, 1 ng, 5 ng, 10 ng, 50 ng, 200 ng). The supplementary file 'GSE18769_nonorm_nobkgd.txt' contains non-normalized data for Samples GSM465821-GSM465844.
