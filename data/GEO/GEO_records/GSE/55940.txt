TITLE
Human transcriptome expression analysis of cervical cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although many protein-coding genes have been identified to be aberrantly expressed in cervical cancer, the mechanisms of development and progression of cervical cancer remain unclear. In recent years, non-coding RNAs, especially including microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, have been shown to play important regulatory roles in mammalian cell biology. In our study, we investigated the whole genome gene expression level changes by human transcriptome array in tumor tissues and paired adjacent non-tumor tissue of patients with cervical cancer. The functions of different expression microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and mRNAs were further analyzed in vitro and in vivo using loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches.

DESIGN
A ten chip study using total RNA recovered from five separate cervical cancer tissues and five paired adjacent non-tumor samples.
