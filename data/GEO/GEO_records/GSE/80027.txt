TITLE
Cell-sorting analysis with SEOR1pro::SEOR1-YFP in a novel in vitro tissue culture system, VISUAL

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We established a novel in vitro tissue culture system (named VISUAL), in which xylem and phloem differentiation can be induced with Arabidopsis thaliana cotyledons To isolate phloem-specific genes in VISUAL, we performed GeneChip analysis after cell-sorting experiments with SEOR1pro::SEOR1-YFP.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis cotyledons cultured with the induction medium were sampled at 72 hours after the induction. After protoplasts isolation, YFP-positive and YFP-negative cells were collected. YFP-positive cells are phloem cells while YFP-negative cells are non-phloem cells.
