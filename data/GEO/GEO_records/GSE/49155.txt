TITLE
Profiling premalignant lesions in lung squamous cell carcinomas identifies mechanisms involved in stepwise carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is thought to arise from premalignant lesions in the airway epithelium, therefore studying these lesions is critical for understanding lung carcinogenesis. We performed RNA sequencing on laser-microdissected representative cell populations along the SCC pathological continuum of patient-matched normal basal cells, premalignant lesions, and tumor cells. We discovered transcriptomic changes and identified genomic pathways altered with initiation and progression of SCC within individual patients. We used immunofluorescent staining to confirm gene expression changes in premalignant lesions and tumor cells, including increased expression of SLC2A1, CEACAM5, and PTBP3 at the protein level and increased activation of MYC via nuclear translocation. Cytoband enrichment analysis revealed coordinated loss and gain of expression in chromosome 3p and 3q regions, respectively, during carcinogenesis. This is the first gene expression profiling of airway premalignant lesions with patient-matched samples that provides insight into the mechanisms of stepwise lung carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
Profiling of mRNA expression in laser-microdissected normal airway basal cells, premalignant airway lesions, and lung SCC tumor cells by massively parallel RNA sequencing.
