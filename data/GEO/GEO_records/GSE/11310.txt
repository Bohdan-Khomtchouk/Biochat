TITLE
Characterization of canine mesenchymal stromal cell lines (MSC)

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
The bone marrow microenvironment is a complex mixture of cells that function in concert to regulate hematopoiesis. Cellular components include fixed nonhematopoietic stromal elements (MSC) as well as monocytes and resident macrophages, which are derived from the hematopoietic stem cells. Clinical studies have shown healing effects, direct or indirect, from the injection of MSC int Keywords: Cell type comparison

DESIGN
Canine bone marrow stromal cells were immortalized by transduction with a replication-defective recombinant retrovirus containing the human papilloma virus E6/E7 genes (pLXSN-16 E6E7), as described for human stromal cell lines in Roecklein and Torok-Storb (Blood 85:997-1005, 1995). Transduced clones were selected with 50 ug/ml G418 and resistant clones were isolated,  grown to confluency and characterized for morphology, cytokine production and cell surface molecule expression. These cells are intended for clinical research in the canine transplantation model, as a complement for existing human stromal cell lines, for mitigation of graft-versus-host disease and radiation effects.
