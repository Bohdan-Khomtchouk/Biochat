TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression profile of the spinal cord in the mice L5 spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To search for novel chemokines that are involved in the maintenance of neuropathic pain, we harvested the ipsilateral spinal cords at 10 days after SNL and performed gene expression profiling using mouse gene expression microarrays.

DESIGN
The gene expression profiles in L5 spinal cords from the lumbar 5 spinal nerve ligation group mice and sham group mice were measured at 10 days after operation, each group have two replicates.
