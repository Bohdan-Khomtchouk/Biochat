TITLE
Effect of heteronemin on gene expression profiles in chronic myelogenous K562 leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Heteronemin is a sesterterpene first isolated from Hyrtios Erecta in 1976. In this study we decided to investigate the anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory potential  of this marine natural compound at the transcriptomic level in chronic myelogenous K562 leukemia cells. Our results suggest that this sesterterpene has an impact on cell cycle, apoptosis, the MAP kinase signalling pathway and the NF-kappaB transcription factor.

DESIGN
We used four experimental conditions : untreated cells, cells treated with heteronemin, cells treated with TNFalpha and cells co-treated with TNFalpha and heteronemin. Experiments were performed in three biological replicates including two technical replicates. Technical replicates were hybridized as dye-swaps. Dye-swap between replicates 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, respectively.
