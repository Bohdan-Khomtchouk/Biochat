TITLE
Gene expression comparison between Arabidopsis wild type (Col) and stomata mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
As the gate for gas exchange and water vapor, stomata play an essential role in plant development. It has been a long time that many research focus on how the opening and closing of stomata is controlled. Until recently, studies on how stomata are formed in Arabidopsis just emerge. With a cluster of guard cells in one stomate in flp-1/myb88 mutant, it will be great interest to understand how FLP/MYB88 control stomata development. By taking advantaging of microarray technology, we intend to study a set of genes regulated by FLP/MYB88, which will facilitate us to better explore the biological functions of FLP/MYB88 in stomata development, even in the biotic or abiotic stresses.

DESIGN
By comparing the gene expression differences between the wild type and stomata mutant--flp-1/myb88, we are trying to see which genes' transcripts are affected in flp-1/myb88 mutant.
