TITLE
ChIP-seq for PRC2 components and H3K27me3 in E14 mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment sought to determine the chromatin structure and PRC2 occupancy at the promoters of all genes in mouse ESCs

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for EZH2, SUZ12, and H3K27me3 were performed on WT E14 cells in 2 biological replicates each. In addition H3K27me3 ChIP-seq was also performed on a clone of E14 cells expressing a tagged version of EZH2, which for the purpose of this study was used as replicate #3.
