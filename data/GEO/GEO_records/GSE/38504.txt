TITLE
ChIP-on-chip analysis of Ring1B, Ring1A, H2AK119u1 and H3K27me3 in mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-on-chip analysis was carried out to determine targets of Ring1B, Ring1A, H2AK119u1 and H3K27me3 in mouse ES cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-on-chip analysis was carried out using the Mouse Promoter ChIP-on-chip Microarray Set (G4490A, Agilent, Palo Alto, Calif., USA). ESCs were subjected to ChIP assay using specific antibodies. Purified immunoprecipitated and input DNA was subjected to T7 RNA polymerase-based amplification as described previously (van Bakel et al., 2008). Labeling, hybridization and washing were carried out according to the Agilent mammalian ChIP-on-chip protocol (ver.9.0). Scanned images were quantified with Agilent Feature Extraction software under standard conditions.
