TITLE
Expression analysis of CsMYBF1 overexpressing tomato fruit

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
To investigate global genome expression changes caused by the ectopic expression of CsMYBF1, we compared the gene expression profiles of the transgenic and wild type tomato fruits by RNA-seq analysis.Fruit samples from at least five plants of each genotype, which were harvested between 7 and 10 days after breaker stage, were pooled for total RNA isolation.A total of 3296 genes were differentially expressed between the transgenic and wild type fruits, and most of them were significantly induced, indicating the widespread influence on the expression of the endogenous tomato genes.

DESIGN
Two lines of the tomato transgenic fruits expressing citrus gene CsMYBF1 were compared with two of that from the wild type.
