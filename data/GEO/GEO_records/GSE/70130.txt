TITLE
Mouse ESC-derived NSPCs NFIA OE (GE)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Since the NFI transcription factors have been shown to be key regulators of gliogenesis, we utilized this pathway to identify miRNAs involved in the regulation of the neurogenesis-to-gliogenesis switch by neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). We focused on miRNAs with expression levels that were differentially regulated downstream of NFIA, and established a mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) line that expresses NFIA in a doxycycline (Dox)-dependent manner.

DESIGN
NFIA-overexpressing (OE) and control NSPCs (neurospheres) derived from ESCs were purified from their mixed cultures (primary neursphsres (PNs) or secondary neurospheres (SNs) ) by fluorescence activated cell sorting and subjected to the gene expression microrray analysis.
