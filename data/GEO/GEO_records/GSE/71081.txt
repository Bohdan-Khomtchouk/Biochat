TITLE
An analysis of the changes in miRNA expression induced by AR, HOXC6 or NKX2-2 overexpression via Next-generation sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to validate that AR, HOXC6 and NKX2-2 co-regulate the same core set of metastasis associated miRNAs in prostate cancer.

DESIGN
AR, HOXC6 or NKX2-2 were stably overexpressed in RWPE1 cells via lentiviral transfection. RNA samples were collected and analyzed by deep sequencing in trilicate.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
