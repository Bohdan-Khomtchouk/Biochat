TITLE
Expression data from cell lines treated with enavatuzumab and human IgG1 control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cancer lines were treated with enavatuzumab and a human IgG1 control (MSL109) in vitro.  Samples were extracted at various time points and analyzed via genechip. We used microarrays to examine gene expression patterns following treatment with enavatuzamab.  Expression changes over time were compared with corresponding data from samples treated with a control.

DESIGN
16 samples were analyzed for each cell line, with duplicate samples at 4 different time points (from 6 hours to 3 days) for each of the 2 treatments (enavatuzumab and control).
