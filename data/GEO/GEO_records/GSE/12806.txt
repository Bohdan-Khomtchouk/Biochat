SUMMARY
Infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae, a human respiratory pathogen, has been associated with various chronic diseases such as asthma, coronary heart disease and importantly atherosclerosis. Possibly because the pathogen can exist in a persistent form. TNF-a has been reported to induce chlamydial persitence in epithelial cell lines, however the mechanism of TNF-a-induced persistence has not been reported. Moreover, C. pneumoniae persistently infect human dendritic cells (DCs) and activate DCs to produce cytokines including TNF-a. Induction of chlamydial persistence by other cytokines such as IFN-g is known to be due to indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity. The present study therefore, investigated whether C. pneumoniae infection can induce IDO activity in dendritic cells, and whether the restriction of chlamydial growth in the DCs by TNF-a is IDO-dependent.  Our data indicate that infection of DCs with C. pneumoniae resulted in the induction of IDO expression. Reporting on our use of anti-TNF-a antibody adalimumab and varying concentrations of TNF-a, we further demonstrate that IDO induction following infection of DCs with C. pneumoniae is TNF-a-dependent. The anti-chlamydial activity induced by TNF-a and the expression of chlamydial 16S rRNA gene, euo, groEL1, ftsk and tal genes was correlated with the induction of IDO. Addition of excess amounts of tryptophan to the DC cultures resulted in abrogation of the TNF-a-mediated chlamydial growth restriction. These findings suggest that infection of DCs by C. pneumoniae induces production of functional IDO, which subsequently causes depletion of tryptophan. This may represent a potential mechanism for DCs to restrict bacterial growth in chlamydial infections. Keywords: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Dendritic cells, TNF-a, Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
