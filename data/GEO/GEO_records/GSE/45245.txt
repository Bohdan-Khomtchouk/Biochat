TITLE
Gene expression regulation by miR-145 in pancreatic cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-145 is a tumor suppressor miRNA in various malignancies including pancreatic cancer. Identification of miR-145 targets can lead to more understanding of the development of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, in this project, we aimed to characterize the changes of transcriptomes caused by miR-145 to identify more miR-145 target transcripts.

DESIGN
cDNA microarray was used to compare transcriptomes 48 hr after transfection of miR-145 mimics or control scramble RNA in a pancreatic cancer cell line, Mia-PaCa2.
