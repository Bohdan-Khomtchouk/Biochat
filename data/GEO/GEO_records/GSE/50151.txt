TITLE
Expression data from 15 month old rat brain subjected to fructose fetal programming

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Fructose has recently been observed to affect brain metabolism and cognitive function in adults. However, possible fetal programming of brain metabolism induced by gestational fructose has not been examined. We evaluated mitochondrial function in the brain of aging (15 month) male offspring of Fischer F344 rat dams fed either a high-fructose diet (50% energy from fructose) or a matched control diet during early life (gestation and lactation). We used microarrays to detail changes in global programme of gene expression in offspring brains from rats subjected to either a control diet or a high fructose diet during gestation and lactation

DESIGN
Pregnant Fischer F344 rats were put on a control diet or a high fructose diet during gestation and lactation starting day 1 of gestation. Offspring was weaned at day 20 after birth and put on a standard chow diet until 15 months of age when they were sacrificed and brain samples obtained followed by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
