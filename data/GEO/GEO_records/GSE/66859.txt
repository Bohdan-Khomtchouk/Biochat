TITLE
MAGE-A1 Promotes Proliferation, Migration and Invasion of Human Melanoma Cells through RNA-SEQ Analysis via Affecting C-JUN-IL8-ARHGAP29 Network

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To define the role of MAGE-A1 in melanoma growth and metastasis, we performed RNA-seq analysis on MAGE-A1 overexpression (OE) and knockdown (KD) models in A375 human melanoma cell line. Our results revealed that overexpression of MAGE-A1 dramatically promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion of human melanoma cells in vitro and down-regulated of MAGE-A1 inhibited tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, MAGE-A1 exerts its tumor promoting activity via activating including ERK-MAPK signaling pathway by RNA-seq analysis.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of MAGE-A1 over expression (OE), knockdown (KD),  pcDNA-vector control, and pRNAT-scramble control in A375 cell line were generated using Ion torrent

PLATFORM
GPL17301 Ion Torrent PGM (Homo sapiens)
