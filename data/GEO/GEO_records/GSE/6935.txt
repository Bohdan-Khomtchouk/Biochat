TITLE
Expression data from planktonic and biofilm cultures of Mycobacterium smegmatis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis

SUMMARY
Transition of microbial growth from planktonic to biofilm is associated with programmed changes in the global patterns of gene expression. These changes are likely to faciliate the appropriate physiological and metabolic adjustments that bacteria need to make during the development of biofilms. Using microarrays we have examined the changes in pattern of gene expression associated with growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis in various stages of planktonic and biofilm cultures. Keywords: developmental time course

DESIGN
M.smegmatis cells were harvested from logarithmic and stationary phase planktonic as well as 3day and 4day biofilm cultures. RNA extracted from these cells were subjected to labelling and hybridization on TIGR microarray chips according to the protocol described by the manufacturer.
