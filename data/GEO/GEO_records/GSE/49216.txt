TITLE
Gene regulation by Pax6 in the lens placode - E10.25

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild type or Pax6 fx/fx; Le-Cre-positive surface ectoderm from E10.25 mouse embryos was laser micodissected from three embryos of each genotype. Total RNA was purified and reverse transcribed and amplified using a NuGEN kit. cDNA was biotinylated and hybridized to Illumina Mouse6 bead arrays.

DESIGN
Three wild type and three knockout embryos were used. Each array used the cDNA obtained from the two prospective lens tissues from one embryo.

PLATFORM
GPL6105 Illumina mouse-6 v1.1 expression beadchip
