TITLE
Intermediolateral column, medial, and lateral motoneurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Three cell types, intermediolateral column motoneurons, medial motoneurons, and lateral motoneurons were isolated from a single adult spinal cord using laser capture microscopy. Four hundred captures were collected for each cell type. For a given cell type, RNA was extracted from the 400 captures using an Arcturus picopure kit. RNA was split in half and two targets were produced using a double amplification protocol. Each target was hybridized to Affymetrix chips and signals were normalized with R-pack. Inverse logs are provided. Five animals were used in these experiments, and all three cell types were collected from each animal. Thus, for each cell type, there are five biological replicates, and for each biological replicate there are two technical replicates. In all thirty chips were analyzed. Techinical replicates are indicated as Set 1 and Set 2. Animal numbers are indicated by Pair1 through Pair 5. Keywords: other
