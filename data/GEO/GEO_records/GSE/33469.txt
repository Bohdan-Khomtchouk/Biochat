TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of 57 human T-ALL samples collected in human clinical trial E2993 (Marks et al., 2009)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of microarray gene expression signatures in adult T-ALL demonstrated a high prevalence of early immature leukemias and revealed a close relationship between these tumors and myeloid leukemias.
