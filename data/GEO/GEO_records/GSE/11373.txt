TITLE
Gene expression profile analysis for the Fascin knockdown esophageal squamous carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fascin, an actin-binding protein, is upregulated in a variety of cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and is proposed to function in cellular growth, mobility and invasiveness. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms through which fascin expression contributes to the proliferation and invasiveness of ESCC are unknown. To address this issue and to identify genes and biological pathways associated with fascin expression, a genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed on a fascin RNAi-depleted cell line and a corresponding ESCC cell line previously determined to express high levels of fascin. Keywords: cell type comparison
