TITLE
Hoxa5 dependent transcriptional regulation of pontine nuclei subset formation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cortico-ponto-cerebellar topographic circuit formation requires patterned expression of chemotropically active molecules as well as differential expression of axon guidance molecules within the pontine nuclei. We carried out RNA-sequencing experiments on different sets of genetically identified or manipulated pontine nuclei neurons followed by comparative transcriptome analysis to identify genes which are potentially involved in controlling PN circuit formation and are regulated by Hoxa5.

DESIGN
6 control samples were compared to 3 12 samples in total; 6 reference samples were compared to 2 conditions with 3 samples each

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
