TITLE
Baseline expression of lymphatic and inflammatory genes in CD14+ blood monocytes from healthy donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Blood was donated by four healthy volunteers with no known illness or malignancies. Mononuclear cells were separated from the blood by density gradient and CD14+ cells were isolated using anti-CD14 IgG-conjugated magnetic beads and magnetic separation (Miltenyi Biotec).  We used an in-house array to analyze the gene expression of a total of 270 targets including 67 cytokines, 57 cytokine receptors, 18 chemokines, 11 chemokines receptors, 10 known TLR4 downstream targets, 64 other inflammation-related proteins, 12 genes expressed primarily in lymphatic endothelial cells, and 32 endothelial cell associated proteins. The results show a baseline expression in CD14+ PBMC in healthy individuals which can be used to detect changes in CD14+ PBMC population via transcript expression in individuals with illnesses and malignancies such as breast cancer.

DESIGN
Transcript of CD14+ peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMC) was analyzed by RT-qPCR gene expression profiling. CD14+ PBMC were isolated from four donors. For each specimen total RNA was isolated, cDNA synthesized, and 269 targets were analyzed by RT-qPCR.
