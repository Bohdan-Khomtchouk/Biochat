TITLE
Polysome profiling of glp-4 mutant animals

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To determine the translational status of mRNAs in glp-4 mutant animals, we analyzed total and polysomal RNA levels by tiling arrays

DESIGN
A total of 8 samples was analyzed (quadruplicates of glp-4_total and glp-4_polysomal, respectively)
