TITLE
Intermittent suckling does not influence the gene expression of Day 9 embryos during early gestation in primiparous sows

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Primiparous sows were randomly allocated to two treatments and were separated from piglets 8h daily from Day 21 of lactation companied with daily boar exposure for oestrus detection until weaning (Day 28). Gene expression of Day 9 embryos were compared between control sows (FE; sows artificially inseminated when  in heat during lactation ) and Skip-a-Heat sows (SE; sows in heat during lactation and artificially inseminated on the following oestrus cycle).

DESIGN
Stimulating lactational oestrus then two mating strategies were applied to primiparous sows; 1)FE; sows were in heat during lactation and received artificial insemination) and Skip-a-Heat sows (SE; sows were in heat during lactation and received artificial insemination at fallowing oestrus cycle).
