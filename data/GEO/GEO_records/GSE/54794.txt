TITLE
Rbfox2 controls autoregulation in RNA binding protein networks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated a global analysis of Rbfox2 splicing regulation combined with a highly specific, single nucleotide-resolution Rbfox2 RNA binding map.  We found that Rbfox2 regulates the splicing and expression of many previously unknown targets, and particularly a number of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), by modulating alternative splicing coupled-NMD. Based on our observations of RBP-Rbfox2 co-regulation with a polarity predicted by Rbfox2 binding, we propose a model whereby Rbfox2 tunes autoregulatory splicing events to control RBP expression levels and in turn alter their respective splicing networks.
