TITLE
Profiling of transcripts expression in Rag2 KO and wild type mice spleen by BeadChip array analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The purpose of the study was to investigate the differential expression pattern of genes in Rag2 KO mice spleen compared to its wild type counterpart. Methods: In this study, we have excised the spleen tissues from three Rag2 KO mice and three wild type mice, and then RNA samples were prepared with the spleen tissues for the analysis of transcriptomic profiles using the Illumina MouseRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChip platforms. The MouseRef-8 v2.0 BeadChip Kit content is derived from the national center for biotechnology information reference sequence (NCBI RefSeq) database (Build 36, Release 22). The content was supplemented with probes derived from the mouse exonic evidence based oligonucleotide (MEEBO) set, as well as standard protein-coding sequences described in the RIKEN FANTOM2 database. As well, the MouseRef-8 v2.0 BeadChip targets approximately 25,600 well-annotated RefSeq transcripts, over 19,100 unique genes, and enables the interrogation of 8 samples in parallel. The MouseRef-8 v2.0 BeadChip Kit uses the DirectHyb assay and is compatible with the iScan, HiScan, and Bead array reader systems. Result: The genes expression BeadChip array analysis showed that many genes have been expressed differentially between Rag2 KO and wild type  mice spleen. These genes might be involved in the different biological and physiological processes including immune regulations. Conclusion: The differential genes expression profile will provide important insight about the immune deregulation in Rag2 KO mice.

DESIGN
Spleen RNA derived from Rag2 KO and wild type mice were profiled by microarray, in triplicates for each sample, by the Illumina MouseRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChip platforms.
