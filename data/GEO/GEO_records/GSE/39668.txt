TITLE
Human prostate carcinoma cell line 22Rv1 overexpressing ESE1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Activation of the inflammatory circuits occurs frequently in cancer cells. However the molecular details linking inflammation to transformation and progression are still unknown. In this study we report for the first time, that activation of the ETS factor ESE1 is a key event connecting inflammatory signaling with prostate cancer progression. We report that ESE1 is induced upon IL-1 beta stimulation by NFKB and mediates key transcriptional changes involving cell adhesion, migration and invasion. ESE1 activation in turn induces NFKB transcriptional activation and intranuclear translocation and mediates the transforming phenotypes linked to the activation of IL-1B. Transcriptional signatures and immunohistochemistry revealed that this ESE1-NFKB regulatory circuit also operates in prostate tumors, particularly in those with significant elevation of ESE1. Thus, ESE1 promotes an inflammatory feed forward loop positively leading to prostate cancer progression.  Pharmacological NFKB inhibition reverted the transformed status of ESE1 cell lines providing a rationale for context-dependent therapeutic strategies in ESE1 activated tumors. These studies find a previously unrecognized link between ETS and activation of the NFKB pathway and open new avenues for prostate cancer treatment.

DESIGN
