TITLE
Global gene expression studies for coronary artery disease and its severity in North Indian population

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genes expression profiling for coronary artery disease (CAD) and its severity were performed in North Indian Population. For CAD a total of 394 differentially expressed genes, of which 331 genes were found to be up-regulated and 63 genes were found to be down-regulated (? 2.0 fold changes, p-value < 0.05). The expression analysis for severity of CAD identified 424 genes up-regulated and 97 down-regulated differentially expressed genes in SVD compared to controls, while 239 genes up-regulated and 125 genes down-regulated genes in TVD compared to controls. The microarray data was validated in different cohort with same inclusion criteria using Real-Time PCR. The mean fold mRNA expression levels for genes were calculated. APOA1, CFTR, SRC, ICAM1, ESR1, SHANK2, ITGA1, IFT22, ZGPAT and THBD were selected for this validation which showed similar patterns as found on microarray experiment.

DESIGN
A total of 12 non-diabetic male patients with stable CAD from North Indian population were selected for this study. We included 6 patients of single vessels disease (SVD) and 6 patients of triple vessels disease (TVD) defined by coronary angiogram. The weight of lesion was scored with modified Gensini Scoring. The Subjects with atypical angina having normal coronary angiogram were recruited in controls group.
