TITLE
Transcription data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Effect of FLO8 or MSS11 deletion and -overexpression on yeast transcript profiles compared to wild type in laboratory yeast strains Î£1278b and S288c.

DESIGN
We used two laboratory yeast strains that behave different with regard to adhesion phenotypes. By comparing yeast deleted in either FLO8 or MSS11 to wild type, or yeast overexpressing these genes, in both genetic backgrounds, we investigate the role of Flo8p and Mss11p on yeast transcription. By using similar growth conditions to what we use for adhesion phenotype determination we aim to correlate transcription profile changes to yeast behaviour (phenotypes).
