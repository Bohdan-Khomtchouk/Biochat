TITLE
Expression profile of wild type (WT) vs miR-155-/- in FLT3-ITD+ AML (MV4-11) cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression profile in miR-155-/- FLT3-ITD+ AML is unknown. Using empty vector (EV) or two distinct miR-155 (S3 or S10) lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 infected FLT3-ITD+ AML cell lines (MV4-11 cells), we performed next generation RNA sequencing to determine the expression profile in these cells dependent on miR-155. We found a number of pathways dysregulated, including STAT5 activation.

DESIGN
RNAseq was performed on EV or miR-155 lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 infected MV4-11 cell lines in triplicate cultures.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
