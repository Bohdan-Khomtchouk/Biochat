TITLE
Analysis of mRNA expression profiles in bovine endometrium during the pre-attachment period using monocygotic twin pairs

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
To get new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying the embryo-maternal communication during the pre-implantation period endometrium samples from Day 18 pregnant vs. non-pregnant twin cows were analyzed using a combination of subtracted cDNA libraries and cDNA array hybridization. Keywords: Comparison of endometrium of pregnant versus control animals
