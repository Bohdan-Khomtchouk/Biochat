TITLE
Trancriptome analysis of honey bees (Apis mellifera) infected with Nosema ceranae

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
The microsporidia Nosema ceranae are intracellular parasites that proliferate in the midgut epithelial cells of honey bees (Apis mellifera). To analyze the pathological effects of those microsporidia, we orally infected honey bee workers 7 days after their emergence. Bees were flash frozen 15 days after the infection. Then, the effects on the gut ventriculi were analyzed and compared to non-infected (control) bees.
