TITLE
Common lymphoid progenitor derivation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells is mediated by Bcl11a Â 

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) specialize in type I interferon production to coordinate innate and adaptive immunity. We identify two pDC subsets in vivo, evaluate their genome-wide expression, and demonstrate a developmental requirement for Bcl11a to provide insight into this enigmatic cell type.

DESIGN
ChIP sequenicng was performed for a transcription factor of BCL11A in the Nalm6 B cell line and the Raji B cell line. Input was sequenced and used as a control.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
