TITLE
Zebrafish Globin Locus (DNAse)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of  H3K4me3 modifications, Gata1 binding, and DNase I hypersensitivity sites in zebrafish adult red blood cells

DESIGN
Zebrafish peripheral blood nuclei were isolated for DNase I hypersensitivity assays. Total DNA were purified using the Proteinase K digestion and Phenol-Chloroform extraction.  Small DNase I fragments from the DNaseI treatement were enriched using a sucrose gradient.  These ends were then labeled and amplified during library construction and for Solexa sequencing
