TITLE
Gene expression data from Phase 2 of the SAMARA study (Supporting a Multi-disciplinary Approach to Researching Atherosclerosis)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our goal was to measure molecular phenotypes associated with coronary atherosclerosis severity in a geriatric cohort.

DESIGN
We utilized a “sample x reference” experimental design strategy in which RNA extracted from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was hybridized to the microarray slide in the presence of labeled Universal Human Reference RNA (UHRR, Stratagene, LaJolla, CA). A total of 143 subjects were used in this analysis. Briefly, five hundred nanograms of total RNA were used for gene expression profiling following reverse transcription and T-7 polymerase-mediated amplification/labeling with Cyanine-5 CTP. Labeled subject cRNA was co-hybridized to Agilent G4112F Whole Human Genome 4x44K oligonucleotide arrays with equimolar amounts of Cyanine-3 labeled UHRR. Slides were hybridized, washed, and scanned on an Axon 4000b microarray scanner. The data were processed using Feature Extraction (v9.5.1.1, Agilent) and imported into GeneSpring (v13, Agilent). The sample titles are composed using the following scheme: ID_gender_ancestry_ObsCad_CadClass_CXCL5rank
