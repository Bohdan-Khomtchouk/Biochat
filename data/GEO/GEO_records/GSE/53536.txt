TITLE
DNA binding activities of the C-clamp

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigated the DNA binding specificity of the C-clamp of dnTCF1E

DESIGN
Used a doxycycline inducible system to investigate the role of the C-clamp in the genome-wide binding of dnTCF1E.  Induced dnTCF1EWT and dnTCF1Emut (C-clamp mutant that is null for C-clamp DNA binding) over 2 time points (2 hours and 9 hours).  A 0 hour (no doxycycline, uninduced) control was also included.
