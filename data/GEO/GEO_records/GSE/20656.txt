TITLE
Effect of glutaraldehyde (Glut) on growth physiology and gene expression of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio vulgaris str. Hildenborough

SUMMARY
The effect of glutaraldehyde stress on Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH) gene expression was determined by comparing the gene expression profiles of DvH with glutaraldehyde added at mid-log phase against DvH grown without glutaraldehdyde. Low concentration glutaraldehyde had little influence over instantaneous growth rate constant and final cell density of the culture. Changes in gene expression caused by exposure to glutaraldehyde were determined using full-genome DvH microarrays. A lot of gene expressions were altered by glutaraldehyde. Keywords: Glutaraldehyde Stress

DESIGN
For each condition 2 unique biological samples were hybridized to 4 arrays that each contained duplicate spots. Genomic DNA was used as universal reference.
