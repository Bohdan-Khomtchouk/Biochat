TITLE
Direct Induction of Neural Progenitor Cells Transiently Passes Through a Partially-reprogrammed State

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During giNPC induction process, cell samples were harvested at various induction days including named Day1, Day4, Day7, Day10, Day14, Day17 and Day21. Meanwhile, samples from primary neurosphere-like cluster (named pre-NPCs), established giNPC cell line at passage 6 (named giNPCs P6), Brain-NPCs as well as Teratoma were also collected. Total RNA was isolated from cell pellets by Trizol reagent and RNA-Seq library were generated using KAPA Strandard mRNA-Seq Kits according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 11 cell types, generated by deep sequencing in duplicate, using HiSeq 2000. Paired-end 100-bp sequencing was applied.
