ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. This Series contains ChIP-chip data on Agilent 244K dual-color arrays for antibody: H3K9me3 at 12 different time-points of Drosophila development.
