TITLE
ChIP-chip of H3K9me3 in Drosophila at different time points of development

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. This Series contains ChIP-chip data on Agilent 244K dual-color arrays for antibody: H3K9me3 at 12 different time-points of Drosophila development. Current Dataset: [GSM382158..GSM382166]: ChIP-chip of H3K9me3 in Drosophila embryos at 12-16 hours of development [GSM384690..GSM384698]: ChIP-chip of H3K9me3 in Drosophila embryos at 0-4 hours of development [GSM384723..GSM384731]: ChIP-chip of H3K9me3 in Drosophila embryos at 4-8 hours of development [GSM384732..GSM384740]: ChIP-chip of H3K9me3 in Drosophila embryos at 16-20 hours of development [GSM384741..GSM384749]: ChIP-chip of H3K9me3 in Drosophila embryos at 20-24 hours of development [GSM384750..GSM384758]: ChIP-chip of H3K9me3 in Drosophila L1 larvae [GSM384760..GSM384768]: ChIP-chip of H3K9me3 in Drosophila L2 larvae [GSM418207..GSM418215]: ChIP-chip of H3K9me3 in Drosophila Adult male [GSM418216..GSM418224]: ChIP-chip of H3K9me3 in Drosophila embryos at 8-12 hours of development [GSM442371..GSM442379]: ChIP-chip of H3K9me3 in Drosophila Adult male - Set2 [GSM442380..GSM442388]: ChIP-chip of H3K9me3 in Drosophila Pupae [GSM442389..GSM442397]: ChIP-chip of H3K9me3 in Drosophila L3 larvae For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
For each combination of time-point and antibody, triplicate ChIP experiments have been performed and hybridized on Agilent 244K arrays. 3 arrays per genome have been used so that each time-point is a set of 9 tiling arrays.
