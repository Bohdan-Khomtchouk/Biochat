TITLE
Expression Profiling Reveals Unexpected Targets and Functions of the Human Steroid Receptor RNA Activator (SRA) Gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA) gene encodes both non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and protein-generating isoforms. However, the breadth of endogenous target genes that might be regulated by SRA RNAs remains largely unknown. To address this, we depleted SRA RNA in two human cancer cell lines (HeLa and MCF-7) with small interfering RNAs, then assayed for changes in gene expression by microarray analyses using Affymetrix HGU133+2 arrays. We also tested if SRA depletion affects estradiol-regulated genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
We transiently transfected HeLa or MCF-7 human cancer cell lines with with non-targeting (NT) or SRA-targeting siRNAs. Six total HeLa RNA samples were analyzed on an Affymetrix HGU133+2 array, representing three biological triplicates. Likewise, 12 total MCF-7 RNA samples were analyzed on Affymetrix HGU133+2 arrays, representing biological trilplicates for both NT and siSRA transfected cells and with/without 10 nM estradiol (E2) for 6 hours.
