TITLE
Long noncoding RNAs in human Neuroblastoma BE(2)-C Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of long noncoding RNAs in human neuroblastoma BE(2)-C after transfection with control siRNA or N-Myc siRNA We analysed which long nocoding RNAs were N-Myc targets.

DESIGN
Neuroblastoma BE(2)-C cells were transfected with control siRNA or N-Myc siRNA. RNA was extracted from the cells 30 hours after siRNA transfections, and subjected to differential gene expression studies with NCodeâ„¢ Human Non-coding RNA Microarray from In vitrogen.
