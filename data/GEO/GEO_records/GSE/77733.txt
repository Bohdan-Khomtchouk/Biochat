TITLE
Expression data from root tips of Medicago truncatula wild type and ngr mutant

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
Root gravitropic response involves signal perception, signal transduction, asymetric auxin transport and differential cell elongation in the root tip. However, the regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. We used microarray to compare transcript profiles in the root tip samples of wild type and ngr mutant.

DESIGN
Medicago truncatula wild type and ngr mutant derived from fast neutron bombardment (FNB) mutagenesis were grown in an aeroponic system for five days. Three centimeter-long root tips were collected for RNA isolation and microarray experiments.
