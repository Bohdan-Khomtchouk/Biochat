TITLE
Effects of Long-term Serial Passaging on the Characteristics and Properties of Cell Lines Derived From Uveal Melanoma Primary Tumors.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Development of liver metastasis remains the most common cause of mortality in uveal melanoma (UM). Although advances in genomics allowed the direct evaluation of clinical samples of this eye cancer, there is still a need for reliable preclinical models to progress from correlative studies to mechanistic investigations. A few UM cell lines have been characterized, but so far the translation of basic knowledge to the clinic for the treatment of metastatic disease has been incremental at best. The aim of this study was to determine whether the properties of UM cell lines at various passages were similar to their corresponding primary tumors.

DESIGN
Two primary uveal melanoma tumors and their derivative cell lines at three different passages are analyzed by gene profiling
