TITLE
Expression in IFN-gamma treated control and Atg5-/- macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Type-I (α/β) and -II (γ) interferons (IFN), through an incompletely understood combination of redundant and unique mechanisms, are essential for host resistance to viral infection. We report a requirement for the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1 autophagosome elongation complex in IFNγ-mediated control of murine norovirus in macrophages. We use microarrays to compare transcriptional changes induced in control and Atg5 deficient macrophages by IFNγ treatment.

DESIGN
Bone marrow derived macrophages were generated from Atg5flox/flox and Atg5flox/flox+LysM cre mice and treated with media alone or 100U/ml of IFNγ for 14 hrs. RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and 10 µg of RNA hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
