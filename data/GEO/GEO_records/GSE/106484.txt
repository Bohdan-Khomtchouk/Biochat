TITLE
Gene expression analysis in fly ovaries carrying Sco homozgyous clones

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study is to analyze genes affected by Sco mutation using RNA-seq. Ovarian mRNA prolife of 7-day-old control flies and flies carring Sco mutant follicle cell clones were generated by deep sequence, in duplicate. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrowsâ€“Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat followed by Cufflinks.
