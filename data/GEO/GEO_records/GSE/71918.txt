TITLE
Expression changes by Endodermal PIF1: SCR:PIF1/pifQ transgenic plant vs. pif1pif3pif4pif5 (pifQ) mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings comparing SCR:PIF1/pifQ transgenic plant with pif1pif3pif4pif5 quadruple mutant (pifQ). Seedlings were grown under dark condition for 2.5 days. Goal was to determine the effects of endodermal PIF1 in dark-grown seedlings.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, SCR:PIF1/pifQ vs. pifQ Biological replicates: 3 pifQ replicates, 3 SCR:PIF1 replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL9020 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Feature Number version)
