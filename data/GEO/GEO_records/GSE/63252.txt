TITLE
Induction of ER stress in HCT116 colon cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of p53 and DICER in the induction of ER stress, wildtype, p53 knockout or DICER mutant HCT116 colon cancer cells were treated with the ER stress inducers tunicamycin or brefeldin A for 24 hours. Microarray analysis was used to determine changes in gene expression associated with the induction of ER stress, and to compare this induction in wildtype, p53 knockout or DICER mutant HCT116 colon cancer cells

DESIGN
Triplicate samples of HCT116 wildtype, HCT116 p53 knockout and HCT116 DICEREX5/EX5 cells were treated with with 0.5 mg/ml of BFA or 2 mg/ml of Tm for 24 h. Following treatment, cells were harvested and lysed in TRIzol reagent and RNA was extracted. Microarray analysis was carried out using Affymetrix HG-U133_Plus-2 arrays.
