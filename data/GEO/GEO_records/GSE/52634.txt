TITLE
C. tropicalis cells under in vitro biofilm-forming conditions

ORGANISM
Candida tropicalis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of a-type wor1 deleted cells and mixed a-type and alpha-type opaque cells under in vitro biofilm-forming conditions. Specifically, they were grown for two days at room temperature in a 12-well poly-styrene plate containing 1 ml of Lee's + Glucose liquid media. Samples were hybridized against a universal mixed reference sample of a-type cells in white and opaque states grown in Spider liquid media.

DESIGN
2 condition experiment: white wor1-deletion mutant a-type cells, opaque mixed a-type and alpha-type cells; two biological replicates each.
