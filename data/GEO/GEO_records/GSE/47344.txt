TITLE
Expression data from Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315 hfq and hfq2 mutants

ORGANISM
Burkholderia cenocepacia

SUMMARY
Hfq proteins are RNA chaperones that play a critical role in post-transcription regulation of gene expression. Bacteria of the Burkholderia cepacia complex harbor two distinct and functional Hfq proteins, the Hfq and Hfq2. We have previously performed the functional analysis of Hfq and Hfq2 in the pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315. In order to examine the impacts of each RNA chaperone on the global transcriptome of B. cenocepacia J2315, we performed comparative transcriptome profile of mutants on the hfq and hfq2 genes, using as reference the wild-type strain.

DESIGN
For expression profiling, over-night cultures of the Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315 wild-type strain and the isogenic mutants hfq::Tp and Δhfq2 grown in LB medium were diluted to an initial OD640 nm of 0.25 into  LB medium. Triplicate samples were cultured at 37ºC with 250 r.p.m. agitation for 16 h and RNA extracted from the three bacterial isolates.

PLATFORM
