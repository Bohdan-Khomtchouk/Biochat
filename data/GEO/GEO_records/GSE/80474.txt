TITLE
Investigating Conservation of the Cell-Cycle-Regulated Transcriptional Program in the Fungal Pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii

SUMMARY
Cell-cycle transcript dynamics from two species of wild-type budding yeast growing at 30 degrees Celsius in rich media: Saccharomyces cerevisiae (BF264-15D background) and Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii (H99F background). We compared programs of cell-cycle-regulated genes between distantly related budding yeasts.

DESIGN
One time course experiment for each yeast over multiple cell cycles

PLATFORM
GPL17342 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) GPL21750 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii)
