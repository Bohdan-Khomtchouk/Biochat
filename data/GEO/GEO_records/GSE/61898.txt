TITLE
Polysome profiling in CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1-overexpressing (CCA1-ox) Arabidopsis thaliana over a 24-hour diurnal cycle

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Circadian control of gene expression has been established in plants at the transcriptional level, but relatively little is known about circadian control of translation.  We used polysome profiling to characterize regulation of transcription and translation over a 24-hour diurnal cycle in Arabidopsis, both in wild type and in plants with a disrupted clock due to constitutive overexpression of the CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 gene (CCA1-ox, AGI AT2G46830).

DESIGN
10 day-old wild type and CCA1-ox (described in Cell. 1998 Jun 26;93(7):1207-17) Arabidopsis seedlings were harvested at 6am (Zeitgeber time ZT0), 12pm (ZT6), 6pm (ZT12), and 12am (ZT18), with 3 replicates for each time and genotype.
