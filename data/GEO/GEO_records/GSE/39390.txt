TITLE
CGH analysis of androgenetic haploid embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis of  androgenetic haploid embryonic stem cells was done with 129/Sv male mouse kidney genomic DNA as reference. The results revealed no consistent copy number variations (CNVs) among the examined cell lines (AH129-5, AH129-N1 and AH129-NC1), except for the global difference on the X chromosome to the male control.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA of FACS sorted G0/G1 stage ahES cells was compared with 129/Sv male mouse kidney genomic DNA reference by the NimbleGen Mouse CGH 3x720K Whole-Genome Tiling Array (Build MM9) [100718_MM9_WG_CGH_HX3]
