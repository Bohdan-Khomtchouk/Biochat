TITLE
ChIP-Seq of Pol2 in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA Polymerase II is the enzyme responsible for active transcription.Â  To gain insight into the genes occupied by RNA Polymerase II and actively transcribed in MEFS, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed to determine the genome-wide binding targets of RNA Pol2.

DESIGN
DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing. ChIP was performed using an antibody against RNA Polymerase II.
