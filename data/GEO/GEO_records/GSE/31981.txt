TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human vascular cells following gene transfer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For further understanding of the gene expression profile of human vascular cells following gene transfer in vitro, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify gene families or single genes with the potential to distinguish between responders and non-responders to a particular gene therapy. Human vascular cells from deseased donors were derived and transduced in vitro. Total RNA was isolated from the cells and subjected to microarray analysis using the Agilent technology.

DESIGN
Two human donors, with two cell types per donor, were tested, including transduced cells and two different control samples. Technical triplicates were tested for each sample type. Thus, a total of 36 whole genome arrays were processed and analyzed. Expression of candidate genes from this signature will be quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, allowing further simplified analysis of a large pool of human donors.
