TITLE
RDC and cisplatin transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ruthenium based compound have developed for anticancer therapy Identification of the transcriptomes induced by either cisplatin or a ruthenium-based compound (RDC) that are both cytotoxic. Cells were treated with either cisplatin or RDC at their IC50 and for 6h or 24h.

DESIGN
15 samples are in the experiment. Each condition has been done in triplicates. Ct is control; R6 is RDC applied for 6h, R24 is RDC applied for 24h, C6 is ciplatin applied 6h and C24 is cisplatin applied for 24h. U87 cells were used.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
