TITLE
Small RNA profiling of Arabidopsis in response to fungal elicitors

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This experiment describes small RNA gene expression after treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings with elicitors obtained from the fungus F. oxysporum

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis plants that had been treated with elicitors obtained from the fungus F. oxysporum, and mock-inoculated plants, at different times of treatment (from 5 min to 120 min of treatment). Three independent biological replicates were prepared for each time point and condition. Samples harvested at 5, 30, 60 and 120 min of elicitor treatment were used for microarray experiments. Elicitor-induced alterations we identified by determining the ratio of the hybridization signal intensities between treated and control plants.
