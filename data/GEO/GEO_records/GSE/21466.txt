TITLE
T. thermophilus HB8 wild-type strain in response to iron (2008)

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA in Thermus thermophilus HB8 wild-type strain at 30 min after the addition of FeSO4.

DESIGN
Three wild-type strain of T. thermophilus HB8 were pre-cultured at 70 degC for 4 hours in 5 mL of TT medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The cells diluted 100 fold by the synthetic medium and then cultivated at 70Â°C until A600 value being 1.0 . Then the 1.0 mM of FeSO4 was added into the medium, and continued cultivation. Cells were collected at 0 and 30 min time point after the addition of iron ion, and then crude RNA was extracted. The expression of each mRNA was analyzed on a GeneChip as described under Sample Description Sheet of each sample.
