TITLE
Comparison of arf2, gnc gnl and arf2 gnc gnl transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We have used Agilent whole genome arrays (v4) to compare the gene expression changes between 10-day-old Arabidopsis wild type seedlings and arf2-8 (Ellis et al., 2005), gnc gnl (Richter et al., 2011) and arf2 gnc gnl mutants (all Col ecotype).

DESIGN
Three independent biological samples were prepared for each genotype.
