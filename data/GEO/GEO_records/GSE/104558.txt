TITLE
Expression data from mouse MDSC with interference or overexpression of lncMDSC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have emerged as major regulators of immune responses in cancer and other pathological conditions. At the epigenetic level, lncRNA play an important role in cell differentiation and function. We identify a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) termed as lnc-mdsc in MDSCs, which may tightly control the development of MDSCs. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and identified distinct classes of up or down regulated genes in MDSC interference or overexpression the lncMDSC.

DESIGN
The transfected MDSC were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. MDSC transfection control shRNA lentivirus as siNC group,MDSC transfection shlncMDSC lentivirus as SilncRNA group, MDSC transfection overexpression control lentivirus as NC group, MDSC transfection lncMDSC overexpression lentivirus as lncRNA group.
