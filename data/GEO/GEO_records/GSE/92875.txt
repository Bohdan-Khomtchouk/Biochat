TITLE
Genome-wide microRNA transcriptome profiles in Control and Schizophrenia hiPSC-dervied NPC [miRNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We Report the genome-wide RNA expression levels in control and schizophrenia hiPSC dervied NPC treated with neuronal media for 2 days.  In total, 440 microRNA expression were detected in all samples, of which 16 were dysregualted.

DESIGN
Examination, identification and comparision of microRNA expression profliles in control and schizophrenia npc

PLATFORM
