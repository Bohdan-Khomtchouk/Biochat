TITLE
Epigenetic regulation of miRNA in CLL [ChIP_hsa_miRNA_v3b]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide profiling of histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation is used for identification of microRNA transcriptional start sites. Various cell types allow a broad range detection of putative promoters rather independent of tissue specific expression patterns. These data are used for identification of   aberrant epigenetic regulation at the respective regions.

DESIGN
11 samples total: 3 primary B-cell samples (1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] and 2 healthy controls), 2 CLL related cell lines -/+ 5-aza-2â€™-deoxycytidine (DAC) treatment (Mec-1, EHEB), T-lymphoid cell line JURKAT, myeloid cell line HL-60,  colon cancer cell line HCT-116 wild type and double knock out; H3K4me3 enriched vs. input
