TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and its isogenic ampR mutant in the presence and absence of sub-MIC ß-lactam exposure.

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
The transcriptional regulator AmpR controls expression of the AmpC ß-lactamase in P. aeruginosa and other bacteria. Studies have demonstrated that in addition to regulating ampC expression, AmpR also regulates the expression of the sigma factor AlgT/U and the production of some quorum-sensing regulated virulence factors. In order to understand the ampR regulon, we compared the expression profiles of PAO1 and its isogenic ampR mutant, PAO∆ampR in the presence and absence of sub-MIC ß-lactam stress. The analysis demonstrates that the ampR regulon is much more extensive than previously thought, with the deletion of ampR affecting the expression of over 300 genes. Expression of an additional 207 genes are affected by AmpR when the cells are exposed to sub-MIC ß-lactam stress, indicating that the ampR regulon in P. aeruginosa is much more extensive than previously thought.

DESIGN
An inframe deletion of ampR was generated in P. aeruginosa PAO1. The wild type and ampR mutant strains were grown to mid-log phase and subjected to sub-MIC ß-lactam exposure. Total RNA was isolated from 2-hour ß-lactam exposed and unexposed cells to monitor changes in gene expression arising due to loss of ampR in the presence and absence of ß-lactam exposure.
