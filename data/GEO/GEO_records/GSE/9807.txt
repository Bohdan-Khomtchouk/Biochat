Expression data from RNAi SNCA treated human neuroblastoma cell line

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The pre-synaptic protein α-synuclein is a key player in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Together with accumulation and missfolding of α-synuclein protofibrils serve as seed structures for the aggregation of numerous proteins in the cytoplasm of neuronal cells, the so-called Lewy bodies. Furthermore, missense mutations in the SNCA gene and gene multiplications lead to autosomal dominant forms of familiar PD. However, so far the exact biological role of α-synuclein in normal brain is elusive. To gain more insights into the biological function of this protein we monitored whole genome expression changes in dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) caused by a 90% reduction of α-synuclein by RNA interference. Keywords: whole genome expression changes through the loss of α-synuclein

DESIGN
comparison of expression profil changes in cells with normal α-synuclein level (control siRNA treatment) and reduced α-synuclein level (siSNCA4 treatment), triplicatesof each condition
