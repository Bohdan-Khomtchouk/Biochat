TITLE
Expression profile of Pten loss and ERG overexpression in mouse prostate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed expression mouse profiling of prostates of 3 month WT, ERG, PTEN f/f and Pten f/f;ERG mice. For WT and ERG prostates, entire prostates were dissected and total RNA immediated harvested. For Pten f/f and Pten f/f;ERG prostates, the Ventral Lobe was dissected.

DESIGN
Mice are in the C57B6 background. The prostate were harvested and RNA isolated by standard protocols and analyzed by expression profiling.
