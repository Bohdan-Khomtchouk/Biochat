TITLE
Transformants of wheat GSK3/Shaggy-like kinase TaSK5 vs wild-type Col-0

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
A novel cold-inducible GSK3/Shaggy-like kinase cDNA (TaSK5) was isolated from winter wheat by a macroarray-based differential screening approach. Sequence analysis of TaSK5 revealed high similarity to Arabidopsis subgroup I GSK3/Shaggy-like kinases ASK-alpha, ASK-gamma and ASK-epsilon. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TaSK5 cDNA under the control of CaMV 35S promoter showed enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stresses. In contrast, the tolerance of the transgenic plants to freezing stress was not altered. To identify genes which are differentially regulated in the 35S:TaSK5 over-expressing Arabidopsis plants under non-stress conditions, we compared the genome-wide expression profiles of Col-0 and plants over-expressing TaSK5 using DNA microarrays. Sixty seven genes were found to be expressed at least 2-fold more strongly in 35S:TaSK5 plants than in Col-0, and 17 genes were found to be expressed at least 2-fold more strongly in Col-0 than in 35S:TaSK5 plants. Most of the TaSK5 up-regulated genes were also induced by abiotic stresses, including cold, salt and drought. These results support the involvement of TaSK5 in abiotic stress signal transduction. Keywords: transgenic vs wt Col.-0 comparison

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from rosette leaves of two independent 3-week-old T1 Arabidopsis Col-0 plants over-expressing TaSK5 driven by 35S promoter and the whole transcriptome was compared with that of wild-type plant. Sample pairs in two independent transformants (OX7 and OX17), referred as biological replicates, were analyzed by the two-color method. Dye-swapped hybridizations were performed in every replicate.
