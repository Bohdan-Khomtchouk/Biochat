TITLE
Prolyl hydroxylase P4HA1 is amplified, overexpressed in prostate cancer and enhances cancer invasion by altering MMP1 expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent studies including next-generation sequencing have identified genomic events in prostate cancer including ETS gene fusions. However, it is critical to identify druggable targets for prostate cancer and their mechanism of action for therapeutic intervention. Here, we show that prolyl 4-hydroxylase, alpha polypeptide I (P4HA1) is overexpressed in aggressive prostate cancer and amplified in a subset of metastatic prostate cancer. This study provides mechanistic insights of P4HA1 regulation and its mode of action including its role in regulating MMP1. Importantly, P4HA1 mediated invasion in cancer cells could be reversed using MMP1 inhibitor, revealing therapeutic utility of targeting P4HA1 either directly or by inhibiting its downstream effectors.
