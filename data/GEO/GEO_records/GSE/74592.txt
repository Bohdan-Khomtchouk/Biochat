TITLE
Identification of Drosophila MBF1 regulated genes in embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Multiprotein bridging factor 1(MBF1), a transcriptional co-activator that can regulate transcription by forming a bridge between the TATA-box-binding protein and gene-specific transcription factors. MBF1 is required for organ development and environmental stress responses. However, the targets of MBF1 is unknown. To identify the MBF1 regulated genes, we compared expression profiles of mRNA purified from wild-type and mbf1 mutant embryos.

DESIGN
yw and mbf1 mutant embryos were selected at later stage of development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
