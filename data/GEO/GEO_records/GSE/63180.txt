TITLE
RNAseq of Individual 4T1 Clonal Populations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcriptional profile 23 cell lines derived from single clones of the 4T1 cell lines were assessed with RNAseq. The two clones with a strong propensity to intravasate were found to have 12 genes in common that were overexperessed relative to the other 21 clones.

DESIGN
Clone RNAseq 1) 23 clonal lines were established using single cell FACs sorting from the 4T1 mammary cancer cell line. 2) After establishing the lines the clones were assesed (in a pooled setting) for their capacity to intravasate the vascular system. 3) Transcriptional profiling was carried out using RNAseq. 4) Two clones were found to be strong intravasators and these were compared to the other clones to identify genes that were overexpressed (as compared to at least half of the other clones in both lines).
