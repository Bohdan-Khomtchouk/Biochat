TITLE
Expression data from lung SCC treated with DMSO and PXD101

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in lung SCC cells treated with belinostat, a pan-HDAC inhibitor. The primary focus of this work is to investigate the efficacy of belinostat on lung SCC cells. Our phosphoproteomic profiling analyses revealed the downregulation of MAPK signaling pathway upon drug treatment, together with the induction of apoptosis. While HDAC inhibition generally affects transcription, the mechanism of SOS/MAPK downregulation was therefore proposed to be affected at the transcriptomic level. However, genes related to MAPK pathway were not significantly regulated upon belinostat treatment, whereas ubiquitin-proteasome gene signature was affected. This supports an indirect mechanism of epigenetic regulation on MAPK signaling that should be explored further.

DESIGN
Lung SCC cell lines treated with DMSO and PXD101 were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to investigate the initial transcriptomic changes impacted by belinostat at early time point. Cells were treated with belinostat for 8 hours.
