TITLE
The Sinorhizobium meliloti SyrM regulon: effects on global gene expression are mediated by syrA and nodD3 (ChvI-SyrA)

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
We characterized transcriptomes of strains containing a K214T mutation in chvI, with and without overexpression of syrA.  Our work shows that overexpression of syrA suppresses many of the transcription changes observed in the chvI K214T mutant.
