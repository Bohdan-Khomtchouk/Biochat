TITLE
The Sinorhizobium meliloti SyrM regulon: effects on global gene expression are mediated by syrA and nodD3 (ChvI-SyrA)

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
We characterized transcriptomes of strains containing a K214T mutation in chvI, with and without overexpression of syrA.  Our work shows that overexpression of syrA suppresses many of the transcription changes observed in the chvI K214T mutant.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of a Sinorhizobium meliloti chvI K214 mutant overexpressing syrA was performed using custom Affymetrix GeneChips
