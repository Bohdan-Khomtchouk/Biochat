TITLE
Delineation of EZH2 oncogenic functions in hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to delineate the important EZH2 direct target genes that mediate the oncogenic properties of EZH2 in HCC. The EZH2 direct target genes in two HCC cell lines were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray (ChIP-chip) analysis and later confirmed by independent ChIP-PCR. The functions of the target genes were further examined.

DESIGN
Two human HCC cell lines, Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 (PLC5), were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. ChIP assays were performed using anti-EZH2 antibody. The immunoprecipitated and input DNA were used to probe the Agilent human ChIP-chip arrays.
