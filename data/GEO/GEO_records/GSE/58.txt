TITLE
Serum stimulation of fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The temporal program of gene expression during a model physiological response of human cells, the response of fibroblasts to serum, was explored with a complementary DNA microarray representing about 8600 different human genes. Genes could be clustered in groups on the basis of their temporal patterns of expression in this program. Many features of the transcriptional program appeared to be related to the physiology of wound repair suggesting that fibroblasts play a larger and richer role in this complex multicellular response than had previously been appreciated. This study is described more fully in Iyer VR, et al. 1999. Science 283:83-7 Keywords: other
