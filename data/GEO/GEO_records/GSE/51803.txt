TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in M. bovis BCG infected THP-1 cells subjected to Metformin treatement

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of Metfromin induced changes in mycobacteria infected cell at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was whether metformin has any effect on the host immune response in mycobacteria infected cells? Results provide important information on the effect of metformin on the inflammatory response and immune activation associated with mycobacterial infection. In conclusion, Metfromin normalizes the effect of infection in THP1 cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from M. bovis BCG infected cells subjected to 4 or 48h of invitro treatment with 2mM metformin. This was compared to uninfected cells and, untreated infected cells.
