TITLE
Global hepatic transcript data from fasted male BXD strains on chow or high fat diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcript data from livers from fasted-state BXD strains on chow or high fat diet We used microarrays to compare the hepatic expression differences across the BXD strain family and across two diverse diets

DESIGN
29-week-old male mice were fasted overnight (6pm-9am), anesthetized under isoflurane, and perfused, then livers were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction and RNEasy cleanup. Each dietary and strain cohort consisted of ~5 animals which were prepared independently then pooled evenly by Âµg RNA before the Affymetrix arrays were run.
