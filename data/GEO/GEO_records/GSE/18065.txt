TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of two life cycle stages of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense

ORGANISM
Trypanosoma brucei gambiense

SUMMARY
Trypanosoma brucei gambiense is the causative agent of the fatal human disease African sleeping sickness. Here we have compared the transcriptome of two different life cycle stages, the potentially human-infective bloodstream form and the non-human-infective procyclic stage, using digital gene expression (DGE) analysis.

DESIGN
Digital gene expression analysis was performed on RNA from 3 biological replicates of bloodstream cultured T.b. gambiense strain STIB 386 and compared to that from 3 biological replicates of procyclic cultured T.b. gambiense strain STIB 386.
