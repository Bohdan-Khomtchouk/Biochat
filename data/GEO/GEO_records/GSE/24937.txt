TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of rice infected with three RDV strains

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rice dwarf virus (RDV) is the causal agent of rice dwarf disease which causes severe loss of rice yield in northern Asia countries. The disease symptoms are stunting of plant growth, chlorosis specks on leaves, and delayed and incomplete panicle exertion. Symptom severity  was different among three strains (RDV-O, â€“D84, and -S),  and was in the rank order RDV-O < -D84, < -S. In this study, we have analyzed the relationship between symptom severity and host gene responses by the gene expression analysis through the 60-mer oligo microarray. Keywords: virus infection, disease response
