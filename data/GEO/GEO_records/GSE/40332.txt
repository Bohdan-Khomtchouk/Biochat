TITLE
Gene expression profiles in wild-type and Jmjd3-/- embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were compared between wild-type and Jmjd3-/- embryos at E9.5 when mRNAs of posterior Hox genes are upregulated, because Jmjd3-/- mice embryos showed homeotic transformation. As expected, mRNAs of Hoxd10 and Hod11 were decreased in Jmjd3-/- embryos. Moreover, gene onthology (GO) analyses identified down-regulated genes (FC > 1.5) in Jmjd3-/- embryos were “multicellular organismal development” and “developmental process”.

DESIGN
Gene expressions in wild-type and Jmjd3-/- posterior half of embryos at E9.5 were examined. Two independent RNA samples of each genotypes were used to verify the reproducibility of the microarray analyses.
