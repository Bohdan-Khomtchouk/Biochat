TITLE
Ectopic expression of AP4 in human colorectal cancer cells DLD-1 for different times

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the transcriptome of the transcription factor AP4 DLD-1 cells were infected with AP4 coding viruses for different periods of time. Adenovirus amplification and purification was performed as previously described (He et al., 1998). The minimal amount of virus needed to reach more than 90% infection efficiency was determined by monitoring GFP signals with fluorescence microscopy. DLD-1 cells were infected in serum-free medium with adenovirus for 3 hours. After removal an equal amount of medium containing 20% FBS was added.

DESIGN
This study contains 17 Samples with different conditions/samples: Triplicates of non-infected cells as a control, triplicates of infections with an AP4 coding viruses harvested after 12, 24 and 48 hours and, as an additional control, a triplicate of cells infected with a GFP expressing virus harvested after 24 hours and unicates harvested after 12 and 48 hours.
