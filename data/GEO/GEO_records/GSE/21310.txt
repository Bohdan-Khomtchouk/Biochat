TITLE
Gene expression after focal demyelination of the corpus callosum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine expression profiles of cytokines and growth factor profiles in the subventricular zone (SVZ) after demyelination we performed gene array analysis. In SVZ after 4 days post lesin (dpl) LPC-injected tissue, demonstrated regulation of BMP pathway elements, including increased chordin, noggin, and ChorR, and decreased BMP4, compared to NaCl-injected tissue.

DESIGN
GEArrayTM expression array systems (cat#OMM031 SuperArray, Bethesda, MD) consisted of spotted cDNA fragments encoding 113 mouse genes for neurotrophic signaling molecules involved in neuronal growth and differentiation, as well as regeneration and survival. Control sequences (PUC18, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), peptidylpropyl isomerase A (Ppia), and β-actin) were also included. These microarrays were employed to compare SVZ gene expression 4 days after NaCl or LPC injection in corpus callosum. Total RNA was isolated by Trizol (Invitrogen) and processed for microarray hybridization following the manufacturer’s instructions. Arrays were visualized by autoradiography, and hybridization signals were scanned and analyzed for density in GEArray Expression Analysis Suite 2.0. The normalized value for each gene was calculated by dividing the value of each gene by the average value of the housekeeping genes GAPDH, Ppia, and β-actin.
