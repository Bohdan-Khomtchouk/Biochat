TITLE
Photomorphogenesis of Arabidopsis seedlings is accompanied by complex alternative splicing alterations

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We analyzed transcriptome-wide gene expression and AS changes in etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to red, blue, and white light. Our study revealed that different types of light signals trigger rapid AS responses of numerous genes, including splicing factors and other functional groups. Among these candidates was RRC1, which was previously shown to function in PHYB signaling. The light signaling phenotype of an rrc1 mutant could only be complemented with the splicing variant being up-regulated upon light exposure, indicating a self-reinforcing circuit. Finally, we provide evidence that light-regulated AS can occur in a phytochrome-independent manner and is closely intertwined with the plantâ€™s energy status.

DESIGN
Analysis of alternative splicing patterns of dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings exposed for 1 or 6 hours to white, blue, or red light, or kept in darkness; all samples in duplicates

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
