TITLE
Mouse isolated kidney preglomerular arterioles: wild type vs conditional knockout of RBP-J in renin cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA profiling of mouse kidney preglomerular arterioles comparing wild type arterioles vs.arterioles from mice having deletion of RBP-J in cells of the renin lineage We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in wild type and RBP-J conditional knockout (RPB-J cKO)  kidney arterioles which revealed upregulation of genes that belong to the immune response system.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment: wild type vs RBP-J cKO. Replicates: wild type - pool of arteriole prparations from 3 animals and cKO - pool of arteriole preparations from 4 animals . One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
