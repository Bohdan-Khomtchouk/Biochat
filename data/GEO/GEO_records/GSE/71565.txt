TITLE
Gene expression during primary osteoblast differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify genes with differential expression in primary murine osteoblasts we compared the transcriptomes of these cells at day 5 and day 12 of differentiation

DESIGN
CD11b-negative cells derived from calvariae of newborn mice were differentiated into osteoblasts by addition of ascorbic acid and ÃŸ-glycerophosphate for 5 or 12 days.
