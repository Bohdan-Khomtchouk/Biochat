TITLE
Biocompatibility assessment of functionalized magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles in human HepaRG cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression to distinguish the effect of diversely functionalized magnetic silica nanoparticles on human HepaRG cells. Cells were exposed in vitro, and datasets of differentially expressed genes were identified for NPs versus control samples.

DESIGN
NPs induced expression profiles in HepaRG cells were measured at 24 hours and 48 hours after exposure. Minimum three independent experiments were performed for each experiment.
