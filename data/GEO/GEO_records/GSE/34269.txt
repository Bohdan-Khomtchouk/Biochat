TITLE
Salmonella Typhimurium: Wild type SL1344 Vs. ∆relA, ∆spoT (ppGpp0) strain grown under SPI1-inducing conditions

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of early stationary phase S. Typhimurium, comparing wild type SL1344 with an isogenic ∆relA,∆spoT strain (JH3370).

DESIGN
Each array used labelled cDNA against a common genomic DNA reference. The wild type strain was arrayed in triplicate and the ∆relA,∆spoT strain in quadruplicate using RNA isolated from biologically independent cultures.

PLATFORM
GPL13609 SALSA 2 IFR Salmonella 8K Arrays
