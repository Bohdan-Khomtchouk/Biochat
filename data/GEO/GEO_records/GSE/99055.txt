TITLE
Global gene expression in Abp57-overexpressing transgenic rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
An auxin-binding protein (Abp57) was previously isolated from rice and known to activate plasma membrane proton ATPase. The Abp57 function was characterised by overexpression in the rice and Arabidopsis. The transgene expression was driven by constitutive promoter, CaMV35S. Results from physiological experiments showed that the transgenic lines were tolerant to drought and salinity stress. The global effects of Abp57 overexpression in rice were studied using microarray platform from Affymetrix.

DESIGN
Control and transgenic rice seeds were germinated and grown on MS medium for 10 days under controlled condition. Total RNA was prepared from whole seedling and the experiment was conducted with two groups of samples: control and Abp57-overexpressing lines. Each group of the sample contains three biological replicates and every biological replicates was consisted of at least three seedlings tissue. The total RNA was processed for microarray analysis according to Affymetrix protocol.
