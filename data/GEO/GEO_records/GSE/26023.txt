TITLE
Prolyl hydroxylase PHD3 is essential for hypoxic regulation of neutrophilic inflammation in humans and mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neutrophils were isolated form peripheral blood of wildtype and Phd3 null mice, cultured for 4 hours in hypoxia (3% O2) and micro array analysis performed The aim of the present study is to identify the mechanism by which phd3 is required for the hypoxia mediated survival of neutrophils

DESIGN
Murine peripheral blood neutrophils were isolated from wildtype and phd3 null mice, cultured for 4 hours in hypoxia (3% O2) and micro array analysis performed
