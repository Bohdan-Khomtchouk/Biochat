TITLE
Genomic profiles of oxidative stress-induced rat renal cell carcinomas

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Intraperitoneal administration of ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) initiates Fenton reaction in the renal proximal tubules of rodents that ultimately leads to a high incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after repeated treatment. We performed high-resolution microarray comparative genomic hybridization to identify characteristics in the genomic profiles of oxidative stress-induced rat RCCs. The results revealed extensive large-scale genomic alterations with a preference for deletion.

DESIGN
Carcinogenesis protocol was performed using male F1 hybrid rats between Fischer344 and Brown-Norway strains. 13 primary tumors and 2 cell lines of Fe-NTA induced RCCs were profiled on Agilent 185K rat genome CGH microarrays. One RCC sample of a female Eker rat was also analyzed with the same Agilent 185K rat genome CGH microarray.
