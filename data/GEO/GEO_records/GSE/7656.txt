TITLE
E.coli GeneChip study of E.coli responses to osmotic and heat stresses

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We probed the mechanism of cross-regulation of osmotic and heat stress responses by characterizing the effects of high osmolarity (0.3M vs. 0.0M NaCl) and temperature (43oC vs. 30oC) on the transcriptome of Escherichia coli K12 using  E. coli Genome 2 Array (Affymetrix, Inc.). Independent array hybridizations were carried out for 3 biological replicates (independent cultures). Total RNA was extracted using a hot phenol-chloroform method.  cDNA synthesis, fragmentation and labeling, and washing and scanning of E. coli GeneChip Arrays were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Affymetrix Technical Manual, Affymetrix, Inc., USA). Labeled cDNA was hybridized to E. coli Genome 2 Array (Affymetrix, Inc.). Independent array hybridizations were carried out for 3 biological replicates (independent cultures) of each condition.   A number of genes in the SoxRS and OxyR oxidative stress regulons were up-regulated by high osmolarity, high temperature, and/or by the combination of both stresses. This result could account for cross-protection of osmotic stress against oxidative stress.  The trehalose biosynthetic genes were induced by both stresses, in accord with the proposed protective role of this disaccharide against thermal and oxidative damage.
