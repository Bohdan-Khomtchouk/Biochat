TITLE
Widespread Use of Non-Productive Alternative Splice Sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741

SUMMARY
Using RNA-Seq analysis of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) mutant strains, we show that many Saccharomyces cerevisiae intron-containing genes exhibit usage of alternative splice sites, but most transcripts generated by splicing from these sites are non-functional because they introduce premature termination codons leading to transcript degradation by NMD. Analysis of splicing mutants combined with NMD inactivation revealed the role of specific splicing factors in governing the use of these alternative splice sites and identified novel functions for Prp17p in enhancing the use of branchpoint-proximal upstream 3’ splice sites and for Prp18p in suppressing the usage of a non-canonical AUG 3’-splice site. The use of non-productive alternative splice sites can limit the expression of some transcripts and can be increased in stress conditions in a promoter-dependent manner, contributing to the down-regulation of genes during stress. These results reveal that alternative splicing is frequent in S.cerevisiae but masked by RNA degradation and that the use of alternative splice sites is mostly aimed at controlling transcript levels rather than increasing proteome diversity.
