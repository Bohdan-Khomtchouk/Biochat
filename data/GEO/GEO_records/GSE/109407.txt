TITLE
Expression data from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) mdmxER-Cre;C463A/WT cells, with or without 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) treatment.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MDMX C463A mutation disrupts its binding with MDM2, and leads insufficient of MDM2 E3 ligase activity. With that, p53 degradation would be slower. In this case, p53 remaining its tumor suppressor function without transactivation. To figure out the whole map of transcripts change in MDMX C463A mutation MEFs. We used mdmxER-Cre;C463A/WTMEFs with EtOH treatment as control group, and same cells with 4OHT treatment as experimental group for gene chip analysis.

DESIGN
Duplicates of each group were cultured until log phase and subjected to RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (QIAGEN). Purified RNA were send to Danar-Faber core for gene-chip analysis with MTA 1.0 chip (Affymetrix).

PLATFORM
GPL20258 [MTA-1_0] Affymetrix Mouse Transcriptome Array 1.0 [transcript (gene) CDF version]
