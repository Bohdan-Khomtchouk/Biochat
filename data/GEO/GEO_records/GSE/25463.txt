TITLE
Spore formation of Lentinula edodes (LongSAGE)

ORGANISM
Lentinula edodes

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles before and after spore formation of Lentinula edodes (L54) grown at sawdust.

DESIGN
SAGE were used to generate tags from RNA of fruit bodies of L. edodes. RNA were extracted from the fruit bodies before and after spore observed. Gene expression profiles of both stages were compared to screen out genes may relate to spore formation. To facilitate comparison of LongSAGE and SAGE data in GEO, LongSAGE tags (15bp) were trimmed to become 10bp and uploaded in previous submission (GSM87320, GSM87321). The current submission are actual LongSAGE experimental data without any extrapolation from SAGE data.
