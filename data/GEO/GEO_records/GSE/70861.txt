SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis rossette leaves comparing WT Col-0 with a transgenic lines overexpressing AhNF-YC gene from Amaranthus hypochondriacus in three different conditions.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment WT vs AhNF-YC OE plant leaves. The analyzed conditions were: normal growth conditions, water stress for 5 days and 24 hrs of recovery after normal watering was reestablished to 8-day water stressed plants.
