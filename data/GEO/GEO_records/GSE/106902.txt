TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of genomic DNA isolated from urine in Diabetic Chronic-Kidney Disease: a pilot study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of urine and blood samples from patients with diabetic chronic kidney disease. The Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip kit was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 850,000 CpGs. Samples included two urine and four buffy coat samples from adults with diabetic chronic kidney disease.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the six samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip

PLATFORM
GPL23976 Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation850 BeadChip
