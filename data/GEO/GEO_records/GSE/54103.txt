TITLE
Single-molecule Dynamics of Enhanceosome Assembly In Embryonic Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These ChIP-exo data were used to validate the predictions from our live-cell single-molecule imaging experiment

DESIGN
The ChIP-exo mapping of ultra-fine localization of endogenous Sox2, halo-Sox2, and two halo-Sox2 mutants (halo-Sox2M and halo-Sox2D) in embryonic stem cells.

PLATFORM
