TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of gene expression after exposure to hot and cold stress in WT cells of Thermosynechococcus elongatus, BP-1

ORGANISM
Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1

SUMMARY
To investigate the temperature response in Thermosynechococcus elongatus (BP-1) and look for coordinated control in the cell, transcriptomes of BP-1 were measured using RNAseq following exposure to low and high temperature stress. The amount of temperature increase (53 to 61 °C) and decrease (53 to 45 °C) was based on the allowable range of continuous growth.  The cells were growth in three separate culture tubes under LED light in a temperature-controlled submersible chamber under batch growth conditions.  The temperature shift was conducted once the cells reached their target concentration of 1.5E7 cells/ml.  A control experiment was conducted, in which the temperature remained at 53 °C, ensuring that the cellular physiology and light attenuation were comparable and that the only difference between the hot and cold treatments relative to the control treatment was temperature.

DESIGN
Heat stress 61°C and cold stress 45°C samples taken at time 0, 0.5hr, 3hr, 10hr, and 24hr.  A control experiment, in which the temperature remained at 53 °C samples taken at time 3hr, 10hr, and 24hr. Each sample timepoint consisted of three biological replicates.
