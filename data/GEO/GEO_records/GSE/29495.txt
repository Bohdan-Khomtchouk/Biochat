TITLE
Murine Kidney cells: Control versus Ischemia reperfusion injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling of kidney tissue from C57BL/6 mice that received a 30 minute ischemic injury compared with control kidney tissue from mice that received sham operation only.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment -  sham and ishemic injury (IRI).  Eight time points were measured using pooled samples from three mice.

PLATFORM
GPL13642 LC_MRA-1002_miRMouse_10.1_071219 (miRNA ID version)
