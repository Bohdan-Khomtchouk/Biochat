TITLE
Catma1-bou-bou mutant characterisation: Autotrophic growth acquisition in the ABOUTDESOUFFLE (bou) mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs07-09_bou - catma1-bou - Autotrophic growth acquisition is abolished in the bou mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana. BOU encodes a putative mitochondrial acyl carnitine carrier. bou mutant is blocked at the cotyledon stage. Autotrophic growth of the bou mutant can be achieved with addition of sugar in the medium or in darkness. Moreover, BOU gene expression is activated by light and depends on plant developmental stage. We wish to determine what are the consequences of bou gene mutation at the transcriptome level. We wish to understand whether bou growth arrest is due to the modification of specific genes expression or to a general effect on metabolism at the transition from heterotrophic to autotrophic growth.  - Seeds from a heterozygous plants were grown for either 5 or 8 days after germination on synthetic medium (MS/2) without sugar under continuous light. We harvested cotyledon-stage blocked plants (bou phenotype) from three independent Petri dishes and also green seedlings with true leaves and fully developed root (heterozygotes with a wild-type phenotype) . We also grew independently Col-O plants for 5 and 8 days to compare them with the bou mutants. Keywords: gene knock in (transgenic),normal vs disease comparison,time course
