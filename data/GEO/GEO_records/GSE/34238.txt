TITLE
C2C12 murine myoblast cell line and 48 h 10  uM BIO treated C2C12 cellulate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In urodele amphibians, limb regeneration involves the dedifferentiation of muscle myotubes into single cells that may acquire pluripotent potential. We have employed small molecules (myoseverin and BIO) to attempt to reproduce this behavior in mammalian muscle culture. C2C12 myotubes derived from the C2C12 myoblast cell line were induced to undergo cellularization by myoseverin treatment, which destabilizes tubulin filaments. The GSK-3 inhibitor, BIO, was then used to induce dedifferentiation. Induce neuron formation; the cells were incubated with 250 nM reversine for 48 h, and neural induction media (DMEM/F12 supplemented with N2 (Invitrogen)) and 1.5  uM all-trans retinoic acid for 7 days. C2C12 murine myoblast cell line and 48 h 10  uM BIO treated C2C12 cellulate (derived by 20 M myoseverin treatment for 48 h)

DESIGN
C2C12 myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes with 2%horse serum in DMEM for 8 days (from 2-4 d, 10 uM AraC treatment was also used to kill any remaining myoblasts). Next, myotubes were cellularized by 20  uM myoseverin treatment for 48 h. 24 h after myoseverin treatment, myotubes were treated with 10  uM BIO for 2d.
