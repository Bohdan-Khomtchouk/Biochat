TITLE
Genome wide study of microglia in Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) and Germ-free (GF) mice at different stages in males and females.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ATACseq was performed on microglia from male and female, SPF or GF mice to elucidate the chromatin accessibility implicated by microbiota and gender. Differential accessible regions (DARs) between the various groups gave some ideas on what different pathways or functions might be affected due to the different factors.

DESIGN
Microglia from SPF and GF mice from embryonic and adult stages of both gender were sorted for sequencing. DARs were obtained to observe if any signicant genes were affected.

PLATFORM
