TITLE
CTCF regulates positioning of the human cystic fibrosis gene in association with a histone deacetylase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin a (TSA) changes the radial positioning of the CFTR gene in HeLa S3 cells. The gene relocates from the nuclear periphery to the nuclear interior. In Calu-3 cells the gene is located in the nuclear interior. To identifiy potential regulatory elements for the positioning of CFTR, the histone h3 and h4 acetylation patterns of untreated and TSA-treated HeLa S3 and untreated Calu-3 cells were determined by ChIP-chip. A CTCF site close to the CFTR promoter displayed consistent histone H3 hyperacetylation in TSA treated HeLa S3 cells and Calu-3 cells.

DESIGN
Four Agilent 4x 44K DNA-chips (DNA-Chips: REP_1 - REP_4). HeLa untreated and TSA treated: H3ac/H3pan (Cy5/Cy3): hybridized together on four sectors - 1x regular 3x dye swap; H4ac: 3 sectors, respective H3pan reference on different sectors on the same DNA-chips (labeled with the identical fluorophore). Calu-3: H3ac/h3pan: one sector each on the same DNA-chip (labeled with the identical fluorophore) H4ac/H3pan: two sectors each on the same DNA-chips (two each on two DNA-Chips, labeled with the identical fluorophore)
