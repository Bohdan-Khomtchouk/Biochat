TITLE
Profiles for long noncoding RNAs in ovarian granulosa cells from polycystic ovary syndrome patients with different serum concentrations of androgen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive system disease, with hyperandrogenism as the core feature. The pathologies remain to be illustrated.  Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been proved to be involved in various biological processes of human diseases. However, there were few reports about the research on lncRNAs in PCOS, not to mention hyperandrogenism.

DESIGN
microarray screening of lncRNAs and mRNAs was performed in PCOS patients with hyperandrogenism (PCOS-T) and PCOS patients with normal testosterone level (PCOS-N) and control subjects

PLATFORM
GPL21096 Agilent-062918 Human lncRNA array V4.0 (Probe name version)
