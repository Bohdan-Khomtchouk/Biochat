TITLE
TRIM28 silences endogenous retroviruses in neural progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we show that in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) TRIM28 silences transcription of two groups of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs): IAP1 and MMERVK10C. Derepression of ERVs in Trim28-deficient NPCs was associated with a loss of H3K9me3 and resulted in transcriptional upregulation and reverse transcription. These findings demonstrate a unique dynamic transcriptional regulation of ERVs in NPCs.
