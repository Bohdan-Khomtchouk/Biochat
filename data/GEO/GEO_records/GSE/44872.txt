TITLE
Analysis of direct target genes regulated by AS1 and AS2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of tiling array data identified 358 genomic regions commonly enriched by the AS1 and T7 antibody datasets.

DESIGN
AS1 antibody data set (AS1 antibody versus mock) and the T7 antibody data set (T7 antibody versus mock)
