TITLE
Recurrent TRIO fusion in non-translocation-related sarcomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used NGS on a cohort of complex genetics sarcomas to study their transcriptomes (RNA-seq technology), looking for recurrent and specific gene fusions. We identified multiple TRIO fusions with different partners in our cohort. No TRIO fusions were reported in negative-control cells (normal tissues) and in simple genetics sarcomas.

DESIGN
We performed RNA-seq on 117 various sarcomas. Samples include ERCC Spike-ins. 6 samples contains TRIO fusions.
