TITLE
Exogenous isoprene modulates gene expression in unstressed Arabidopsis thaliana plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Isoprene is a well-studied volatile hemiterpene that protects plants from abiotic stress through mechanisms that are not fully understood. The antioxidant and membrane stabilizing potential of isoprene are the two most commonly invoked mechanisms. However, isoprene also affects phenylpropanoid metabolism, suggesting an additional role as a signaling molecule. In this study, microarray based gene expression profiling reveals widespread transcriptional reprogramming of Arabidopsis thaliana plants fumigated for 24 hrs with a physiologically relevant concentration of isoprene. Functional enrichment analysis of fumigated plants revealed enhanced heat- and light-stress-responsive processes in response to isoprene. Isoprene induced a network enriched in ERF and WRKY transcription factors, which may play a role in stress tolerance. The isoprene-induced upregulation of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes was specifically confirmed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These results support a role for isoprene as a signaling molecule, in addition to its possible roles as an antioxidant and membrane thermoprotectant.

DESIGN
Plants were held at 23 °C for 24 hours and then held at 40 °C for 24 hours, either in the presence or absence of 20 PPM isoprene during the entire 48 hours. Leaf samples were taken at the end of both 24 hour treatment periods. Each of the 4 resulting conditions was replicated 3 times.
