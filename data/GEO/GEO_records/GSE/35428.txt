TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of clinically relevant SERMs and SERM/estradiol complexes in a cellular model of breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we have utilized microarray analysis to directly compare a subset of structurally distinct, clinically relevant SERMs in the presence and absence of estradiol, using a high replicate number (10) to ensure detection of modestly regulated genes. Tested compounds included 4-hydroxytamoxifen, ICI-182,780, Raloxifene, Bazedoxifene and Lasofoxifene.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were treates with indicated SERMs in the presence of E2 or vehicle; RNA was isolated and used for preparation of label for 3' expression analysis.
