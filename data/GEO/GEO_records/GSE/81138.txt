TITLE
miRNA profiling of mature C2C12 myotubes using modified (COS) vs standard (STD) tissue culture conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling comparing modified (COS = Cytokine (low dose), Oxygen (physiological), Stimulation (low frequency electrical)) or standard (STD) culture condtions for 72hrs prior to harvest at day 8 post differentiation.  Secondary experiment to assess additional impact of dexamethasone when given in COS conditions. 5 arrays were labeled with same RNA in each channel (self-self hybridisations) to establish parameters for detecting real change for each probe on the arrays.
