TITLE
MicroRNA expression profile in GlycophorinA positive cells of severe and intermedia Eb thalassemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate whether the microRNA expression profile changes with modulation of severity, GlycophorinA positive cells were isolated by immunomagnetic procedure from peripheral blood of two Eb thalassemia patients with same b globin gene mutation but differing in transfusion requirment. MicroRNA expression profile of the two samples were monitored.
