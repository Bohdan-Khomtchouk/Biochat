TITLE
caArray_green-00001: Alterations in Gene Expression Profiles during Prostate Cancer Progression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify molecular changes that occur during prostate tumor progression, we have characterized a series of prostate cancer cell lines isolated at different stages of tumorigenesis from C3(1)/Tag transgenic mice.
