TITLE
Expression Quantitative Trait Locus Mapping Studies in Mid-Secretory Phase Endometrial Cells Identifies HLA-F and TAP2 as Fecundability-Associated Genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed an unbiased genome-wide expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping study to identify common regulatory (expression) single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs) in mid-secretory endometrium.

DESIGN
53 women underwent endometrial biopsies as part of their clinical evaluation for recurrent pregnancy loss, after obtaining informed consent. These women were between the ages of 26 and 43 years and had at least two previous pregnancy losses before10 weeks gestation.
