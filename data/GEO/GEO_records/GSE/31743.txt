TITLE
Comparison of Flk-1+/Etv2- vs Flk-1+/Etv2+ populations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Screening for genes up in Etv2+ cells within Flk-1+ ES derived mesoderm Microarray analysis performed to screen for the candidate genes regulated by Etv2. Differentiated Flk-1+ mesoderm can be devided into Etv2+ or-. Etv2+ cells are assumed to be committed to hemato/endothelial cells. Comparison of two populations can reveal genes relevant in this commitment.

DESIGN
Extract RNA from sorted  Flk-1+/Etv2- vs Flk-1+/Etv2+ populations.Etv2-Venus KI ES cells were differentiated on OP9 for 4-5 days and Flk-1+ population was separated into Etv2-Venus+ or- cells. Total RNA was purified from each population for analysis.
