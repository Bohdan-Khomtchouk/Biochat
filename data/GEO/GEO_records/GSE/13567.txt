TITLE
US28-expressing and mock-transfected stable NIH-3T3 cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes the chemokine receptor US28 that exhibits constitutive activity. NIH-3T3 cells stably transfected with US28 present a pro-angiogenic and transformed phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. We used gene expression profiling to determine how US28 constitutive activity modulates expression of genes compared to mock-transfected cells. Keywords: Comparison of stably transfected cell lines

DESIGN
We isolated RNA from two different clonal stable cell lines of NIH-3T3 cells transfected either either mock or US28-WT and analysed these 4 RNA samples using Affymetrix mouse genome arrays.
