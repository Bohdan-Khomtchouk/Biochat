TITLE
Expression data from naive and memory CD8 T cells cultured in presence or absence of IL-4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Effects of IL-4 on CD8 T cells functions are largely unknown. IL-4 induces survival and proliferation of CD8 T cells, but several studies suggest that IL-4 could also affect several functions of CD8 T cells such as cytotoxicity. Our team has shown that IL-4 repress the expression of Ccl5 in vitro. To define more precisely the impact of IL-4 on CD8 T cells, we performed a whole genome expression microarray analysis of naive and memory CD8 T cells cultured in presence or absence of IL-4. This approach allowed us to define the IL4-gene-expression signature on CD8 T cells.

DESIGN
18 samples were processed. Two populations of F5 naive CD8 T cells were FACS-sorted: samples from each population were incubated 20 hours with IL-7 in presence or absence of IL-4. Thus, a total of 6 “Naive” samples were processed. In addition, 4 populations of F5 TIM memory CD8 T cells were FACS-sorted: samples from 2 of these populations were incubated 20 hours in presence of IL-7 and/or IL-4, or in medium alone. Thus, 12 “Memory” samples were processed.
