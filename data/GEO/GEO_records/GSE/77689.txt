TITLE
Impact of Arylsulfatase B (ARSB) on gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Arylsulfatase B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase) null mouse hepatic gene expression was compared with control C57BL/6J mice To determine if there were differences in gene expression between ARSB null mice and matched control mice.  ARSB is the enzyme that removes 4-sulfate groups from chondroitin 4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate and thereby regulates their degradation.

DESIGN
comparison between ARSB-null mice on C57BL/6J background and control C57BL/6J mice matched for age and gender

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
