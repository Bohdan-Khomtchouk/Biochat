TITLE
Expression data from CD8 memory T cells after IN immunization compared to IM immunization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Intranasal (IN) immunization induces different genotype expression in CD8 memory T cells compared to the CD8 memory T cells induced by intramuscular (IM) immunization. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying the differential induction after IN or IM immunization.

DESIGN
CD8-specific memory T cells were sorted after IN or IM immunization with STxB-E7 vaccine with the following immunization protocol: Prime with STxB-E7 + aGalCer at D0, and boost with STxB-E7 at D21. The cells were collected and sorted 7 days after the boost.
