TITLE
Expression data from wild and ind-6 mutant Arabidopsis silique  during three development stages of  fruit dehiscence

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Fruit dehiscence is an essential developmental process of some economic crops that impacts dramatically on crop yields and involves altered regulation of thousands of genes, ind-6 gene is a transcription factor play important role during fruit dehiscence. Gene expression were examined in wild-type and ind-6 mutants at three development stages of fruit dehiscence to explore the molecular mechanism of ind-6 in fruit dehiscence. We used microarrays to examine changes in gene expression during fruit dehiscence  and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes in wild-type and ind-6 mutant genotypes.

DESIGN
Two Arabidopsis genotypes (wild-type and ind-6 mutant) were grown in a growth room with a 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle at 22Â°C. Silique for stage 11(dehiscence zone did not start differentiate), stage 15 (fruit dehiscence zone started asymmetric cell division), stage 17( dehiscence zone just completed the differentiation)  were used for microarray experiments. Three biological replicates for Arabidopsis silique in each stage and genotypes were prepared. Total RNA was isolated by RNAiso for Polysaccharide-rich Plant Tissue (TAKARA) and purified using a QiagenRNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands), then hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
