TITLE
Gene coexpression network and community detection analyses of CA3 trascriptome reveal distinct pathogenic and compensatory pathways in early and late onset febrile forms of temporal lobe epilepsy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prolonged febrile seizures history (FH) in early childhood is associated with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (RTLE). FH-RTLE patients may have early (E, before 4 YOA) or late (L, mid-adolescence, early adult life) disease onset.  In order to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying E and L forms we compared  differentially expressed (DE) and complete (CO) transcriptional networks from hippocampal CA3 explants obtained from E and L patients.

DESIGN
CA3 transcriptomic profiles of early and late onset febrile forms of temporal lobe epilepsy were compared in order to identify differentially expressed transcripts.
