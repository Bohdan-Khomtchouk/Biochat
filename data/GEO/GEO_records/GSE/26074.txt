TITLE
Expression data of distinct organs in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We applied the tiling arrays to study the Arabidopsis whole-genome transcriptome in leaf, root, stem, flower, early silique, middle silique and late silique.

DESIGN
To obtain approximately 3-week-old leaf and root, plants were grown on a 0.5% gelangum (Wako) containing 0.5% sucrose and 1/2 MS at 22℃ under the continuous light condition. In case of sampling for other tissues (stem, flower, early silique, middle silique, and late silique), plants were grown on soil in pots at 22℃ under 16-h light/8-h dark cycle. Three replicative hybridization experiments for each strand array were carried out using the independent biological RNA samples.
