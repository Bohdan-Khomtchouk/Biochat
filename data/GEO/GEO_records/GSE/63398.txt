TITLE
Ets homologous factor regulates pathways controlling response to injury in Calu-3 airway epithelial cells [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ets homologous factor (EHF) is an Ets family transcription factor expressed in many epithelial cell types including those lining the respiratory system. Disruption of the airway epithelium is central to many lung diseases, and a network of transcription factors coordinates its normal function. EHF can act as a transcriptional activator or a repressor, though its targets in lung epithelial cells are largely uncharacterized. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq), showed that the majority of EHF binding sites in lung epithelial cells are intergenic or intronic and coincide with putative enhancers, marked by specific histone modifications. EHF occupies many genomic sites that are close to genes involved in intercellular and cell-matrix adhesion.

DESIGN
Examination of EHF binding plus two histone modifications in Calu-3 cells. There are two replicates of the EHF ChIP-seq plus an input sample (control). There is one replicate each of the two histone modifications, plus a second input sample (control).
