TITLE
Pseudomonas putida KT2440 cells: control vs. 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA)

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida KT2440

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiling of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 comparing cells exposed for 1 hour to DIMBOA from maize (Zea mays) to unexposed cells

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, unexposed vs. exposed, three biological replicates independantly grown and harvested. A dye swap was performed on each biological replicate for a total of six hybridizations. Each GEO Sample represents the data after merging of the technical (dye swap) replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL15347 Progenika P putida KT2440 oligo array (probe-level)
