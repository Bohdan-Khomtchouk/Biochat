TITLE
Whole heart transcriptional response to complete and epiblast-specfic deletion of Zic3 in 15.5 dpc mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to better understand the molecular basis for the heart defects seen in Zic3 null and epiblast CKO embryos, we investigated whether complete or epiblast-specific deletion of Zic3 would impact later embryonic heart development at the transcriptional level by whole genome expression microarray.

DESIGN
The whole heart was carefully dissected out from 15.5 dpc Zic3 +/y, Zic3 flox/y, Zic3 flox/y; Sox2-cre, and Zic3 -/y embryos, total RNAs were extracted and purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Spectrophotometry (NanoDrop-1000 Spectrophotometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and microfluidic electrophoresis (Experion Automated Electrophoresis System, Bio-Rad Laboratories) were used for RNA quality control. In vitro transcription was performed using Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion). cRNAs were hybridized onto Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChips (Illumina) per manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
