TITLE
Gene expression profiles of yeast treated with YCl3 and Y2O3 nanoparticle

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study, we attempted to compare among the stress of Y2O3 nanoparticle and YCl3 to yeast cells. Yttrium oxide (Y2O3) nanoparticle is used in widespread applications. It has been reported that Y2O3 nanoparticle showed toxic activities. However, we assumed that the most important toxic factor of nanoparticles was metal ion release. We tried to prove the toxicity of yttrium nanoparticles comes from yttrium ion. Therefore, we used YCl3 as a positive control for evaluation of effects of yttrium ion.

DESIGN
Series contains four hybridization results from independent biological samples respectively in five conditions (Control; performed sep9 2014, Control; performed nov9 2015, treated YCl3 5 mg, treated Y2O3 nanoparticle 3 mg , treated Y2O3 nanoparticle 20 mg).

PLATFORM
GPL16244 Agilent-016322 Yeast (V2) Gene Expression 8x15K Microarray (Probe Name version)
