DNA methylation modifications associated with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

SUMMARY
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, is a complex multifactorial disease that is characterized by the persistent presence of fatigue and other particular symptoms for a minimum of 6 months. Symptoms fail to dissipate after sufficient rest and have major effects on the daily functioning of CFS sufferers. CFS is a multi-system disease with a heterogeneous patient population showing a wide variety of functional disabilities and its biological basis remains poorly understood. Stable alterations in gene function in the immune system have been reported in several studies of CFS. Epigenetic modifications have been implicated in long-term effects on gene function, however, to our knowledge, genome-wide epigenetic modifications associated with CFS have not been explored. We examined the DNA methylome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from CFS patients and healthy controls using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array, controlling for invariant probes and probes overlapping polymorphic sequences.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from 24 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples (12 CFS, 12 controls) were bisulfite-converted and hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. GenomeStudio files were generated and the data was analyzed using the Illumina Methylation Analyzer R package.
