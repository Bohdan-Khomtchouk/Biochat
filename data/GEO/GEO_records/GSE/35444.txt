TITLE
Analysis of tumor cell RNA (glioma and melanoma) and their corresponding microvesicles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary glioblastoma cells and primary malignant melanoma cells were grown in vitro (less than 15 passages). Exosomes/microvesicles were isolated from the media supernatant at the same time as RNA was extracted from the cells. The goal of the study was to compare the gene expression profiles in exosomes/microvesicles compared to the cells that release them.

DESIGN
Analysis of tumor cell RNA (glioma and melanoma) and their corresponding microvesicles.
