TITLE
Gene expression profile of liver from adult and neonatal Balb/c mice after listeriosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling by microarray was used with a murine listeriosis model to better understand increased susceptibility of preterm neonates to infection. We used DNA microarray to identify genes that were differentially expressed in liver of adult and neonatal Balb/c mice after listeriosis infection.

DESIGN
A murine listeriosis model was established. The methods for culturing and counting the Listeria monocytogenes (strain CNL 85/163) had been described in previous publications. The Listeria was injected intraperitoneally using a 1-mL U-100 insulin syringe with a 30 gauge needle. Doses of Listeria monocytogenes used were based on work by our laboratory showing that similar bacterial colony counts were obtained with 4.2 x 10^5 total Listeria per adult mouse and 150 Listeria per gram for 3 to 5 day old neonatal mice. In neonatal mice, great care was taken to void deep intraperitoneal injection towards the viscera, or across the central abdominal vessels. At specified time points, liver was removed upon animal sacrifice and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 degrees Centigrade. Three adult mice and three neonatal mice were used at each time point.
