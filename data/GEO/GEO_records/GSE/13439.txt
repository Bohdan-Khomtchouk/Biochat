ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated chromosomal imbalances in samples from patients with androgen insensitive prostate cancer.

DESIGN
4 archival FFPE tumor samples were analyzed with Affymetrix 250K Nsp SNP microarrays and virtual-karyotype results for PTEN region were compared to PTEN deletion analysis by FISH.
