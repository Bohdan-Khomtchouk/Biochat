TITLE
Converting adult pancreatic α-cells into β-cells by targeting Dnmt1 and Arx

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
After their destruction in adult mice, insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells slowly regenerate from other islet cells, like glucagon-producing alpha-cells. However the molecular basis of this conversion is unknown. Moreover it remains unclear if this intra-islet cell conversion is relevant to human diseases with extensive beta-cell loss, like in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Here, we show that subsets of glucagon-expressing cells in subjects with T1D produce Insulin and other molecular features of beta-cells, accompanied by loss of the alpha-cell regulators DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) and Aristaless-related homeobox (Arx). We generated mice permitting lineage tracing and inactivation of Dnmt1 and Arx in adult alpha-cells. Within 3 months of Dnmt1 and Arx loss, 50% of alpha-cells converted into cells producing insulin protein but not glucagon, changes not observed in alpha-cells after only Arx or Dnmt1 loss. Single cell isolation and high-throughput RNA sequencing revealed efficient and extensive alpha-cell conversion into progeny indistinguishable by global gene expression from native beta-cells. Our work reveals pathways regulated by Arx and Dnmt1 sufficient for achieving targeted generation of beta-cells from adult pancreatic alpha-cells.
