TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of pluripotent cell lines and corresponding starting donor source cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of induced pluripotent stem cell lines and their corresponding source cells

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from H9 hESC (P51), non-integrated episomal CB-iPSC clones 6.2, 6.11, 6.13, (P14), 19.11, (P11), nonviral KER-iPSC clones KA.1, KA.3 (P13) nonviral FFB-iPSC: F.1, F.6 (P14) and viral fibroblast iPSC clones IMR1 (P66), IMR4 (P64). A single sample of each condition was used for this analysis.
