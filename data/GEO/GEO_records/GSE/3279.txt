TITLE
Gain-of-function mutants of SOC1 vs soc1-2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To find downstream target of SOC1, we attemted global expression profiles in gain-of-function mutants of SOC1 To find downstream target of SOC1, we attemted global expression profiles in soc1-101D: Expt. 1 GSM73643, GSM73646 Expt. 2 GSM73647, GSM73648 Expt. 3 GSM73649, GSM73650 To find downstream target of SOC1, we attemted global expression profiles in soc1-2: GSM73649, GSM73651 To find downstream target of SOC1, we attemted global expression profiles in gain-of-function mutants of SOC1: GSM73643, GSM73646, GSM73647, GSM73648, GSM73649, GSM73650 Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
To more completely identify the downstream targets of SOC1, we attemted to compare the expression profiles of g-o-f mutant of SOC1 with the results of soc1-2 mutant
