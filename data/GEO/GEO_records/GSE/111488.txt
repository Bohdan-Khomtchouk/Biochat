TITLE
Effects of a mixture of amino acids and other small molecules on the gene expression profile of HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hela cells were treated with a mixture of amino acids and other small molecules, called active mixture for various time periods. The aim was to identify the differentially expressed genes that are upregulated or downregulated upon treatment at different time points.

DESIGN
Hela cells were treated with the active mixture for various time periods (3h, 6h, 24h). Total RNA was isolated and global gene expression profiling was performed using Illuminaâ€™s HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip Array. Gene expression of treated samples was compared to untreated control samples.12 samples were analysed, 3 replicates in 4 sample groups. Sample groups: control (no treatment), 3 hours of treatment, 6 hours of treatment, 24 hours of treatment.
