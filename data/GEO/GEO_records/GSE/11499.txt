TITLE
Expression data from Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) human peripheral blood samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray analysis of peripheral blood samples can contribute to the determination of distant blood markers of local pathophysiological alterations in colorectal diseases. These markers can lead to alternative screening procedures.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of patients with Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and hybridized on Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
