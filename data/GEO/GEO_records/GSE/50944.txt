TITLE
NCoR Repression of LXRs Restricts Macrophage Biosynthesis of Insulin-Sensitizing Omega 3 Fatty Acids

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophage-mediated inflammation is a major contributor to obesity-associated insulin resistance. The corepressor NCoR interacts with inflammatory pathway genes in macrophages, suggesting that its removal would result in increased activity of inflammatory responses. Surprisingly, we find that macrophage-specific deletion of NCoR instead results in an anti-inflammatory phenotype along with robust systemic insulin sensitization in obese mice. We present evidence that de-repression of LXRs contributes to this paradoxical anti-inflammatory phenotype by causing increased expression of genes that direct biosynthesis of palmitoleic acid and ω3 fatty acids. Remarkably, the increased ω3 fatty acid levels primarily inhibit NF-κB-dependent inflammatory responses by uncoupling NF-κB binding and enhancer/promoter histone acetylation from subsequent steps required for pro-inflammatory gene activation. This provides a mechanism for the in vivo anti-inflammatory insulin sensitive phenotype observed in mice with macrophage-specific deletion of NCoR. Therapeutic methods to harness this mechanism could lead to a new approach to insulin sensitizing therapies.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq and Gro-Seq profiling was performed in thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages treated as indicated.
