TITLE
Gene differential expressions between cell subpopulations with high invasiveness (invaded) and low invasiveness (non-invaded) in human lung cancer H460 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell populations with different invasiveness were isolated and collected with cell culture inserts of Boyden-type cell invasion chambers coated with 1xBME (base membrane extract). Cells that invaded to bottom chamber were collected  as cell population with high-invasiveness , and cells that remained in the insert chamber were collected as cell population with low-invasiveness. The selection with Boyden-type cell invasion chambers was repeated six times, and cells with high invasiveness were terms as H-INV subline, and cells with low invasiveness were termed as L-INV subline. Microarray analysis was performed with Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips

DESIGN
The transcriptional profile of invaded cell subpopulations  (H-INV, n=3) was compared to non-invaded cell subpopulations (L-INV, n=3), 968 genes were found to be differentially expressed compared with fold changes more than 2 and FDR < 0.05.
