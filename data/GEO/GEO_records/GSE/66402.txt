TITLE
Gene expression profiling of perinatal or adult medullary thymic epithelial cells (MECs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A comparative analysis of gene expression of perinate or adult Aire-GFP+ and GFP- MECs in WT or Aire-KO thymus

DESIGN
Aire+ and Aire- MECs were sorted from adults (5 weeks old) or perinates (0-3 days old) of Aire-driven Igrp-GFP (Adig) mice in Aire-WT and -KO background. RNA from whole samples was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
