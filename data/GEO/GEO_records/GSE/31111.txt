TITLE
Soybean fast neutron genotyping: 700k Reverse genetics

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
CGH was used to compare induced structural variation among soybean fast neutron lines, developed in background M92-220.

DESIGN
11 different soybean fast neutron lines were hybridized against the parental reference genotype M92-220. The soybean tiling array consists of 700k probes, spaced at approximately 1.1 kb intervals.
