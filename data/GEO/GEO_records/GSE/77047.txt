TITLE
Untimely expression of gametogenic genes in vegetative cells causes uniparental disomy (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We report gene expression profiling in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We performed high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated from wild-type, ago1d, mmi1d and dcr1d strains.

DESIGN
RNA expression profiles of Schizosacccharomyces pombe strains containing deletions were compared to the wild type to generate differences in gene expression.
