TITLE
Global variation of copy number in the human genome_EA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identify and categorize copy number variation in normal populations Keywords: Copy number variation detection

DESIGN
270 Hapmap samples were hybridized to 500K EA mapping arrays (Nsp and Sty) to identifying variable copy number regions in the genome.  10 Hapmap samples were hybridized to 500K EA mapping arrays in triplicate to determine reproducibility (technical replicates).  NA15510 and NA10851 were hybridized to 500K EA mapping arrays in triplicate for parameter-tuning and validation of algorithm.
