TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of planktonic, initial pellicle, and mature pellicle of Pseudoalteromonas sp. SCSIO 11900

ORGANISM
Pseudoalteromonas sp. SCSIO_11900

SUMMARY
One of the most distinct features of Pseudoalteromonas sp. SCSIO 11900 is its ability to form a very robust pellicle than most Pseudoalteromonas strains. Thus we want to identify the genes essential for the pellicle formation of SCSIO 11900. We compared transcriptom profiles of planktonic cells, initial pellicle and mature pellicle of coral Pseudoalteromonas sp. SCSIO 11900 and revealed that some unique genes from horizontal gene transfer is involved in the pellicle formation of SCSIO 11900.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of  planktonic cells, initial pellicle cells and mature pellicle cells Pseudoalteromonas sp. SCSIO 11900 were generated by Illumina Hiseq2000.

PLATFORM
