TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling in a Fusarium graminearum lacking FgVelB, a velvet complex gene

ORGANISM
Fusarium graminearum

SUMMARY
Using a 3'-tiling microarray covering the whole F. graminearum genes, we carried out genome-wide expression analyses of both a wild type and a FgVelB deletion strainn of F. graminearum  at a sexual stage (3 days after perithecial induction on carrot agar) Our study is the first report elucidating regulatory pathways controlled by FgVelB in Fusarium graminearum.

DESIGN
A total of 4 chips were used for microarray. Total RNAs were extracted from perithecia and/or ground mycelia formed on carrot agar cultures of a self-fertile wild-type and a self-sterile FgVelB-deleted strain of F. graminearum with two biological replicates.
