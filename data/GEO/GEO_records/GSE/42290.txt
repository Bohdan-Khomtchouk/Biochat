TITLE
Expression data in an Arabidopsis cytokinin (CK)-signaling mutant, ahp2,3,5 and its wild type plant (Col-0) under drought and well-water (control) conditions.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the role of CK-signaling components, AHPs (His-containing phosphotransfer proteins) in drought stress response, we have employed transcriptional profiling of ahp2,3,5 and it's wild type plant, Col-0 under drought and well-water (control) conditions. Aligentâ€™s Whole Arabidopsis Gene Expression Microarray (G2519F-021169, V4, 4x44K) was used.

DESIGN
Two-week-old WT and ahp2,3,5 mutant plants were transferred from GM plates to soil and grown for an additional week. Three week-old plants were exposed to drought stress for 10 days or grown under well-watered condition in parallel. All rosette leaves of independent 31d-old plants were corrected. Total RNA was prepared and used for the microarray hybridization. Three replicative hybridization experiments were carried out for each independent biological sample.
