TITLE
Expression profiling in VCP-associated myopathy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is caused by mutations in the Valosin Containing Protein (VCP) gene on chromosome 9p12-13. To elucidate affected signaling transduction axes in IBMPFD, we determined expression profiles using microarray technology in quadriceps muscle from patients and unaffected relatives.

DESIGN
Muscle from 10 individuals  (7 affected, 3 unaffected first degree relatives) was obtained after informed consent for the muscle biopsy was obtained.
