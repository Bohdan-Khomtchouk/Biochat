TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of human fetal microglia during mid-trimester gestation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of human fetal microglia from the mid-trimester period was performed. DEGs were identified between early and late stages of the mid-trimester gestation. Genes expressed in the human fetal microglia were also compared with mouse microglia core signature.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from microglia from 14 weeks to 24 weeks gestation human fetuses' brain. Gene expression analysis was done to observe DEGs and differential pathway analysis between the early and late stage.
