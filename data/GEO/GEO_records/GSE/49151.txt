TITLE
Expression data from Klf4 KD cells in the presence and absence of TGFβ in NMuMG cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling after Klf4 KD during EMT in NMuMG reveals a significant number of genes that are transcriptionally deregulated

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling is performed in Klf4 ablated (siKlf4) NMuMG cells. Cells transfected with siControl is used as a control. The cells were either treated with TGFβ (2ng/ml) or not.
