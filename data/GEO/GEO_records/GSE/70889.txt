TITLE
Gene and  retrotransposon expression analysis for WT, Pld6 KO, and Dnmt3l KO male germ cells during spermatogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA sequencing analysis of P0 testes and FACS-purified leptotene/zygotene (L/Z) spermatocytes

DESIGN
Compare transcriptomes of WT, Pld6 KO, and Dnmt3l KO germ cells to study the effects of these mutations affecting piRNA biogenesis and DNA methylation, respectively.

PLATFORM
