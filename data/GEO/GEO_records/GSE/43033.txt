TITLE
Expression data from H295R cells where NRSF/REST or SF-1 were knocked down

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SF-1 is a nuclear receptor transcription factor playing a key role in adrenogonadal development and in adrenocortical tumorigenesis when overexpressed. NRSF/REST is a transcriptional repressor that represses expression of neuronal genes in non-neural tissues. Some data suggest that SF-1 and NRSF/REST can functionally interact in adrenocortical cancer cells. We studied gene expression profiles using Affymetrix microarrays in the H295R/TR SF-1 adrenocortical cancer cell line. In this cell line, SF-1 expression can be increased in a doxycycline-dependent manner (Mol. Endocrinol. 21: 2968â€“2987, 2007). The effects of a control siRNA and sRNAs specific for SF-1 and for NRSF/REST (in basal or increased SF-1 expression conditions) on gene expression were measured.

DESIGN
In H295R/TR SF-1 cells SF-1 and NRSF/REST (in conditions of basal and increased SF-1 dosage) expression were knocked down by Amaxa nucleofection. RNA was extracted and hybridized to Human Gene 1.0 ST Affymetrix microarrays.
