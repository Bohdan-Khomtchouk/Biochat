TITLE
Gene expression profiles of mouse glioblastoma tissues following anti-PD-1 and/or temozolomide treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to examine the ability of anti-PD-1 and/or temozolomide to reprogram transcriptional profiles. Samples were obtained from tumor mass formed by orthotopic implantation of GL261 cells.

DESIGN
GL261 cells (mouse glioblastoma cell line) were orthotopically implanted to male 8 wk old C57BL/6 mice, and anti-PD-1 antibody and/or temozlomide were administered. 16 days after injection, mice were sacrificed and their brains were removed.
