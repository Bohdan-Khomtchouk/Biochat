TITLE
Microarray analysis of genes activated by mouse CAR and human CAR in vivo.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This dataset is a four-ligand x three-genotype Affymetrix microarray analysis of the regulation of liver genes in the mouse by the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR).

DESIGN
24 female mice of mixed background (C57BL/6x129Sv) were divided into three groups:  wild-type (contains only mouse CAR; mCAR), CAR.KO = knockout mice (mice ablated for mCAR gene; mCAR -/-), and  CAR.AH= contains human CAR transgene under the control of the mouse albumin promoter in the mCAR -/- background.  Each of the three groups underwent four different treatment regimens:  CO = corn oil vehicle control, PB = phenobarbitol (100 mg/kg/day), an anti-convulsant agent which can translocate both mCAR and hCAR into the nucleus to turn on target gene expression, TC = TCPOBOP, a potent non-metabolized ligand of mCAR (3 mg/kg), CITCO = a hCAR specific ligand (30 mg/kg/day).  Two mice were used per treatment group and each mouse RNA was used for one chip.
