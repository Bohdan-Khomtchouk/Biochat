TITLE
Innate and antigen-specific cytotoxic cells and Paradoxical HIV-associated Tuberculosis Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tuberculosis Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (TB-IRIS) frequently complicates combined anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and anti-tubercular therapy in HIV-1 co-infected tuberculosis (TB) patients. The immunopathological mechanism underlying TB-IRIS is incompletely defined. Differential transcript abundance in PBMC from IRIS and control patients stimulated with heat killed H37Rv was determined by microarray

DESIGN
Blood samples were collected during longitudinal observational studies of TB-IRIS patients and controls (both groups HIV-infected patients placed on antiretroviral treatment). PBMC were stimulated with heat killed H37Rv and RNA extracted.
