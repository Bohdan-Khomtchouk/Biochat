TITLE
PcG/TrxG profiling of differentially aged adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The microarray reported here is part of a study aimed to investigate whether the gene expression profile of Polycomb, Trithorax and interacting molecules (collectively referred to PcG/TrxG genes) might be related to different states of differentiative potential. In particular , this microarray profiles the expression of PcG/TrxG genes in adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells isolated from the inguinal fat depot of mice of different age.

DESIGN
MSC have been isolated from the inguinal fat pad of FVB mice aged 1, 3, 6, 12 or 24 months.
