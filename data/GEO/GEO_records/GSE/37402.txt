TITLE
PGE2 promotes recovery from established Nephrotoxic Serum Nephritis in mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We induced acute nephritis by single injection of sheep nephrotoxic serum in mice and then treated the mice with prostaglandin E2. We used microarrays to examine the global  gene expressions during recovery from nephrotoxic nephritis by prostaglandin E2.

DESIGN
Acute nephristis was induced in female mice by single injection of sheep Nephortoxc Serum (NTS), followed by prostaglandin E2 administration daily starting from day 2 after NTS administration.  Mice were sacrificed on day 7 and RNAs were isolated from kidney.  The RNA samples were subjected to mouse gene 1.0 ST array analysis.
