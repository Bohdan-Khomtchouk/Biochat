TITLE
L. lactis MG1363 transcriptome analysis of 4 evolved strains

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris

SUMMARY
L. lactis MG1363 was evolved in 4 fermentors in glucose-containing chemically defined medium (CDMPC) for 309 generations at a dilution rate of 0.5h-1 Glycerol stocks made during the evolution experiment were revived in CDMPC and further characterized.

DESIGN
Glycerol stocks from generation 309 were revived in CDMPC and grown to mid-exponential phase.  Strains from each of the 4 fermentors were compared to the original strain (Generation 0).

PLATFORM
GPL20601 University of Groningen Lactococcus lactis MG1363 amplicon/oligo 2 X 2.5K [includes plasmids and pseudogenes]
