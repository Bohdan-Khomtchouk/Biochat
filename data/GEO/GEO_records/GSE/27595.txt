TITLE
Technical comparison of qRT-PCR experiments with the GLYCOv2 custom array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression patterns were surveyed using RNA from 4 different murine sources.

DESIGN
Four classes of RNA were analyzed: undifferentiated embryonic stem cells, differentiated ES cells, kidney and liver tissues. Classes were prepared in triplicate for a total of 12 samples. All samples were hybridized to the custom designed CFG GLYCOv2 glycogene array. Analysis results were used for comparison with parallel experiments using qRT-PCR.

PLATFORM
GPL11094 [GLYCOv2a520086F] Custom Affymetrix Glyco v2 GeneChip
