TITLE
Whole genome expression analysis of SaOS2 cells expressing anti-sense APC RNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Osteoblasts represent an important cell type playing a role in not only bone formation but also regulate hematopoiesis by secreting factor as well as via contact with hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Since Wnt signalling plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation, we were interested in looking at how canonical Wnt signalling activation in osteoblastic cells is likely to affect hematopoietic cell adhesion and regulate their fate. Endogenous Wnt signaling activation in osteoblastic SaOS2 cells was achieved by generating doxycycline (DOX) inducible antisense-APC expressing SaOS2 cells. Gene expression profiling was performed on SaOS2 cells induced with DOX (1Î¼g/ml) for 3 days and further on DOX treated cells allowed to recover for 3 days. The results reveal changes in expression of a number of cell adhesion and extracellular matrix protein genes as well as genes involved in osteoblast differentiation.

DESIGN
Doxycycline inducible antisense APC expressing SaOS2 cells were treated with DOX for  3 days and compared with control (untreated) cells. In addition, a set of DOX induced cells was further cultured for 3 days in absence of Dox to allow for the cells to recover and see the change in gene expression compared to Dox treated and control cells. All experiments were done in triplicates (in total 9 samples). This study has not been published
