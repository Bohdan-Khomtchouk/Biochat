TITLE
microRNA-like RNAs exploring and expression profile in plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum

ORGANISM
Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum

SUMMARY
To explore the presence of milRNA in Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (Fon) and evaluate their expression at different propagules, two categories of sRNAs were identified from Fon hyphae and microconidia by using illumina sequencing. A total of 650,960 and 561,114 unique sRNAs were obtained from the hyphae and microconidia samples. With a previously constructed pipeline to search for microRNA, we then identified 74 and 56 miRNA-like small RNAs (milRNAs) candidates in hyphae and microconidia based on the short hairpin structure analysis, respectively. Global expression analysis showed an extensively differential expression of sRNAs between two propagules. Altogether, 78 significantly differently expressed milRNAs were identified in two libraries. Target prediction revealed 2 interesting genes involved in trichothecene and necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1 (NEP1) biosynthesis predicted to be down regulated by Fon-miR7696a-3p and Fon-miR6108a. These two milRNAs were further validated by qRT-PCR and showed a well consistency with sequencing. The negative correlation expression levels between these two milRNAs and their targets genes imply that they might play a role in trichothecene and NEP1 biosynthesis, and this negative regulation for toxin related gene expression are more specific in microconidia. The present study provides the firstly large-scale characterization of milRNAs in Fon and the comparison between hyphae and microconidia propagules gives a clue on how milRNAs involves in toxin biosynthesis.

DESIGN
microRNA-like RNAs in hyphae and microconidia were identified and compared
