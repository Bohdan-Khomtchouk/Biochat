TITLE
Exon Array analysis of WT1(+KTS) mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This exon array analysis was performed on mice carrying splice specific mutations at the end of exon9 of the Wilms tumor supressor gene that interfere with the production of WT1(+KTS) isoforms (Hammes et al., 2001; Cell 106:309)

DESIGN
4 wildtype and 4 wt1(+KTS) mutant E18.5 mouse embryos were transcardially perfused with magnetic beads, glomeruli isolated and RNA extracted and analyzed for differential expression on Affymetrix Exon Arrays
