TITLE
Gene expression in macrophages in response to Acetylated-LDL (Ac-LDL)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of mouse thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages incubated in presence of acetylated low density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL) (120 μg/ml) for 24 h vs. mock-treated controls. Lipid accumulation in macrophages has profound effects on macrophage gene expression and contributes to the development of atherosclerosis.  Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) is the most up-regulated gene in foamy macrophages and it’s absence in hematopoietic cells results in larger atherosclerotic plaques, characterized by bigger necrotic core areas and increased macrophage apoptosis.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from mouse thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages incubated in presence of Acetylated-LDL (120 μg/ml) for 24 h vs. mock-treated controls.
