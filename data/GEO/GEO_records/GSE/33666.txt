TITLE
Genome-wide location analysis of Foxa1 in adult liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We determine by genome-wide location analysis (ChIP-Seq) that Foxa1 occupies 5,682 binding sites in the adult murine liver. Although Foxa1 and its closest paralog Foxa2 (GEO accessions: GSE25836 and GSE26729) share a large fraction of binding sites in the liver, each protein also occupies distinct regulatory elements in vivo. Foxa1-only sites have a weaker forkhead motif are enriched for p53 binding sites and are frequently found near genes important to cell cycle regulation, while Foxa2-restricted sites show only a stronger match to the forkhead consensus and are found in genes involved in steroid and lipid metabolism. Thus, Foxa1 and Foxa2, while redundant during development, have evolved divergent roles in the adult liver, ensuring the maintenance of both genes during evolution.
