Architectural protein subclasses shape 3-D organization of genomes during lineage commitment

SUMMARY
Understanding the topological configurations of chromatin can reveal valuable insights into how the genome and epigenome act in concert to control cell fate during development.  Here we generate high-resolution architecture maps across seven genomic loci in embryonic stem cells and neural progenitor cells.  We observe a hierarchy of 3-D interactions that undergo marked reorganization at the sub-Mb scale during differentiation.  Distinct combinations of CTCF, Mediator, and cohesin show widespread enrichment in architecture at different length scales.  CTCF/cohesin anchor long-range constitutive interactions that might form the topological basis for invariant sub-domains.  Conversely, Mediator/cohesin together with pioneer factors bridge short-range enhancer-promoter interactions within and between larger sub-domains.  Knockdown of Smc1 or Med12 in ES cells results in disruption of spatial architecture and down-regulation of genes found in cohesin-mediated interactions.  We conclude that cell type-specific chromatin organization occurs at the sub-Mb scale and that architectural proteins shape the genome in hierarchical length scales.
