TITLE
Gene expression changes in dorsal dermal fibroblasts after beta-catenin deletion in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Goal of this study was to examine gene expression changes upon conditional deletion of beta-catenin at E10.5 in dermal fibroblasts. Method:  Skin tissues were treated in 0/25% trypsin for 15 min at 37 degrees C to obtain single cells for FACS sorting and collected in RNA later. RNA was extracted with Karcturus pico pure kit. The RT and amplification was done using Nugen's ovation RNA-seq system V2.  Libraries for sequencing were prepared with Illumina TruSeq kit. Transcriptome of  FACS sorted E13.5 Engrailed1; RRYFP lineage-marked dorsal dermal fibroblasts was generated next-gen sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq machine. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed by TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRTâ€“PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays Results: We mapped about 33-49 million sequence reads per sample and obtained 76-79% of uniquely mapped percentage.  We assembled the reads to the mouse ref genome (build mm10).

DESIGN
E13.5 dermal fibroblast mRNA profiles from En1;RRYFP (n=2) and En1Cre;RRYFP;beta-catenin flox/del (n=3) embryos (from three different litters) were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hi Seq
