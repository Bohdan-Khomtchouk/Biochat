TITLE
Global transcript structure resolution of high gene density genomes through multi-platform data integration: Illumina RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Strand-specific Illumina RNA-Seq was used in conjunction with Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq and deepCAGE to globally resolve transcript structures in replicating Epstein-Barr virus.

DESIGN
Illumina strand-specific RNA-seq of BCR-activated Akata cells at 9 time points, and GapmeR knockdown of BZLT12-22 transcripts
