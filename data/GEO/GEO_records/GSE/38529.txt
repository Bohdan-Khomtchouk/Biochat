TITLE
Expression data from Drosophila embryos, control vs. dMyc+

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
dMyc is a conserved transcription factor that controls growth and proliferation by regulating its target genes. We used Affymetrix microarray to identify and classify targets of dMyc during Drosophila embryogenesis.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 0-24 hour old Drosophila embryos in control (Gal 4 expressing animals) and Myc+ (flies over-expressing dMyc under UAS enhancer) to identify genomic targets od dMyc during embryogenesis
