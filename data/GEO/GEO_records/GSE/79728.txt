TITLE
Differential expression of Hdc-GFP+/hiCD11b+Gr1+ vs Hdc-GFP-/loCD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells from mouse bone marrow

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow Hdc-GFP+/hi and Hdc-GFP-/loCD11b+Gr1+ cells were isolated from bones from histidine decarboxylase (Hdc) green fluorescent protein (Hdc-GFP) mice Hdc-GFP+/hiCD11b+Gr1+ cells and Hdc-GFP-/loCD11b+Gr1+ cells were sorted by combinations of GFP and myeloid cell surface markers CD11b and Gr1 and their differential mRNA expression compared with Affymetrix microarrays.

DESIGN
a. Hdc-GFP-/loCD11b+Gr1+cells (n=3) b. Hdc-GFP+/hiCD11b+Gr1+ cells (n=3)
