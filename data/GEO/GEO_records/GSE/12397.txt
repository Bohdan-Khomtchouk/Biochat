TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of P. yoelii SAP1 knockout

ORGANISM
Plasmodium yoelii

SUMMARY
To study the function of gene SAP1. We knocked out SAP1 gene in P. yoelii, and compared the global gene expression profiles of the P. yoelii SAP1 knockout parasites isolated from mosquito salivary gland to that of wild type P. yoelii parasites.

DESIGN
RNA samples from SAP1 knock out (SAP1ko) were directly hybridized to RNA samples obtained from mosquito salivary gland (sgSpz). Two independent biological replicates with dye swaps for each pairs of biological replicates were performed.  Also we included in the analysis two direct hybridizations between sgSpz and ooSpz from our previous study.
