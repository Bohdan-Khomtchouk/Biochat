TITLE
Lamin and Lamin B receptor knockout

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
influence of lamin B rereceptor knockout and lamin A/C knockout on gene expression in cultured myoblast cells and in striated muscle tissue

DESIGN
knockout samples are obtained by mating of heterozygous animals. Homozygous KO and wt animals of one litter are compared. Two boilogical replicates of KO samples are processed in parallel. wt samples are used as controls. One wt sample is processed per KO litter. Where appropriate two wt samples are used as biological replicates.
