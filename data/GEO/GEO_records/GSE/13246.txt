TITLE
Expressionprofiling of a glnR-mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis during culture on nitrate

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Identification of glnR-dependent regulation of nitrate assimilation Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv wild type and glnR mutant strain were incubated in minimal medium supplemented with 5 mM NO3 for 18 and 48 hours. RNA was extracted at indicated time points and microarray analysis was performed. Experiments were repeated once. As we wanted to focus on genes that were regulated steadily over time, data obtained from time points 18 hours and 48 hours were grouped. Thus for wild type and mutant, four independent data sets were obtained each, and compared using t-test statistics.
