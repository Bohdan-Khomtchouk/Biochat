TITLE
Mapping and dynamics of regulatory DNA in A. thaliana accessions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We performed DNase-seq on 7-day-old seedlings from four A. thaliana accessions: Bur-0, Tsu-0, Bay-0, Est-1 using INTACT constructs (Deal and Henikoff, Developmental Cell, 2010) driven by the UBQ10 promoter.

DESIGN
Chromatin accessibility profiling (Dnase I-seq) of 7-day-old seedlings of A. thaliana accessions: Bur-0, Tsu-0, Bay-0 & Est-1 grown in LD conditions (16hr light 22°C, 8hr dark 20°C).

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
