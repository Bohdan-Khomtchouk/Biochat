TITLE
Transgenerational changes in small RNA profiles of C.elegans mutants lacking PRG-1

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
An attempt to identify small non-coding RNAs that change with increasing generations after becoming homozygous for the loss of PRG-1

DESIGN
Small non-coding RNA (18-30nt) was extracted from animals the indicated number of generations after homozygosity was established

PLATFORM
GPL13657 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Caenorhabditis elegans)
