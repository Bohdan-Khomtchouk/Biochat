CETCh-Seq  of Mammalian Transcription Factors

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a widely used technique for identifying transcription factor (TF) binding events throughout an entire genome. However, ChIP-seq is limited by the availability of suitable ChIP-seq grade  antibodies, and the vast majority of commercially available antibodies fail to generate usable  datasets. To ameliorate these technical obstacles, we present a robust methodological  approach for performing ChIP-seq through epitope tagging of endogenous TFs. We used Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-based genome  editing technology to develop CRISPR Epitope Tagging ChIP-seq (CETCh-seq) of DNA-binding  proteins. We assessed the feasibility of CETCh-seq by tagging several TFs spanning a wide  range of endogenous expression levels in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. Our  data exhibit strong correlations between both replicate types as well as with standard ChIP-seq  approaches that use TF antibodies. Notably, we also observed minimal changes to the cellular  transcriptome and to the expression of the tagged TF. To examine the robustness of our  technique, we further performed CETCh-seq in the breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7 as  well as mouse embryonic stem cells and observed similarly high correlations. Collectively,  these data highlight the applicability of CETCh-seq to accurately define the genome-wide  binding profiles of DNA-binding proteins, allowing for a straightforward methodology to  potentially assay the complete repertoire of TFs, including the large fraction for which ChIPquality  antibodies are not available.
