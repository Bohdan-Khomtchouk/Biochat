TITLE
Expression data from bovine corpus luteum treated with equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG)

ORGANISM
Bos indicus

SUMMARY
In order to indentify genes regulated by eCG, and involved in CL development and progesterone increases, the transcriptome was evaluated using the microarray technology

DESIGN
Cows (Bos indicus) were divided into control, stimulated  and superovulated groups.  The stimulated group received 400 IU of eCG on day 8 and the superovulated group received 2000 IU of eCG on day 4 after the beginning of synchronization. Corpus luteum were collected at day 6 after ovulation e the trasncripitome was available by microarray.
