TITLE
IDR-1018 treatment of mice infected with Plasmodium berghei, spleen and brain expression data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Severe malaria encompasses a range of syndromes manifesting systemically or in diverse organs. These are believed to represent the end-stage processes of local parasite sequestration and inflammatory cascades. Classical anti-malarial drugs target parasites only. In treatment of severe disease, adjunctive therapies capable of controlling the inflammatory processes could be beneficial. Innate defense regulator (IDR) peptides display multiple immune modulatory activities. In this study, we assessed peptide IDR-1018, which shows promise as an anti-inflammatory drug, as a lead candidate for adjunctive host-directed therapy of established disease in the P. berghei ANKA model of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). Intravenously administered IDR-1018 partially protected mice from ECM both prophylactically and in adjunctive treatment with classical anti-malarial drugs. We used transcriptional data from spleens and brains taken early in infection (day 3) of prophylactically treated mice to investigate the protective mechanisms.

DESIGN
The microarrays compared spleens and brains from nine IDR-1018 i.v. treated, infected mice (IDR-1018-treated infected) with three saline i.v. treated infected mice (saline-treated infected) and three uninfected untreated control mice (controls). RNA samples were hybridized in randomized order to five Illumina WG-6 v2 BeadChips . No technical replicates were performed.
