TITLE
PC3 vs LNCaP amplified and unamplified miRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of miRNA expression profiles directly comparing PC3 cells to LNCaP cells using unamplified and amplified miRNA. Keywords: Expression profiling of hormone sensitive vs. insensitive prostate cancer cell lines and evaluation of amplification fidelity

DESIGN
MiRNA expression was compared between untreated PC3 (hormone insensitive) vs LNCaP (hormone sensitive) prostate cancer cell lines.  Six replicates were performed on enriched and unamplied miRNA from both cell lines.  Three replicates were performed on enriched and amplified miRNA from both cell lines. Both cell lines were grown to ~70% confluency and harvested for enriched miRNAs using the mirVana Isolation kit from Ambion per manufacturer's instructions.  A total of 200 ng of enriched PC3 miRNA was labeled with Cy3 and LNCaP was labeled with Cy5 using the Array900 miRNA RT kit from Genisphere.
