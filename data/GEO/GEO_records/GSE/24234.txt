TITLE
Experimental systems biology: Lessons from an integrated, multi-laboratory study in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We undertook an inter-laboratory effort to generate high-quality quantitative data for a very large number of cellular components in yeast using transcriptome and metabolome analysis. We ensured the high-quality of the experimental data by evaluating a wide range of sampling and measurement techniques. The data were generated for two different yeast strains, each growing under two different growth conditions and based on integrated analysis of the high-throughput data we hypothesize that differences in growth rates and yields on glucose between the two strains are due to differences in protein metabolism.

DESIGN
Two yeast strains, YSBN2 and CEN.PK 113-7D, were grown in aerobical batch as well as glucose-limited chemostat (dilution rate 0.1h-1) in biological triplicates
