TITLE
Functional analysis of chicken IRF7 in response to dsRNA analog poly(I:C) by integrating overexpression and knockdown

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
In this study, an integrative high-throughput functional genomics approach was applied by combining overexpression and knockdown assays with RNA-seq; this side-by-side approach was taken in an effort to obtain corroboration and complementary support in the identification of potential genes that are under the control of IRF7.

DESIGN
Transcriptiome analysis of Poly(I:C) induced IRF7 overexpression & knockdown DF-1 cell lines and their respective controls

PLATFORM
