TITLE
Microarray expression analysis of patients DupuytrenÂ´s contracture (DC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used a high-throughput technology, DNA microarray, to screen the entire genome for the changes in gene expression in diseased tissue to characterize Dupuytren's contracture at a molecular level and find genes that are involved in development of the disease.

DESIGN
Primary cell cultures were established from surgically removed diseased (D) and healthy (ND) tissue from 3 patients. Total we had 6 samples, 3 diseased and 3 healthy patient-matched samples.  Total RNA was isolated by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and further used for microarray expression analysis (HG-U133A array, Affymetrix).  Raw data, CEL. files were analysed with software MAS5, GeneSpring and GENEMAPP.
