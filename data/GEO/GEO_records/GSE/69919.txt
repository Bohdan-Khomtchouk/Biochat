TITLE
Generation of a Panel of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells From Chimpanzees: a Resource for Comparative Functional Genomics [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Pan troglodytes ; Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparative genomics studies in primates are extremely restricted due to our limited access to samples from non-human apes. In order to gain better insight into the genetic processes that underlie variation in complex phenotypes in primates, we must have access to faithful model systems for a wide range of cell types. To facilitate this, we have generated a panel of 7 fully characterized chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines derived from healthy donors. To begin demonstrating the utility of comparative iPSC panels, we collected RNA-sequencing and DNA methylation data from the chimpanzee iPSCs and the corresponding fibroblast lines, as well as from 7 human iPSCs and their source lines, which encompass multiple populations and cell types. We observe much less within-species variation in iPSCs than in somatic cells, indicating that the reprogramming process erases many inter-individual differences. The low within-species regulatory variation in iPSCs allowed us to identify many novel inter-species regulatory differences of small magnitude.

DESIGN
We used ChIP-seq to characterize the genome-wide distribution of two types of histone modifications (H3K27me3 and H3K27ac) in three of our chimpanzee iPSCs and compared them to histone modification data from three human iPSC lines from the Roadmap Epigenomics project:
