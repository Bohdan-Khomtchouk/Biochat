TITLE
Prediction of breast cancer prognosis by gene expression profile of TP53 status.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TP53 mutations are a poor prognostic factor in breast cancers. This study sets out to identify the gene set that determine expression signature of the TP53 status (TP53 signature) and to correlate it with clinical outcome. Using comprehensive expression analysis and DNA sequencing of the TP53 gene in 38 Japanese breast cancer patients, we have isolated a gene set of 33 genes from differentially expressed genes in the learning set (n=26), depending on the TP53 status. Predictive accuracy of TP53 status by gene expression profile was 83.3% in the test set (n=12). As independent external datasets, two published datasets were introduced for validation of TP53 status prediction (251 Swedish samples) and survival analysis (both the Swedish and 295 Dutch samples). TP53 signature has the ability to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) of 29 stage I and II Japanese breast cancers (log rank, P = 0.032), and RFS, overall survival of two independently published datasets (log rank, both P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis has shown an independent and significant prognostic factor with a hazard ratio (HR) for recurrence and survival in two external datasets (P < 0.0001). The TP53 signature is also a strong prognostic factor in the subgroups: estrogen-receptor positive, lymph node (LN) positive and negative, intermediate/high risk in St. Gallen criteria, and high risk in National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria (log rank, P < 0.0001). TP53 signature is a reliable and independent predictor of the outcome of disease in operated breast cancer. Keywords: Tumor sample comparison

DESIGN
Microarray hybridizations (Agilent: Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray; 41k unique probe) were carried out with 1μg Cy3 labeled cRNA and 1 μg Cy5 labeled cRNA, both prepared from each sample and reference pool, respectively. Fluorescent intensities of scanned images were quantified by ArrayVision Ver.8 rev.4 (Imaging research). The gene expression data was quantified and analyzed by GeneSpring 6.2 (Silicon Genetics). To identify the TP53 status predictor gene set, a Wilcoxon rank sum test along with Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) was used.
