TITLE
Gene expression profile of Drosophila third instar larval wing imaginal discs overexpressing netrinA (netA) and frazzled (fra).

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In order to analyze the global changes in gene expression resulting from induction of NetA-Fra signaling, we carried out a microarray experiment comparing Drosophila third instar wing imaginal discs in which Net+Fra had been overexpressed to age matched wild type wing imaginal discs. RNA extracted from both +NetA-Fra overexpression and wildtype third instar imaginal discs were hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip Drosophila Genome 2.0 .

DESIGN
Heat shock induced GFP-marked clones ectopically expressing NetA+Fra in larvae were generated.  Controls for this study included age matched wildtype third instar wing imaginal discs bearing GFP clones which were prepared in the same manner.  Total RNA was extracted from dissected +NetA-Fra vs. control third instar wing imaginal discs and hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip Drosophila Genome 2.0.
