TITLE
Gene network analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana flower development through dynamic gene perturbations

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Microarray experiments conducted using artifical microRNA knockdowns from multiple induction systems

DESIGN
Multiple replicates for each artifical microRNA/inducible system combination were conducted on two channel microarrays against uninduced samples using a dye swap
