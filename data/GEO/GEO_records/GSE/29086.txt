TITLE
Arabidopsis root Fe deficiency transcriptome

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Fe deficiency stimulates a coordinated response involving reduction, transport and redistribution of Fe in the roots. The expression of genes regulated by Fe deficiency in the two contrasting Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes, Tsu-1 and Kas-1, shows that different ecotypes can respond in diverse ways, with different Fe regulated overrepresented categories. We use microarrays to analyze the Fe deficiency responses of contrasting Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes (Tsu-1 and Kas-1).

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana roots from the Kas-1 and Tsu-1 ecotypes were exposed to complete or -Fe nutrient solutions and collected after 24 and 48 h for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Experiments were done using three biological replicates.
