ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio vulgaris str. Hildenborough

SUMMARY
Using data from microarray experiments, we investigated the transcriptional changes in evolved and ancestor D. vulgaris strains.    gene expression changes in evolved salt-stressed DvH strain (ES, evolved in LS4D + 100 mM NaCl for 1200 generations), evolved control DvH strain (EC, evolved in LS4D for 1200 generations) and ancestor DvH strain grown in non-stress (LS4D), low salt stress (LS4D + 100 mM NaCl) or high salt stress (LS4D + 250 mM NaCl) conditions

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression in evolved salt-stressed strain (ES, 1200g) to ancestor (An) or evolved control (EC, 1200g) strains at mid-logarithmic phase under standard growth condition with defined medium LS4D, salt stress conditions LS4D+100 mM NaCl or LS4D+250 mM NaCl.
