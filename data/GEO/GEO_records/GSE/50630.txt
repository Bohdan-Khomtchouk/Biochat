TITLE
Whole Transcriptomic Sequencing of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the gene expression profile of 8 metastatic castration resisistant prostate cancer samples analyzed by paired-end RNA-seq. We found evidence of extensive abnormal splicing as well as several novel fusion genes. Finally, we also observed several recurrent high-confidence somatic mutations.
