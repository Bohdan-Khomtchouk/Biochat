TITLE
sRNA populations of 2 week old seedlings from Arabidopsis ecotypes C24, Ler, and their two reciprocal F1 hybrids

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We examined sRNA populations in the Arabidopsis ecotypes C24, Landsberg erecta (Ler), and their reciprocal hybrids which display strong intra-species heterosis.  The parental ecotypes had significant differences in their sRNA epigenomes and associated methylation profiles.  The hybrids differed greatly from the parents in their sRNA epigenomes including a marked reduction in 24nt sRNA associated with loci that differed in the frequency of 24nt sRNAs between the parents.

DESIGN
Examination of sRNA populations from two-week old seedlings from Arabidopsis ecotypes C24, Ler, and their two reciprocal hybrids.
