TITLE
Timecourse of mAbs 18B7 or MOPC-21 (control) binding to Cryptococcus neoformans serotype D strains JEC21 or 24067 (52D) after 1, 2 or 4 hours at 37 C.

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans

SUMMARY
Changes in gene expression of serotype D strains JEC21 or 24067 (52D) were examined after incubation with mAb 18B7 or the control MOPC-21 for 1, 2 or 4 hours at 37 C.

DESIGN
Analysis used incubation with a non-binding IgG1 mAb as a control for incubation with a protective IgG1 mAb 18B7 at different timepoints.
