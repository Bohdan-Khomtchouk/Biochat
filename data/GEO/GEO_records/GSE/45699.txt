TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the Zebrafish model of Diamond-Blackfan Anemia from RPS19 deficiency via p53-dependent and -independent pathways

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To determine the effect on the whole transcriptome of RPS19 morpholino and to identify the function of p53 in RPS19-deficient embryos, we analyzed the genome-wide transcript profiles of control morpholino (control), RPS19 morpholino knockdown (RPS19 MO), and RPS19 and p53 morpholino knockdown simultaneously (RPS19+p53 MO) using the Illumina Hi-seq 2000 Genome Analyzer platform with paired-end 100 base-pair tags to a depth of 35-60 million reads. We found that genes enriched in the functions of hematological systems and nervous system development and that skeletal and muscular disorders had significant differential expression in RPS19 MO embryos compared with controls. Co-inhibition of p53 partially alleviates the abnormalities for RPS19-deficient embryos. However, the hematopoietic genes, which were down-regulated significantly in RPS19 MO embryos, were not completely recovered by the co-inhibition of p53. Furthermore, we identified the genome-wide p53-dependent and -independent genes and pathways. These results indicate that not only p53 family members but also several other factors have important impacts on RPS19-deficient embryos. The detection of potential pathogenic genes and pathways provides us a new paradigm for research on DBA, which is a systematic and complex hereditary disease.
