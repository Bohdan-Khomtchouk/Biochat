TITLE
Differential effects of progesterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate on normal breast cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison between the effects of progesterone (P4) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) combined to estradiol (E2) on gene expression in normal breast cells to provide insight on their possible different impact on breast cancer risk in vivo.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from cultures of normal human breast epithelial cells (HBE) under E2, E2+MPA and E2+P4 six hour treatments, compared to untreated HBE cells
