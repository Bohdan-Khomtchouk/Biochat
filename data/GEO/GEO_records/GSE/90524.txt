TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of long noncoding RNA expression profile in colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world.Recent studies have shown that long non-coding (lncRNA) plays critical roles in a myriad of biological processes and human diseases,Since the roles of lncRNA in CRC remain largely unknown,they were investigated in the study.Our findings indicate that the expression profiles of lncRNAs has changed in CRC as compared with adjacent non-tumor samples, and may provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the disease and potential novel diagnostic or therapeutic targets for CRC.

DESIGN
Microarray expression profiling of mRNAs and lncRNAs were conducted using RNA extracted from three colorectal cancer tumor samples and three matched adjacent non-tumor samples
