TITLE
Dnmt3L-histone H3 binding is necessary for male fertility and non-CG methylation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Patterns of DNA methylation are established during gametogenesis. The catalytically-inactive adaptor Dnmt3L is crucial to ensure this occurs correctly. In vitro, Dnmt3L binds to the N terminal tail of histone H3 but the function of this interaction during development is unknown. Here we show that Dnmt3L-histone H3 interaction is necessary for spermatogenesis. Mutant animals exhibit reduced fertility, defective methylation establishment at retrotransposons coupled with their reactivation and meiotic catastrophe. The spermatogonial stem cell pool is also defective, with mutant cells displaying marked changes in gene expression. Genome-wide methylation analysis reveals reductions in CG methylation as well as severe loss of non-CG methylation suggesting that non-CG methylation is specifically sensitive to the ability of Dnmt3L to bind histone H3.
