TITLE
Expression analysis of evolved polygamous and monogamous Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Investigation of gene expression level changes in evolved polygamous and monogamous populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The populations investigated are described in Hollis et al. 2011. Populations with elevated mutation load do not benefit from the operation of sexual selection. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 24: 1918-1926.

DESIGN
A study using total RNA extracted from male and female virgin 4-day old Drosophila melanogaster and then transcriptionally profiled with 12x135k Nimblegen arrays. Also, transcriptional profiling of male and female heads from the same populations using Illumina RNA-Seq.
