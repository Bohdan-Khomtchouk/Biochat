TITLE
The gene expression of wild-type worms and kin-1(ok338) mutant worms exposing Salmonella entericaSL1344 at 24 hours

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
PKA/KIN-1 pathway is required for innate immunity in C. elegans, however, the downstream signaling is largely unclear. To gain further insight into mechanism underlying the promoted immunity of PKA/KIN-1 pathway, we performed genome microarrays of wild-type and kin-1(ok338) worms infection by Salmonella entericSL1344, compared with the controls wild-type fed E.coli OP50

DESIGN
The gene expression in wild-type worms and kin-1(ok338) mutant worms after exposure Salmonella entericaSL1344 at 24 hours. all experiments were performed three times independently.

PLATFORM
