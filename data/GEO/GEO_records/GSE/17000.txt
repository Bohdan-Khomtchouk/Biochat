TITLE
miRNAs in activated mouse CD4 T cells by Bcl-6 overexpression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Compare miRNA expression profiles in mouse CD4 T cells overexpression of Bcl-6 vs empty vector

DESIGN
Mouse na√Øve CD4+ T cells were transduced with a Bcl-6-expressing retrovirus or the control vector and cultured in Th0 condition for 2 days. Cells expressing medium to high levels of GFP were sorted and total RNAs were isolated using mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems). MiRNA expression was profiled using Agilent 8x15K mouse miRNA microarray miRNA-v1_95_May07 (miRBase Release 9.2) by Ramaciotti Centre for Gene Function Analysis (Sydney). Each sample was run in duplicate.
