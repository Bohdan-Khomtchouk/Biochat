TITLE
Genome-wide cardiac gene expression analysis of mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cardiomyocyte-specific double knockout (DKO) mice lacking the catalytic domains of Dnmt3a (exon 18) and Dnmt3b (exon 19) were obtained by mating Dnmt3aflox and Dnmt3bflox mice [PMID 15757890] with mice expressing a cre recombinase under control of the cardiac atrial myosin light chain promoter (Myl7) [11689889]. Mice with the genotype Dnmt3aflox/flox, Dnmt3bflox/flox without expressing cre recombinase were used as control mice (CTL). Transcriptome analyses identified upregulation of 44 and downregulation of 9 genes in DKO as compared with control sham mice. TAC mice showed similar changes with substantial overlap of regulated genes compared to sham.

DESIGN
Cardiac tissue from sham CTL (n=4) and DKO mice (n=4) as well as TAC-operated CTL (n=6) and DKO mice (n=6) was analysed.
