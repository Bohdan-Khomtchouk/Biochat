TITLE
miR-19b mediates lung epithelial-mesenchymal transition via PTEN signaling in response to mechanical stretch

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alveolar epithelial type II (AEII) cells are the first line host in response to mechanical ventilation. We tested the hypothesis that the modulation of microRNA on AEII cells in response to mechanical stretch may participate in the ventilator-induced lung injury. This experiment is designed to screen miRNAs that are deregulated during mechanical stretch of AEII cells.
