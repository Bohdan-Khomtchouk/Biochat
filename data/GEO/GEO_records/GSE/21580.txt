TITLE
DeepCAGE and DeepSAGE with proliferating and differentiated C2C12 mouse myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We use tag-based next generation sequencing analysis to quantify gene expression levels during myogenic differentiation and focused on the identifcation of novel 3' ends with DeepSAGE and novel 5' ends with DeepCAGE.

DESIGN
Illumina DeepCAGE and DeepSAGE with C2C12 cells at time points T0 (proliferating) and T9 (differentiated) days of differentiation.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
