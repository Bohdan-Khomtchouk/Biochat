TITLE
Gene expression data ARID1A knockdown OE33 cells versus mock OE33 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A nonsense mutation in ARID1A was identified by next generation sequencing in non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus [BE] tissue and esophageal adenocarcinoma [EAC] tissue of a patient diagnosed with EAC. Immunohistochemistry performed on an independent archival cohort demonstrated ARID1A protein loss in 0% (0/76), 4.9% (2/40), 14.3% (4/28), 16.0% (8/50), and 12.2% (12/98) of normal squamous epithelium, BE, low-, high-grade dysplasia, and EAC tissues, respectively. Enhanced cell growth, proliferation and invasion were observed upon ARID1A knockdown in EAC cells. ARID1A was knocked down in OE33 cells (Sample MS_1 and MS_3) using on-TARGET smartpool ARID1A siRNA. At the same time, OE33 cells were transfected with a non-targeting siRNA, and these experiments (Samples MS_2 and MS_4) functioned as mock controls. Cells were harvested after 48 hours and total RNA was extracted using the Rneasy kit (Qiagen)

DESIGN
Aim Affymetrix Human PrimeView Gene Expression Array : to determine the downstream effectors of ARID1A that are likely to contribute to the oncogenic phenotype caused by ARID1A down-regulation. Two biological replicates of each condition (2x ARID1A knockdown, and 2x Mock) were used for the microarray experiment.
