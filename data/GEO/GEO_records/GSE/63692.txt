TITLE
De Novo Transcriptome of tobacco seedlings and Identification of early response gene network under low potassium stress

ORGANISM
Nicotiana tabacum

SUMMARY
We used solexa sequencing technology to analysis transcriptome of tobacco seedings under low potassium stress for 6 h,12 h and 24h treatment. Further analysis suggested that 732 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were up-regulated and 302 DEGs were down-regulated after potassium deficiency. Our results provided comprehensive analysis of gene regulatory network under low potassium stress of tobacco seedings.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different tobacco seedings samples (CK and LK)

PLATFORM
GPL13760 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Nicotiana tabacum)
