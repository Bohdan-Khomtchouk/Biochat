TITLE
Gene expression profiling of uterine epithelial cells isolated from Msx1Msx2 floxed and Msx1Msx2 ablated mice on day 4 of pregnancy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our preliminary study revealed that the homeobox transcription factors, Msx1 and Msx2, are expressed in the mouse uterus during early pregnancy. Further, conditional deletion of Msx1 and Msx2 in mouse uterus leads to implantation failure due to impaired uterine epithelial receptivity. To identify the downstream targets of Msx1Msx2 in the uterus, we performed gene expression profling of uterine epithelial cells isolated from Msx1Msx2-null mice and the corresponding controls on day4 of pregnancy (the time of implantation). The microarray results revealed elevated expression of mRNAs corresponding to several Wnts in uterine epithelium of Msx1Msx2-ablated mice.

DESIGN
We performed conditional ablation of Msx1Msx2 in the mouse uterus using the PRcre mouse model. we isolated uterine epithelial cells from day4 pregnant mice (n=5 for each genotype). Total RNA was purified from these cells to hybridize to high density affymetrix microarrays.
