TITLE
Differentially expressed genes under different stress conditions in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Rice is one of important crop and, the genome has been already completely sequenced. Moreover we collected more than 30K rice FL-cDNA clones as transcriptome resources. However, the cDNA collection did not reveal the transcription activity and specificity of expression. So, we designed 60-mer oligo array based on the array system of Agilent Technologies (GPL477) as custom array. For validation of the array, we tested the reproducibility of labeling and hybridization. After this validation, 22K rice oligo array was supplied from Agilent Technologies (GPL892). 2: reproducibility of hybridization-2: We made a dye-swap experiment to validate dye-effect and data reproducibility between arrays. We hybridized shoot (as control) and stress-treated shoot. This data also indicated the diversity of gene expression profile among stress response. In addition, array data of samples treated for 24 hours have been already published on NCBI-GEO (GSE2415) Keywords: variety among tissues

DESIGN
organisms: Oryza sativa ssp. japonica (Nipponbare) tissue: shoot derived from more than 100 plants treatement1: cold stress (10 degreeC) time course1: 48, 72 hours tissue1: shoot treatment2: drought stress (25% polyethylene glycol 6000) time course2: 1, 9 hours tissue: shoot treatment3: flood and lay-down stress time course3: 1, 6, 24, 48 hours tissue3: shoot treatment4: flood stress time course4: 1, 24, 48, 72 hours tissue4: shoot treatment5: lay-down stress for 24 hours tissue5: shoot hybridization : two dye method hybridization: Dye-swap experiment replication: samples were not replicated. array: 2 array per 1 experiment (total 26 arrays)
