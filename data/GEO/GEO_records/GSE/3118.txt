TITLE
Comparison of expression profile between human Müller cells, HMCL-I and HMCL-II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Müller cells are the principal glial cells in the retina. Alterations in Müller cell behaviour are observed in retinal tissue from patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The purpose of this study was to compare gene and protein expression profile of normal human Müller cells (NHMC) with two spontaneously human Müller cell lines generated from type 1 (HMCL-I) and type 2 (HMCL-II) diabetic donors using Serial Analysis Gene Expression (SAGE). Approximatively 50 000 tags were sequenced for each of the three SAGE libraries. Identification of the transcripts was obtained by matching the 15bp (CATG + 11bp) with the UniGene and GenBank databases. Classification of the genes was based upon the updated information of the genome directory found at the NCBI website. SAGE allowed us to characterize the entire transcriptome of human Müller cells and to compare these data with those from Müller cells of type 1 and 2 diabetic donors. Keywords: Müller cells, SAGE, HMCL-I, HMCL-II, expression profile comparison
