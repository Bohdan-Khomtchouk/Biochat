TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation map reveals widespread epigenetic variation in healthy individuals (RRBS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using neutrophils from a cohort of normal individuals, we generated base-resolution DNA methylation maps to document inter-individual epigenetic variation.

DESIGN
Here we generated single-nucleotide resolution DNA methylation maps from neutrophils isolated from a cohort of healthy individuals, using Reduced Representation Bisulphite Sequencing (RRBS).
