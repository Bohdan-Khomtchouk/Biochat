TITLE
The PRC2-associated factor C17orf96 is a novel CpG island regulator in mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CpG islands (CGIs) are key DNA regulatory elements in the vertebrate genome and are often found at gene promoters. In mammalian embryonic stem (ES) cells, CGIs are decorated by either the active or repressive histone marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, respectively, or by both modifications (‘bivalent domains’), but their precise regulation is incompletely understood. Remarkably, we find that the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-associated protein C17orf96 (a.k.a. esPRC2p48 and E130012A19Rik) is present at most CGIs in mouse ES cells. At PRC2-rich CGIs, loss of C17orf96 results in an increased chromatin binding of Suz12 and elevated H3K27me3 levels concomitant with gene repression. In contrast, at PRC2-poor CGIs, located at actively transcribed genes, C17orf96 colocalizes with RNA polymerase II and its depletion leads to a focusing of H3K4me3 in the core of CGIs. Our findings thus identify C17orf96 as a novel context-dependent CGI regulator.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of C17orf96, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in mouse ES cells (E14).
