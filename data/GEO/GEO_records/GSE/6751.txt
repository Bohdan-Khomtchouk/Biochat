TITLE
Expression profiles of peripheral blood monocytes in periodontal therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Periodontal infections have been associated with systemic inflammation and risk for atherosclerosis and vascular disease. We investigated the effects of comprehensive periodontal therapy on gene expression of peripheral blood monocytes. Approximately 1/3 of the patients showed substantial changes in expression in genes relevant to innate immunity, apoptosis, and cell signaling. We concluded that periodontal therapy may alter monocytic gene expression in a manner consistent with a systemic anti-inflammatory effect. Keywords: time course,disease state analysis
