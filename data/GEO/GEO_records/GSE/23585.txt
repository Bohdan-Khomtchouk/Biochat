TITLE
Neural stem and progenitor cells shorten S-phase upon commitment to neuron production

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The dorsal telencephalon from E14.5 Tis21–GFP heterozygous mice embryos was subjected to microarray analysis. To identify genes whose expression were changed in Tis21–GFP positive S phase cells compared to Tis21–GFP negative S phase cells, Tis21–GFP positive or negative S phase cells labeled with a vital dye were separated by FACS corresponding to the GFP expression and DNA contents of the cells.

DESIGN
30 telencephalic hemispheres from 15 embryos of the Tis21–GFP heterozygous mice at E14.5 were dissected to collect approximately 200,000 S phase cells either from Tis21–GFP positive or negative for one replicate. Four independent experiments were performed from 3 different pregnant mice at least for each experiment set. Finally three best experiment sets were used for data analyses.
