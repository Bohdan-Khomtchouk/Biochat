TITLE
Differential Renal Gene Expression in Pre-hypertensive and Hypertensive SHR

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study examined the renal gene expression profiles between spontaneously-hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats at a pre-hypertensive stage (3 weeks of age) and hypertensive stage (9 weeks of age).  In addition, age-related changes in gene expression patterns were examined from 3 to 9 weeks in both WKY and SHR.  Five to six individual kidney samples of the same experimental group were pooled together and quadruplicate hybridizations were performed on the NIEHS Rat v2.1, 2.2 and 3.0 arrays. Keywords: other
