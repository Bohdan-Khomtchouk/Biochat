TITLE
Gene expression profiles of canine and human osteosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Pulmonary metastasis continues to be the most common cause of death in osteosarcoma.  Indeed, the 5-year survival for newly diagnosed osteosarcoma patients has not significantly changed in over 20 years. Further understanding of the mechanisms of metastasis and resistance for this aggressive pediatric cancer is necessary. Pet dogs naturally develop osteosarcoma providing a novel opportunity to model metastasis development and progression. Given the accelerated biology of canine osteosarcoma, we hypothesized that a direct comparison of canine and pediatric osteosarcoma expression profiles may help identify novel metastasis-associated tumor targets that have been missed through the study of the human cancer alone.  Collectively, these data support the strong similarities between human and canine osteosarcoma and underline the opportunities provided by a comparative oncology approach as a means to improve our understanding of cancer biology and therapy. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
Two datasets consisting of canine osteosarcoma tumors, canine osteosarcoma cell lines, and three normal tissues and an analogous human dataset were used to define the similarity between human and canine osteosarcoma.  A third dataset, human osteosarcoma with outcome data, was then used to suggest that some of the differences between the canine and human osteosarcoma were, perhaps, related to survival.
