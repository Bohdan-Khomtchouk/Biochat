TITLE
Runx3 function in splenic NK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NK cells are innate immune cells that recognize and kill foreign, virally-infected and tumor cells without the need for prior immunization. NK expansion following viral infection is IL-2 or IL-15-dependent.

DESIGN
To identify Runx3 responsive genes, NK cells were isolated from spleen of WT and Runx3-/- mice . Six samples (3 WT and 3 Runx3-/-)  of freshly isolated NK cells (resting) were separately obtained from individual mice.
