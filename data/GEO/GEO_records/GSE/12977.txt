TITLE
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 growth curve

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 was grown in CM media, at 37oC in a waterbath with agitation of 125 rpm under constant light. Analysis of transcriptional changes during growth, in addition to mapping of transcriptome structure under the same conditions, provided interesting insights about regulatory logic within prokaryotic coding regions.
