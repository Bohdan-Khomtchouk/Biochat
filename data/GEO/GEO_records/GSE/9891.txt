TITLE
Expression profile of 285 ovarian tumour samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to profile the expression levels of 285 ovarian samples in order to identify molecular subtypes of the tumour Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Randomly selected samples from the AOCS ( Australian Ovarian Cancer Study) was expression profiled on the affymetrix U133_plus2 platform to identify novel subtypes of ovarian tumour

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
