TITLE
Novel age related alterations revealed by a comparative kinetic transcriptome analysis of na√Øve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from young and old animals.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Define,(a) intrinsic differences and (b) changes occuring upon TCR activation in genetic profiles of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from young and old animals, to identify candidate genes altered in old T cells involved in impairement of immune response in order to restore immune function in the old.

DESIGN
Activation dependant time series on sorted naive (CD62Lhi/CD44lo) CD4 and CD8 T cells from young and old animals-Each time point contains RNA pooled from 4 independent sortings

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
