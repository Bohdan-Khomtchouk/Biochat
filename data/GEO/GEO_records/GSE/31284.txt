TITLE
Histone H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation mark active enhancers and promoters together with bivalent promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcription regulation in pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells is a complex process that involves multitude of regulatory layers, one of which is post-translational modification of histones. Here we have investigated the genome-wide occurrence of two histone marks, acetylation of histone H3K9 and K14 (H3K9ac and H3K14ac), in mouse ES cells. We demonstrate genome-wide that H3K9ac and H3K14ac show very high correlation.
