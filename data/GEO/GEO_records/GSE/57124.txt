TITLE
Lung-resident myeloid-derived suppressor cells display dual functionality in experimental tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using cell-based approaches and experimental mouse models for pulmonary TB we unveiled MDSCs as new myeloid populations directly interacting with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). MDSCs readily phagocytosed Mtb, released proinflammatory (IL-6, IL-1α) and immunomodulatory (IL-10) cytokines while retaining their suppressive capacity. MDSCs were identified at the site of infection in disease-resistant and -susceptible mice during pulmonary TB. Excessive MDSC accumulation in lungs correlated with elevated surface expression of IL-4Rα and heightened TB lethality.

DESIGN
Microarray experiments were performed as dual-color hybridizations on Agilent mouse whole genome catalog 44K arrays. To compensate for dye-specific effects, a dye-reversal color-swap was applied.
