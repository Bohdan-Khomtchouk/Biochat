TITLE
SBF2-AS1 promotes tumorigenesis as a miRNA sponge in lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) play important roles in the pathogenesis of cancer. LncRNA SBF2-AS1is unregulated in lung cancer tissues, while its biological function and molecular mechanism are largely unknown. RNA sequencing results suggest cell cycle-related genes are altered after SBF2-AS1 knockdown. In vivo and in vitro experiments confirm SBF2-AS1 could promote tumorigenesis of lung cancer. Further experiments prove SBF2-AS1 could bind with miR-338-3p and miR-362-3p to regulate various cell cycle-related genes, including E2F1. These results indicate the existence of ceRNA network driven by SBF2-AS1 through sponging miRNAs.

DESIGN
A549 cells are plated into 6-well plate and then transfected small interfering RNA (siRNA) specifically targeting SBF2-AS1 or negative control (NC) siRNA. 24 hours after transfection, cells are harvested and extract total RNA with TRIZol reagent.

PLATFORM
GPL17303 Ion Torrent Proton (Homo sapiens)
