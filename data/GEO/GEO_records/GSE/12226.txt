TITLE
The Detection and Subtyping of Seasonal Influenza A H1N1 Isolates Using a Microarray

ORGANISM
Influenza A virus

SUMMARY
An influenza A microarray was used to type influenza A H1N1 specimens collected in Washington State and the results compared with identification by both culture and real time RT PCR. The microarray was more sensitive than conventional influenza testing. Cluster analysis of the microarray data discriminated specimens into distinct clades. Specimens from two pediatric decedents formed a unique clade upon H1 analysis. Keywords: Comparative genome study; Influenza A strains; Subtype H1N1
