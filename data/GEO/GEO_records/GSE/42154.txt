Hira-dependent histone H3.3 deposition facilitates PRC2 recruitment at developmental loci in ES cells [RNA-Seq]

SUMMARY
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) regulates gene expression during lineage specification through trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). In Drosophila, polycomb binding sites are dynamic chromatin regions coupled to incorporation of the histone variant H3.3. Here we show in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that H3.3 is required for proper establishment of H3K27me3 at the promoters of developmentally regulated genes. These promoters show reduced dynamics as determined by deposition of de novo synthesized histones, associated with reduced PRC2 occupancy. H3.3-depleted ESCs show upregulation of extraembryonic trophectoderm, as well as misregulation of other developmental genes upon differentiation. Our data demonstrate the importance of H3.3 incorporation in ESCs and suggest that changes in chromatin dynamics in its absence lead to misregulation of gene expression during differentiation. Moreover, our findings lend support to the emerging notion that H3.3 has multiple functions in distinct genomic locations that are not always correlated with an “active” chromatin state.
