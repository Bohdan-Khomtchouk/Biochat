TITLE
Effects of Morus alba L. (Mulberry) Leaf Extract in Hypercholesterolemic Mice on Suppression of Cholesterol Synthesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate effects of intake of mulberry leaf extracts on hypercholesterolemia, we performed gene expression profiling on rat liver by microarray analysis. Microarray analysis revealed that mulberry leaf extracts up-regulated the gene expression involved in suppression of cholesterol synthesis and stimulation of innate-adaptive Immunity.

DESIGN
Mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet without/with orally administration of mulberry leaf extracts for 4 weeks. Livers were taken for RNA extraction and hybridization on Agilent microarrays.
