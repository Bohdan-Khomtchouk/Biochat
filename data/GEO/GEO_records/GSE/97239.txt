TITLE
High-throughput RNA sequencing on circular RNA profiles of human bladder cancer tissues and normal bladder tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to find out circular RNAs profiles in human bladder cancer tissues and normal bladder tissues, we characterized circuclar RNA transcripts by performing RNA-Seq on ribosomal RNA-depleted total RNA from three pairs of human bladder cancer tissues and paired normal bladder tissues.A computational pipeline based on the anchor alignment of unmapped reads was used to identify circular RNAs. Collectively, we identified16,535 distict circular RNAs, most of them origined from exons (88.96%), others from introns, linc RNA, intergenic region, 3’UTR and 5’UTR. Among all these circRNAs, 571 circRNAs were differentially expressed between bladder cancer tissues and normal bladder tissues, and 524 circRNAs were downregulated in bladder cancer tissues (91.2%), others were upreguluated. These significantly differential expressed circular RNA might have regulatory function in bladder cancer, and worth to be further explored.

DESIGN
Circular RNAs profiles of thredd pairs of bladder cancer tissues and paired adjacent normal bladder tissues were generated by RNA deep-sequencing, using HiSeq2000, Illumina.
