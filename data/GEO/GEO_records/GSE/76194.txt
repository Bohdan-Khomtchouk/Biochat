TITLE
Comparative expression of bone metastasis clones and their parent cells Chinese lung adenocarcinoma cell lines CPA-Yang1, CPA-Yang2, CPA-Yang3, SPC-A-1 and human larger cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 by cRNA array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (CPA-Yang1, CPA-Yang2, CPA-Yang3, SPC-A-1) and human larger cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 were injected into left cardiac ventricle of nude mice for bone metastases clone, respectively. Bone metastatic lesions were detected by bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-methylene diphophonate and X ray. Removed bone metastatic lesions for cell primary culture, chromosome analysis for determine the bone metastatic cells have a characterization of unchanged humanization, in the anesthesia death mice. Through in vivo ~ in vitro selections, the bone-seeking clones 1st, 3th, 4th, 8th, 8th passage cells of CPA-Yang1, CPA-Yang2, CPA-Yang3, SPC-A-1, NCI-H460 and their parent cells were used for microarray analysis, respectively.

DESIGN
Bone-seeking clones 1st, 3th, 4th, 8th, 8th passage cells of CPA-Yang1, CPA-Yang2, CPA-Yang3, SPC-A-1, NCI-H460 by in vivo ~ in vitro selections and their parent cell lines respectively expression by cRNA array. Comparative expression of these biological replicates with osteolytic, osteoblestic, mixed bone metastases and their parent cells respectively.
