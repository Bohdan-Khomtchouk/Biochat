SUMMARY
Identification of the Early Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) Transriptome and its Associated Interactome in Resting Murine CD4 T Cells In an attempt to understand  the biological role of this neuropeptide in the immune system, we choose CD4 T cells  as a cellular system for identifying a VIP-induced transcriptome. Murine CD4 T cells were isolated and used to identify changes in gene expression in the absence of  PMA/ionomycin (resting)  with and without 10-7 M VIP.
