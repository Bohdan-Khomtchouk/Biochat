TITLE
Functional genomic responses to temperature variation in adult Drosophila mojavensis

ORGANISM
Drosophila mojavensis

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome transcription expression level changes in Drosophila mojavensis wild-type populations (1 Punta Onah: PO, 2 Organ Pipe National Monument: OPNM, 3 Punta Prieta:PP, and 4 San Quintin: SQ). The experiment was designed to investigate functional genomic responses to temperature variation (15, 25, and 35 °C) in adult Drosophila mojavensis wild populations. For each treatment 1-5 replicates were used (R1, R2, R3, R4 & R5). SO and BC represents Sonora deserts and Baja California region respectively.

DESIGN
A total of 97 hybridizations were performed in this entire experiment. We used 135K 12-plex NimbleGen arrays. Total RNA was recovered from each sample listed below. The experimental design consisted a total of four populations (Punta Onah:PO; Organ Pipe National Manument:OPNM, Punta Prieta:PP and San Quintin:SQ),  two host diets (Agria:AG and Organ pipe:OP) and three temperature treatments (15, 25 and 35 °C). Each chip measures the expression level of 14528 transcripts. One to 5 replicates were used for each type (R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5). Fly source details are as follows: Punta Onah 2007:PO07; Organ Pipe National Monument 2008:OPNM08; Punta Prieta 2008:PP08; San Quintin 2008:SQ08.
