TITLE
Identification of PARD3 signature on PARD3 deficient H157 cell line, reconstituting the expression of PARD3 gene, with a wt and a mutant form.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To development our gene expression approach, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes potentialy regulated by the polarity protein PAR3. Human SCC cell line, NCI-H157 (H157), has a big deletion at PARD3 locus and showed no PAR3 protein expression. This cell line was used as a model in which we restored the expression of PAR3 (wt or mutant form). Afterwards, this model was used to identify PARD3 signature on Human  SCC.

DESIGN
There are triplicates of each sample. We compare the effects in gene expression between the different situations: no PARD3 expression in the cell, expression of the  mutant form of PARD3 gene and expression of the PARD3 wt form in the cells.
