TITLE
Profiling of gender-regulated gene transcripts in the filarial nematode Brugia malayi by oligonucleotide array analysis

ORGANISM
Brugia malayi

SUMMARY
Microarray technology permits high throughput comparisons of gene expression in different parasite stages or sexes. We now report the first use of this technology for analysis of gene expression in filarial worms. The slide array (comprised of 65 mer oligos representing 3569 EST clusters) was spotted with sequences selected from the extensive Brugia malayi EST database ( ). Arrays were hybridized with male and female cDNA and developed with Cy5- and Cy3-fluorescent 3DNA capture reagents. The experimental design included both biological and technical (dye-flip) replicates. Keywords: repeat sample
