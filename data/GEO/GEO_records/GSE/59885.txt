TITLE
Gene expression in liver-specific insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) and IR/FoxO1 double knockout (LIRFKO) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression was analyzed by gene array in liver RNA collected from 11-12 week old male IR floxed, LIRKO, IR/FoxO1 floxed and LIRFKO mice either a) following an overnight 24 hr fast, b) 60 min after dextrose (2 g/kg ip) was administered to overnight fasted mice, or c) 6 hr after fasted mice were allowed to refeed on standard chow.

DESIGN
LIRKO and and LIRFKO mice were created on a mixed background by crossing C57bl/6 IR floxed (R. Kahn), FVB/N FoxO1 floxed (R. DePinho) and C57Bl/6 albumin-Cre mice (Jackson Lab) and verified by genotyping tail DNA, and PCR and western blotting of liver extracts. Mice were fasted and refed or treated with glucose prior to tissue collection.
