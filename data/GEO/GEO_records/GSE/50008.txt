TITLE
The effect of cell subset isolation method on gene expression in leukocytes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of isolation methods (fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), positive and negative immunomagnetic selection) on gene expression in human primary CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells and monocytes. FACS incurs the least short-term changes in gene expression signature.

DESIGN
This study evaluated the short-term effects on gene expression in four leukocyte subsets (CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells and monocytes) of the three commonly used isolation methods (FACS, positive and negative selection) in order to identify the optimal method for cell isolation for gene expression studies in patient samples where gene expression pertaining to a disease state or treatment is of interest and gene expression caused by cell handing is minimized.
