TITLE
Estrogen receptor regulation of the social transcriptome

ORGANISM
Haplochromis burtoni

SUMMARY
We investigated the gene regulatory network of the estrogen receptor in the preoptic region of dominant and subordinate male Astatotilapia burtoni.  We compared dominant males receiving either an ER antagonist or vehicle control and seperately compared subordinate males receiving either an ER antagonist or control. 8.25% of all genes examined changed expression in DOMs in comparison to only 0.56% in SUBs.
