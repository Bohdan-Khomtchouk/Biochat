TITLE
Gene expression profile of Wharton-jelly mesenchymal stem cells at 12th in vitro expansion cycle compared to Wharton-jelly mesenchymal stem cells at 4th in vitro expansion cycle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are generally considered the main tool box for cell-based therapies and compared to embryonic stem cells (ESCs), MSCs exhibit many advantages. It has been shown that UC matrix (the Wharton’s Jelly surrounding umbilical vessels) contains a great number of mesenchymal cells. The abundant amount of Wharton’s Jelly (WJ) makes it an attractive source of MSCs for cell-based therapies. recently have been highlighted the changes in protein expression profiling during in vitro expansion of WJ-MSC, probably related to the gradual reduction of their staminal plasticity and to the biological cellular mechanism occurring in the cellular aging. The aim of the present work was to analyze the transcriptomic profile useful to the definition of WJ-MSC characteristics and therefore identify possible different new marker candidates. In these contest, changes in gene expression profiles occurring during WJ-MSC in vitro growth wile by analyzed in order to find possible modulation related to their long expansion and fast growth abilities. We analyzed the changes in total RNA expression at the 12th in vitro expansion cycle compared to the 4th in vitro expansion cycle.

DESIGN
In this study we performed gene expression profiles of a total of 6 experiment. Three different cell pools at 12th and 4th in vitro expansion cycles were used (UC2, UCA and UCB). On the total of 6 experiments 3 were biological replicates, 2 technical replicates and 1 dye-swap replicate.
