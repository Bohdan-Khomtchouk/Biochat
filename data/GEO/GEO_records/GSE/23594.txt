TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of dikaryotic colonies of Schizophyllum commune: wild-type, delta-hom2, delta-fst4

ORGANISM
Schizophyllum commune

SUMMARY
The transcription factors Hom2 and Fst4 were shown to be involved in mushroom development in the basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune. When the genes encoding Hom2 or Fst4 were deleted, no mushrooms formed. In this study we performed a genome-wide expression analysis on dikaryons of wild-type, delta-hom2 and delta-fst4.

DESIGN
A total of three samples were analyzed. One wild-type and two deletion strains (delta-hom2 and delta-fst4)
