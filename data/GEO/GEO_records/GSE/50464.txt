TITLE
RNA-Seq and BS-Seq of Sorghum bicolor tissues

ORGANISM
Sorghum bicolor

SUMMARY
This study utilized next generation sequencing technology (RNA-Seq and BS-Seq) to examine the transcriptome and methylome of various tissues within sorghum plants with the ultimate goal of improving the Sorghum bicolor annotation

DESIGN
We examined the mRNA of various Sorghum bicolor (BTx623) tissues (flowers, vegitative and floral meristems, embryos, roots and shoots) and bisulfite treated DNA from two root samples

PLATFORM
GPL13779 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Sorghum bicolor) GPL14790 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Sorghum bicolor)
