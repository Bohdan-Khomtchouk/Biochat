TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of bacterial strains in the cbr/crc regulatory system

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas donghuensis

SUMMARY
We screened a number of virulence genes in Pseudomonas donghuensis HYS, and genes in cbr/crc regulatory system were included. To investigate the relationship between this regulatory system and other virulence genes screened in the study, we performed transcriptome sequencing of strains related to cbr/crc system. Through analyzing the expression quantity, we found that the screened virulence genes were under the regulation of the cbr/crc system.

DESIGN
Analyses of six samples, and two control strains are included

PLATFORM
GPL24459 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Pseudomonas donghuensis)
