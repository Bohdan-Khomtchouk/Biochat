TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of the pest Bactrocera oleae feeding on phenolic rich green olives

ORGANISM
Bactrocera oleae

SUMMARY
The strictly monophagous olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae, represents the major pest of olive orchards worldwide. It has the unique ability to hydrolyze olive proteins as well as to overcome olive defenses, especially the high levels of phenolic compounds present in the green olive mesocarp. In this study, we aimed to identify specific genes potentially implicated in overcoming green olive defense and the utilization of the flesh, by examining larval responses to green olives on the transcript level. Focusing on the up-regulated gene set, we identified two putative serine proteases and one putative UDP-glycosyltransferase possibly associated with these traits. Serine proteases could be involved in the digestion of dietary proteins but also could represent a mechanism to overcome the effect of trypsin inhibitors induced by the olive fruit upon attack. UDP-glycosyltransferase may be implicated in the sequestration and/ or direct detoxification of phenolic compounds highly present in green olives.

DESIGN
Two major comparisons were performed: four biological replicates of green olive reared larvae (GO) were compared to either four biological replicates of black olive reared larvae (BO) or four replicates of artificial diet reared larvae (AD).
