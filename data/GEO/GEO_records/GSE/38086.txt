TITLE
HeLa Cells infected with Shigella in the presence/absence of Staurosporin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Question Addressed: What is the host response (specifically apoptosis pathways) to Shigella infection and what is the contribution of MxiE to the host response? The arrays are apoptosis Exon hit arrays, thus splice variation can be determined.  Array data from HeLa cells that remained Uninfected or were infected with wildtype S. flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T or an isogenic mixE mutant. These groupings are further divided such that Uninfected or Infected cells remained untreated or were treated with the apopotosis inducer staurosporine (STS). The design of the experiment was a time course and samples were harvested at the indicated time points (hr). All hybridizations were conducted against a common reference sample that was made from pooled samples of normal uninfected healthy HeLa cells. Infection: HeLa cells were infected with wt Shigella (wt), mxiE mutant (mixE) or were left uninfected (uninfected) Compound Based Treatment: Cultures were treated with Staurosporin (STS) or were left untreated (untreated) Infection time: Cells were harvested at the indicated time after treatment

DESIGN
20 Samples
