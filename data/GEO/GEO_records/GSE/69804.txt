TITLE
Gene expression analysis of WT, HBZ-Tg, IFNgKO, and HBZ-Tg/IFNg KO mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comprehensive analysis of gene expression in CD4+ T cells of WT, HBZ-Tg, IFNgKO, and HBZ-Tg/IFNg KO mice.

DESIGN
CD4+ T cells were isolated from splenocytes of each strain. From isolated CD4+ T cells, RNAs were extracted and used for microarray analysis.
