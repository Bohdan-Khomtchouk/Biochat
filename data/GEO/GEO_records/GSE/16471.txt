TITLE
Identification of CPK5ac and CPK11ac early target genes in Arabidopsis mesophyll cells

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to identify the early target genes of constitutively activated CPK5ac and CPK11ac in Arabidopsis mesophyll cells that are involved in early flagellin responses important for plant innate immunity. We used the microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying initial calcium responses to microbial associated molecualr patterns (MAMPs).

DESIGN
Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were transfected with plasmid DNA to express constitutively active CPK5ac or CPK11ac for 6 hr.  Transcript profiles were analyzed and compared between cells transfected with control DNA and CPK5ac or CPK11ac DNA to identify early CPK5ac and CPK11ac target genes.
