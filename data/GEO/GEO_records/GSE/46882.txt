TITLE
Expression data from primary isolated colonic epithelial cells from ChopIEC Tg/Tg mice and Chopflox/flox mice as wild-type controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Loss of epithelial cell homeostasis and apoptosis highly con-tribute to intestinal inflammation. While endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR) has been implicated in chronic intestinal inflammation, functional correlation between UPR-related C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression and CHOP-mediated programming towards inflammation-related disease susceptibility remains unclear. In this study, we generated the new mouse model ChopIEC Tg/Tg to investigate consequences of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific CHOP overexpression. Transcriptional profiling of transgenic mice identified a set of CHOP-dependent target genes related to inflammatory and microbial defense program in the intestinal epithelium.

DESIGN
Effect of CHOP overexpression in intestial epithelial cells was investigated on epithelial homeostasis using transgenic mice Disease-free mice do not show enhanced apoptotic signaling Intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from 12 week old females
