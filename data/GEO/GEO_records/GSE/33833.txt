TITLE
Effect of unilateral naris occlusion on gene profile in mouse olfactory mucosa.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Unilateral naris occlusion was performed the day after birth in three FVB strain mice. At 25 days of age olfactory mucosa was collected from open nasal fossa, the occluded nasal fossa and from three untreated mice. Total RNA was extracted and gene profiles among these three treatment conditions were compared. The goal of the study was to determine the effect of stimulus deprivation on the genetic profile of olfactory mucosa.

DESIGN
There were three treatment conditions: open mucosa, occluded mucosa, and untreated mucosa. Each of these conditions had three biological replicates. Open and occluded however were repeated measures i.e. from the same individuals.
