TITLE
FOXA and master transcription factors recruit Mediator and Cohesin to the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Mediator and Cohesin complexes control the cellular transcriptional program. However, it is not well understood how they are recruited to regulatory regions. Our study shows that the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of cancer cells is essential to recruit Mediator, Cohesin and NIPBL to enhancer and promoter regions of actively transcribed genes in cancer cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq analysis of Mediator (MED1), Cohesin (SMC1A) and NIPBL  in HEPG2, A549 and MCF7 cells. The analysis also includes ChIP-Seq data for the transcription factor ERa in MCF7 cells treated with estradiol.
