TITLE
Differential gene expression between WT and ERRa-null hearts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total RNA was isolated from 3 WT and 3 ERRa null hearts and independent hybridizations were performed using MOE430 2.0 microarrays. Expression profiling was conducted to determine changes in gene expression in hearts lacking ERRa. The expression of genes involved in heart and muscle development, muscle contraction, lipid metabolism, OxPhos, protein metabolism and transcription were affected by the loss of ERRa. Keywords: microarray and genetic modification
