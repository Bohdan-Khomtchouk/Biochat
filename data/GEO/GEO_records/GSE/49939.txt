TITLE
Shigella flexneri ntrBC and nac mutant expression analysis

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Investigate whole genome gene expression level changes in an S. flexneri ntrBC and nac mutants compared to wild type strain. NtrBC is a two component regulatory system, nac is a transcriptional activator Mutations in ntrBC and nac result in small plaque formation in Henle cell monolayers compared to wild type bacteria. Gene expression studies were pursued to identify the genes regulated by these transcriptional regulators.
