TITLE
Shigella flexneri ntrBC and nac mutant expression analysis

ORGANISM
Shigella flexneri

SUMMARY
Investigate whole genome gene expression level changes in an S. flexneri ntrBC and nac mutants compared to wild type strain. NtrBC is a two component regulatory system, nac is a transcriptional activator Mutations in ntrBC and nac result in small plaque formation in Henle cell monolayers compared to wild type bacteria. Gene expression studies were pursued to identify the genes regulated by these transcriptional regulators.

DESIGN
A 9 array study using total RNA recovered from the wild type, ntrBC and nac mutant strains in three independent experiments. Bacterial RNA was isolated from infected Henle cells at four hours post-infection. Gene expression from the mutant strains was compared to that of wild type.
