TITLE
Role of 14-3-3 in the transcriptional response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to potassium starvation.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We investigated the transcriptional response of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae bmh1 and bmh2 deletion mutants to potassium starvation. To this end yeast strains were grown for 60 min in media without potassium or in media with a standard potassium concentration (50 mM KCl).  Using Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE)-tag sequencing the effect of potassium starvation on the transcriptome was determined. This study is a follow-up of our previous study (Anemaet IG and van Heusden GPH. 2014. BMC Genomics:1040)( GEO accession number GSE57093).

DESIGN
3 samples of cells grown in media without potassium and 3 samples of cells grown in the presence of potassium were analyzed.
