TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of 5 white Italian grapevine varieties during berry development

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
We report the berry pericarp transcriptomic profiles of 5 white Vitis vinifera varieties: Vermentino, Garganega, Glera, Moscato bianco and Passerina at 4 growth stages: pea-sized berries (Bbch 75) at almost 20 days after flowering, berries beginning to touch (Bbch77) just prior véraison, the softening of the berries (Bbch 85) at the end of véraison and berries ripe for harvest (Bbch 89)

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 5 white grapevine varieties at 4 growth stages were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 1000.
