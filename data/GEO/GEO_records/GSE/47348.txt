TITLE
RNAseq in whole freshwater planarians, Schmidtea mediterranea, following RNAi of the transcription factors lhx1/5-1 and pitx.

ORGANISM
Schmidtea mediterranea

SUMMARY
Freshwater planarians can be used as a model to investigate neuronal function and maintenance in adults in vivo.  We knocked down expression for 2 transcription factors, then sequenced resulting animals to examine transcriptional changes that may have occurred.

DESIGN
There are 3 triplicated conditions:  control(RNAi) using the unc22 gene from C. elegans, lhx1/5-1(RNAi), and pitx(RNAi).  Worms were fed RNAi for each gene 5 times over 12 days then were collected 12 days later.  Approximately 50 million single-end reads were performed on each sample.
