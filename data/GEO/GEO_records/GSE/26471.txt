TITLE
HeLa gene expression profile

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression in HeLa cells was profiled using Affymetrix gene expression Human HG-U133_Plus_2 array.  Transcript signal was mapped against the chromosome coordinates (probe-by-probe basis) using the HG-U133A_2 Annotations CSV file for hg18 build of the human genome provided by Affymetrix. Karnani N, Taylor C, Malhotra A, Dutta A (2007) Pan-S replication patterns and chromosomal domains defined by genome-tiling arrays of ENCODE genomic areas. Genome Res 17: 865-876.

DESIGN
Total RNA from asynchronously growing HeLa cells was isolated and subjected to micrarray analysis for gene expression.
