TITLE
microRNAs involved in regulating embolic stroke recovery following spontaneous reperfusion [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To date, miRNA expression studies on cerebral ischemia in both human and animal models have focused mainly on acute phase of ischemic stroke. In this study, we present the roles played by microRNAs in the spontaneous recovery phases in cerebral ischemia using rodent stroke models.

DESIGN
In this study presented here, Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion stroke model was established by using embolus and the brain samples of stroke model were harvested at 0hrs, 3hrs, 6hrs, 12hrs, 24hrs, 48hrs, 72hrs, 120hrs and 168hrs. RNAs were extracted from these samples and microRNA array and mRNA array were performed.
