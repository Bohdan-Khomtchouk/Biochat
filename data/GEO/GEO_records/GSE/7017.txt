TITLE
Establishment of a predictive clinicogenomic model for FEC100 regimen in node-positive breast cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer is a hugely heterogeneous disease, and markers for disease subtypes and therapy response remain poorly defined. For that reason, we employed a retrospective study in node-positive breast cancer to identify molecular signatures of gene expression correlating with metastatic free survival. Patients were primarily included in FEC100 (fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) arms of two multicentric phase III clinical trials (PACS01 and PEGASE01 - FNCLCC). Data from nylon microarrays containing 8.032 cDNA unique sequences, representing 5.776 distinct genes, have been used to develop a predictive model for treatment outcome. We obtained the gene expression profiles of 150 population-based patients, and used stringent univariate selection technique based on Cox regression combined with principal component analysis to identify signature associated with prognosis and impact of FEC100 chemotherapy. Our work identified a gene-signature of metastatic relapse. Most of the 14 selected genes have a clear role in breast cancer, neoplasia or chemotherapy resistance. Furthermore, we showed the interest of combining transcriptomic data with clinical data into a clinicogenomic model for patients subtyping. The described model adds predictive accuracy to that provided by the well established Nottingham prognostic index or by the genomic predictor alone. Keywords: Gene-expression profiling
