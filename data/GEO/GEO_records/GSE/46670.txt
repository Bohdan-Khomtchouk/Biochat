TITLE
Regulation of gene expression in human T lymphoblastic leukemia Molt4 cells by farnesol

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of Molt4 cells treated with DMCS (vehicle) or farnesol were compared to understand the mechanism by which farnesol induces apoptosis in these cells.

DESIGN
Molt4 cells were treated with 75 uM farnesol for 4 hrs to compare with vehicle-treated Molt4 cells.  RNA from three replicates for each treatment was then isolated for microarray analysis.
