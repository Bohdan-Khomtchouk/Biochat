TITLE
Gene expression profile of hepatic lincRNAs in male mouse liver using nuclear RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in adult male mouse liver was assayed by nuclear RNA-seq, as part of a study of hepatic lincRNAs.

DESIGN
Three independent pools, comprised of nuclear RNA isolated from 4 individual male livers per pool, were prepared and used for RNA-seq.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
