TITLE
Effects of IDH1-R132H on mouse neural stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse neural stem cells were generated from conditional knock-in mice.  Mutant IDH1 is conditionally expressed following expression of Cre-recombinase.  Cre-recombinase was incorporated in vitro via adenoviral-Cre recombinase.  Addtionally, adenoviral-GFP was also used to control for effects of adenoviral infection.  D-2HG, the metabolic product of IDH1-R132H, was detected in cell lines post-cre transduction

DESIGN
A total of three cell lines were used for this study.  Each of the three cell lines were transduced with either adenoviral-GFP (Control) or adenoviral-Cre recombinase (induces expression of mutant IDH).
