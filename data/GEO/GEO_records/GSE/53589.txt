TITLE
Differentiation resistant HPV16-immortalized keratinocytes: Six1 transfected vs. Control.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The overexpression of Six1, a member of the Six family of homeodomain transcription factors, has been found in various human cancers, and is associated with tumor progression and metastasis. We previously determined that the expression of Six1 mRNA increased during in vitro progression of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16)-immortalized human keratinocytes (HKc/HPV16) toward a differentiation-resistant (HKc/DR) phenotype. However, if Six1 promotes HPV16-mediated transformation or not remains unknown. HKc/DR were transfected with a Six1 or control vector and RNA isolated from these cells were used in an Agilent two-color gene expression profiling experiment. The goal was to determine the effects of Six1 on global gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Six1 vs. Control HKc/DR cells. Biological replicates: 4 Six1-transfected replicates and 4 control-transfected replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
