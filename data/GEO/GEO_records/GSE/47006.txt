TITLE
Expression profile and RNA Polymerase II occupancy of transposable elements among knock down of the piRNA pathway components in OSCs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The Piwi–piRNA complex (Piwi–piRISC) in Drosophila ovarian somatic cells represses transposons transcriptionally to maintain genome integrity; however, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. We performed mRNA-seq analysis from OSCs transfected with siRNAs against CG3893, the known piRNA pathway genes, Piwi, Maelstrom, HP1a and Armitage, and the control (EGFP), and PolII ChIP-seqanalysis from OSCs transfected with siRNAs against CG3893, Piwi, Mael and the control (EGFP).  This result indicates that CG3893 is a novel factor for primary piRNA pathway in OSCs.

DESIGN
RNA levels in wild-type (EGFP control knock-down) ovarian somatic cells (OSC) and RNAi knock-downs of Piwi, Armi, Mael, CG3893, and HP1a. RNA Polymerase II occupancy in wild-type (EGFP control knock-down) ovarian somatic cells (OSC) and RNAi knock-downs of Piwi, Mael, and CG3893.
