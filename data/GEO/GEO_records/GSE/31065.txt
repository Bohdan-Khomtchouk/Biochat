TITLE
Population of viral small RNAs expressed in common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) T cells latently infected with Herpesvirus saimiri (strain A11)

ORGANISM
Herpesvirus saimiri (strain 11)

SUMMARY
We report the discovery of six novel miRNAs expressed by Herpesvirus saimiri (strain A11). These miRNAs are generated by a non-canonical biogenesis pathway that does not require the Microprocessor complex.

DESIGN
Examination of one sample prepared from common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) T cells latently infected with Hespesvirus saimiri (strain A11).

PLATFORM
GPL14002 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Herpesvirus saimiri (strain 11))
