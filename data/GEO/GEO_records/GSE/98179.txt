TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Gerbera delavayi based on high-throughput sequencing technology

ORGANISM
Gerbera delavayi

SUMMARY
Gerbera delavayi Franch. endemic to southwest China, is a rare fiber plant. In this study, the leaves of G. delavayi were sequenced based on Illumina Hi-Seq2500. The results showed that 108694 unigenes were found. N50 was 593.90bp, and the mean length was 912bp. By comparing with Nr and Swiss-prot database, 40915 unigenes were annotated, and 67779 unigenes were unannotated. In addition, 30 unigenes had homology with Ces family, 20 unigenes had homology with Cls family, and 11 unigenes had homology with SuSy. 11369 unigenes were assigned to 25 categories with COG database, and 21378 unigenes were divided into 52 GO terms. Function annotation against KEGG database obtained 8087 unigenes and 118 pathways. 47 unigenes were found at “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis” pathway. Furthermore, 4908 unigenes contained 5179 SSRs, 1 SSR occurred every 12.46kb. The largest number of SSR type was mono-nucleotide repeat, and its frequency was 54.37%; the next was di-nucleotide repeat and tri-nucleotide repeat, with the frequencies of 22.90% and 21.70%, respectively. These results greatly enriched the genetic information of G. delavayi, and provided basic data for genetic breeding and exploitation of this unique plant resource.
