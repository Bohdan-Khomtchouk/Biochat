TITLE
In vivo response of microglia to Aβ and prostaglandin-E2 EP2 receptor signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system, perform critical inflammatory and non-inflammatory functions to maintain homeostasis and normal neural function.  However in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), these beneficial functions become progressively impaired, contributing to synapse and neuron loss and cognitive impairment. The inflammatory cyclooxygenase-PGE2 pathway, including the PGE2 receptor EP2, is implicated in AD development, both in human epidemiology and in transgenic models of AD. To test the transcriptional responses of EP2-deficient microglia to Aβ in vivo, we used mice in which the EP2 receptor is conditionally deleted in microglia using the CD11b-Cre transgene and floxed alleles of the EP2 gene. By injecting these mice with Aβ ICV and isolating microglia from the brains, we have been able to establish the transcriptional response of microglia to Aβ in vivo and test how EP2 deletion in microglia affects this response.

DESIGN
8 month-old C57BL/6 mice, of the genotype CD11b-Cre; EP2+/+ or CD11b-Cre; EP2lox/lox, were injected I.C.V. with either Aβ or vehicle. 48 hours after injection, the mice were sacrificed and transcardially perfused with cold heparinized 0.9% NaCl. Brains were then removed from the mice and pooled, two brains of the same genotype per sample, to ensure adequate cell and RNA yield. The brains were then enzymatically dissociated for microglia isolation using the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (P), MACS Separation Columns (LS), and magnetic CD11b Microbeads from Miltenyi Biotec according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immediately after isolating the microglia, RNA was extracted from the cells for microarray analysis.
