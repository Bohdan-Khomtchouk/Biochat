TITLE
Expression data for pharmacogenomics antiplatelet therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Antiplatelet therapy is the most important treatment to reduce the risk of developing recurrent thrombosis, and to prevent progression to a complete occlusion of coronary arterial disease (CAD) patients after percutaneous coronary intervention Aim of study was to investigate the relationship between response to antiplatelet drugs and global mRNA gene expression in peripheral blood cells (PBC) in patients with coronary arterial disease (CAD)

DESIGN
All patients were treated crhonically with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day). Blood samples were drown before PCI to evaluate platelet reactivity by VerifyNowÂ® ASA and P2Y12 assays and mRNA expression was measured by Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST array.
