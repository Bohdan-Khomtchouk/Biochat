TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of Su(var)3-9 distribution in chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Histone modifications represent one of the key factors contributing to proper genome regulation. One of the histone modifications involved in gene silencing is H3K9 methylation, which is found in the chromosomes across different eukaryotes and controlled by SU(VAR)3-9 and its orthologs. Although SU(VAR)3-9 was discovered over two decades ago, little is known about the details of its chromosomal distribution pattern. To fill in this gap, we used DamID-seq approach and obtained high-resolution genome-wide profiles for SU(VAR)3-9 in two somatic and two germline tissues of fruitfly.

DESIGN
DamID-Seq profiling of Su(var)3-9 protein in somatic and germline cells of Drosophila melanogaster. We performed DamID profiling of Su(var)3-9 in male (M) and female (F) salivary glands (SG), larval brains (BR), germline nurse cells (NC) and at the different developmental stages of male germ cells, using testes of bam-, aly-, can-mutants and wild-type testes. For every experiment Dam-alone control was performed. Experiments were performed in replicates.
