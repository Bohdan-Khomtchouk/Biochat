TITLE
Genome-wide binding of condensin II and TFIIIC upon respective knockdown of a TFIIIC and condensin II subunit

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Condensin complexes are highly conserved for chromosome compaction to ensure their faithful segregation in mitosis. However, little is known about the role of condensin complexes in interphase. Condensins exists in two complexes, condensins I and II, in higher eukayotic cells. During interphase, condensin II is predominantly localized in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle, whereas condensin I is localized at the cytoplasm in interphase. The distinct localization patterns suggest that condensin II, but not condensin I, may contribute to genome organization in interphase. Our results suggest that condensin II is associated with TFIIIC complex in vivo. The aim of these experiments is to unravel the dependency of each other on binding to chromatin.
