TITLE
Expression data from mouse embyonic stem cell, neural progenitor and neuron

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The effect of HMGN1 protein on gene expression of mouse ESC, NP and Neurons were investigated by comparing the transcriptome between Hmgn1+/+ and Hmgn1 -/- cells.

DESIGN
three cell types, two genotypes, three reps per sample type
