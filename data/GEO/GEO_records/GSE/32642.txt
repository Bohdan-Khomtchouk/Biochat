TITLE
Identification of quantitative trait loci controlling gene expression during the innate immunity response of soybean

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Microbe associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-responsive genes were identified in leaves of four different genotypes. The genotypes used in this study were: LD0-2817P; LDX01-1-65; Ripley and EF59. Leaves from three-weeks old plants were used in this study We used microarray to identified the MAMP-responsive genes in leaves of four soybean genotypes trated with 1 uM flg22 and 50 ug/ml chitin for 30 minutes

DESIGN
Trifoliolate leaves from three-week-old plants were detached and then vacuumed infiltrated with ddiH2O for 2 min. Water-infiltrated trifoliolate leaves from five different plants of each genotype were pooled and cut into approximately 1 cm2 slices. Equal amount of leaf slices (~30 slices) were transferred into two different Petri dishes and then floated overnight on autoclaved ddiH2O. Water was removed from both Petri dishes and was replaced with 5 ml of MAMP solution [1 mM flagellin 22 (flg22) and 50 mg of crab shell chitin (called in this study as chitin)], or 5 ml of mock solution [autoclaved ddiH2O plus equivalent amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). DMSO was included since it was contained in the solution used to dissolve the flg22 peptide]. After a 30 min treatment, mock- and MAMP-treated leaf slices were harvested into different tubes and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at -80 until use. All procedures described above were performed under dark conditions.
