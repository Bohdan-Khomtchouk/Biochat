TITLE
MicroRNA expression profile of human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with Angiogenin (ANG)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We quantified differential microRNA (miRNA) expression in Human umbilical vein endothelial cells （HUVECs）response to Angiogenin (ANG) treatment.These data were used to determine which miRNAs are altered on ANG in Human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

DESIGN
Each group had a n=2 and ANG response miRNA levels post incubations were compared to no treatment with ANG.
