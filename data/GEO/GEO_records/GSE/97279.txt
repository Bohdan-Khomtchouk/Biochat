TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of rapamycin effect on the glucocorticoid receptor function in human keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rapamycin increased negative effect of glucocorticoid fluocinolone acetonide (FA) on gene expression and blunted gene activation by glucocorticoid FA.

DESIGN
HaCat cells grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum and 1 X Pen/Strep a day prior to the experiemnt were either pre-treated with 1 μM Rapamycin for 6 h followed by 1 μM of FA for additional 24 h (IB4 and IB8) or were treated with 1 μM of FA alone for 24 h (IB2 and IB6). Control cells used for comparison were either treated with DMSO (vehicle control. IB1 and IB5) or 1 μM of Rapamycin (IB3 and IB7). The experiments were performed in duplicates.
