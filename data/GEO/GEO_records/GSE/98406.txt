TITLE
Comparing miRNA Signature of Colon Cancer Primary Tumors to Metastases Formed in the Liver

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide miRNA expression profiling was performed using Affymetric miRNA v. 3.0 Array on 48 samples which included paired FFPE colon tuomor and metastisized liver and paired normal colon, normal liver). The data set was divided into two categories and identified by tissue source and patient demographics: Tissue (Colon, Liver), Source (Colon Tumor Liver Met, Colon Normal, Liver Normal), Sex (Male, Female), Patient Pair. microRNAs (miRs) are frequently dysregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) and subsets are correlated with advanced tumor stage and metastasis. Despite this, the development of prognostic biomarkers that predict metastatic potential remain limited. Our study was designed to identify, validate, and elucidate underlying biology imposed by a miR signature that defines and predicts metastatic disease. Genome-wide miR expression profiling was performed on fourteen patient-matched stage IV primary CRC tumors and corresponding liver metastases using microRNA array technology. Based on these results, this miR panel was then validated and evaluated in normal colon tissue (N = 5), early stage (I & II, N = 11) and late stage (Stage III & IV, N = 14) colorectal primary tumors via qRT-PCR.

DESIGN
General study design included biological replicates and controls. miRNA was isolated from paired FFPE colon tumor and metastasized liver tumor samples derived from the same patient.  Controls were paired normal colon and liver samples from the same patients.  There were 42 samples total including: 28 paired patient colon tumor (14) and liver metastases (14), 14 paired normal colon (7) and normal liver (7).  Thus, biological replicates
