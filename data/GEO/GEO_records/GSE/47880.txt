TITLE
Array-based determination of DNA methylation in children born small for gestational age

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of peripheral blood samples obtained from normal controls and children born SGA. Illumina's HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450.000 CpGs.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 110 samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
