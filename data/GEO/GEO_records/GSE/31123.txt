TITLE
Discovery of genes differentially-expressed in the endothelium of lymph nodes draining metastatic versus non-metastatic tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Metastasis to lymph nodes is an early and prognostically important event in the progression of many human cancers, and is associated with expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D). Changes to lymph node vasculature occur during metastasis, and may establish a metastatic niche capable of attracting and supporting tumor cells. We used microarrays to characterise the molecular profiles of endothelial cells from lymph nodes draining metastatic (VEGF-D-overexpressing) and non-metastatic tumors, and to identify differentially-expressed genes that might have therapeutic or prognostic potential.

DESIGN
Draining lymph nodes of metastatic (VEGF-D-overexpressing) or non-metastatic tumors were pooled from 1-5 mice and enzymatically digested. Lymph nodes draining metastatic tumors were included for the analysis only if macroscopically enlarged, indicating the presence of metastatic cells. After digestion, tumor cells and leukocytes were depleted via immunomagnetic selection, and the resulting lymph node stromal cells were cultured briefly. Podoplanin was then used as a positive immunomagnetic selection marker to enrich for lymphatic and other endothelial cells in the lymph node. RNA was isolated from biological duplicate lymph node endothelial cell (LN EC) preparations and analysed by microarray.
