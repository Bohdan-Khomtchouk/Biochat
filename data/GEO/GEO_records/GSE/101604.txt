TITLE
Antagonistic BMPâ€“cWNT signaling in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis reveals insight into the evolution of mesoderm

ORGANISM
Nematostella vectensis

SUMMARY
Using forward transcriptomics, we show that beta-catenin/Tcf signaling and BMP2/4 signaling provide differential inputs into the cnidarian endomesodermal gene regulatory network (GRN) at the onset of gastrulation (24 h postfertilization) in N. vectensis. Surprisingly, beta-catenin/Tcf signaling and BMP2/4 signaling regulate a subset of common downstream target genes in the GRN in opposite ways, leading to the spatial and temporal differentiation of fields of cells in the developing embryo. Thus, we show that regulatory interactions between beta-catenin/Tcf signaling and BMP2/4 signaling are required for the specification and determination of different embryonic regions and the patterning of the oral?aboral axis in Nematostella.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates for two experimental conditions (Morpholino knockdown of NvBMP2/4, and RNA injection of the dominant negative form of NvTCF) and control dextran injection samples taken at 24 Hours past fertilization.
