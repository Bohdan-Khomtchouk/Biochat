TITLE
Chlamydomonas nonphotosynthetic mutants

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of two nonphotosynthetic nuclear mutants (mcd1-1, mcd1-2) that affect chloroplast RNA stability to identify affected organellar genes (chloroplast and mitochondrial). Further, the photosynthetic suppressor (mcd2-1) that suppresses mcd1-2 was included to determine which genes respond directly to the RNA stabilty phenotype and which respond to the nonphotosynthetic phenotype. Keywords: repeat sample
