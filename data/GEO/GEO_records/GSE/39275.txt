TITLE
tRNA fragment profiling in CLP1 mutant (kinase-dead) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss of CLP1 activity results in the accumulation of novel sets of small RNA fragments derived from aberrant processing of tyrosine pre-tRNA. Such tRNA fragments sensitize cells to oxidative stress-induced p53 activation and p53-dependent cell death.

DESIGN
2 samples, Wt and Clp1(k/k), no replicates

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
