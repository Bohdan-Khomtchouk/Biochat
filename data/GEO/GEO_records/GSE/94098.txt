TITLE
FTO regulates adult neurogenesis through modulating the dynamics of N6-methyladenosine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) is a member of the Fe (II) and oxoglutarate-dependent AlkB oxygenase family, and has been linked to obesity and intellectual disability. However, the role of FTO in neurodevelopment and neurogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we show that FTO is expressed in adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) and neurons, and displays dynamic expression during postnatal neurodevelopment. The loss of FTO leads to the decreased brain size and body weight. We found that FTO deficiency could reduce the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of aNSCs in vivo, which leads to the impaired learning and memory. Given the role of FTO as a demethylase of N6-methyladenosine (m6A), we further performed the genome-wide m6A profiling and observed the dynamic m6A modification during postnatal neurodevelopment. The loss of FTO could lead to the altered m6A modifications on the mRNAs of several key components of BDNF pathway. These results together suggest that FTO play important roles in neurogenesis and learning and memory.

DESIGN
Gene expression analyses were performed on mRNA samples isolated from the hippocampi of adult Fto knockout mice (8-12 weeks old) and age/gender-matched wild-type C57BL/6 mice. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) epitranscriptome profiling was performed on mRNA samples isolated from the hippocampi of 2-week-old and 6-week-old male wild-type C57BL/6 mice.
