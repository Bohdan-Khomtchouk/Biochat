TITLE
Prostaglandin duration required to elicit maximum response on hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a valuable source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for use in allogeneic transplantation. Key advantages of UCB are rapid availability and less stringent requirements for HLA matching.  However, UCB contains an inherently limited HSC count, which is associated with delayed time to engraftment, high graft failure rates and early mortality. 16,16 dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2) was previously identified to be a critical regulator of HSC homeostasis and we hypothesized that a brief ex vivo modulation could improve patient outcomes by increasing the “effective dose” of HSCs. Molecular profiling with Affymetrix GeneChips were used to evaluate if prostgandin is required for the entire 2 hour incubation to elicit the maximum pathway activated gene expression response.

DESIGN
Isolated human CD34+ from umbilical cord blood were incubated ex vivo in Stem Span (SS) media with 10uM 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 for varying amounts of time within a two hour incubation window to evaluate if the entire 120 minutes is required to elicit the maximum pathway activated gene expression response or if shorter incubation times were sufficent.  Total RNA was isolated post incubation and analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays for pathway activation.
