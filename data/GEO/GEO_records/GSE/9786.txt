TITLE
Transcriptional response to PFOA in wild-type and PPARalpha-null mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Toxicogenomic Dissection of the Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Transcript Profile in Mouse Liver: Evidence for the Involvement of Nuclear Receptors PPARalpha and CAR We performed a toxicogenomics dissection of the transcript profiles in the mouse liver after exposure to PFOA.  We uncovered classes of genes that were regulated independently of PPARalpha.  Some of these genes, including those involved in lipid metabolism, may be regulated by PPARbeta/delta or PPARgamma, whereas others, such as those involved in xenobiotic metabolism are likely regulated through CAR. Keywords: toxicogenomic analysis

DESIGN
129S1/SvlmJ wild-type and PPARalpha-null mice were exposed to 3 mg/kg/day PFOA or water for 7 days.  Total RNA was isolated from liver samples and gene expression analyzed using Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 GeneChips.  Data from 16 samples, with four mice in each of the 4 treatment groups, were analyzed.
