TITLE
Effect of dietary vitamin B6 on white adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse white adipose tissues The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between vitamin B6 activity and chronic inflammation of white adipose tissue in mice fed a high-fat diet. Twenty-four CD-1 mice were divided into two groups (n = 12) and fed either a 1 mg pyridoxine (PN) HCl /kg diet or a 35 mg PN HCl /kg diet for 8 weeks. We isolated total RNA from epididymal white adipose tissue of each group and compared gene expression profiles by DNA microarray data analysis.
