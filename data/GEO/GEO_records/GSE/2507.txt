TITLE
Cardiac and skeletal muscle gene expression profiles in dysferlin deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dysferlin is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. However, dysferlin deficiency, namely limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) and Myoshi myopathy, results in skeletal muscle weakness and spares the heart. This dichotomy could be caused by differential regulation of protective mechanisms. Therefore, we compared intraindividual mRNA expression profiles between cardiac and skeletal muscle in dysferlin-deficient SJL/J mice  and normal C57BL/6 mice. Keywords: parallel sample
