TITLE
Whole transcriptome sequencing in 274 glioma patients reveals gene fusion profiling and novel candidate fusion genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We detected fusion genes in 274 fresh surgical samples of gliomas using whole transcriptome sequencing. Using this approach we screened a panel of glioma samples and identified a number of activating novel fusion transcripts.
