TITLE
Gene expression analysis between the pancreatic tissues of Pdx1-cre;Kras LSL-G12D and Pdx-cre;KrasLSL-G12D;IKK2/beta F/F mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Constitutive Kras and NF-kB activation is identified as signature alterations in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here, we report that pancreas-targeted IKK2/beta inactivation inhibited NF-kB activation and completely suppressed PDAC development. Our findings demonstrated that NF-kB is required for development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that was initiated by Kras activation.

DESIGN
Pancreatic tissue from 4 groups of mice were used in this project: (1) the pancreas normal appearance of Pdx1-cre;KrasLSL-G12D;IKK2/beta mice, (2) the normal pancreas of Pdx1-cre;KrasLSL-G12D mice, (3) the pancreatic lesion of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) of Pdx1-cre;KrasLSL-G12D mice, and (4) the pancreatic lesion of PDAC of Pdx1-cre;KrasLSL-G12D mice. Each group included three mice. RNA samples from mouse pancreas were hybridized on GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix). Group (1) and group (2) were compared, and group (2), group (3) and group (4) were compared.
