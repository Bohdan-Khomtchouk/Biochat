TITLE
Fasting response of mouse brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of fasting-induced change of metabolites in mice confirmed that glucose level was reduced in the liver, but unaffected in the brain of fasted mice. To explore molecular mechanisms for the preferential glucose supply to the brain upon fasting, we compared gene expression profiles of the brain between fasted and fed mice. Gene ontology (GO) term analysis revealed the enrichment of one GO term, “active membrane transporters activity”. We also showed that fasting enhances the expression of a glucose transporter Slc2a1 (Glut1) gene.

DESIGN
Mice were fasted or fed for 17 hrs, and their brains were dissected for microarray analysis
