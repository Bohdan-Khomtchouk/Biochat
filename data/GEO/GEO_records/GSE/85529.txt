TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of four DLD1 colorectal cancer cell derivatives that recapitulate EMT/MET transitions during metastasis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation profiling of four DLD1 colorectal cancer cell derivatives that recapitulate EMT/MET transitions during metastasis. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from four DLD1 colorectal cancer cell line derivatives were analyzed with the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip
