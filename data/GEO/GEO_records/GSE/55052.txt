TITLE
Study of the impact of G9a on DNA methylation in mouse embryonic cells [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We explored the role of the lysine-methyltrasferase G9a in the control of DNA methylation during mouse embryogenesis. We provide maps of cytosine methylation by MeDIP and RRBS in G9a-deficient mouse embryos and ES cells, as well as ChIP-Seq profiles for H3K9me2 in embryos and RNA-Seq expression profiles in G9a-deficient embryos.

DESIGN
We mapped DNA methylation by MeDIP in WT and G9aKO E9.5 embryos. Experiments were performed in triplicates, and MeDIP and Input samples were hybridized to Nimblegen HD2 mm9 promoter deluxe arrays covering 12 kb of all gene promoters.
