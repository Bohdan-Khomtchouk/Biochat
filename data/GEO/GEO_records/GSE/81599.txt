TITLE
A long noncoding RNA regulates sister chromatid cohesion [microarray]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have appeared to be involved in the most diverse cellular processes through multiple mechanisms. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized human lncRNA, CONCR (cohesion regulator noncoding RNA), transcriptionally activated by MYC, which is upregulated in multiple cancer types. The expression of CONCR is cell cycle-regulated, and it is required for cell cycle progression and DNA replication. Moreover, cells depleted of CONCR show severe defects in sister chromatid cohesion, suggesting an essential role for CONCR in cohesion establishment during cell division. CONCR interacts with and regulates the activity of DDX11, a DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase involved in DNA replication. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of action for CONCR in the modulation of DDX11 enzymatic activity, unveiling the direct involvement of a lncRNA in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.

DESIGN
Characterization of the function of the long noncoding RNA CONCR. A549 were transfected with a control siRNA or with a combination of two siRNAs targeting CONCR. Three independent siRNA-mediated knockdowns (siRNA CONCR REP1, 2 and 3) and controls (siRNA Control REP1, 2 and 3) were used for the analysis.
