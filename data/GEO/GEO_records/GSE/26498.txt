TITLE
The prior probability can derive the variety in the interpretation of p-value

SUMMARY
In contrast to its common definition and calculating process, interpretations of p-value differ among statisticians. Since p-value is the basis of various methodologies, this divergence has led to distinct test methodologies as well as various opinions for evaluating test results, producing a chaotic situation. Here the origin of the divergence is found in the differences among Pr(H0 = true), which gives a prior probability in the definition of p-values. Effects of differences in the prior probability on the character of p-values are investigated by comparing microarray data and random numbers as subjects. The summarized levels the genes are presented in the matrix files (linked below as supplementary files). Student t-test was applied between the two groups (0h and 14d): p-values presented in the matrix files.
