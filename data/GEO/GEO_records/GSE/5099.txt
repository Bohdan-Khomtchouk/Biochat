TITLE
Expression Data from Macrophage Maturation and Polarization Experiment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Monocytes were induced to mature to macrophages with M-CSF. Cells were then activated with  Interferon gamma and LPS or IL-4.

DESIGN
Freshly isolated monocytes were cultured in the presence of M-CSF (100 ng/ml) for 7 days, and then activated. The study includes Monocytes at day 0, macrophages at day 3 and 7, Interferon Gamma and LPS treated macrophages and IL-4 treated macrophages.
