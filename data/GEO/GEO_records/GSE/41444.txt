TITLE
Airn transcriptional overlap but not its lncRNA products induce imprinted Igf2r silencing.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To test if the imprinted long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Airn transcription or its product silences the protein-coding Igf2r gene, we shortened the endogenous lncRNA to four different lengths by inserting polyadenylation (polyA) cassettes on the paternal chromosome via homologous recombination in ES cells. ES cell differentiation was used to recapitulate the developmental onset of Airn and Igf2r imprinted expression and polyA cassettes inserted before (T3, T16, T27) or after (T31, T51) the Igf2r promoter successfully truncated Airn, with the exception of T27. RNA hybridization to a tiling array (MIRTA) demonstrated loss of Airn upstream of the Igf2r promoter (except T27) and absence of novel spliced variants in all truncation alleles. To further test the transcriptional overlap model we moved the Airn promoter ~700bp before the Igf2r TSS in ES cells that lack an endogenous paternal Airn promoter and called this cell line FAP (Forward-Airn-Promoter). RNA hybridization to a tiling array (MIRTA) demonstrated that the moved Airn promoter expresses Airn in wildtype orientation and terminates at the wildtype 3' end.

DESIGN
ES cell lines expressing different Airn variants were differentiated on gelatinized dishes after feeder cell depletion and LIF withdrawal by 0.27ÂµM retinoic acid for 5 days and Airn length was assayed.
