TITLE
Gene expression profiling of paracancerous tissues of human lung squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our group previously reported the gene expression profiles of four stages of human lung development, and the expression of one group of genes (PTN1 genes) steadily decreased during lung development, the data included four stages of human lung development and 69 lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) samples, and their gene expression profile data are available in the GEO (GSE43767). Our group has already performed another study with 69 lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tissues, the gene expression profile data are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE67061). In the present study, we performed the whole genome gene expression mircroarray of 60 paracancerous tissues of human lung squamous cell carcinoma, we aim to show expression characteristics of PTN1 genes during the four lung developmental stages and in lung ADC, lung SCC and paracancerous samples. We examined the prognostic value of the PTN1 genes in five independent lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and five squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) microarray datasets and revealed that the expression of PTN1 genes was associated with survival in lung ADC patients but had no prognostic value for lung SCC.

DESIGN
A total of 60 paracancerous tissue samples from lung squamous cell carcinoma patients were profiled by Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K .
