TITLE
Regulation of Activation-Associated MicroRNA Accumulation Rates during Monocyte-to-Macrophage Differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled miRNA expression using TaqMan TLDA assays to identify miRNAs with expression levels that were affected by differences in culturing conditions during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation.

DESIGN
9 samples: 3 sample types for 3 different human donors

PLATFORM
