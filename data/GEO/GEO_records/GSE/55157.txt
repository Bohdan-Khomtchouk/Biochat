TITLE
Epigenome signatures during gastric carcinogenesis based on next generation sequencing analysis [MBD-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Because gastric cancer cells already had genetic and epigenetic alterations which can affect the gastric carcinogenesis, we tried to characterize genetic and epigenetic changes during gastric carcinogenesis. To do this, we performed MBD sequencing and RRBS sequencing.

DESIGN
MBD and RRBS sequencing of gastric mucosa, intestinal metaplasia, and gastric cancer cells from one patient were generated by NGS using Illumina GAII.

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
