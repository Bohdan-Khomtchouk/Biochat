TITLE
Atlantic Salmon Macrophage Study

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
MicroPoly(A)Pure kits (Ambion) were used to prepare mRNA from P. salmonis-infected and control Atlantic salmon macrophages. Infected and control (24 h incubation) macrophage mRNA samples were subjected to two rounds of amplification using the MessageAmp aRNA kit (Ambion) and manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 400 ng of macrophage mRNA was used as template in the first round of amplification, yielding 8.1 ug of infected macrophage aRNA and 7.8 ug of control macrophage aRNA. Approximately 1 ug of first-round macrophage aRNA was used as template in the second round of amplification, yielding 81.2 ug of infected macrophage aRNA and 83.3 ug of control macrophage aRNA. Infected and control macrophage aRNA samples were visualized on agarose gels to check quality and quantity. Except for the amounts of aRNA and reverse transcription (RT) primer used, macrophage target labeling reactions and microarray hybridizations were identical. Macrophage target syntheses used 5 ug of second-round aRNA and 5 ug of random primers (Roche). RT primers were mixed with aRNA samples, and nuclease-free H2O (Invitrogen) was added to make 10 ul total volume. Samples were incubated at 70 degrees C 4 min, then placed on ice. RT reactions included 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 0.2 mM dTTP, 0.05 mM Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham), 40U RNAguard ribonuclease inhibitor (Amersham), and 400U Superscript II Rnase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). RT reactions were incubated at 42 degrees C for 2.5 h, followed by addition of 0.025U RNase A (Sigma) and 1.5U RNase H (New England BioLabs) and incubation at 37 degrees C for 30 min. Labeled targets were cleaned using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and precipitated, with 300 mM sodium acetate, 1 ul of 20 ug/ul glycogen (Invitrogen), and 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol, at -20 degrees C overnight. Each labeled target was recovered by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 4 degrees C, 1 h), washed in 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in 60 ul of hybridization buffer: 50% deionized formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 5 ul of 5 ug/ul oligo dT (5'T18[Q-N]3'), 5 ul of 2 ug/ul BSA (Pierce), and 2 ul of 10 ug/ul sonicated human placental DNA (Sigma). Targets were incubated at 96 degrees C for 3 min, and then at 65 degrees C until applied to microarrays. Microarrays were prepared for hybridization by washing 2 X 5 min in 0.1% SDS, washing 5 X 1 min in MilliQ H2O, immersing 3 min in 95 degrees C MilliQ H2O, and drying by centrifugation (2000 rpm, 5 min, in 50 ml conical tube). Microarray hybridizations were run in the dark under HybriSlips hybridization covers (Grace Biolabs) in slide hybridization chambers (Corning) submerged in a 45 degrees C water bath for 16 h. Coverslips were floated off in 45 degrees C (1X SSC, 0.2% SDS), and arrays were washed 1 X 10 min in 45 degrees C (1X SSC, 0.2% SDS), 3 X 4 min in room temperature (0.1X SSC, 0.1% SDS), and 4 X 4 min in room temperature 0.1X SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation as before. Fluorescent images of hybridized arrays were acquired immediately at 10 um resolution using ScanArray Express (PerkinElmer). The Cy3 and Cy5 cyanine fluors were excited at 543 nm and 633 nm respectively, and the same laser power (90%) and photomultiplier tube (PMT) settings were used for all slides in a study (PMT 72 Cy3, PMT 63 or 64 Cy5 for macrophage study). Fluorescent intensity data were extracted from TIF images using Imagene 5.5 software (Biodiscovery). Keywords: other
