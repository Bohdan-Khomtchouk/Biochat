TITLE
Xenomicrobiota transplant experiment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gut microbes elicit specific changes in gene expression in the colon of mice. We colonized germ-free mice with microbial communities from the guts of humans, zebrafish and termites, human skin and tongue, soil and estuarine microbial mats. We used microarrays to detail the differences in global gene expression in colon tissue that are caused by the different microbial communities 28 days after gavage into the germfree animal.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates per group, male C57BL/6 mice (12-16 weeks old)

PLATFORM
