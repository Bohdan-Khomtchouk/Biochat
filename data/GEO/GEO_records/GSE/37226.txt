TITLE
LMN-1-DamID in N2 and set-25(n5021) met-2(n4256) mutant early C. elegans embryos

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We asked if the perinuclear position of chromosome arms in C. elegans depends on the histone methyltransferases MET-2 and SET-25. To this end, we performed LMN-1-DamID in wild-type (N2) and mutant (set-25 met-2) strains. LMN-1-DamID signal on chromosome arms was significantly reduced in the mutant.

DESIGN
Three biological replicas were performed for each genotype. For one replica dyes were swapped. For each replica methylated DNA amplified from a strain expressing LMN-1-Dam was competitively hybridized against DNA amplified from a strain expressing GFP-Dam.
