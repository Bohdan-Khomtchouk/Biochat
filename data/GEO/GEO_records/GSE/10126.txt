TITLE
The genome of Streptomyces rimosus shows a novel structure compared to other Streptomyces

ORGANISM
Streptomyces rimosus ; Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)

SUMMARY
This study compared the genome of Streptomyces rimosus rimosus against that of Streptomyces coelicolor. It also compared 4 strains with changes in oxytetracycline production and derived from G7, the type strain, against G7. Keywords: Comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Duplicate samples, each replicate may be found in the corresponding supplementary file for the Sample

PLATFORM
