TITLE
Global expression profile in a combined study in low grade meningiomas and schwannomas shows upregulation in PDGF, CDH1, SLIT2 and MET.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Schwannomas and grade I meningiomas are non-metastatic neoplasms that shares the common mutation of gene NF2. They usually appear in Neurofibromatosis type 2 patients. Currently, there is no drug treatment available for both tumors, so the use of wide expression technologies is crucial to find those therapeutic targets. Methodology: Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST was used to test global gene expression in 22 meningiomas, 31 schwannomas and, as non-tumoral controls, 3 healthy meningeal tissues, 8 non-tumoral nerves and 1 primary Schwann cells culture. A non-stringent P-cutoff and fold change were used to establish deregulated genes. Results and discussion: We found a subset of genes that were upregulated in meningiomas and schwannomas when compared to their respectively healthy tissue, including PDGFD, CDH1, SLIT2 and MET. Thus, those genes could be more thoroughly studied as targets in a possible combined treatment.
