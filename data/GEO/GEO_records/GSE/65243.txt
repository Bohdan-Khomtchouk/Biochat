TITLE
Leukocyte gene expression in a model of perceived social isolation (PSI)

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Differences in basal leukocyte gene expression profiles in macaques classified as showing low, moderate, or high behavioral indications of perceived social isolation (PSI)

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was carried out on peripheral blood mononuclear cell RNA samples collected from 56 adult rhesus macaques classified as showing low, medium, or high behavioral indicators of PSI.  Some analyses additionally controlled for age and RNA indicators of major leukocyte subsets (CD3E, CD3D, CD4, CD8A, CD19, FCGR3A/CD16, NCAM1/CD56, CD14).
