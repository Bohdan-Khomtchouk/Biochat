TITLE
Differential gene expression following SCI in trkB.T1 null

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We asked what genes are significantly differentially regulated in the spinal cord of SCI trkB.T1 WT and trkB.T1 KO mice. TrkB.T1 is upregulated shortly after SCI although the precise mechanisms underyling this upregulation are poorly understood. In the trkB.T1 null, we show less mechanical allodynia and better locomotor recovery following SCI. The microarray studies helped us to elucidate a signaling pathway that is differently regulated in the WT versus KO mice at 1 day after SCI. In this study, we did not examine gene changes within a genotype after SCI. Rather, we examined DGE by genotype at each time point.

DESIGN
Spinal cord tissue from WT and KO mice in a sham condition (intact spinal cord) versus 1D, 3D and 7D following SCI was harvested for microarray analyses.
