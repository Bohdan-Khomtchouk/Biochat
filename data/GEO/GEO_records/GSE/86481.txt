TITLE
Expression analysis of the genes induced by Ascophyllum nodosum extract in the presence of salinity stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Ascophyllum nodosum extract induced salinity tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying ANE mediated salinity tolerance in the Arabidopsis thaliana

DESIGN
Arabidopsis was initially exposed to 150 mM NaCl for 24 hours, after which plants were treated with either the methanol extract of A. nodosum (MEA) or the ethyl acetate sub-fraction of A. nodosum (EAA).
