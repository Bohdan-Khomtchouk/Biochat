TITLE
AIP inactivation leads to pituitary tumorigenesis through defective GÎ±i-cAMP signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene-level expression profiles of 7 Aip knock-out (triplicates from each) and 9 Aip wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines were studied using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Arrays

DESIGN
All samples were quantile-normalized by the RMA method (Robust Multichip Average) using re-mapped gene annotations from Brainarray Custom CDF files (MoEx10stv1, Version 14.1.0, ). A 2-way ANOVA was constructed to identify genes that differentially expressed between KO and WT samples. False discovery rate control (FDR) with Benjamini and Hochberg method was used to correct for multiple testing
