TITLE
Intrathymic T-cell selection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparisons between untreated primary cells T-cell precursors from the thymus. CD69- thymocytes are from Zap70-deficent mice and are > 95% CD4+CD8+. These cells fail to generate intrathymic TCR signals as a result of their lacking Zap70 molecules, and are thus representative of " preselection " CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. The CD69hi population comes from wildtype mice and is heterogeneous for CD4 and CD8 expression. These cells have been intrathymically TCR-signaled and are undergoing selection. Keywords: other
