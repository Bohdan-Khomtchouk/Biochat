TITLE
Role of small RNA in post-natal olfactory bulb neurogenesis in mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed deep-sequencing analysis of small RNA extracted from neuronal progenitors at different developmental stages. The RNA samples were extracted from microdissected tissues of dorsal or lateral sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) (to analyze the immature progenitor pools), of rostral migration stream (RMS) (to analyze the migrating neuroblasts) or of olfactory bulbs (OB) (to analyze both immature and mature neurons). These tissues were dissected from animals at variable ages: P1 and P6 for SVZ samples, P15 and P28 for RMS and OB samples.

DESIGN
Expression profile of microRNA  in time and space along post-natal neurogenesis

PLATFORM
GPL14602 AB SOLiD 4 System (Mus musculus)
