TITLE
Characterization of Nicotiana attenuata plants with reduced expression of lectin receptor kinase 1 (ir-lecRK1 plants).

ORGANISM
Nicotiana attenuata

SUMMARY
Identification of transcripts that change expression in Nicotiana attenuata plants with reduced expression of lectin receptor kinase 1 after elicitation with oral secretions of Manduca sexta larvae.

DESIGN
Gene expression in leaves of Nicotiana attenuata wild type and ir-lecRK1 plants was measured at 1 hour after elicitation with oral secretions of Manduca sexta larvae. Three independent experiments were performed with wild type plants and three independent experiments were performed with ir-lecRK1 plants. A total of 148 genes were identified as differentially regulated in ir-lecRK1 plants compared to wild type plants.
