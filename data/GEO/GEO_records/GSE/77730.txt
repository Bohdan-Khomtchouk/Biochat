TITLE
DNA IP for 5hmC modified CpGs in the liver of control mice and a Tet1 -/- mouse liver [hmeDIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Through the analysis of mouse liver tumours promoted by distinct routes (DEN exposure alone, DEN exposure plus non-genotoxic insult with phenobarbital and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease); we report that the cancer associated hyper-methylated CGI events in mice are also predicated by silent promoters that are enriched for both the DNA modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and the histone modification H3K27me3 in normal liver. During cancer progression these CGIs undergo hypo-hydroxymethylation, prior to subsequent hyper-methylation; whilst retaining H3K27me3. A similar loss of promoter-core 5hmC is observed in Tet1 deficient mouse livers indicating that reduced Tet1 binding at CGIs may be responsible for the epigenetic dysregulation observed during hepatocarcinogenesis. Consistent with this reduced Tet1 protein levels are observed in mouse liver tumour lesions. As in human, DNA methylation changes at CGIs do not appear to be direct drivers of hepatocellular carcinoma progression in mice. Instead dynamic changes in H3K27me3 promoter deposition are strongly associated with tumour-specific activation and repression of transcription. Our data suggests that loss of promoter associated 5hmC in diverse liver tumours licences DNA methylation reprogramming at silent CGIs during cancer progression.

DESIGN
We carry out 5-hydroxymethylation DNA immunoprecipitation (hmeDIP) prior to sequencing Ion Proton P1 to report on the genome-wide 5hmC patterns. Heterozygote pairs of Tet1 B6;129S4-Tet1tm1.1Jae/J mice were  bought from The Jackson Laboratory (Maine USA). Heterozygotes were interbred to produce homozygous knock out males with colony mate wild type controls. Genome-wide 5hmC patterns were generated by hydroxymethyl-DNA immuoprecipitation (hmeDIP) followed by genome wide sequencing on the Ion Proton P1 sequencer.
