TITLE
Global Identification of SYT-SSX2 Downstream Genes using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established human pluripotent stem cell (PSC) lines expressing Synovial Sarcoma-specific oncogene, SYT-SSX2, under the control of doxycycline with dose- and time-dependent manner. Gene expression profiles were analyzed to identify early response genes of SYT-SSX2.

DESIGN
SYT-SSX2-inducible PSC lines including two hESCs and one hiPSC were analyzed at several time points (0, 6, 12, 18, 24 hours) after doxycycline treatment.
