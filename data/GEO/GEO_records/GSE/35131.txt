TITLE
Identification of miRNA from Cyprinus carpio by high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis

ORGANISM
Cyprinus carpio

SUMMARY
Common carp is one of the main commercial fishes captured and cultured worldwide. Although common carp genome is not finished yet, this study provides a first large scale cloning and characterization of common carp miRNAs and their potential targets. These miRNAs add to the growing database of new miRNA and lay the foundation for further understanding of miRNA function in gene regulation of common carp.

DESIGN
We constructed a small RNA library from 17 Cyprinus carpio samples.
