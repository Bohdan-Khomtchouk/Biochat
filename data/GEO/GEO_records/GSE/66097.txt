TITLE
Identification of genes associated with the astrocyte-specific gene Gfap during astrocyte differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chromosomes and genes are non-randomly arranged within the mammalian cell nucleus. Clustering of genes is of great significance in transcriptional regulation. However, the relevance of gene clustering in their expression during differentiation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) into astrocytes remains unclear. We performed a genome-wide enhanced circular chromosomal conformation capture (e4C) to screen genes associated with an astrocyte-specific gene, glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap), during astrocyte differentiation. We identified 13 genes that were specifically associated with Gfap and expressed in NPC-derived astrocytes. These results provide evidence for functional significance of gene clustering in transcriptional regulation during NPCs differentiation.

DESIGN
comparison of NPCs vs LIF+ vs LIF- cells.
