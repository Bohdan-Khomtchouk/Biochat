TITLE
Gene expression profiles of COPD and nonCOPD small airway epithelia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles in this submission were part of an integrative DNA methylation and gene expression integrative study. The goal of this study was to determine whether DNA methylation patterns were disrupted in small airway epithelia of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) compared to airways from subjects with normal lung function. No subject has cancer or asthma at time of collection. Corresponding DNA methylation profiles for these subjects can be found at GSE55454. We concluded that methylation alterations in COPD airways may underlie disease-specific gene-expression changes (such as the Nrf2 oxidative response pathway).

DESIGN
RNA isolated from bronchial brushings was processed and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. DNA isolated from these same samples can be found at GSE55454
