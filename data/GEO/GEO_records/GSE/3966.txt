TITLE
Expression comparison of GAS M3 strains MGAS315 & MGAS9887 in exponential growth

ORGANISM
Streptococcus sp. 'group A'

SUMMARY
Epidemiological data indicate that strains MGAS315 and MGAS9887 differ significantly in their capacity to cause necrotizing fasciitis infections.  To probe the hypothesis that this difference was associated with differences in gene expression, an expression MA comparison of the strains in exponential phase growth in rich media was conducted. Keywords: strain comparison

DESIGN
For statistical robustness in comparing the strains, total RNA was isolated from 3 independent growths (3 biological replicates), split into 2 samples (2 technical replicates) for a total of 6 replicates per strain, and 12 total samples for the investigation.
