TITLE
Expression comparison of GAS M3 strains MGAS315

ORGANISM
Borreliella burgdorferi

SUMMARY
Epidemiological data indicate that strains MGAS315 and MGAS9887 differ significantly in their capacity to cause necrotizing fasciitis infections.  To probe the hypothesis that this difference was associated with differences in gene expression, an expression MA comparison of the strains in exponential phase growth in rich media was conducted. Keywords: strain comparison
