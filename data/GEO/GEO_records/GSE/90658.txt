TITLE
Expression data from J774A.1 mouse macrophages after neuropeptide-FF (NPFF) treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We treated 80% confluent J774A.1 macrophages with 1 nM neuropeptide-FF (NPFF) for 18 h. We used microarray as an explorative approach to recognize effects of NPFF on macrophages.

DESIGN
J774A.1 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 with 10% FCS, to reach 80% confluence.
