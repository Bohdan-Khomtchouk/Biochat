TITLE
The long noncoding RNA expression profile of hepatocellular carcinoma identified by microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the potential involvement of lncRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) oncogenesis, we conducted lncRNA and mRNA profiling in 3 pairs of human HCC and adjacent normal tissue (NT) by microarray. With abundant probes accounting for 33,045 lncRNAs and 30,215 coding transcripts in our microarray, the number of lncRNAs and coding transcripts that could be detected here is 10,149 and 14,944, respectively. From the data, thousands of lncRNAs and mRNAs were found to bedifferentially expressed (Fold Changeâ‰¥2.0) in HCC tissues compared with NT and identified 624 lncRNAs and 1050 mRNAs were differentially expressed in all three HCC tissues.Bioinformatic analysis (gene ontology, pathway and network analysis) was performed for further study of these differentially expressed mRNAs.By qRT-PCR analysis in nineteen pairs HCC and adjacent normal tissues, we found that eightl ncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in HCC compared with corresponding NT, which is consistent with microarray data. Additionally, change trends of seven lncRNAs were basically identical to their nearby coding genes.

DESIGN
In this study, to explore the potential involvement of lncRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) oncogenesis, we conducted lncRNA and mRNA profiling in 3 pairs of human HCC and adjacent normal tissue (NT) by microarray.
