TITLE
Gene expression profiles in human oral squamous cell carcinoma tissues and cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Common overexpressing genes were identified in all human oral squamous cell carcinoma tissues and/or cultured cells.

DESIGN
Ten oral squamous cell carcinoma tissues and 10 human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were analyzed. Three normal oral mucosa tissues and a human non-neoplastic keratinocyte cell lines were used as control samples.
