TITLE
Expression data from AEG-1fl/fl and AEG-1DHEP mice which have conditional hepatocyte-specific knockout of AEG-1 (Astrocyte elevated gene 1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
AEG-1 is overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and positively regulates development and progression of HCC A conditional hepatocyte-specific knockout mouse was generated by crossing floxed AEG-1 mouse with Alb/Cre mouse in C57BL/6 background

DESIGN
Livers were harvested from chow-fed 12 wks old AEG-1fl/fl and AEG-1DHEP mice. RNA was extracted and subjected to RNA-Seq.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
