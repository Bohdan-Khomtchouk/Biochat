TITLE
BCL11B DNA binding sites in progenitor and differentiated populations in the human thymus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To define binding targets during thymopoiesis on a genome wide scale, we performed ChIP-Seq for BCL11B on two cell types isolated from the human thymus: the CD34+ progenitors and the more differentiated CD34- cells

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq for BCL11B binding was done on CD34+ and CD34- cells isolated from human thymus (n=2 biological replicates per cell type)
