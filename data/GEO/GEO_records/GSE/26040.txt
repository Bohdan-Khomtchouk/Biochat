TITLE
Relationship between gene body DNA methylation and intragenic H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 chromatin marks

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of cross talk of epigenetic marks in HBEC by using tilling arrays chr19. In Human Bronchial epithelia cells (HBEC), H3K9me3, H4K20me3, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3 and DNA methylation were profiled. In these cells, DNA methylation status was analyzed by MIRA and UnmethylCollector (UMC). Study of epigenetic changes in HCT116 DNMT1-/- and DNMT3b -/- (HCT116-DKO) in comparison to intact HCT116. In HCT116 and HCT116-DKO, H3K9me3,  H3K36me3 and DNA methylation were profiled. In these cells, DNA methylation status was analyzed by MIRA. Analysis of epigenetic changes caused by siRNA for SED2 transcript in HBEC. In HBEC and SETD2 siRNA HBEC, H3K36me3 and DNA methylation were profiled. In these cells, DNA methylation status was analyzed by MIRA.
