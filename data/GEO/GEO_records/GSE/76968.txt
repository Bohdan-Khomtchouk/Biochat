TITLE
Myelin-allied gene expression profile of adult neural progenitors shortly after onset of differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Spontaneous neural repair from endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) occurs in response to central nervous system (CNS) injuries or diseases to only a limited extent from endogenous NSCs niches. Uncovering the mechanisms that control neural repair and can be further manipulated to promote towards oligodendrocyte progenitors cells (OPCs) and myelinating oligodendrocytes is a major objective. Our aim was to identify myelin specific transcriptional regulators amongst large transcriptional changes shortly after differentiation of neural stem cells from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult mice

DESIGN
SVZ-NSCs from adult mice were differentiated for 12 and 24 h in absence of growth factor (bFGF, EGF) and subjected for gene array as compared with undifferentiated NSCs cultured in presence of growth factors (n=5 samples per condition).
