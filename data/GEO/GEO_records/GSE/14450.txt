TITLE
Genome-wide direct targets of PIL5 (ChIP-chip analysis of PIL5)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
PIL5 is a key negative regulator of phytochrome mediated seed germination and PIL5 protein is degraded by red light irradiation through phytochrome. The ChIP-chip analysis aimed to find various PIL5 direct targets in the Arabidopsis genome.

DESIGN
PIL5-myc over-expressed seeds were used for ChIP-chip analysis. Conventional ChIP DNA was amplified by using LM-PCR method. Input DNA (before immuno-precipitation) was used as control DNA.Total three biological replicates were used for the ChIP-chip analysis.
