TITLE
Transcripts induced by exposure to SLE serum in healthy blood monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Monocytes from 3 healthy donors were cultured for 6 hours in the presence of 20% serum from three newly diagnosed, untreated SLE patients. Microarray analysis was then performed upon normalizing the gene expression levels of samples incubated with SLE sera to those incubated with autologous serum.
