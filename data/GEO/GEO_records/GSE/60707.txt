TITLE
ChIp-on-chip with Rbp3 in C-ternimal domain (CTD) of Rbp1 mutants upon Nacl Stress in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The modification of Ser 5 is important for the relocalization of RNAP II upon NaCl stress. The CTD14 strains harbors a plasmid expressing RPB1 with 14 wild-type CTD repeats. The 5A strain carries a plasmid expressing a chimeric RPB1 in which the CTD was composed of 5 repeats of CTD-serine 5 substituted with alanine followed by 7 wild-type-sequenced repeats.

DESIGN
Two-color fluorescence arrays reporting on Rpb3 localization abundance in strains (input vs. IP) before and at 20 min after a shock with 0.7M NaCl
