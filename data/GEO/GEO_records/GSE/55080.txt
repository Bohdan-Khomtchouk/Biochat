TITLE
Prdm16 Knockout Brown Adipose Tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile from brown adipose tissues of Prdm16 knockout and wile type mice. Prdm16 is a transcription factor that regulates the thermogenic gene program in brown and beige adipocytes.  However, whether Prdm16 is required for the development or physiological function of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in vivo has been unclear. By analyzing mice that selectively lacked Prdm16 in the brown adipose lineage, we found that Prdm16 was dispensable for embryonic BAT development.

DESIGN
Brown adipose tissues were collected from Prdm16 knockout and wiletype mice with 4 biological replicates per condition. Experiment was done in two separate batch for 6-week-old and 11-month-old. Extracted RNA was hybridized to Agilent two-color arrays.
