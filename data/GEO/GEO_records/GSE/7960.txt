TITLE
Analysis of MYC- and PIM1-dependent genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It has been estimated that about 11% of cellular genes present a functional E box to which MYC can associate on the genome. MYC silencing demonstrated that MYC recruits PIM1 at specific MYC binding sites and confocal microscopy following growth factor treatment, showed an elevated degree of nuclear co-localization of PIM1 with nascent transcripts and with MYC suggesting that PIM1 is recruited by MYC to a large number of sites. To understand the actual extension of PIM1 and MYC co-operation in gene transcription we performed expression profile analysis of 293 cells silenced either for MYC or PIM1 at 120 minutes after serum treatment. MYC silencing affected the expression of 1026 genes of which 818 were up-regulated and 208 were down-regulated. Comparison of genes regulated by MYC with those regulated by PIM1, by RNAi silencing, showed that PIM1 contributes to the regulation of 207 genes out of the 1026 MYC-regulated genes. Thus, a subset of 20% of MYC-regulated genes, are also regulated by PIM1. The co-regulated includes genes involved in cell metabolism, protein synthesis, cycle progression, and oncogenesis. Interestingly, a large number of genes are transcriptional factors, which suggests that PIM1 participates in MYC-dependent regulatory networks. Keywords: expression profiles
