TITLE
Exposure of squamous esophageal cell line HET-1A to deoxycholic acid (DCA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The involvment of bile acids such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) in gastro-esophageal reflux disease and subsequent Barrett’s metaplsia has been postulated. This study examines gene expression induced by exposure to DCA in esophageal cells and may be utilised in cross-comparisions with data derived from gene expression studies of Barrett’s esophagus and associated adenocarcinoma. Additionally this study may be used to assess divergence in response to bile acids by comparisons with similar study performed in SKGT4 barrett''s assocaited adenocarcinoma cell line.

DESIGN
HET-1A cells were exposed to 300um DCA over 24 hours in duplicate experiments including matched timepoint controls
