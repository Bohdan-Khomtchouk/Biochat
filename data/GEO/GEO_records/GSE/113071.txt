TITLE
Sequencing of human chain specific ribosome transcriptional group

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the expression profile of long chain non coding RNA (lncRNA) in different concentrations of PM2.5 after treatment of normal human bronchial cells is changed. The total RNAs were extracted from 16HBE cells after exposure to either PM2.5, at concentration of 50 μg/mL and 100μg/mL, or PBS (control group) for 48h. lncRNA-sequencing, detection and analysis was performed. Fold change ≥ 2 and p ≤ 0.05 were used as a cutoff values to determine significant differential expression Further, cluster analyses were performed to classify lncRNAs based on their distinguishable expression in different samples.

DESIGN
Detection of a long chain noncoding RNA treated with cell type and different concentrations of PM2.5

PLATFORM
GPL21290 Illumina HiSeq 3000 (Homo sapiens)
