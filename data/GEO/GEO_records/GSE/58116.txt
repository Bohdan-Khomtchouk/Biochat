TITLE
Helminth Infection Reactivates Latent γ-herpesvirus Via Cytokine Competition at a Viral Promoter

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammals are co-infected by multiple pathogens that interact through unknown mechanisms. We found that helminth infection, characterized by the induction of the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) and the activation of the transcription factor Stat6, reactivated murine gammaherpesvirus infection in vivo. IL-4 promoted viral replication and blocked the antiviral effects of interferon-g (IFNg) by inducing Stat6 binding to the promoter for an important viral transcriptional transactivator. IL-4 also reactivated human Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus from latency in cultured cells. Exogenous IL-4 plus blockade of IFNg reactivated latent murine gammaherpesvirus infection in vivo, suggesting a ‘two-signal’ model for viral reactivation. Thus chronic herpesvirus infection, a component of the mammalian virome, is regulated by the counterpoised actions of multiple cytokines on viral promoters that have evolved to sense host immune status.

DESIGN
All of the RNA from virus-pos cells and 50 ng of RNA from virus-neg cells was prepared for RNA-seq using ScriptSeq v2 RNA-seq library preparation kit (Epicentre). Index Primers (Epicentre) were added and samples underwent Duplex-Specific thermostable nuclease (DSN) (Evrogen) treatment to remove ribosomal RNA. Samples were pooled and sequenced on HiSeq.

PLATFORM
