TITLE
Specific acetylase-deacetylase balance controls stress adaptation by modulating global histone H3K14 acetylation.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Histone acetylation and deacetylation is important for gene regulation. The histone acetyltransferase, Gcn5, is a known activator of transcriptional initiation that is recruited to gene promoters. Here we map genome-wide levels of Gcn5 occupancy and histone H3K14ac at high resolution. Gcn5 is predominantly localized to coding regions of highly transcribed genes where it antagonistically collaborates with the class II histone deacetylase, Clr3, to regulate histone H3K14ac levels. Regulation of histone H3k14ac levels is critical for regulation of many genes during stress adaptation. Our findings suggest a novel role for Gcn5 during transcriptional elongation in addition to its known role in transcriptional initiation. The data in this series showed Gcn5 occupancy and H3K14 acetylation levels in wild type, gcn5- and gcn5-/clr3- cells under KCl stress condition. Related expression data are GSE5227 and GSE13817 Keywords: Chip-chip

DESIGN
This data include: 1 Genome wide analysis study of Gcn5 occupancy in S. pombe in rich media, so called ChIP on chip using Affymetrix tiling arrays with a 20 bp resolution. 2. Under 1M KCl treatment,  H3K14 acetylation levels in wild type cells and cells lacking  the  Gcn5 histone acetyltransferase and cells lacking both Gcn5 and class II HDAC Clr3. To control for nucleosome density we also determined H3 binding. ChIP on chip data using input (whole cell lysate) as control, at least two biological replicates were used.
