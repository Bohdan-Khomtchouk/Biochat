TITLE
Identification and analysis of microRNAs in the SAM and leaves of Populus tomentosa

ORGANISM
Populus tomentosa

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing was performed to build two sRNA libraries derived from shoot tips and mature leaf tissues of P. tomentosa. Millions of small RNA (sRNA) reads were obtained, and many known and novel miRNAs in SAM and leaf libraries were established. Several miRNAs that were differentially expressed between the SAM and its surrounding tissues, and their targets involved in important biological processes were identified and analyzed. Our study provide insights for better understanding the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs involved in the SAM of woody plants.
