TITLE
Malaria Host Pathogen Interaction Center Experiment 13: Gene and exon transcript abundances of uninfected Macaca mulatta treated with pyrimethamine over 7 time points in a 100 day study

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
The Malaria Host-Pathogen Interaction Center (MaHPIC) is an inter-disciplinary NIH systems biology contract that utilizes multiple omics  types (omics, clinical, and mathematical models), to iteratively test and develop hypotheses related to the complex host-parasite dynamics in the course of malaria infections in non-human primates with the goal of better understanding human disease.  These data and metadata were produced by MaHPIC in collaborations between Emory University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and The University of Georgia as part of the MaHPIC contract (NIAID Contract: # HHSN272201200031C).  Curation and maintenance of these data and metadata are the responsibility of the MaHPIC.

DESIGN
The experimental design of this pyrimethamine administration experiment with Macaca mulatta was approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and is as follows. Five naive males (RCs13, RWr13, RUn13, RZe13 and RTi13) approximately 2 years of age were injected intravenously with a preparation of Anopheles dirus salivary gland material and then profiled for clinical and omic measurements over the course of a 100-day experiment. Samples were generated and analyzed as part of a multi-omic approach to understanding the effects that the anti-malarial drug pyrimethamine has on immune physiology in rhesus macaques (M. mulatta).  There was no infection with Plasmodium parasites during this study. Whole blood and bone marrow RNA-Seq and plasma have been obtained for seven time-points before, during and after three rounds of drug administration.  Samples are from either whole blood or bone marrow specimen types.  5 individuals were sampled for each specimen type, 7 times each over the 100 day experiment. 5 individuals * 2 specimen types * 7 time points = 70 samples. Biological samples (Whole Blood or Bone Marrow) were collected at 7 time points during the 100 days.  These correspond to: Time Point 1 = Day 0 (Baseline Sampling Point) Time Point 2 = Day 21 Time Point 3 = Day 27 Time Point 4 = Day 52 Time Point 5 = Day 59 Time Point 6 = Day 90 Time Point 7 = Day 98 Pyrimethamine was administered on Days 21, 52, 53, 54, 90, 91, and 92.
