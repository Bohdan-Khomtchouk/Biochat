TITLE
Gestational high salt stressed Embryonic Day 14.5 BdkrB2 Null Mouse Kidney vs. BdkrB2 Wild Type Mouse Kidney

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Embryonic Day 14.5 mouse kidneys comparing the infuence of gestational high salt stress on gene expression remolding of BdkrB2 receptor null mice with that of BdkrB2 receptor wild type mice. The BdkrB2 receptor has been shown to be playing a role in renal vascular tone, kidney secretion and reabsorption function, normal kidney development, while impaired BdkrB2 receptor in kidney shown being associated with renal agenesis and renal dysplasia. Goal was to determine the effects of BdkrB2 receptor knockout together with gestational high salt stress on renal gene expression pattern.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, BdkrB2 null mouse kidney vs. BdkrB2 WT mosue kidney with both on gestational high salt stress . Biological replicates: 3 BdkrB2 null/WT replicates, 3 BdkrB2 WT/null replicates, all 6 replicates were duplicated.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
