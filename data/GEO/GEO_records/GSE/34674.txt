TITLE
cDNA microarray of hepatocellular carcinoma and nontumor liver tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify the deregulated genes in hepatocellular carcinama, we applied the Agilent two-color chip cDNA microarray to explore the expression of genes in hepatocellular carcinoma and nontumor liver tissue samples. Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and nontumor liver tissues were obtained from hepatocellular carcinoma patients during surgery. In these samples, RNA was extracted and cDNA microarray was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes in these samples.

DESIGN
Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and nontumor liver tissues were obtained from hepatocellular carcinoma patients during surgery. We included four hepatocellular carcinoma patients in this study, and there are four nontumor tissues and four hepatocellular carcinoma tissues.
