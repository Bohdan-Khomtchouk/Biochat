TITLE
Expression data from mus musculus subjected to traumatic brain injury (TBI) for treatment with cyclophosphamide

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We inflicted TBI to wildetype (wt) mice in order to establish whether the anti-inflammatory agent cyclophosphamide can be used therapeutically. Cyclophosphamide was found to regulate distinct inflammatory cells such as activated microglia separate from invading phagocytes and dendritic cells. Cyclophosphamide postinjury selectively reduces antigen-presenting dendritic cells.  Findings show feasibility of drug development to interfere with brain inflammation.

DESIGN
TBI was carried out in injured wt B6 mice for postinjury treatment with cyclophospamide i.p. using saline as a control substance for comparison with injured but untreated mice. Total RNA was prepared from injured cerebral neocortex after three days. RNA samples were also from uninjured wt mice as reference for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
