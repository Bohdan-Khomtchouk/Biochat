TITLE
Total RNA from human venous blood from male and female probands

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the project was to explore the feasibility of gene expression profiles as a general diagnostic tool. Therefore the most frequently used and easy to use white blood cells have been profiled. We wanted to examinate, whether phenotypes created by organs different from blood cells have enough influence on these cells to allow the diagnosis of their presence. As a proof of principle we tried to identify surrogate markers for human sex (excluding markers on sex chromosomes). Keywords: indirect phenotype classification, surrogate marker classification, genetic differences

DESIGN
14 HG-U95A and 9 HG-U95Av2 arrays have been hybridized with material from 5 male and 5 female probands with no known diseases; different number of replicates in the range 1 to 4 resulting into 12 experiments in the male group and 11 experiments in the female group.
