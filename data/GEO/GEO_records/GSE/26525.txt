TITLE
Expression data analyzed with LPIA in A549 lung carcinoma cells treated with geldanamycin.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The statsitcal model, latent pathway identification analysis (LPIA), was implemented for the analysis of A549 lung carcinoma cells treated with geldanamycin. Control and treated samples were assayed with Affymetrix HG_U133_plus_2 arrays and analyzed using LPIA. LPIA looks for statistically signÔ¨Åcant evidence of dysregulation in a network of pathways constructed in a manner that explicitly links pathways through their common function in the cell. Geldanamycin (geld) is known to inhibit the molecular chaperone protein, Hsp90, and plays a role in preventing the malignant transformation and proliferation of healthy cells during oncogenesis. LPIA successfully identified pathways specific to geldanamycin effects at the gene transcription level.
