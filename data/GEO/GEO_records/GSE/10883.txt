TITLE
A network of transcriptional repression specifies muscle fibre type in the zebrafish embryo

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The zebrafish u-boot (ubo) gene encodes the transcription factor Prdm1, which is essential for the specification of the primary slow twitch muscle fibres that derive from adaxial cells. Here we show that Prdm1 executes this function by acting as a transcriptional repressor. Expression of the slow twitch isoform of the myosin heavy chain in adaxial cells is achieved by Prdm1 mediated repression of the transcriptional repressor Sox6. Using Chromatin immuno precipitation (ChIP) we found that genes encoding fast specific isoforms of sarcomeric proteins are direct targets of Prdm1. These genes are ectopically expressed in the adaxial cells of ubotp39 mutant embryos, suggesting that Prdm1 promotes slow twitch fibre differentiation by acting both as a global repressor of fast fibre specific genes as well as of a repressor of slow specific genes.
