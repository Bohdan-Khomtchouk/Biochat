SUMMARY
we analyzed the gene expression profile of newly produced transgenic bone marrow subpopulations and compared it to the expression patterns obtained from cells isolated from wild type mice at different stages of the hematopoietic differentiation process. These populations were enriched in HSC, CMP, CD41+ c-kit+ and CD41+ c-kit- populations for the myelo-megakaryocytic lineage; and for the B lymphoid lineage, the populations were enriched in CLP, Pro-B and mature B lymphocytes. To produce comparable profiles total bone marrow RNA was used as a common reference. Keywords: repeat sample
