TITLE
Human NTERA2 (NT2/D1) cells lines: shZRF1 vs. shRandom during Retinoic Acid (RA) administration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human NT2 cell lines comparing control cells (shRandom) with ZRF1 knockdown cells (shZRF1) both either untreated (0 h) or treated with Retinoic Acid (3 h) at 0.01 ÂµM. The cell lines were established by retroviral infection allowing for the transcription of either a random shRNA (shRandom) or a shRNA specific for ZRF1 (shZRF1). The goal was to determine the effect of ZRF1 on transcriptional activation at the onset of differentiation.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment, shRandom vs. shZRF1 cells either uninduced (0 h) or RA induced (3 h). Biological replicates: 6 replicates (shRandom) taken on 3 different days without or with RA administration. 6 shZRF1 replicates taken on three different days with or without RA administration.
