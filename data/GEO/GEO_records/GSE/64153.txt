TITLE
Microarray Analysis for the Screening of Genes Inducible by Light or Low Temperature in Post-veraison Grape Berries

ORGANISM
Vitis labrusca x Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Flavonoid biosynthesis in grape berry skin is affected by environmental factors such as light and temperature. However, the components of the light-signaling and low-temperature-induced ABA signaling networks related to flavonoid accumulation in grape berry skin have not been fully elucidated. To clarify details of the possible light- and ABA-related signal transduction networks, we performed comprehensive transcriptome analysis using grape berries cultured under different light and temperature conditions. We identified 40 light-inducible genes, 55 low-temperature-inducible genes, and 34 genes induced by light plus low temperature.

DESIGN
12 samples were analysed. The experiment had 4 conditions and  included 3 repetition.
