TITLE
Effect of Valproic Acid on Endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Valproic acid (VPA) is a short-chain fatty acid used in the treatment of epilepsy and also considered to be an epigenetic modifier by functioning as a histone deacetylase (HDAC)-inhibitor. The aim of this study was to search for gene altered by VPA in human endothelial cells.

DESIGN
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) from five individuals were cultured in the absence or presence of 4mM VPA for 24h. Cells were cultured in EGM-2 medium and all experiments were performed in passages 1 or 2.
