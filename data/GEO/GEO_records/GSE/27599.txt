TITLE
Coordinate regulation of galectins in GAL3 deficient mouse keratinocytes exposed to UVB irradiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dr. Liu's research group is interested in studying the expression and functions of galectin-3, -7 and -12, in particular the roles of these proteins in inflammation and neoplasm. Members of the galectin family are known to participate in cellular homeostasis by modulating cell growth, controlling cell cycle progression, and inducing or inhibiting apoptosis. It is known that some galectins have similar functions. However, it is not fully understood whether they work cooperatively or not. Recent reports suggest that gal-3 deficiency may induce changes in cellular homeostatic mechanisms, leading to changes in expression of other galectins and galectin-related proteins.

DESIGN
To analyze the coordinate regulation of galectins in the face of gal-3 deficiency, gene expression patterns of gal-3 / and gal-3 -/- keratinocytes exposed to UVB were compared. Murine epidermal keratinocytes from gal-3 / and gal-3 -/- mice will be irradiated with 200 J/m2 of UVB. Total RNA will be extracted at 0, 6, 12 and 24 h after irradiation. Classes were prepared in triplicate for a total of 24 samples. All samples were hybridized to the custom designed CFG GLYCOv2 glycogene array.
