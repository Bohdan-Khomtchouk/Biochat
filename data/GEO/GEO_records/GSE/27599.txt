TITLE
Coordinate regulation of galectins in GAL3 deficient mouse keratinocytes exposed to UVB irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dr. Liu's research group is interested in studying the expression and functions of galectin-3, -7 and -12, in particular the roles of these proteins in inflammation and neoplasm. Members of the galectin family are known to participate in cellular homeostasis by modulating cell growth, controlling cell cycle progression, and inducing or inhibiting apoptosis. It is known that some galectins have similar functions. However, it is not fully understood whether they work cooperatively or not. Recent reports suggest that gal-3 deficiency may induce changes in cellular homeostatic mechanisms, leading to changes in expression of other galectins and galectin-related proteins.
