TITLE
Gene Expression Differences in Pediatric Lymphatic Cystic Malformations:  Size Really Matters

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microcystic and macrocystic lymphatic malformations are similar but clinically distinct infantile malformations, with distinct clinical responses and prognoses. In this study, we identify considerable differences in gene expression between the microcystic and macrocystic malformation subtypes with respect to healthy tissue.

DESIGN
Tissue was collected from children with lymphatic cystic malformations. Patient's normal skin from demographically matched children were used as controls.
