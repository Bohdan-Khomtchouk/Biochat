TITLE
Expression data from breast cancer FNA biopsies from patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The behavior of breast cancers and their response to different chemotherapy treatments depend on their phenotype which is to a large extent determined by gene expression programs within the cancer cell. We used gene expression values from 30 probes on affymetrix U133A chips to calculate a score that would predict if a breast cancer is likely to achieve pathological complete response to chemotherapy consisting of T/FAC.

DESIGN
Pre-treatment FNA from primary tumors or axillary lymph node metastases were obtained and RNA extracted and hybridized to afymetrix microarrays according to manufacturer protocol.
