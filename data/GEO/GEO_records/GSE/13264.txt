TITLE
Liver tissue from the " Four Core Genotype " treated group C57BL/6J mice versus pool C57BL/6J mice of chow diet Liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the expression traits in Liver tissue from the Four Core Genotype treated group. Keywords: Sry transgene Four Core Genotype Mouse liver Tissue

DESIGN
Liver tissue from the " Four Core Genotype " treated group consists of 20 female and male C57BL/6J mice fed a chow diet containing 4% fat (Ralston-Purina Co., St. Louis, MO) until 8 weeks of age and then were gonadectomized at 8 weeks of life.  In mice of the " four core genotypes " (FCG), the Y chromosome is deleted for the testis-determining gene Sry, producing the Y- chromosome.  The Sry transgene is inserted onto an autosome, so that testis determination is independent of the complement of sex chromosomes.  XY-Sry gonadal males are bred with XX gonadal females, producing progeny with four different genotypes: two types of gonadal males (XX.Sry and XY-Sry) and two types of gonadal females (XX and XY-).  At 12 weeks mice were sacrificed, after a 12-hour fast, Liver tissue were dissected and flash frozen in LN2 and stored at -80Â°C.  All sample were compared to a common pool created from equal portions of RNA from each of the samples.
