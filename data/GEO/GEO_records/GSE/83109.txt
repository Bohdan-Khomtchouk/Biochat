TITLE
Substrate and oxygen dependent citric acid production by Yarrowia lipolytica: Insights through transcriptome and fluxome analysis

ORGANISM
Yarrowia lipolytica

SUMMARY
The goal of the study is to use Next generation sequencing (RNA-seq) and 13C based flux analysis to study the underlying regulation of citric acid metabolism in mixed culture fermentation (glucose and glycerl) of Yarrowia lipolytica. We  sequenced the RNA from 4 different samples in the mixed culture (glucose and glycerol) under oxygen excess and limited conditions with 2 replicates each . Transcriptional profiles showed that under oxygen limited conditions, due to deficient mitochondrial activity, citric acid is being consumed back after glycerol exhaustion eventhough glucose is present in excess. Transcriptome and fluxome profiles showed that glucose is mainly directed towards the Pentose phosphate pathway in the dual substrate fermentations.

DESIGN
Total 4 phases (pO2-1, pO2-2, pO2-UN-2, pO2-UN-3) were choosen and 2 replicates for each phase were paired-end sequenced using Illumina True seq kit on Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL17209 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Yarrowia lipolytica)
