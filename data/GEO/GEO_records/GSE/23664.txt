TITLE
mpk4/mpk4 gof vs mpk4/mpk4 vs col0   -Transcriptome study of mpk4 complemented line with a hyperactive form of MPK4 (MPK4 GOF).

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au10-07_mpk4gof - mpk4/mpk4 gof vs mpk4/mpk4 vs col0    - Genes regulated by MPK4 pathway.        - In order to study of the genes controlled by MPK4 pathway we generate mpk4 complemented lines expressing active MPK4 (MPK4 GOF). For the transcriptome analysis we compare the MPK4 GOF to mpk4/MPK4 (complemented mpk4 mutant with a wt MPK4) and to Col0. Keywords: genotype comparaison

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - CATMA arrays Comparisons of MPK4 GOF to mpk4/MPK4 (complemented mpk4 mutant with a wt MPK4) and to Col0.

PLATFORM
GPL9553 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 34.6K CATMA_v5
