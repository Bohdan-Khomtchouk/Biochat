TITLE
Nascent RNA-seq in Kasumi-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Amino Enhancer of Split (AES) is essential for AML1-ETO induced self-renewal and leukemogenesis. To study the effect of AES on transcription regulation in AML1-ETO expressing Kasumi-1 cells, nascent transcripts in control (shctr) and AES knockdown (shAES) Kasumi-1 cells were labelled with uridine analogue 4-thioduridine with subsequent nascent RNA purification and next generation sequencing (Nascent RNA-seq).

DESIGN
Examination of nascent transcription in Kasumi-1 cells under two conditions with duplicate.
