TITLE
Expression data of MCF-7 cells treated with gamma tocotrienol (g-T3)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gamma tocotrienol induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells however, the molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the effects of gamma tocotrienols on MCF-7 cells and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were grown in DMEM medium with 5% FBS. The cells were treated with vehicle control (DMSO) or 40 uM of gamma tocotrienol for 24 h for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Four independent experiments were performed.
