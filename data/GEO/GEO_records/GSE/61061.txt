TITLE
Dormancy of green-cotyledon Col seeds matured at 20°C vs 15°C

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To determine genes involved in induction of dormancy in response to reduced maturation temperatures, RNA sequencing was performed on developing seeds matured at 20°C, where low dormancy is observed, and compared to seeds matured at 15°C where high dormancy is observed.

DESIGN
Col green cotyledon seeds matured at 20°C and 15°C were dissected from siliques between five to seven hours after dawn and frozen in liquid nitrogen.  RNA was extracted as described previously (Penfield et al., 2005).
