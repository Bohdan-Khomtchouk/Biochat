TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression profiling of high-grade osteosarcoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide gene expression data of high-grade osteosarcoma cell lines, as well as on mesenchymal stem cells, and osteoblasts, and performed global test analysis in order to determine the most significantly affected KEGG pathways.

DESIGN
Genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed on 19 high-grade osteosarcoma cell lines. Significantly differentially expressed genes were determined between osteosarcoma cells and two different sets of control samples - osteoblasts [n=3, GEO accession number GSE33382] and mesenchymal stem cells [n=12, GEO accession number GSE28974]. Global test was applied to the different analyses, in order to determine the most affected signaling pathways in osteosarcoma cells.
