TITLE
Whole transcriptomic screening the RNA from control (O), photon radiotherapy (X) and proton therapy (P) tumors

ORGANISM
mixed sample

SUMMARY
The general purpose of the experiment is to compare the therapeutic effect of photon (X) radiotherapy versus proton (P) therapy for head and neck carcinoma. For that purpose we have generated cells that have resisted to multi irradiations by X or P. We have then injected these human cells in nude mice. Whereas these cells proliferate less than the control (0, non-irradiated cells) in vitro, they formed bigger tumors in mice compared to 0 cells. Hence, the hypothesis is that they secreted factors that educate the microenvironment. We have observed that although the tumors generated by the P cells are as big as those generated by the X cells, the lymphangiogenic/metastatic capacity is greater for the X cells. Hence, we would like to compare within a whole transcriptomic screening the RNA from 0, X and P tumors. The provided samples consist of a mix of human and mouse RNA.

DESIGN
Three conditions with three replicates : control (O), photon radiotherapy (X) and proton therapy (P)
