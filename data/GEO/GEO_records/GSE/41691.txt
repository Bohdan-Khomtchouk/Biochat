TITLE
Early limb bud transcriptome analysis between anterior and posterior domain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Shh signal mediated by Gli family of transcription factors regulates digit growth and patterning in early limb development. Shh expression in the posterior margin of the limb bud defines the zone of polarizing activity. However, much less is know about downstream targets that mediate Shh signal functions. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from dissected anterior and posterior halves of mouse limb bud respectively. These data are used to obtain 889 transcripts that were upregulated 1.3 fold or more in the posterior limb bud, and 1189 transcripts that were enriched in the anterior limb bud at 1.3 fold or more.

DESIGN
Two samples were analyzed. We generate pairwise comparisons between anterior and posterior limb tissues. Genes with a fold-change â‰¥1.3 were selected.
