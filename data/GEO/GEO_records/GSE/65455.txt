TITLE
Characterizing the interactions between a naturally-primed IgA (mAb 260.8) and its conserved Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron species-specific epitope in gnotobiotic mice [array]

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

SUMMARY
Comparisons of gnotobiotic Rag1-/- mice, with and without subcutaneous 260.8 hybridomas, disclosed that this IgA does not affect B. thetaiotaomicron population density or suppress 260.8 epitope production but does affect bacterial gene expression in ways that are emblematic of a diminished host innate immune response.

DESIGN
C57BL/6 wildtype, C57BL/6J Rag1-/- , and C57BL/6J Rag1-/- mice harboring the 260.8 IgA producing hybridoma were colonized for 10 days with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482.
