TITLE
Gene expression in Delta Sub1 with and without 4NQ0

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Microarrays analysis was undertaken to compare mRNA levels in exponentially growing wild-type and sub1Δ cells, or after 1 h treatment with 4NQO. After spot quantification and normalization, only few genes were found to be differentially expressed when the two strains were exponentially grown in rich medium. In contrast, the distribution of gene expression ratios was clearly different upon 4NQO treatment showing that the transcriptional response to DNA damages was affected in the absence of Sub1. Most of the differentially expressed genes were up-regulated in sub1Δ cells, suggesting a global repression effect of Sub1. About half of them were bound by Sub1 demonstrating that Sub1 occupancy correlates with gene regulation. A GoTermFinder analysis revealed an enrichment in genes implicated in cell cycle process for the down-regulated genes. The up-regulated genes were enriched in ribosome biogenesis and cell wall structure GO categories, confirming that most of the genes bound by Sub1 were up-regulated in sub1Δ cells upon 4NQO treatment. A third GO category corresponded to genes encoding proteins involved in amino acid metabolism whose expression is under the control of the Gcn4 transcriptional activator. This GO category could reflect an indirect effect since the GCN4 gene is bound by Sub1, up-regulated in sub1Δ cells and induced at the translational level in response to DNA-damaging agents.
