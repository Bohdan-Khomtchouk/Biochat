TITLE
Copy number alteration in Murine Tumor Cells: primary inoculated tumor cells vs. out-growing tumor cells [Fig8b]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Copy number alteration in out-growing mouse tumor cells comparing that in the original tumor cells that was primarily inoculated into the indicated mice.  Goal is to determine the effects of IFN-gamma producing tumor-specific CTL on targeted tumor cell gene expression.

DESIGN
genomic DNA of out-growing tumor cells was compared with that of primary inoculated tumor cells by a-CGH assay
