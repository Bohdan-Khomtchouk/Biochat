TITLE
Gene expression levels in immortalized B cells from 131 unrelated CEPH-Utah grandparents treated under ER stress.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to examine gene expression levels from 131 unrelated CEPH-Utah grandparents with either DMSO or tunicamycin.

DESIGN
We measured gene expression levels in immortalized B cells from 131 unrelated CEPH-Utah grandparents.  Each individual was treated for 8 hours with either DMSO or with 4 ug/ml of tunicamycin.  Gene expression was measured.
