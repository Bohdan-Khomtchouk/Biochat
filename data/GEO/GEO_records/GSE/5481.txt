BRAF siRNA NHGRI_Liang_BRAF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BRAF, one of three RAF serine/threonine kinases (ARAF, BRAF and CRAF), plays a major role in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, which mediates cellular responses to growth signals. Recently a high frequency (~60%-70%) of activating BRAF mutations (predominantly V600E) has been reported in malignant melanoma. In order to identify the downstream effects of BRAF signaling on melanoma cell growth and gene expression, cDNA microarray analysis was carried out following BRAF siRNA or MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) treatment. Keywords: time series, siRNA

DESIGN
time series, siRNA, drug treatment
