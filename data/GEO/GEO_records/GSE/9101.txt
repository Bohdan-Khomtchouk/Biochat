TITLE
Expression data in native lipoprotein-stimulated human THP-1 macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We previously found that a native lipoprotein mix with a high VLDL+LDL/HDL ratio causes a global de novoDNA methylation in THP-1 macrophages. In the present experiment we assessed the consequences of global lipoprotein-induced de novo DNA methylation on global gene expression in the same cells. Moreover, we sought to use gene expression array data to measure RNA expression levels for candidate factors mediating the epigenetic effects of lipoproteins. Keywords: comparison treated vs. control

DESIGN
Human native VLDL, LDL and HDL lipoproteins were isolated from buffy coats, fractionated by ultracentrifugation, stored at -80deg., desalted to PBS before usage and kept at 4deg. for a maximum of 7d. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated to macrophages, stimulated for 24h with a mix of 68.8mg/ml VLDL, 32.1mg/ml LDL, 91.1mg/ml HDL or unstimulated (control), in serum-free medium with 2% BSA.  Three independently isolated lipoprotein samples were used in triplicate.
