TITLE
Expression data in native lipoprotein-stimulated human THP-1 macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We previously found that a native lipoprotein mix with a high VLDL+LDL/HDL ratio causes a global de novoDNA methylation in THP-1 macrophages. In the present experiment we assessed the consequences of global lipoprotein-induced de novo DNA methylation on global gene expression in the same cells. Moreover, we sought to use gene expression array data to measure RNA expression levels for candidate factors mediating the epigenetic effects of lipoproteins. Keywords: comparison treated vs. control
