TITLE
A. thaliana transcriptomic responses against salt stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Using A. thaliana microarray platform the transcriptomic response of shoot tissues was characterized at two different time points- 3h and 27h after 250mM and 500mM of NaCl treatments.

DESIGN
Four weeks old, soil grown Arabidopsis thaliana, Col 0 plants were treated either with 250 or 500 mM NaCl solution by flush flooding, while the control group was watered.

PLATFORM
GPL16892 Agilent-029132 At8X60 [Probe Name version]
