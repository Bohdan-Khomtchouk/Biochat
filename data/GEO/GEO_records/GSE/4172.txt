TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human inflammatory Cardiomyopathy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Since targeting of specific pathogenic pathways may be more efficient than current unspecific heart failure treatment, we obtained genomewide expression profiles of a DCM subtype characterized by cardiac inflammation (DCMi) in association with parvovirus B19. This study was entirely based on RNA isolated from endomyocardial biopsies so far only rarely used for genomic expression profiling. Keywords: disease state analysis
