TITLE
PIE cell line: Control vs. ETEC treated or Immunobiotic treated

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We investigate the transcriptome response of porcine intestinal epitheliocyte cell line (PIE cells) to the challenge with heat-stable Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and, the changes induced by Lactobacillus jensenii TL2937 in that response. The transcriptome approach allowed us to obtain a global overview of the immune and immune related genes involved in response of PIE cells to heat-stable ETEC PAMPs. The most remarkable changes in PIE cells after heat-stable ETEC PAMPs challenge were observed in chemokines expressions, followed by cell adhesion molecules and, complement and coagulation cascades factors. We also confirmed that L. jensenii TL2937 differently modulates gene expression in ETEC PAMPs-challenged PIE cells. The microarray gene expression profiles clearly demonstrated that an anti-inflammatory effect was triggered by the immunobiotic strain in PIE cells. The main outcome from the study was the differential regulation of chemokines (CCL8, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11), complement factors (C1R, C1S, C3 and CFB) and, coagulation system proteins (Tissue factor) expression by L. jensenii TL2937. PIE cells treated with the negative control Lactobacillus plantarum TL2766 showed a transcriptomic response similar to ETEC PAMPs-challenged PIE cells.

DESIGN
PIE cells were cultured for 3 days, L. jensenii TL2937 or L. plantarum TL2766 were added to cell cultures and 48 hours latercells were washed to eliminate bacteria. Non-bacteria treated PIE cells were used as controls.  Then cells were stimulated with ETEC PAMPs  for 12 hours for microarray studies. Groups: unchallenged PIE cells, PIE cells + ETEC PAMPs, PIE cells + TL2937 + ETEC PAMPs, PIE cells + TL2766 + ETEC PAMPs. One replicate for each group.
