TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling after Allyl Alcohol treatment in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Allyl alcohol is a highly toxic industrial chemical used as a synthetic substrate, and as an herbicide in agriculture. It is evident that Allyl alcohol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) to the highly toxic Acrolein. Acrolein is a simple unsaturated aldehyde, ubiquitous environmental pollutant, endogenous metabolite and major constituent of cigarette smoke. Acrolein is highly electrophilic in nature and has strong reactivity towards nucleophiles present in cell such as amino acids, proteins and DNA. Several studies have tried to explore the molecular mechanisms of acrolein cytotoxicity. In continuation, we attempted to investigate the global transcriptional response of yeast cells upon treatment with 0.4mM Allyl alcohol (Acrolein) using oligonucleotide microarray assay. Also, we investigated for functionally enriched pathways based on the altered gene expression profiles after Allyl alcohol treatment. The microarray data were validated by quantitative real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Wild-type yeast (W1588-4c) cells were grown to exponential phase and the cells were left untreated (Control) or treated with a dose of 0.4mM Allyl Alcohol (AA) for 3h. Two independent experiments were performed for each experiment (Control or AA). Total RNAs were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
