TITLE
DNA methylation data from 11 periodontitis cases and 12 age-matched healthy individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray methylation (InfiniumÂ® HumanMethylation450 BeadChip from Illumina) was performed on gingival tissue samples from 11 periodontitis cases and 12 age-matched healthy individuals.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 23 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
