TITLE
Genome wide H3K9ac and SAGA occupancy at OX growth phase and RC quiescent phase of yeast metabolic cycle

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We found acetyl-CoA levels increase when cells are committed to growth. We also found 3 components of the SAGA complex, Spt7p, Sgf73p and Ada3p as well as histones are dynamically acetylated in tune with the acetyl-CoA levels. ChIP-seq study reveals SAGA and H3K9ac predominantly occupy growth genes at the OX growth phase of the yeast metabolic cycle indicating acetyl-CoA levels may drive growth gene transcription program through acetylation of these proteins.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K9ac and SAGA binding over two timepoints using H3 and Input as controls

PLATFORM
