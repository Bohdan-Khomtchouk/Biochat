TITLE
Chromatin function of IkBa: ChIP-on-chip of IkBa

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Inhibitor of the NFkB, IkBa, is the main regulator of the NFkB pathway. Our data has demonstrated that there is an alternative function for IkBa in the chromatin that affects HOX and other developmental genes. Keywords: CHIP-chip

DESIGN
Chip-on-chip analysis has demonstrated that IkBa associates to the promoters of several genes. Chromatin fragments were obtained from NIH-3T3 cells and precipitated with 3 different IkBa comercial antibodies (raised in mouse, goat and rabbit), and fold enrichment was compared to input.
