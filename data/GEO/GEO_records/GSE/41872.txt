TITLE
Gene expression analysis after selective expression of tissue factor isoforms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of TF isoform-induced breast cancer cell transformation at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that expression of TF isoforms upregulate genes involved in proliferation and transformation, while downregulating genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Results provide important information on the cellular response to TF expression with respect to pro-oncogenic programs .

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from an MCF-7-based cell model (2A3-3) expressing full length tissue factor (2A3-3-flTF) or alternatvively spliced tissue factor (2A3-3-asTF) compared to cells expressing an empty vector control (2A3-3-pcDNA).
