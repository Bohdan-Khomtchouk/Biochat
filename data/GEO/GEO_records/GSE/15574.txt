TITLE
Cerebellar gene expression data from Mecp2-null and MECP2-transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression changes in the cerebellum of mice lacking MeCP2 (Mecp2-null) and mice overexpressing MeCP2 (MECP2-transgenic). A group of postnatal neurodevelopmental disorders collectively referred to as MeCP2 disorders are caused by aberrations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Loss of MeCP2 function causes Rett syndrome (RTT), whereas increased copy number of the gene causes MECP2 duplication or triplication syndromes. MeCP2 acts as a transcriptional repressor, however the gene expression changes observed in the hypothalamus of MeCP2 disorder mouse models suggest that MeCP2 can also upregulate gene expression. To determine if this dual role of MeCP2 extends beyond the hypothalamus, we studied gene expression patterns in the cerebellum of Mecp2-null and MECP2-Tg mice, modeling RTT and MECP2 duplication syndrome, respectively. We found that abnormal MeCP2 dosage causes alterations in the expression of hundreds of genes in the cerebellum. The majority of genes were upregulated in MECP2-Tg mice and downregulated in Mecp2-null mice, consistent with a role for MeCP2 as a modulator that can both increase and decrease gene expression. Interestingly, many of the genes altered in the cerebellum, particularly those increased by the presence of MeCP2 and decreased in its absence, were similarly altered in the hypothalamus.

DESIGN
Total cerebellar RNA samples were collected from Mecp2-null male mice (n=5), MECP2-transgenic male mice (n=5), and their wild type male littermates at 6 weeks of age (n=5 for each group).
