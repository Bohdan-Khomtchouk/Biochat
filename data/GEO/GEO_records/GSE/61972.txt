TITLE
Allele-Specific Analysis of DNA Replication Origins in Mammalian Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nascent strand were purified with the BrdU methods from culture human basophilic erythroblasts and sequenced.

DESIGN
An allele-specific analysis of origin of replication efficiency was performed by taking advantage of the phased genome sequence of an individual
