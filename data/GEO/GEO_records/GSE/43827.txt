TITLE
Expression profile of S. pombe cells with ribosomal protein L32 paralogs

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We cultured the cells of S. pmbe in EMM2, and harvested them in the OD600 of 0.5 and 10 respectively. We used microarrays to detail the the global program of gene expression of SP-Q01 and SP-Q01 carrying vevtor pESP3X to overexpress either ribosomal protein L32 paralog in the OD600 of 0.5 and 10 respectively.

DESIGN
We constructed the ribosomal protein L32 paralog overexpression strains to mimic the expression pattern of RPL32 paralogs in wild-type cells of S.pombe. We cultured the cells to different growth phase, and used microarray to identify the genes were regulated distinctively by RPL32 paralogs.
