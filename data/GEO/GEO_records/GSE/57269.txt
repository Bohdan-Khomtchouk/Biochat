TITLE
The Wilms' tumor blastema propagating cell is a self-renewing committed epithelial stem cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recently the cancer stem cell (CSC) model has been put forward to describe how a subset of cells within the tumor is responsible for tumor growth and heterogeneity. Wilms' tumor (WT), the most common pediatric renal malignancy, arises from developmentally arrested early renal progenitors. WT NCAM1+ALDH1+ CSCs have been recently isolated and shown to localize to tumor blastema. Herein by generating 'blastema'-only WT xenografts composed solely by cells expressing the SIX2 and NCAM1 embryonic renal stem cell markers, we surprisingly show that sorted ALDH1+ WT CSCs are phenotypically not the earliest renal stem cells. Rather, gene expression and proteomic comparative analysis disclose a more differentiated self-renewing epithelial cell type than bulk of the blastema. Thus, WT CSCs do not represent the transformed counterpart of the most primitive renal stem cell being more differentiated than the presumable WT cell of origin and are likely to de-differentiate to propagate the tumor blastema.

DESIGN
We used Wilms tumor Xns, as well as, fetal renal tissue originally obtained from a patients or aborted fetus
