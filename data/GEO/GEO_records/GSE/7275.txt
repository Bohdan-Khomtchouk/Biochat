TITLE
Evaluation of murine mast cells derived exosomal RNA versus their parental cells MC/9.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exosomes are vesicles of endocytic origin released by many types of cells into the extracellular environment. In an attempt to further examine the exosome-mediated cellular communication, we show that exosomes from a mouse mast cell line (MC/9), exosomes from primary bone marrow derived mast cells, and exosomes from a human mast cell line (HMC-1) contain RNA but not DNA. Microarray assessments of exosome-derived RNA revealed that these vesicles contain mRNA from approximately 1200 genes, many of which are unique and not present in the cytoplasmic RNA pool in the donor cell. Keywords: Exosomal RNA versus their parental cells, MC/9

DESIGN
Exosomes were prepared from the supernatant of MC/9 cells by differential centrifugations and filtration. RNA was isolated from the exosomes and their parental cells using Trizo. The microarray experiments were performed by SweGene (www.swegene.org/) according to Affymetrix microarray DNA chip analysis. The experiment was performed in quadruple samples. ExoRNA1, ExoRNA2, ExoRNA3, and ExoRNA4 for the exosomes samples and Mast_cells1, Mast_cells2, Mast_cells3, and Mast_cells4 for the MC/9 cells.
