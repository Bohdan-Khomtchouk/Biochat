TITLE
Modification of C-terminal Domain (CTD) of RPB1 plays a role in transcriptome change upon salt stress

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transctriptome profiling of CTD-14 repeats, 2A, 5A mutants responding to 0.7N NaCl for 30mins. The study shows that phosphorylation at Ser5 sites plays a role in normal induction and repression of genes upon NaCl stress. The CTD14 strains harbors a plasmid expressing RPB1 with 14 wild-type CTD repeats. 5A strains carries a plasmid expressing a chimeric RPB1 in which the CTD was composed of 5 repeats of CTD-serine 5 substituted with Ala followed by 7 wild-type-sequenced repeats. The 2A strains carrys  8 repeats of CTD-serine 2 substituted with alanine followed by 7 wild-type-sequenced repeats.

DESIGN
Two-color fluorescence arrays reporting on mRNA abunance in strains before and after 30 min with 0.7M NaCl treatment

PLATFORM
GPL15778 NimbleGen UW-Madison Saccharomyces cerevisiae 380K tiling array [2006-10-12_Ansari_tiling_51mer; gene-level version]
