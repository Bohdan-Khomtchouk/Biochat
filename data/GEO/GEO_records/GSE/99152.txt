TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of splenic CD4+ cells from tBHQ treated

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report a transcriptomic analysis from tBHQ (terc-butyl-hydroquinone) treated mice. Mice were treated with this chemical for 20 days using 1.5% mixed in food and allowed water and food ad libitum. After the treatment period, spleen of tBHQ treated and control animals were taken out and CD4+ cells were isolated. Isolated RNA from these cells were subjected to cDNA microarray analysis. Our results show, that tBHQ changes the gene expression of many genes which are involved in metabolic and immune processes. In parallel with transcriptomic analysis, the effect of tBHQ on T cell differentiation was studied. Our results show, that beside changing the gene expression of many genes, tBHQ sensitize effector T cells (Th1, Th2, Th17) and inhibit Treg cells upon stimulation with chemicals.
