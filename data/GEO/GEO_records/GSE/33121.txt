TITLE
Expression data from ESC and in vitro derived somatic cells and germ cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression profiling on in vitro derived PGCs, undifferentiated ESCs, and somatic cells from the EB to examine germ cell expression in ESC-derived cells

DESIGN
All cells were collected using fluorescence activated cell sorting to isolate SSEA1+/cKit+ ESCs, SSEA1+/cKitbright PGCs, Oct4-gfp+/cKitbright PGCs, and SSEA1-/cKit- somatic cells and Oct4-gfp-/cKit- somatic cells.
