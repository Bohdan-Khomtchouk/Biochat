TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression in the Arabidopsis rlt1-1 rlt2-1 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis thaliana Imitation Switch (AtISWI) subfamily of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors play essential roles in plant development. Here we show that the DDT domain transcription factor RINGLET (RLT) form a complex with AtISWI. RLT1 physically interacts with CHR11 in yeast cells. Single mutants rlt1-1 and rlt2-1 show no obvious developmental defects, while the rlt1-1 rlt2-1 double mutant phenocopies the AtISWI mutant chr11-1 chr17-1. In addtion, the RLT-ISWI complex selectively represses SEPALLATA, FRUITFULL and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1, but not AGAMOUS and PISTILLATA in leaves.

DESIGN
Leaves from 15-day-old seedlings of wild-type Col-0 and rlt1-1 rlt2-1 were used for RNA preparation.In the experiment data,3a3b refers to rlt1-1 rlt2-1.
