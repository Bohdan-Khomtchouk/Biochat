TITLE
Transcript profiling in splenic red pulp macrophages from SIRPa-KO mice and WT mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare the splenic macrophages between SIRPα-knockout mice and WT mice, we performed a complete transcript profiling of the splenic red pulp macrophages from SIRPα-KO mice compared to WT mice using mRNA microarray as a discovery platform. SIRPα-KO mice and WT mice were kept under the same condition. Macrophages were isolated from spleen red pulp of SIRPα-KO mice and WT mice. RNA was then isolated from the same number of freshly isolated macrophages.

DESIGN
In each group, 5 mice were used. Splenic red pulp macrophages isolated from 5 SIRPα-KO or 5 WT mice were mixed before RNA extraction.
