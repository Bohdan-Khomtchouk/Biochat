TITLE
Dissecting the heterogeneity of skin gene expression patterns in systemic sclerosis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified fibro-inflammatory and keratin gene expression signatures in systemic sclerosis skin.

DESIGN
Skin biopsy samples from 61 patients enrolled in the GENISOS cohort or an open label imatinib study (baseline sample) and 36 controls were examined by global gene expression studies.  5 patients were sampled at two time points (early-late).  There is overlap between this data set and GSE47162.
