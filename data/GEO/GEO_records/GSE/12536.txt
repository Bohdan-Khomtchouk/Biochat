TITLE
Differentially regulated genes in control and c-myc N-myc deficient progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of HSCs from control and c-myc N-myc deficient long-term hematopoietic stem cells. HSCs lacking both c-myc and N-myc display increased apoptosis rates. Data provide insight into the molecular changes occuring upon complete loss of Myc activity, clarifying the resulting apoptotic mechanism and the role of Myc family proteins in HSCs and commited progenitors.

DESIGN
Commited progenitors (Lin-Sca1+CD150+CD48+) cells were sorted from the BM of MxCre c-myc flox2 N-myc flox2 (experimental) and c-myc flox2 N-myc flox2 (control) mice 3 days after the last pI-pC injection. Each condition was analysed in triplicates, with each replicate consisting of a pool of 3 dKO mice or 2 control mice.
