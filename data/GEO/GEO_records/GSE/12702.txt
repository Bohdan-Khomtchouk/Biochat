TITLE
Genomic profiling of prostate cancer in African-American patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
African-Americans with prostate cancer tend to have a more aggressive form of the disease, as compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Nevertheless, African-Americans tend to be underrepresented in most molecular profiling studies of prostate cancer.  To investigate DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) in prostate cancer from a cohort of African-Americans, we profiled 20 tumors (each with paired normal) for 500,000 SNPs. Keywords: tumor-normal comparison

DESIGN
Profiles were generated on two Affymetrix array chips: Nsp and Sty, each with ~250K SNPs represented.  In all, 20 tumors and 20 paired normal samples were profiled, 40 profiles in all.  Each tumor was centered on its corresponding normal pair to define copy number alterations (CNA) in that tumor.
