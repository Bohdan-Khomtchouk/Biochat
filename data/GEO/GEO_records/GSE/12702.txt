TITLE
Genomic profiling of prostate cancer in African-American patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
African-Americans with prostate cancer tend to have a more aggressive form of the disease, as compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Nevertheless, African-Americans tend to be underrepresented in most molecular profiling studies of prostate cancer.  To investigate DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) in prostate cancer from a cohort of African-Americans, we profiled 20 tumors (each with paired normal) for 500,000 SNPs. Keywords: tumor-normal comparison
