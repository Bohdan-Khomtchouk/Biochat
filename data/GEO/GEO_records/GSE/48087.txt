TITLE
The Cellular and Genomic Response of  Dopaminergic Neurons (N27) to Commericial “Capped” Nanosilver

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression indicated that N27 neurons exposed to each nanoAg material (1.0 ppm, 18 hr) responded primarily to PVP coated nanoAg of both sizes with affected pathways largely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (PVP 75 nm nanoAg) and Nrf-2 mediated oxidative stress (PVP 10 nm nanoAg) pathways.

DESIGN
N27 rat dopaminergic neurons were exposed to non-cytoxic (0.5-5.0 ppm) concentrations of nanoAg of different sizes (10 nm, 75 nm) and “cappings” (PVP, citrate).

PLATFORM
GPL6101 Illumina ratRef-12 v1.0 expression beadchip
