TITLE
Gene expression in Ewing tumor cell lines after STEAP1 silencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Goal: identification of differentially expressed genes after STEAP1 silencing. Ewing tumors (ET) are characterized by oncogenic EWS/ETS translocations and early metastasis. STEAP1 is a membrane-bound channel protein of unkown function. While overexpressed in many cancers, STEAP1 expression is strongly restricted to mesenchymal stem cells, prostate and urothelium among benign tissues. Here we show that STEAP1 is a direct transcriptional target of EWS/FLI1 and critical for ET malignancy. We demonstrate that STEAP1 is most prominently expressed in ET among sarcomas and provide further evidence for the concept of STEAP1 as a universal diagnostic marker for carcinomas. Using RNA interference we determined that STEAP1 promotes cellular invasiveness and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and accelerates tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Transcriptome and proteome analyses as well as functional studies reveal that STEAP1 contributes to the generation of reactive oxygen species that in turn regulate the levels of redox-sensitive signaling molecules and pro-metatstatic genes. In synopsis, these data illuminate the hitherto unkown oncogenic function of STEAP1 as a redox-modulator in ET and point to a potential role of STEAP1 as universal drug target for anti-cancer therapy.

DESIGN
6 samples (3x A673 cells; 3x SK-N-MC cells); for each cell line one sample was transfected with control non silencing siRNA and two samples with different STEAP1 siRNAs (siSTEAP1_2 and siSTEAP1_3).
