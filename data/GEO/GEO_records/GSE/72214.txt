TITLE
Microarray analysis of the brain response to cutaneous Aldara treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole mouse brain following peripheral, cutaneous immune stimulation with Aldara cream or aquaeous control cream. Results provide insight into the central response to peripheral inflammation Microarrays were used to investigate the global gene expression of mouse brains following peripheral, cutaneous application of Aldara cream or control cream

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice were treated with 80mg topical Aldara cream or aquaeous control cream every 24 hours for 5 consecutive days. 24 hours following the final application, brains were removed and RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). 5 brains from each group were analysed using full genome Affymetrix GeneChip array

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
