TITLE
Caco-2 cells: cultured in conventional vs apical anaerobic conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Caco-2 cells comparing Caco-2 monolayers cultured in a custom built co-culture chamber, either inside a 5% COâ‚‚ incubator (conventional cell culture environment) or an anaerobic workstation (apical anaerobic environment) for 12 hours.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment with dye swap, A vs B, 6 biological replicates
