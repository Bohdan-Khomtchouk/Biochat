TITLE
DNA methylation profiles in preeclampsia and healthy control placentas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and preeclampsia placental samples. Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K array) was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles in placental samples. Samples included 16 samples from healthy uncomplicated pregnancies and 8 samples from pregnancies affected by preeclampsia.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 24 samples were hybridised to the  Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K array).

PLATFORM
