TITLE
MYCN-transformed neuroblasts from TH-MYCN mice are selectively isolated and maintained as spheres in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It has been already reported that there are undifferentiated/proliferating neuroblasts in the postnatal sympathetic ganglia in TH-MYCN mice. We established suitable spheroid culture condition that selectively isolates undifferentiated neuroblasts from superior mesenteric ganligon (SMG) of TH-MYCN mice. In the present study, in order to investigate the transcriptomic differences among 3-week-old WT SMG, TH-MYCN (hemizygote) SMG, and TH-MYCN (hemizygote) spheres, we carried out microarray gene expression analysis. We investigated whether or not undifferentiated cells observed in TH-MYCN SMG were selectively isolated and maintaned as spheres.

DESIGN
SMG tissue were dissected from 3-week-old WT and TH-MYCN (hemizygote) mice (biological replicate is eight). Primary spheres were cultured from 3-week-old TH-MYCN (hemizygote) mice (biological replicate is eight). And the primary spheres were  passaged 5 times (biological replicate is four, and array replicate is two for each biological replicate). They were subjected to micorarray analyis.
