TITLE
Streptomyces hygroscopicus 5008 Transcriptome or Gene expression

ORGANISM
Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. jinggangensis 5008

SUMMARY
The RNA sequencing approach was utilized to carry out a comparative transcriptome analysis between Streptomyces hygroscopicus 5008 wild-type and a genetically engineered strain. The A-factor-like cascade play an important role in the regulation of validamycin biosynthesis by Streptomyces hygroscopicus 5008, and the pleiotropic regulator AdpA-H may positively regulate the transcription of gene cluster for the biosynthesis. shbR1 and shbR3 as the A-factor receptor homolog genes,  could repress the transcription of AdpA-H. By tandem deletions of these genes, the production and productivity of validamcyin was significantly enhanced.  To explore the effects of the shbR1/R3 double deletion of the overall cellular metabolism, the RNA sequencing approach was utilized to carry out a comparative transcriptome analysis between wild-type and shbR1/shbR3 double mutant (genetically engineered strain).

DESIGN
The trancriptome analysis between 5008 and DM98 was carried out respectively.
