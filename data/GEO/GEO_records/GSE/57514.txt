TITLE
Transcriptome profile of oocytes expressing a catalytically inactive knock-in allele of Ago2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The RNase III enzyme DICER generates both microRNAs (miRNAs) and endogenous short interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs). Dicer deletion in mouse oocytes leads to female infertility due to defects during meiosis I. Because miRNA function is suppressed in mouse oocytes, it has been proposed that endo-siRNAs may have a role during female meiosis. By utilizing a catalytically inactive knock-in allele of AGO2 specifically in oocytes, we disrupt the function of siRNAs and analyze the transcriptome of these oocytes in comparison with Ago2 null, and Dicer null oocytes.

DESIGN
Germinal vesicle-intact, full-grown oocytes were collected from eCG-primed females expressing a catalytically inactive knock-in allele of Ago2 (Ago2 ADH) specifically in oocytes. Oocytes were also collected from Ago2 null and Ago2 fl/fl oocytes, as well as Dicer wild-type and null mice. Oocytes were freed of attached cumulus cells by pipetting. Twenty oocytes collected from 3 different mice were used for high-throughput RNA sequencing. Three replicates for all genotypes except Ago2 null (two). The mouse background strain is " mostly " C57BL6, i.e., it is a cross between 3 different transgenic mice of different strains.
