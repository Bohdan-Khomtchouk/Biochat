TITLE
HNRNPL RIP-seq in LNCaP prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with next generation sequencing (RIP-seq)  was used to map the HNRNPL-RNA interactome in LNCaP cells.

DESIGN
Analysis of RIP-seq and total RNA data enabled the identification of the HNRNPL binding sites in the LNCaP cell transcriptome.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
