TITLE
Comparison of microRNA expression using different preservation methods of matched psoriatic skin samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression profiling in matched lesional skin samples from 25 patients with psoriasis using the miRNA analysis platform miRCURY LNATM MicroRNA array (v. 11.0) (Exiqon). Aim: To explore the effect of three different preservation methods (Formalin-fixation paraffin-embedding (FFPE), frozen (FS) and OCT-embedding (OCT)) on miRNA expression levels in matched lesional skin samples from 25 patients with psoriasis.
