TITLE
Genome wide analysis of gene expression of rat ES cells, rat embryonic fibroblast cells and mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rat ES cells were derived using 3I medium from E4.5 blastocysts. Rat embryonic fibroblast cells were derived form E14.5 embryos. To analyze the mechanism under the  selfrenewal of rat ES cells, microarrays were used for the genome wide analysis of gene expressoin profiles in rat ES cells. Rat embryonic fibroblast cells and mouse ES cells were tested at same time as control. Our results from clustering analysis demonstrated that the gene expression profile of rat ES cells resembles mouse ES cells, but not REFs. Keyword: 3I medium; rat embryonic stem cells; mouse ES cells; rat embryonic fibroblast cells
