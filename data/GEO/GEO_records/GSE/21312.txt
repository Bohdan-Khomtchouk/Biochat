TITLE
Gene expression in a Geobacter sulfurreducens strain adapted for faster Fe(III) oxide reduction grown with ferric citrate as an electron acceptor

ORGANISM
Geobacter sulfurreducens

SUMMARY
Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA was put under selective pressure for rapid Fe(III) oxide reduction. The resultant strain, V1, contained five confirmed mutations and reduced Fe(III) oxide 17 times faster. Whole genome DNA microarray analysis was performed in order to determine which genes are up- or down-regulated in V1 compared to PCA, both grown with ferric citrate as an electron acceptor.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were hybridized in duplicate. Experimental (V1) was labeled with cy5, control (wild type PCA) was labeled with cy3.
