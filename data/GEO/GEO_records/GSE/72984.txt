TITLE
Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from human mesenchymal stem cells of parotid gland origin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis between PMSCs and PMSC-iPSCs

DESIGN
We compared the global gene expression between  PMSCs and PMSC-iPSCs using the Affymetrix Human U133 gene chip. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool. No techinical replicates were performed.
