TITLE
Study of gene networks in basal progenitors during cortical neurogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During cortical development neurons are generated sequentially from basal progenitors (BPs) which specifically express the transcription factor Tbr2. We used fluorescent-activaed cell sorting (FACS) to isolate BPs from Tbr2GFP knockin reporter mice (Arnold SJ et al. Genesis, 2009) at early (embryonic day, E13) and late (embryonic day, E16) stages of cortical neurogenesis and determined mRNA expression profiles using mouse mRNA microarray  (Illumina MouseWG-6 v2). Comparison of E13 and E16 mRNA expression profiles allowed us to identify regulatory gene networks for maintaining stage specific homeostasis of BPs throughout neurogenesis.

DESIGN
FACS isolated BPs at E13 and E16 mouse brain cortex were used for microarray analyses.  Six biological replicates (embryonic cortex from three different litters) for E13 and five biological replicates (embryonic cortex from three different litters) for E16 were analysed.
