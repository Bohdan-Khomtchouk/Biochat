ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HepG2 cells were exposed to similar concentrations of BaP in two different laboratories (2.5 uM at Institute of Cancer Research and 3 uM at Maastricht University)for 6 and 24 h. Gene expression was analysed by Agilent oligonucleotide microarrays and Cancer Research UK (CR-UK) cDNA microarrays. An inter-laboratory and inter-platform comparison were performed on the data. Keywords: other

DESIGN
1 samples  - cells exposed to benzo(a)pyrene dissolved in DMSO were compared to cells exposed to DMSO alone

PLATFORM
