TITLE
microRNA array analysis for seaching IGBP1-targeting microRNA in lung adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Immunoglobulin (CD79a) binding protein 1 (IGBP1) is universally overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma and exerts an anti-apoptotic effect by binding to PP2Ac. However, the molecular mechanism of IGBP1 overexpression is still unclear. In the present study, we used a microRNA (miRNA) array and TargetScan Human software to detect IGBP1-related miRNAs that regulate IGBP1 expression.
