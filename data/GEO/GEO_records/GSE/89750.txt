TITLE
microRNA array analysis for seaching IGBP1-targeting microRNA in lung adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Immunoglobulin (CD79a) binding protein 1 (IGBP1) is universally overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma and exerts an anti-apoptotic effect by binding to PP2Ac. However, the molecular mechanism of IGBP1 overexpression is still unclear. In the present study, we used a microRNA (miRNA) array and TargetScan Human software to detect IGBP1-related miRNAs that regulate IGBP1 expression.

DESIGN
microRNA array was performed using IGBP1-positive small invasive adenocarcinoma of lung and IGBP1-negative minimally invasive adenocarcnoma of lung

PLATFORM
GPL18940 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, 6th generation - hsa, mmu & rno [miRBase 18.0]
