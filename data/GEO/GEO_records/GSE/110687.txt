TITLE
Chromatine immunoprecipation of atonal binding sites in Drosophila L3 Brains

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Atonal is a proneural transcription factor expressed in the Drosophila neuroblast cluster known as the inner proliferation center (IPC). To characterize the putative targes of Atonal in the IPC we have used an endogenously GFP-tagged version of atonal to immunoprecipate brain samples with anti-GFP antibodies

DESIGN
L3 larvae of the Ato::GFP genotype where dissected to collect developing brains. The fixed sample was homogenized by sonication. A 10% of the sonicated volume was processed as input controls while the rest was Immunoprecipitated with antiGFP antibodies, purified and sequence.

PLATFORM
GPL19132 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
