TITLE
Gene expression profile of Baf3 cells conditionally expressing BCR-ABL in presence and absence of Growth factor IL-3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Baf3 are dependent on IL-3 for grwoth however transformation by BCR -ABL oncogene causes BAf3 cells independent of IL-3. The BAf3 cells expressing BCR-ABL are dependent on continuous expression of BCR_ABL for growth. Inhibitionof BCR-ABL by its inhibitor Imatinib cause these cells to undergo apoptosis. When these cells are grown with IL-3  these cells do not respond to Imatinib mediated grwoth arrest.

DESIGN
This experiment was  design to test the expression of genes driven by BCR-ABL and Growth factor that provides resistance to Imatinib treatment.
