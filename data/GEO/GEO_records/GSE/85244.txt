TITLE
Gene expression profile of LNCaP prostate cancer cells with exogenous HNF4G  expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine genes regulated by HNF4G, we retrovirally infected LNCaP cells in triplicates to express HNF4G  and empty vector  as  control. cDNA for HNF4G in pDONR201 vector was obtained from Harvard medical school Plasmid database (ID:HsCD00022314) and was cloned into an murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-based retroviral vector with puromycin selection marker (Addgene) using Gateway technology.

DESIGN
LNCaP cells were infected with retroviruses in triplicates for HNF4G and control empty vector expression. After three days of infection cells were selcted with puromycin for two days and later on RNA was harvested for gene expression analysis.
