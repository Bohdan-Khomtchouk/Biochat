TITLE
Jurkat T cell gene expression with IKKe gene knockdown and PMA and ionomycin stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray to monitor the differentially expresed genes during Jurkat T cell activaiton.

DESIGN
Jurkat T cells with control shRNA or IKKe shRNA were treated with solvent or PMA and ionomycin for 3 h, and then RNA was extracted and applied to microarray analysis
