TITLE
Applied Biosystems Human TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA) in HCC tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are aberrant expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and play a central role in diverse biological processes. We conducted a genome-wide miRNAs screening in 10 pairs of HCC tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues to test the hypothesis that dysregulation of miRNAs in HCC tumor tissue are partially due to aberrant methylation in relevant miRNAs host genes. Taqman low density arrays were used to examine miRNA profiles in paired HCC tissues, and quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate candidate miRNAs for both discovery and validation sets.

DESIGN
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 HCC tumor tissues and 10 adjacent non-tumor tissues in Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC), which is approved by the Institutional Review Board.
