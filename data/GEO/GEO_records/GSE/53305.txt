TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of retinal progenitors, exposed to endothelial cells or EGF

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Retinal histogenesis occurs over an extended period, which necessitates retinal progenitors to self-renew to sustain the temporal generation of diverse cell types. Embryonic day 18 retinal cells showed self-renewal properties such as clonal propagation without compromising multipotentiality when grown in the presence of endothelial cell conditioned medium and not EGF alone.

DESIGN
Timed pregnant Sprague Dawley (Embryonic day 18) rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Embryos were harvested and enucleated. Retinae were dissected out and dissociated by trypsin-EDTA followed by manual trituration. The retinal cells  obtained from 10 embryos were cultured  in the presence of EGF (condition1) or EGF and Endothelial cell conditioned medium (condition 2) to obtain neurospheres. To get biological replicate for both conditions, another batch of embryos were pooled and subjected to neurosphere formation. Total RNA was extracted from both conditions using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit following manufacturer's protocol. The RNA was subjected to microarray analysis using Affymetrix Rat 230 2.0 platform  by UNMC microarray Core facility. RMA analysis was performed using Genepattern software. Log2 transformed values of each condition was used to obtain fold change of specific genes.
