TITLE
Aspergillus nidulans: Control (Wt) vs. ypkA induction or repression (alcAypkA)

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. nidulans comparing the mutant strain alcAypkA grown on inducing or repressing conditions. The main objective was to identifiy genes related to ypkA gene function. The experiment was further validated by real-time PCR and enzymatic assay.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment: A. nidulans strains grown during 16 and 24 h at 37Â°C in glucose 4% or glycerol 2% threonine 100mM.

PLATFORM
GPL15870 Agilent-029535 Aspergillus nidulans FGSC A4 array [Feature Number version]
