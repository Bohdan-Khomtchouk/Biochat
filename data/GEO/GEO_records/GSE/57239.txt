TITLE
Gene induction in mouse C57BL6 kidney cortex by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (captopril)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Attempt to identify genes whose expression changed in the kidney cortex with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.

DESIGN
Eleven week-old male C57BL6 mice were treated with captopril at 10mg/kg/day in drinking water for 7 days. The kidney cortex was surgically excised and total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) from three treated and three control mice and was further purified using RNeasy MinElute Cleanup spin columns (Qiagen) according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Probes generated from the resulting RNA were hybridized to Illumina Expression BeadChips (mouseWG-6_V2).
