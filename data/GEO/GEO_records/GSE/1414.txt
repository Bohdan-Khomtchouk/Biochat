TITLE
Gene expression of bovine embryo

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The objective of the present study was to use our own fabricated bovine embryo cDNA microarray to profile genome-wide expression patterns of genes during the implantation period. Duplicate readings were obtained by hybridization of a Cy3/Cy5 probe mixture for each sample. Data normalization was performed the local background intensity of each array spot was smoothed by the local weight regression (lowess) smoother and subtracted from spot intensity data. The subtracted intensity data were subjected to non-parametric regression and local variance normalization because non-parametric regression can reduce intensity-depended biases. Accuracy is improved, when compared to linear regression, if the points in the scatter plot of Cy3 vs. Cy5 are not distributed around a straight line. Keywords = Gene expression Keywords = embryo Keywords = fetus Keywords = fetal membrane Keywords = implantation period Keywords: time-course
