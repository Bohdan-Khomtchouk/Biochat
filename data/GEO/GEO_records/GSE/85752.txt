TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of retrogradely labeled stellate neurons in LII of the rat medial entorhinal cortex

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We compared miRNA expression in FACS-sorted, retrogradely labeled stellate neurons with other medial entorhinal cells, and found 7 miRNAs to be upregulated in stellate cells.

DESIGN
qPCR array expression profiling of FACS sorted labeled and unlabeled cells from five biological replicates. qPCR array expression profiling of total RNA from dissected medial entorhinal cortex of two biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL22335 Applied Biosystems Taqman miRNA
