TITLE
SNHG5 promotes colorectal cancer cell survival by counteracting STAU1-mediated mRNA destabilization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We functionally characterize SNHG5 as an important lncRNA, which could constitute a  new therapeutic target in colorectal cancer, and provide a novel mechanism of action for a  cytoplasmic lncRNA

DESIGN
RNA pull down of SNHG5 in HCT-116 cells and subsequent sequencing of the transcriptional interactome

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
