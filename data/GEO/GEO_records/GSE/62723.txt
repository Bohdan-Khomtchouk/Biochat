TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of miR-552-3p- and miR-608-mediated gene silencing in A549 lung cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of changes in gene expression after transfection with miR-552-3p or miR-608 mimic in A549 cells

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from  A549 cells transfected with miR-552-3p or miR-608 or negative control mimic, and gene expression  was compared using microarrays.
