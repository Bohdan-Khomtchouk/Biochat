TITLE
Comparison of human PRDM12 mutants D31Y and E172D with wildtype fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fibroblasts from PRDM12 patients and unaffected wildtype relatives were cultured until near confluency. The transcriptional profile of those cells was determined by mRNA sequencing and uncovered differential expression in several known pain and neurodevelopmental genes.
