TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3' poly(A) site mapping

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The use of alternative polyadenylation sites is common and affects the post-transcriptional fate of mRNA, including its stability, localization, and translation. Here we present a method for genome-wide and strand-specific mapping of poly(A) sites and quantification of RNA levels at unprecedented efficiency by using an on-cluster dark T-fill procedure on the Illumina sequencing platform. Our method outperforms former protocols in quality and throughput, and reveals new insights into polyadenylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

DESIGN
Experimental benchmark of five different protocols (3tfill, bpmI, internal, rnaseq and yoon) for genome-wide identification of polyadenylation sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and transcript quantification. RNA was extracted from WT cells grown in glucose (ypd) or galactose (ypgal) as carbon source. The same RNA was used for 3 independent library constructions (technical replicates, rep).
