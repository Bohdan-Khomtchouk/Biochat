TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in M. tuberculosis TrxB2-DUC mutant treated or not with atc

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
M. tuberculosis thioredoxin reductase (TrxB2) is essential for bacterial survival in vitro and in vivo. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying lethality caused by TrxB2 depletion, we compared the mRNA profiles of TrxB2-DUC mutant in the presence and absence of atc.

DESIGN
We grew bacteria in 7H9 medium to an OD of 0.5~0.6 and then added atc to a final concentration of 400ng/ml. Samples were collected 6 h and 24 h after atc treatment.
