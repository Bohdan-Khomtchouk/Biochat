TITLE
Fgf18 regulates hair cycle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fgf18 gene is strongly expressed in hair follicles of mouse dorsal skin during regressing (catagen) and resting (telogen) phases of hair cycle, but not in growth (anagen) phase.  This study aims at identifying the function of Fgf18 in the regulation of hair cycle.
