TITLE
Expression Data from  Allogeneic Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Primary Cultures of Human Alveolar Epithelial Type II Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe syndrome affecting more than 200,000 patients annually in the U.S.  New studies are needed to understand the biological and clinical mechanisms that impair alveolar epithelial function. Also, innovative  therapies are needed for the resolution of pulmonary edema in ARDS. We and other investigators have reported that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are effective in preclinical models of ALI due to their ability to secrete several paracrine factors that can regulate lung endothelial and epithelial permeability, including growth factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and antimicrobial peptides. So in this study we will test the therapeutic value of human MSCs in an in vitro model of acute lung injury induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines. We will identify differentially expressed genes in primary cultures of human alveolar epithelial type II cells and human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells using Affymetrix gene expression arrays.

DESIGN
Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and human alveolar epithelial type II cells were co-cultured in a transwell system. The cells were stimulated with cytomix (a combination of different pro-inflammatory cytokines) under different conditions. Cells were harvested for  Affymetrix gene expression arrays. Total 25 samples are analyzed, 3~5 replicates are included.
