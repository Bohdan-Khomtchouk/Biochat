TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression changes in mouse tongue squamous cell carcinomas induced by 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that the expression of many genes are dysregulated during oral cancer carcinogenesis.  We examined genome-wide transcript levels in normal mouse tongues and the tongue squamous cell carcinomas induced by 4-NQO. The results will provide important information for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of human oral cancers, including tongue cancer.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from normal tongues (not treated with 4-NQO) and tongue squamous cell carcinomas induced by 4-NQO.

PLATFORM
