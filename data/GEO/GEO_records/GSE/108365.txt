TITLE
Functional subnetwork modules and hub gene discovery using RNA-Seq (wild type Fusarium verticillioides and the FSR1 mutant)

ORGANISM
Zea mays ; Fusarium verticillioides

SUMMARY
Using RNA-Seq datasets, we identified subnetwork modules (group of genes) and key functional (hub) genes associated with the fungal pathogenicity by developing a computational pipeline with network-based comparative analusis approach

DESIGN
Network-based comparative analysis between wild type Fusarium verticillioides and the FSR1 mutant

PLATFORM
GPL24415 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Fusarium verticillioides; Zea mays)
