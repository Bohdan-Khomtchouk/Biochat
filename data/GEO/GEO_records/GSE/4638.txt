ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In order to study the Nep1 responsive genes in Arabidopsis, experiments were performed with the Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array (Santa Clara, CA; Cat # 900385). Keywords: Arabidopsis, Nep1, Affymetrix GenChip

DESIGN
Seven-day old Arabidopsis seedlings were exposed to Nep1 (10 ug/mL) treatment or using sterilized, deionized H2O as a control for 30 min.  Two independent biological replications were conducted using two independent samples and two microarrays.
