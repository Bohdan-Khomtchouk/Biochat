TITLE
Smoking and Obesity Related Molecular Alterations in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Both cigarette smoking and obesity have been implicated in increased risk of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC); however, there are limited data   regarding the molecular mechanisms that underlie these associations.  We used a multi-stage design to identify and validate specific molecular targets that are associated with smoking or obesity-related ccRCC.

DESIGN
The data deposited herein are comprised of two batches of samples that were processed at two different time periods (please see Supplementary Data in Eckel-Passow et al. Carcinogenesis first published online December 28, 2013; doi:10.1093/carcin/bgt485).  The first batch of samples consisted of 12 obese subjects and 13 non-obese subjects; all of whom were self-reported never-smokers.  Each of the 12 obese subjects had  microarray data available on both the patient-matched tumor and adjacent-normal tissues.  All of the 13 non-obese subjects had microarray data available on the tumor tissue; however, only 9 of these 13 also had microarray data available on the patient-matched adjacent-normal tissue.  The second batch of samples consisted of 16 self-reported smokers and 19 self-reported never smokers; all of whom were non-obese.   This second batch of samples also contained 7 subjects who were obese and self-reported smokers.  All subjects in the second batch had microarray data available on both the patient-matched tumor and adjacent-normal tissues.  Lastly, two of the 13 patients in batch 1 were replicated in batch 2; both were non-obese and a non-smoker.  These two technical replicates (two tumor samples and two normal samples) were included during normalization but removed prior to analysis.  The cel files are Par007U133Plus2.0.CEL Par008U133Plus2.0.CEL Par041U133Plus2.0.CEL Par042U133Plus2.0.CEL The metadata " duplicate " column can also be used to exclude these samples.
