TITLE
Functional characterization of hGRβ Isoform in mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used AAV as a vector to deliver hGRβ to C57BL/6 mouse liver. We collected liver samples for microarray analysis to investigate any phenotype as well as the underlying specific signaling pathway. In particular, we would like to determine if and how hGRβ overexpression in liver affects mGRα’s gene transcription profile in C57BL/6 mice.

DESIGN
Three replicates for each group: untreated WT liver, AAV-GFP treated liver, and AAV-hGRB treated liver.
