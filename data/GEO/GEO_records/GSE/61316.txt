TITLE
Pioneer factors govern super-enhancer dynamics in stem cell plasticity and lineage choice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse hair follicles undergo synchronized cycles. Cyclical regeneration and hair growth is fueled by hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and transit-amplifying cells (TACs). We used ChIP-seq to unfold genome-wide chromatin landscapes of H3K27ac and Med1 to identify super-enhancers and dissect their biological relevance in cell identity and plasticity of HFSCs in vivo and in vitro.

DESIGN
Telogen quiescent hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and transit-amplifying cells (TACs) were FACS-purified for ChIP-sequcencing. Furthermore, cultured HFSCs were used for ChIP-sequencing.
