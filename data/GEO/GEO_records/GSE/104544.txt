TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Drosophila WT and dDP-/- mutant larvae.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
WT and dDP-/- mutant larvae RNAs were analyzed on Drosophila 12 x 135 Nimbelgen gene expression microarrays. dDP-/- mutants are described in Frolov et al., 2001. Genes Dev. Aug 15;15(16):2146-60. PMID: 11511545 The complete elimination of E2F/DP function in Drosophila results in upregulation of DNA damage responses. The net effect of E2F regulation in larval tissues is that all classes of E2F target genes are reppressed by E2F/DP complexes.

DESIGN
Drosophila 12 x 135 Nimbelgen gene expression microarrays were prepared with triplicates of larval RNA from WT and dDP-/- mutant larvae.
