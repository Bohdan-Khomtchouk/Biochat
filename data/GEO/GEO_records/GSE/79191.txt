TITLE
The dose-dependent role of PU.1 in Myeloid differentiation [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A doxycycline-inducible system was used to induce PU.1 expression in cultured myeloid cell lines. The parent cell line used was BN (Kamath et al., Leukemia 22:1214-1225, 2008).

DESIGN
ChIP-seq using an anti-PU.1 antibody was prepared from uninduced cells (2) and cells induced with 1000 ng/ml doxycycline for 72 hours (2)
