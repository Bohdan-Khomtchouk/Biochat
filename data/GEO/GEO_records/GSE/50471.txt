TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of ex vivo gene expression of 4T1 series mouse mammary tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of factors upregulated in highly aggressive 410.4 and 4T1 tumour cells compared to the less aggressive 4T07 tumour cells at gene expression level. The question addressed in the present study was which secreted factors are differentially expressed by these cells and therefore could account for the observed difference in fibroblast activation in these tumours. Results provide important characterisation of the ex vivo expression profiles of highly aggressive vs. non-aggressive tumour cells.

DESIGN
4T07, 410.4 or 4T1 cells were inoculated into the mammary fat pad of Ub-GFP mice and total RNA from FACSorted GFP-negative; CD45-negative tumour cells was isolated.
