TITLE
RNA-sequencing of human intestinal enteroids infected with or without human rotavirus (strain Ito)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the human intestinal epithelial host transcriptional response to human enteric virus infection using primary human intestinal enteroids cultures as a model system.

DESIGN
Human intestinal enteroids from two different individuals were mock-infected or human rotavirus (strain Ito) infected.  At 6 hpi, total RNA was extracted.  The RNA was rRNA-reduced and then sequenced.
