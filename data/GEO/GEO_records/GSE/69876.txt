TITLE
EP400 is required for Max and MCPyV mediated gene activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine if EP400 knockdown would affect Max target genes in Merkel cell carcinoma cell line MKL-1, we performed RNA-seq analyses of MKL-1 cells inducibly expressing EP400 shRNA and compared to ChIP-seq data using BETA analyses.

DESIGN
EP400 was inducibly reduced with shRNA in MKL-1 cells to analyze gene regulation.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
