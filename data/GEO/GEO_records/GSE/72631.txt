TITLE
Effects on the transcriptome upon deletion of distal elements are not correlated with the size of H3K27Ac peaks in human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). A molecular understanding of the functional consequences of this genetic variation is complicated because most GWAS SNPs are located in non-coding regions. After identifying H3K27Ac peaks in HCT116 colon cancer cells that harbor SNPs associated with an increased risk for CRC, we used CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease to delete 2 CRC risk-associated H3K27Ac peaks (E7 and E24), a peak that is not associated with CRC risk (18qE) and a region that doesn?t have H3K27Ac peak (18qNE) from HCT116 cells and analyzed effects on the transcriptome and epigenome. We also deleted E7 region from HEK 293 cells and analyzed effects on the transcriptome of HEK 293. We also confirmed the physical interaction between enhancers of our interest and their putative target genes.

DESIGN
Analysis of RNA-seq data and ChIP-seq between control clones and enhancer deleted clones in HCT116 cell. For Control, gRNA empty vectorplasmid was transfected with Cas9-GFP. For Deletion, gRNAs that have enhancer target sequences were transfected along with Cas9-GFP. Cells with high GFP expression were identified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Sorted cells were plated into individual wells of a 24 well plate and then re-plated as single cells in 10cm dishes and subsequently expanded for further analyses. Samples used in this study were clonal populations. Interaction profiling of enhancers of interest with putative target genes using 4C-seq
