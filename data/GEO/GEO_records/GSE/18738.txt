TITLE
Bovine Hypertrophic Growth Plate Chondrocytes vs. Reserve Zone Chondrocytes

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Growth plate chondrocytes were isolated from the distal metacarpus of young dairy cattle (all under 10 mo of age), the chondrocytes were released from the extracellular matrix by digestion with Collagenase P for 4 hours, and the various zones of the growth plate were separated by density centrifugation. The least-dense Hypertrophic Zone (HZ) cells were compared to the most-dense Reserve Zone (RZ) cells. 6 pairs of HZ vs RZ were compared by microarray.

DESIGN
Growth plate chondrocytes were isolated from the distal metacarpus of young dairy cattle (all under 10 mo of age), the chondrocytes were released from the extracellular matrix by digestion with Collagenase P for 4 hours, and the various zones of the growth plate were separated by density centrifugation. The least-dense Hypertrophic Zone (HZ) cells were compared to the most-dense Reserve Zone (RZ) cells.  Six independent sample pairs of HZ vs RZ were compared by microarray.
