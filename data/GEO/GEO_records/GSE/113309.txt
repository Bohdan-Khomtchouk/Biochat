TITLE
BMI1 drives metastasis of prostate cancer in Caucasian and African-American men and is a potential therapeutic target: hypothesis tested in race-specific models

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MDA-PCa2b cells  were treated with PCT-209 or control (DMSO) for 24h and subjected to the qRT-PCR based microarray analysis (Qiagen, Germantown, MD).

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. Metaststic African american prostate cancer cell line MDA-Pca2b cells were treated with BMI-1 inhibitor PTC-209  or control  as indicated in the summary. Equal amount total RNA from Treated and control was used for gene expression analysis.
