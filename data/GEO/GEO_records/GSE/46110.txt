TITLE
Effects of Brazilian propolis on gene expression of stromal cells in mesenteric adipose tissue of ob/ob mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A hive product propolis has been used for folk medicine for more than 4, 000 years. So far, several line of studies demonstrated that propolis improved glucose metabolism in obese models. In this study, we inverstigated whether  propolis modulates stromal cells of mesenteric adipose tissue of ob/ob mice.

DESIGN
Male ob/ob mice were inhjected with Brazilian propolis ethanol extract  (100mg/kg ip, twice a week) or vehicle for 12 weeks. Subsequently, vasucular stromal fraction was prepared from mesenteric adipose tissue. Total cellular RNA extracted from the fraction was used for microarray analysis. Biological triplicates were subjected.
