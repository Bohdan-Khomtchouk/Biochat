TITLE
Leishmania infantum: Alba20 null mutant Vs wild type

ORGANISM
Leishmania infantum

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of an LiAlba20 (LinJ.34.2410) null mutant strain versus Wild type. Experiments were run with promastigotes and axenic amastigotes independently. Null mutant was produced by homologous recombination, replacing both alleles with Hygromycin phosphotransferase and Puromycin.

DESIGN
Two independent experiments, each samples were used as triplicates

PLATFORM
GPL11330 Agilent custom Leishmania microarray v2
