TITLE
Purification of TAP::ALG-1 complexes and associated RNA from mixed-stage TAP::ALG-1 transgenic (WS4303) and wild-type (N2) animals

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To discover new miRNA targets, we generated a C. elegans transgenic line expressing a functional N-terminally Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) tagged ALG-1 protein We purified TAP::ALG-1 complexes from mixed-stage TAP::ALG-1 transgenic (WS4303) and wild-type (N2, serving as a mock control) animals and hybridized the associated mRNAs to two-color microarrays

DESIGN
RNA isolated from WS4303 and N2 (mock control) animals was analyzed for each IP sample and for each total worm extract sample. Three independent biological replicates have been performed. Long-oligo whole-genome C. elegans arrays, produced by the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University in St. Louis ( http://genome.wustl.edu/genome/celegans/microarray/ma_gen_info.cgi ), were used for analysis. Log2 ratios (immunopurified RNA over total RNA from extract) were calculated for each gene. Microarrays generated from WS4303 animals were compared to microarrays generated from N2 mock control animals by a Student’s two sample t test.
