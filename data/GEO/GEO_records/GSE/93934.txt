TITLE
Co-chaperone Hop/dSTIP1 is required for piRNA biogenesis and transposon silencing

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
piRNAs are 26-30nt germ-line specific small non-coding RNAs that have evolutionarily conserved function in mobile genetic element silencing and maintenance of genome integrity. It has been shown that Drosophila Hsp70/90 Organizing Protein Homolog (Hop) – a co-chaperone interacts with piRNA binding protein Piwi and mediates silencing of phenotypic variations. However, it is not known if Hop has a direct role in piRNA biogenesis and transposon silencing. Here, we show that knock down of Hop in the germ-line nurse cells (GLKD) of Drosophila ovaries leads to activation of transposable elements. Females without germ-line Hop can lay eggs but the eggs do not hatch into larvae. GLKD of Hop leads to accumulation of γ-H2Av foci in the germline indicating increased DNA damage in the ovary. We also show that Hop is required for efficient piRNA biogenesis. Based on these results, we conclude that Hop is a critical component of piRNA pathway and it maintains genome integrity by silencing transposable elements.
