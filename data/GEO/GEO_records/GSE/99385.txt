TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of CD133 overexpressed U87MG glioblastoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study investigated the biological function of CD133 by ectopic expression of CD133 in U87MG cell line. Although CD133 is widely used as a cancer stem cell marker, there are a few studies that examined its own biological functions. While a number of loss-of-function studies about CD133 have shown that CD133 have effects on cancer progression, there are few gain-of-function studies about functions of CD133. Thus, we identified the potential function of CD133 by its overexpression in U87MG glioblastoma cell line. Though there were no significant changes in cell growth and sphere forming ability, elevated IL-1β and its downstream chemokines (CCL3, CXCL3, CXCL5) may function as chemoattractants which affect recruitment of Ly6G+ neutrophils surrounding necrotic regions in vivo and migration of neutrophil-like dHL-60 cells. Taken together, this results imply that CD133 can regulate IL-1β signaling, and promotes the environmental change.

DESIGN
A Glioblastoma cell line, U87MG, was transfected with pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-Puro (U87MG-control) or pCDH-CMV-CD133-EF1-Puro (U87MG-CD133). Plasmids for CD133 overexpression (NM_001145847) were gifted by Dr. Young-Gyu Ko (Korea University). The 3 biological replicate of RNA extracts in these cells was used for transcriptome analysis.
