TITLE
Identification of binding sites for σ54 (RpoN) in Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC14028 [ChIP]

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. ATCC 14028

SUMMARY
ChIP-chip analysis of DNA specifically bound to anti-σ54 from mid-exponentially growing Salmonella enterica sv Typhimurium ATCC14028 wild type and ΔrpoN mutant cultures containing plasmid pPBHP192 expressing protein DctD250

DESIGN
DNA specifically bound to anti-σ54 was harvested from mid-exponentially growing Salmonella enterica sv Typhimurium ATCC14028 wild type (three biological replicates) and ΔrpoN mutant (two replicates) cultures that contain plasmid pPBHP192 (expressing protein DctD250). DNA was labeled and hybridized to an overlapping high density oligo array.
