TITLE
Gene expression profiling of peripheral blood and alveolar recruited mononuclear phagocytes in Pam3CSK4 treated mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aim of this project was to examine the global gene expression profiles of mononuclear phagocytes recruited from peripheral blood to the alveolar space following alveolar deposition of the TLR2-ligand Pam3CSK4 in transgenic CX3CR1+/GFP mice.
