TITLE
Gene expression profiling of peripheral blood and alveolar recruited mononuclear phagocytes in Pam3CSK4 treated mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aim of this project was to examine the global gene expression profiles of mononuclear phagocytes recruited from peripheral blood to the alveolar space following alveolar deposition of the TLR2-ligand Pam3CSK4 in transgenic CX3CR1+/GFP mice.

DESIGN
Alveolar macrophages (AM) and peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) were isolated from broncho-alveolar lavages and from blood, respectively, using FACS. Expression profiles from AM and PBM of the same mice were compared on the same slides. Each labeled RNA sample contained RNA pooled from six individuals. Four pairs of RNA from corresponding AM and PBM pools were hybridized, giving a total amount of 24 individual mice analyzed. Two hybridizations were performed with AM labeled with Cy3 and PBM with Cy5, two hybridizations were performed with swaped dyes.
