TITLE
Differentially expressed genes in isolated postnatal AP2e WT and null VNOs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Understanding the molecular mechanisms defining and maintaining the identity of a specific neuronal cell type is a central goal in neuroscience. The vomeronasal organ (VNO) of mice contains hundreds of distinct vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs). The VSNs are classified into two major cell types that are segregated in apical and basal regions of the VNO, express vomeronasal receptors of different superfamilies, and send axons to different portions of the accessory olfactory bulb. How apical or basal identity of VSNs is established and maintained is largely unknown. Here we attempt to assess the role of a single transcription factor, AP-2ε, in the VNO of mice. We used microarrays to examine global effect of AP-2ε loss-of-function on gene expression in the vomeronasal organ.
