TITLE
Enterococcus faecalis downregulates virulence genes of EHEC

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. EDL933

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of EHEC grown in vitro with or without Symbioflor® was analyzed using RNA-seq. The analysis revealed downregulation of several virulence-associated genes in the presence of Symbioflor®, including virulence key genes (e.g., LEE, flagellum, quorum-sensing).

DESIGN
EHEC were grown on LB medium, either with or without Symbioflor added.
