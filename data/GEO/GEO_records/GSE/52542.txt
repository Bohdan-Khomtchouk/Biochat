TITLE
VEGF Isoform Transcriptome Changes in the E9.5 Murine Forebrain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulation of neural stem cell (NSC) fate decisions is critical during the transition from a multicellular mammalian forebrain neuroepithelium to the multilayered neocortex. Forebrain development requires coordinated vascular investment alongside NSC differentiation. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegf) has proven to be a pleiotrophic gene whose multiple protein isoforms regulate a broad range of effects in neurovascular systems. To test the hypothesis that the Vegf isoforms (120, 164, and 188) are required for normal forebrain development, we analyzed the forebrain transcriptome of mice expressing specific Vegf isoforms, Vegf120, VegfF188, or a combination of Vegf120/188. Transcriptome analysis identified differentially expressed genes in embryonic day (E) 9.5 forebrain, a time point preceding dramatic neuroepithelial expansion and vascular investment in the telencephalon. Meta-analysis identified gene pathways linked to chromosome-level modifications, cell fate regulation, and neurogenesis that were altered in Vegf isoform mice.

DESIGN
Twelve E9.5 wildtype forebrain samples were compared to four E9.5 Vegf120 mouse forebrains, four E9.5 Vegf188 mouse forebrains, three E9.5 Vegf120/188 mouse forebrains, and four E11.5 wild type forebrains using the Mouse 430. 2.0 Affymetrix GeneChip. This study comprises of new samples and reanalysis of Samples from GSE30767 and GSE8091.
