TITLE
Dissecting the transcriptome landscape of mouse organogenesis by single-cell RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Organogenesis is crucial during mammalian embryonic development after implantation. However, the similarities among different organs and cellular heterogeneity during this process at single-cell resolution remain elusive. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of 1,814 individual cells from eight organs and tissues of E9.5 to E11.5 mouse embryos, including the forebrain, hindbrain, skin, heart, somite, lung, liver, and intestine. We identified 41 types of cells and their characteristic features of cell cycle, metabolism, signaling pathway, and expressions of transcription factor. We also reconstructed their developmental path during the organogenesis process. We captured key features of the hematopoiesis in the liver. Moreover, we identified the emergence of the innate immune cells in the skin and liver, smooth muscle cells in the forebrain, two populations of cardiomyocytes in the heart, and neural cells in somites. We also unveiled the unique differences among epithelial cells in different organs. Our work reveals the transcriptome landscape of mouse organogenesis at single-cell resolution and paves the way for future mechanistic studies of the gene regulatory networks involved in mouse organogenesis.
