TITLE
Sp7/Osterix is restricted to bone-forming vertebrates where it acts as a Dlx co-factor in osteoblast specification [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sp7/Osterix is a master regulator of osteoblast specification. To identify transcripts profile in Sp7 positive osteoblast, we performed RNA-seq on primary mouse calvarial cells obtained from Sp7-GFP reporter mice at P1. By hierarchical clustering using transcriptional profiles for chondrocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) together with the osteoblast data, we identified cell-type enriched gene expression signatures in osteoblasts, chondrocytes and MEFs. In conjunction with Sp7 ChIP-seq in osteoblast, we identified putative Sp7 targets which underlie the osteoblast regulatory program.

DESIGN
RNA-seq experiments with GFP-sorted Sp7 positive osteoblasts and chondrocytes isolated from wild-type rib cartilage at P1
