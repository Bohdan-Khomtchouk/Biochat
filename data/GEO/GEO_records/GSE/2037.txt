TITLE
carbon utilization in E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The study investigated the effect of different carbon sources on E. coli global gene expression. We grew MG1655 cells aerobically in MOPS minimal medium with either glucose, glycerol, succinate, L-alanine, acetate, or L-proline as the carbon supply. Samples were taken from each culture at mid log phase and were RNA-stabilized using Qiagen RNAProtect Bacterial Reagent (Qiagen). Total RNA was then isolated using MasterPure kits (Epicentre Technologies). Purified RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip√í E. coli Antisense Genome Arrays as recommended in the technical manual (www.affymetrix.com). Keywords: parallel sample
