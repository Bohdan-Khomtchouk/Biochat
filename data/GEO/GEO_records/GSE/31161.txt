TITLE
Expression data from primary multiple myeloma plasma cells from patients treated by  Total Therapy 2, 3 and Other protocols at baseline and relapse.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression profile of primary multiple myeloma plasma cells from patients treated in Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy was done using Affymetrix microarrays.

DESIGN
MMPC were isolated from patients following Total Therapy 2, 3 and Other treatments at baseline and/or after relapse and GEP was done.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
