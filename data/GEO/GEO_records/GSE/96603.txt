TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of depleted uranium effects on adult zebrafish and progeny

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
This dataset describe the transcriptomic profiling of adult brain, gonades (testis and ovaries) of adult zebrafish exposed to 20Âµg/L of depleted uranium for 10 days. The progeny of the exposed fishes were also analysed at two-cells stage and 96 hours post fertilization

DESIGN
Biological samples (adult dissected tissues and whole embryos and larvae) were tested by RNASeq in duplicates
