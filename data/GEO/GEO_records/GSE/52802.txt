SUMMARY
Membrane vesicles released by neoplastic cells into extracellular medium contain potential of carrying arrays of oncogenic molecules including proteins and microRNAs (miRNA). Extracellular (exosome-like) vesicles play a major role in cell-to-cell communication. Thus, the characterization of miRNAs of exosome-like vesicles is imperative in clarifying intercellular signaling as well as identifying disease markers. microarray analysis identified several oncogenic miRNA between the two types vesicles.

DESIGN
Exosome-like vesicles were isolated using gradient centrifugation from MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 cultures. Sample-derived miRNA expression was analyzed on Miltenyi's miRXplore™ platform. The RNA was isolated from two replicate samples of MDA-MB231 and MCF7 cell lines. The miRNAs extracted from all four samples were labeled with Hy5 and hybridized against Hy3-labeled Universal Reference miRNA (UR). Candidate miRNAs were identified. In this report, the re-ratios of MDA1 or MDA2 relative to a virtual pool of both MCF7 samples 1 and 2 were used for further analyses.   1- Reratio No. 7 MDA 1 vs MCF7 1+2  reratios of (MDA 1 vs UR) and (MCF7 1 vs UR + MCF7 2 vs UR)  7970041, (7970039 + 7970040)    2- Reratio No. 8 MDA 2 vs MCF7 1+2  reratios of (MDA 2 vs UR) and (MCF7 1 vs UR + MCF7 2 vs UR)  7970042, (7970039 + 7970040)  Exosome-like vesicles were isolated using gradient centrifugation from MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 cultures.
