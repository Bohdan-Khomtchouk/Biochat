TITLE
mTORC1 activation blocks BrafV600E-induced growth-arrest but is insufficient for melanoma formation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling was performed using uncultured melanocytes and melanoma cell from various mouse models of BrafV600E induced melanocytic proliferation Various genotypes were analyzed at different time points in melanomagenesis

DESIGN
RNA was purifired and hydridized to Affymetrix microarrays
