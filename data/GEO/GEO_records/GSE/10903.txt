TITLE
Early response of potato plants to virus (PVY-NTN) inoculation

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Potato virus YNTN (PVYNTN), causing potato tuber ring necrosis disease, dramatically lowers the quantity and the quality of the potato yield all over the world. The cultivar Igor is one of the most susceptible cultivars, developing severe disease symptoms on plants as well as on tubers. Finding genes differentially expressed in the early response to infection, when the host response is more defense- than infection- related, could improve our understanding of the potato - PVYNTN  interaction. Differential gene expression in early response of potato cv. Igor plants to PVYNTN infection was studied using potato TIGR cDNA-microarrays. Expression was compared between mock inoculated and virus infected plants 12 hours after inoculation, in four biological replicates. Keywords: direct comparison
