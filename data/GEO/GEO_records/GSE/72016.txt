TITLE
Mouse-specific skin and blood transcriptional responses after intradermal administration of flagellin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study aimed at defining the local and systemic innate responses after intradermal injection of flagellin. For this purpose, mice were immunized by intradermal route with flagellin. Skin and blood were then sampled at selected times for microarray analyses.

DESIGN
Mice were then immunized with the TLR5 agonist flagellin by intradermal route. Blood samples and punch biopsies of skin were sampled post-immunization and on mock animals. Total RNA was extracted and microarray experiments were performed as single-color hybridizations on Agilent 4x44K mouse whole genome catalog arrays (Agilent-014868) according supplier's recommendations.
