TITLE
Effect of TetR family regulator SAOUHSC_02897 deletion in S. aureus NCTC8325

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus NCTC 8325

SUMMARY
To analyze function of TetR family regulator SAOUHSC_02897, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes transcription changed in respective mutant strains. Target SAOUHSC_02897 was replaced by ermB gene.

DESIGN
Bacteria grown in the wells of biofilm formation at 12 hours, and the RNA level of wild type NCTC8325 and SAOUHSC-02897 mutant were compared.

PLATFORM
GPL17776 Agilent-037369 Staphylococcus aureus 3K
