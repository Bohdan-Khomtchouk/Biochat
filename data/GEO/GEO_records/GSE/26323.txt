TITLE
Human hepatocellular carcinoma: primary tumor vs.lung metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA exprssion profiling of HCC comparing primary tumor with lung metastasis. To explore differentially expressed microRNAs involved in process of HCC metastasis, and identify their biological functions.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, primary tumor specimens vs. lung metastasis specimens. Biological replicates: 3 primary tumor replicates, 3 lung metastatic replicates. One replicate per array.
