TITLE
Microarray of four CSM strains

ORGANISM
Tetranychus cinnabarinus

SUMMARY
The phenomenon of pesticide resistance is an important example of human induced evolution, and the factors governing the origin and spread of resistance-associated genes are of academic and practical importance. To identify such genes, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and a custom made microarray were utilized to compare transcription levels in four different Tetranychus cinnabarinus strains.

DESIGN
Four samples,two replications. SS as a control, FeR, CyR and AbR as treatments.
