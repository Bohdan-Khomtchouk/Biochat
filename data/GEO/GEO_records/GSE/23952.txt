TITLE
Expression data from TGF-beta treated Panc-1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGF-beta treatment of Panc-1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line on Affymetrix HG_U133_plus_2 arrays; triplicate experiments. The goal of the experiment is to profile temporal gene expression changes during TGF-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). During EMT cancer cells lose their epithelial specifc proteins and gain mesenchymal proteins to acquire migratory and invasive phenotype essential for metastasis. Human Panc-1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line was treated with 5 ng/mL TGF-beta for 48 h to induce EMT. The experiment was repeated 3 times. Samples were assayed using Affymetrix HG_U133_plus_2 arrays with 54675 probe-sets, using standard techniques.
