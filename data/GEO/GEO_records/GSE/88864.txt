TITLE
Genes expression analysis of chemical-induced hypooctyl elongation under blue light irradiation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the transcript regulation of early Arabidopsis seedlings developments with different chemicals under continuous blue light irradiation.

DESIGN
Three chemicals which induced different hypocotyl growth length in WT Arabidopsis seedlings were evaluated with three replicates conducted for each chemical. The profile for each chemical was analyzed againts sample with DMSO treatment as control.

PLATFORM
GPL9020 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Feature Number version)
