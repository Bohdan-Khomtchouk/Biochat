TITLE
Vascular specific H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 profile in the Arabidopsis root

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We isolated Vascular specific root protoplast using the pWOL:GFP marker line  (Birnbaum et al., 2003) and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). FACS-treated root protoplast from wild type plants (Col0) were used as control. The GFP positive protoplast from the pWOL:GFP line and WT protoplast were used for a ChIP-seq experiment using H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 antibodies.

DESIGN
Examination of root vascular specific H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 deposition
