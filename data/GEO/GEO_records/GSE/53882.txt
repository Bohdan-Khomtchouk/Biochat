TITLE
The prognostic and predictive value of a three-microRNA-based classifier in NSCLC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression profiles were sucessfully contructed in 397 patients with NSCLC and 151 corresponding adjacent noncancerous tissues using a custom microarray containing probes for 1888 miRNAs and an outcome prediction of miRNA signature was successfully identified for predicting prognosis in NSCLC.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a consecutively operated, well-defined cohort of 397 NSCLC cases, followed up more than three years, was used to acquire miRNA expression profiles of 1888 miRNAs and identify a miRNA signature, leading to the successfully for predicting prognosis in NSCLC.
