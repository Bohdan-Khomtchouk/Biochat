TITLE
Analysis of TF binding sites and histone modification in IRF8-induced monocyte differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chromatins were prepared from myeloid progenitor cell line Tot2 cells transduced with retrovirus for control MSCV or MSCV-IRF8. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was carried out by using anti-IRF8 antibody, anti-PU.1 antibody or anti-histone H3K4me1 antibody. ChIP-Seq peaks were identified using the FindPeaks tool in the HOMER package or SICER with input DNA tags as background distribution. Potential IRF8-direct target genes were identified based on ChIP-Seq and the alteration of expression by IRF8-induction.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 transcription factor occupancy and 1 histone modifications in myeloid progenitor cells and monocyte-like cells differetiated by IRF8 expression

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
