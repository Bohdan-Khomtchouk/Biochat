TITLE
Cycling transcriptional networks reduce the synthetic cost of genomes

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The synthetic cost of cycling genes is higher than other genes, and the cyclic expression pattern of these genes is a strategy for reducing the overall energy usage of cells

DESIGN
Samples for both conditions were taken over two metabolic cycles. For the fast cycling condition one sample was taken every 13 minutes for ~4.25 hours. For the slow cycling condition, samples were taken every 36 minutes for ~14.5 hours. Cycling genes were identified using JTK_Cycle (Hughes et al. (2010) Journal of Biological Rhythms).
