TITLE
Production of cytokines by CD4+CAR+ T-cells in spleens

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to compare and contrast cytokine production by CD4+ chimeric antigen receptor + T-cells and putative myeloid derived suppressor cell populations (CD11b+Gr-1 hi and lo) in the spleens of Balb/c mice which had received a transfer of CD19 specific second-generation CAR T-cells 56 days previously following cyclophosphamide pre-conditioning.

DESIGN
Splenocytes from four individual mice were pooled, incubated with antibodies to CD4, CD34 (CAR), CD11b, Gr-1 and sorted using flow cytometric cell sorting for CD4+CD34+, Gr-1 and the negative cell fraction. Total RNA was isolated and samples loaded in duplicate in the array. Data was normalized to global expression levels.
