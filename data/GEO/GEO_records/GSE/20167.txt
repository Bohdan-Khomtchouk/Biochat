TITLE
Gene expression profiles of cervical cancers for novel molecular classification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cervical cancers is the second most malignancy in women. It has been clinically important histological variants such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC) and adenosquamous carcinomas (ASC). It has been postulated that AC and ASC has a worse prognosis than pure SCC. However, many of the mixed or other types confuses its diagnosis and aggressive/resistant behavior of some tumors has resulted in debate for prognostic role of empirical pathological classification. In addition, the prognosis of adenosquamous carcinoma is still under debate. To establish a novel molecular classification of cervical cancer, we investigated intrinsic characteristics using expression profile.

DESIGN
A total of 80 cevical cancer samples of following histology were included in this study:  54 SCC, 18 ASC, 6 AC, and 2 others. Replicate number: 2. No control/no reference sample was included. One-color.
