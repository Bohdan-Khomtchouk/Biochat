TITLE
Mouse Hotchon ChIRP-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine the genome-wide localization of the lncRNA Hotchon in murine limb mesenchyme

DESIGN
Four samples were characterized.  Two samples, Limb Even and Limb Odd used limb mesenchyme which expressed the lncRNA Hotchon.  The Limb Even sample was hybridized with the Even Hotchon probe set, The Limb Odd sample was hybridized with the Odd Hotchon probe set.  Two additional samples from a mouse glial cell line that does not express the lncRNA Hotchon were used as controls and hybridized with either the Hotchon Odd or Hotchon Even probe set.
