TITLE
Iron Chelators Treatment on DMS-53 Human Lung Cancer Cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The molecular role of iron in gene expression remains poorly characterized. Moreover, the alterations in global gene expression after iron chelation remains unclear and are important to assess for understanding the molecular pathology of iron-depletion and the biological effects of iron chelators. We assessed the effect on whole genome gene expression of two iron chelators (desferrioxamine and Dp44mT). These studies are important for understanding the molecular and cellular effects of iron-depletion.

DESIGN
The DMS-53 cells were incubated with either control medium or this medium containing DFO (250 µM) or Dp44mT (25 µM) for 24 h at 37oC. These concentrations were used since our previous studies demonstrated that under these conditions these chelators lead to up-regulation of iron-responsive genes such as the TfR1 after this incubation time. Moreover, the higher concentration of DFO was implemented due to its limited ability to permeate cell membranes. Total RNA was isolated from cells in 1 mL of TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). Samples were then prepared and hybridized to the Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 430 2.0. The human GeneChip® U133 Plus 2.0 consists of greater than 47,000 transcripts and variants from over 38,500 well characterized human genes. On completion of hybridization and washing, microarray chips were scanned with the Affymetrix GeneChip® Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix).
