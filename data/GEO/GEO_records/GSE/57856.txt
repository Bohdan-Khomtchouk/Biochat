TITLE
TOX3 is Expressed in Mammary ER Positive Epithelial Cells and Regulates a Subset of ER Target Genes in a Ligand-Independent Manner in Luminal Breast Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess how the TOX3 nuclear protein can modulate gene expression in luminal epithelial cells, MCF7 cells were transfected with a TOX3 expression vector or vector control. In both instances, GFP was coexpressed, allowing isolation of transfected cells by flow cytometry before transcriptome analysis. Experiments were carried out under estrogen depleted conditions, and cells isolated 48 hours after transfection.

DESIGN
Treatment vs. Control
