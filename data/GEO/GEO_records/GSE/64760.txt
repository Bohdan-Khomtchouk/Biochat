TITLE
Gene expression in liver tissues derived from wild-type and Siglec-E-deficient mice at 55 weeks of age

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We show that mice lacking Siglec-E, the main member of the CD33rSiglec family, exhibit reduced survival. Removal of Siglec-E causes the development of exaggerated signs of aging at the molecular, structural, and cognitive level. We found that accelerated aging was related both to an unbalanced ROS metabolism, and to a secondary impairment in detoxification of reactive molecules, ultimately leading to increased damage to cellular DNA, proteins and lipids. Taken together, our data suggest that CD33rSiglecs co-evolved in mammals to achieve a better management of oxidative stress during inflammation, which in turn reduces molecular damage and extends lifespan.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from liver tissues from two wild-type and three Siglec-E-deficient mice
