TITLE
RNA-seq transcriptome profiling of motor neurons (MNs) and surrounding white matter glia (WM) microdissected from pre-symptomatic mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report tramscriptome perturbations in MNs and WM of SMA mouse, prior to first morphological and biochemical synaptic defects

DESIGN
Examination of ventral horn MNs and WM isolated from lumbar segment spinal cords from wild type (WT) and SMA mice

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
