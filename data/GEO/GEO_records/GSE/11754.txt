TITLE
Transcriptional responses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to carbon and nitrogen deprivation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Metabolite concentrations can regulate gene expression, which can in turn regulate metabolic activity. The extent to which functionally related transcripts and metabolites show similar patterns of concentration changes, however, remains unestablished.  We have therefore measured and analyzed the metabolomic (previously published in Brauer et al., PMID 17159141) and transcriptional responses (presented here) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to carbon and nitrogen starvation.

DESIGN
The transcriptomes of filter cultures of FY4 (a prototrophic, Mata derivative of S288C presented by Winston et al., PMID 7762301) were sampled during exponential growth in minimal media and at 10, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 minutes following a switch to media lacking ammonium (nitrogen starvation) or D-glucose (carbon starvation).  Transcriptional profiles were measured using an Agilent Yeast Oligo Microarray (V2), with the zero timepoint (i.e. exponential growth) as the reference sample.  This yielded 2 time-courses of 6 time-points each.  Further information is available in the accompanying manuscript.
