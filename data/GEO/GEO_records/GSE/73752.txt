TITLE
Small RNA deep sequencing of Arabidopsis DRB mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) encodes five DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA BINDING (DRB) proteins, DRB1 to DRB5, that predominantly act as non-catalytic cofactors for DICER-LIKE (DCL) proteins in the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) processing stages of small RNA (sRNA) production pathways. In the nucleus, DRB1 is required for microRNA (miRNAs) processing from imperfectly dsRNA precursors by DCL1. Similarly, DRB4 is required by DCL4 for small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) production from endogenous or exogenous perfectly dsRNA templates. DRB2 has been recently demonstrated to be required for miRNA and siRNA production in developmentally-important tissues of Arabidopsis while the requirement of either DRB3 or DRB5 in sRNA production remains unclear. Here, we analyse in parallel, the contribution of all five DRB protein family members to the global sRNA landscape of Arabidopsis floral tissues. In depth bioinformatic analysis of sRNA sequencing datasets generated from floral tissues of DRB knockout mutant (drb) plant lines, drb1, drb2, drb4, drb12, drb14, drb24, and drb35 and their comparison to the floral sRNA profile of wild-type Arabidopsis, has enabled confident assignment of the requirement of DRB1, DRB2 and DRB4 for the production of specific miRNA and siRNA subclasses in this tissue. Our analyses have additionally identified novel and/or expanded roles for DRB2 in miRNA, trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) and natural antisense transcript siRNAs (natsiRNAs) production.

DESIGN
Eight samples are included in the study, corresponding to floral small RNA deep sequencing results for wild-type and seven DRB mutant lines; drb1, drb2, drb4, drb12, drb14, drb24, and drb35. This study has been submitted as BioProject PRJNA295898.
