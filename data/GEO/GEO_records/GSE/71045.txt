TITLE
Gene expression of CD8+ T cells isolated from human subjects during acute and convalescent phase of EBV infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix HuGene ST 1.0 microarrays were used to study and compare gene expression in peripheral blood CD8+ T cells of human patients with Acute Infectious Mononucleosis (AIM; acute EBV infection) and during convalescence  (CONV; 6-12 months after AIM visit). Blood samples were drawn from ten human patients with AIM and again during their covalescence (CONV). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and cryopreserved. Paired AIM and CONV samples were thawed and CD8+ T cells purified with magnetic beads. RNA was isolated and processed for hybridization according to the Affymetrix protocol

DESIGN
CD8+ T cells acute and convalescent phase of EBV infection (10 subjects)
