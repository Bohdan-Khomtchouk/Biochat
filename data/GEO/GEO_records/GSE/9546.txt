TITLE
Genomic profile of maize response to A. flavus infection identifies genes associated with biotic and abiotic resistance

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
The experiment consisted of a field design containing two maize inbred lines Va35 and Mp313E. Va35 has yellow kernels and is susceptible to kernel infection by Aspergillus flavus (A. flavus). Mp313E is a white dent maize inbred line and was released primarily as a source of resistance to kernel infection by A. flavus. The test ears were inoculated with Aspergillus flavus and collected two days after inoculation. Non-inoculated ears collected 16 days after pollination were also used as a control. The microarray experimental design was a randomized complete block design with three replications. One microarray slide was used for each field plot.  Each slide contained the inoculated and non-inoculated sub-treatments. A second slide for one replication of each genotype contained a dye swap for the inoculation treatment and three subsamples (dots) within the slide represented each contig. Keywords: Direct comparison

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, inoculated vs. uninoculated maize ears for Va35 and Mp313E. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 inoculated, 2 dye-swap, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
