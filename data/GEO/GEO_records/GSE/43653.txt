TITLE
Expression data from endometrial carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
some genes associated with cell growth, cell differentiation, meiosis, migration, and apoptosis are regulated in ECC-1 after DEHP exposure. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
ECC-1 (human endometrial cancer) cell lines were subjected to DEHP for 48 h with 50 Î¼M DEHP and total RNA was extracted. Quantified spectro-photometrically, and RNA quality was verified via agarose-gel electrophoresis. Gene expression changes were analyzed using oligonucleotide microarray hybridization by comparing the treated and control groups (two-fold change, P < 0.05).
