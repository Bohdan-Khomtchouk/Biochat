TITLE
Tgif1 regulates quiescence and self-renewal signaling pathways of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we demonstrate that Tgif1 has a role in HSCs maintenance, self-renewal and quiescence. RNA sequencing data of LSK cells (HSCs enriched cell population) from Tgif1-/- and wild type mice  implicates that multiple pathways involved in HSC quiescence and self-renewal are disturbed in Tgif1 deficient mice.

DESIGN
RNA expression profiles of  wild type (WT) and Tgif1-/- LSK cells were generated by RNA sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
