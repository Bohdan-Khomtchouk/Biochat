TITLE
Altered gene expression in the mouse heart after 2-day fasting

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To obtain insight into the effect of starvation on heart ischemia/reperfusion injury, gene expression patterns in the hearts of satiated and fasted mice were examined.

DESIGN
Gene expression was examined in the hearts of satiated (n=4) and 2-day-fasted C57BL/6J male mice.
