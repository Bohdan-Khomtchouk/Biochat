Expression data from BAT and liver of the KRAP deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
KRAP (Ki-ras-induced actin-interacting protein) is a cytoskeleton-associated protein and a ubiquitous protein among tissues, originally identified as a cancer-related molecule.  KRAP-deficient (KRAP-/-) mice show enhanced metabolic rate, decreased adiposity, improved glucose tolerance, hypoinsulinemia and hypoleptinemia.  KRAP-/- mice are also protected against high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance despite of hyperphagia. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
