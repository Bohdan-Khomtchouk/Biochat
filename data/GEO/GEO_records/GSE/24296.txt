SUMMARY
Molecular mechanism underline immune cell type population shift upon anti-DLL4 treatment

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice were injected with anti-DLL4, or an isotype control antibody as controls. Two weeks later mice were sacrificed, and thymi was harvested from 4 anti-DLL4 and 4 control animals. Total thymocytes, DN cells (CD4-CD8-) and DN1(CD4-CD8- CD44+CD25-) cells were isolated. Samples included in this data set are: 3 Thymocytes-anti-DLL4; 3 Thymocytes-isotype control; 3 DN1-anti-DLL4; 2 DN1-isotype controls; 3 DN-anti-DLL4; 3 DN-isotyoe control.
