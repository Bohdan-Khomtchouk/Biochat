TITLE
Diarrhoeal mechanisms of the Campylobacter jejuni enteritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Campylobacter jejuni is the most prevalent cause of foodborne bacterial enteritis worldwide. This study aims at the characterisation of pathomechanisms and signalling in Campylobacter-induced diarrhoea in the human mucosa. During routine colonoscopy, biopsies were taken from patients suffering from campylobacteriosis. RNA-seq of colon biopsies was performed to describe Campylobacter jejuni-mediated effects. Mucosal mRNA profiles of acutely infected patients and healthy controls were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500. This data provide the basis for subsequent upstream regulator analysis.

DESIGN
Colon mucosa mRNA profiles from 4 acutely infected patients and 6 healthy controls were generated by paired end sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
