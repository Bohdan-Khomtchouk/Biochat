TITLE
High throughput sequencing of the mouse transcriptome within the VTA following exposure to emotional stress.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using a novel stress paradigm, we generated emotionally stressed, physically stressed, and control animals.  We measured changes in mRNA expression using Illumina HiSeq2000 to obtain high-depth sequencing.  Interestingly, we observed a number of significantly up- and down-regulated mRNAs.  By identifying mRNAs that were regulated similarly in both emotionally and physically stressed mice, we hope to provide a list of potentially novel targets for therapeutic intervention in mood disorder.

DESIGN
Examination of the transcriptome within the VTA in emotionally and physically (both susceptible and resilient) stressed C57BL/6J male mice.
