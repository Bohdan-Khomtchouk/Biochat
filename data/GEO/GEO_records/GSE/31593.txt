TITLE
Genes regulated by GRF1 and GRF3 in Arabidopsis roots

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips were used to compare the mRNA profiles of root tissues of the grf1/grf2/grf3 triple mutant and transgenic plants overexpressing miR396-resistant variants of GRF1 (P35S:rGRF1) or GRF3 (P35S:rGRF3) with those of the corresponding wild-type (Col-0 or WS).   Wild-type (Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Col-0 and Ws), the triple mutant grf1/grf2/grf3, and transgenic plants overexpressing rGRF1 or rGRF3 were grown in vertical culture dishes on modified Knopâ€™s medium for 2 weeks and then root tissues were collected for RNA extraction.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Tarek Hewezi.
