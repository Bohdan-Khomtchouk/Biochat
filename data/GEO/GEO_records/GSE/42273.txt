TITLE
Defining Gene Signatures for Protective Immunity to Tuberculosis in the Chinese Cynomolgus Macaque Model

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles in PPD-stimulated and unstimulated peripherhal blood mononuclear cells isolated from chinese cynomolgus macaques before and after BCG vaccination and before and after M. tuberculosis challenge were compared in animals able to control TB infection and those that developed TB disease in order to identify potential correlates of protection and/or biomarkers of disease.

DESIGN
6 macaques received BCG vaccination prior to challenge and were able to control TB infection (vaccinated controllers). 3 unvaccinated macaques were also able to control TB infection after challenge (unvaccinated controllers) and 3 other unvaccinated macaques developed TB disease and reached humane endpoint criteria (unvaccinated progressors). PBMCs isolated at 8 and 18 weeks post BCG-vaccination from the vaccinated controllers and at 6 weeks post M.tb challenge and at 2 time-points when the animals were naive in all animals were stimulated with PPD. RNA was extracted from the cells and hybridised to and Agilent rhesus macaque GE microarray in a one-colour hybridisation. Gene expression post-vaccination and/or post-challenge was compared with expression before vaccination/challenge when the animals were naive.
