TITLE
Defining Gene Signatures for Protective Immunity to Tuberculosis in the Chinese Cynomolgus Macaque Model

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles in PPD-stimulated and unstimulated peripherhal blood mononuclear cells isolated from chinese cynomolgus macaques before and after BCG vaccination and before and after M. tuberculosis challenge were compared in animals able to control TB infection and those that developed TB disease in order to identify potential correlates of protection and/or biomarkers of disease.
