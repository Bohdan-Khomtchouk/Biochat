TITLE
Dissimilar manifestation of heterosis in super hybrid rice at early-tillering stage under nutrient-deficient and nutrient-sufficient condition

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Heterosis has long been exploited for crop breeding; however, the genetic mechanisms, particularly the initial establishment of heterosis during the early vegetative growth phase, remain elusive. The biggest challenge for that is to exclude noise genes from the identified heterosis-related candidates. Herein, we use nutrient-deficient hybrid with no measurable growth heterosis as control to filter potential background noise differentially expressed genes In this dataset, we compared the differentially expressed genes in both heterotic  and non-heterotic hybrid. After filtering these irrelevant genes, only 336 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which is significantly lower than those of previous reports, were identified as heterosis-related genes in a super hybrid rice of Liang-You-Pei-Jiu (LYP9) at early-tillering stage

DESIGN
Major object was aimed to eliminate the potential background DEGs in hybrid, and therefore to identify possibly geninue DEGs, which were directly responsible for the initial establishment of heterosis during early vegetative growth phase.
