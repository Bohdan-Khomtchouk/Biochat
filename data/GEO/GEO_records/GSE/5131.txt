TITLE
Adjudin-induced germ cell loss from adult rat testes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This is a study to explore the transcriptional changes after Adjudin treatment in adult rat testes at three time points (control, 8 hour and 4 day). Adjudin, [1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carbohydrazide], is a potential male contraceptive that targets the Sertoli-germ cell interface and causes germ cell depletion from the seminiferous epithelium. Adjudin has been proved to be a useful model to study the mechanisms that regulate junction restructuring in the testis. Keywords: Sertoli-germ cell adhesion regulation using an Adjudin model

DESIGN
Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single dose of Adjudin at 50 mg/kg b.w. by gavage and terminated after 8 hours (n=2) and 4 days (n=3). Testes from Adjudin-treated rats and untreated (control, n=3) rats were harvested and total RNA were prepared.  Standard Affymetrix genechip procedures were followed for the subsequent experiments. Data were analysed in MAS 5.0 and GeneSpring 7.2.
