TITLE
Soy LGI Protein NILs, seed fill

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Evaluation of transcripts from soybean seed tissue during seed fill for a pair of near-isogenic lines contrasting in seed protein and oil and carrying an introgression at the linkage group I protein QTL region.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Yung-Tsi Bolon.  The equivalent experiment is GM11 at PLEXdb.]
