TITLE
Two Forkhead transcription factors regulate the division of cardiac progenitor cells by a Polo-dependent pathway - II

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The development of a complex organ requires the specification of appropriate numbers of each of its constituent cell types, as well as their proper differentiation and correct positioning relative to each other.  During Drosophila cardiogenesis, all three of these processes are controlled by jumeau (jumu) and Checkpoint suppressor homologue (CHES-1-like), two genes encoding forkhead transcription factors that we discovered utilizing an integrated genetic, genomic and computational strategy for identifying novel genes expressed in the developing Drosophila heart.  Both jumu and CHES-1-like are required during asymmetric cell division for the derivation of two distinct cardiac cell types from their mutual precursor, and in symmetric cell divisions that produce yet a third type of heart cell.  jumu and CHES-1-like control the division of cardiac progenitors by regulating the activity of Polo, a kinase involved in multiple steps of mitosis.  This pathway demonstrates how transcription factors integrate diverse developmental processes during organogenesis.

DESIGN
GFP-positive cells were profiled from Stage 11-12 Drosophila embryos of the following two genotypes: twi-GAL4 UAS-2EGFP/UAS-jumu and twi-GAL4 UAS-2EGFP
