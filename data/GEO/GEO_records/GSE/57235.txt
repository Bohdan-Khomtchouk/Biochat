TITLE
Transcriptomic response to different biomass in Myceliophthora thermophila (Sporotrichum thermophile)

ORGANISM
Thermothelomyces thermophila

SUMMARY
The thermophilic filamentous fungi Myceliophthora thermophila (Sporotrichum thermophile) has an ability to decompose cellulolytic biomass. To identify the genes and proteins involved in this process, we explored the transcriptomes of M. thermophila grown at 45 Â°C on different agricultural straws (oat, triticale, canola, flax straws).

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from M. thermophila cultures in early growth stage growing with oat, triticale, canola and flax straws as carbon source at 45C

PLATFORM
GPL15335 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Myceliophthora thermophila)
