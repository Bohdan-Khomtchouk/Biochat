TITLE
BBBomics - Human Blood Brain Barrier Transcriptomics Hub [miRNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Functional and structural dysfunction of the blood brain barrier (BBB) leads to severe alterations in brain physiology and is believed to trigger neurodegeneration. To investigate the molecular mechanisms driving the BBB dysfunction, very few human BBB cell culture models are available;of which, the human microvascular endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) is  the most widely used. Thus far, array-based approaches or targeted seqeuncing based approaches have been employed to characterize the gene expression of the hCMEC/D3 model. However,The goal of this study is to perform deep transcriptomic sequencing of the BBB cell line and obtain  features like gene expression, expressed single nucleotide variants, alternate splice forms, circular RNAs, long non-coding RNAs and micro RNAs.

DESIGN
We have developed blood brain barriers transcriptomics landscape using RNA and micro RNA sequencing data obtained from replicates of hCMEC/D3 BBB cell line.
