TITLE
Expression data from liver of WNIN/Ob lean and obese rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Obesity is risk factor for development of fatty liver. Analysis of altered gene expression gives better understading about the mechanisms involved/alterted in the development of obesity-induced fattyliver  in this new obese rat model. We used Microarrays to delinate the alted gene expression in liver of WNIN/Ob obese rats

DESIGN
Liver was collected from 4 month old WNIN/Ob lean and obese rats for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymatrix Rat gene 1ST arrays. Four RNA samples from each phenotype were pooled and used for the study.

PLATFORM
GPL6247 [RaGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
