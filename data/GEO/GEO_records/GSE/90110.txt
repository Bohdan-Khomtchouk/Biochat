TITLE
Functional genomics of HDAC class-I specific inhbitor 4SC-202 in pancreatic cell lines [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have utilized a  HDAC class-I specific inhbitor 4SC-202 and revealed a potential involvement of BRD4 and MYC in regulating the expression of induced genes in response to 4SC-202 treatment.

DESIGN
We performed ChIP-sequencing from L3.6 cells (treated with DMSO or 4SC-202 for 24 hours) .  We generated ChIP-Seq data for H3K27ac and H3K4me3 from DMSO and 4SC-202 treated L3.6 cells. Consistently, Input DNA from all the two conditions was included as well.
