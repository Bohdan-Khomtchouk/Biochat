TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of human iPS cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells induced by methoxamine treatment.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole gene expression during differentiation from hiPS cells into hepatocyte-like cells. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that the hepatocyte-like cells induced with adrenergic receptor agonists were identical to those induced with conventional growth factors (hepatocyte growth factor and oncostatin M). Results provide the important information of the differentiation mechanisms from hepatoblasts into hepatocytes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from undifferentiated hiPS cells, hiPS cell-derived hepatoblast-like and hepatocyte-like cells. The hiPS cells were induced to differentiate into hepatoblast-like cells, then the cells were treated with methoxamine or growth factors (hepatocyte growth factor and oncostatin M) to induce the differentiation into hepatocyte-like cells.
