TITLE
mRNA expression profiles in YT and NK92 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
YT and NK92 cells are EBV-infected lymphoma cells of NK- cell origin. YT cells have weaker expression of T-bet and IFNg than NK92 cells. However, this data set shows that both cell lines have similar mRNA levels, implying post-transcriptional regulations.

DESIGN
Affymetrix chips (Human Genome U133 plus 2.0) were used for a genome-wide screen of transcriptional profiles on YT and NK cells. Hybridization and washing of the arrays were done according to the GeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Technical Manual from Affymetrix. The arrays were scanned with GenePix 4000B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA.), and the data were extracted with Affymetrix Microarray suite (MAS) software.
