TITLE
Gene expression pattern of synovial cells from inflammatory and normal areas of osteoarthritis synovial membrane

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to compare the gene expression pattern of synovial cells from inflammatory (I) or normal/reactive (N/R) areas of a synovial membrane harvested from the same osteoarthritis (OA) patient. This study is the first to identify different expression pattern between two areas of the synovial membrane in the same patient. These differences concern several key pathways involved in OA pathogenesis (inflammation, cartilage metabolism, Wnt signaling and angiogenesis). This analysis also provides interesting information regarding new potent intermediates as potentiel targets for the future therapeutic.

DESIGN
Synovial tissues were obtained from 12 knee OA patients at the time of total knee replacement. The inflammatory status of the synovial membrane was characterized according to macroscopic criteria and sorted as N/R and I. Biopsies were cultured separately for 7 days. Microarray gene expression profiling between N/R and I areas was performed.
