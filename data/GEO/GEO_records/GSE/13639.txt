TITLE
Drosha or DGCR8 knockdown effects on mRNA levels in HeLa

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Anaysis of mRNA changes in HeLa cells following knockdown of Drosha or DGCR8. Drosha is a nuclear RNase III that carries out microRNA (miRNA) processing by cleaving primary microRNA transcript (pri-miRNA). DGCR8 is an essential co-factor of Drosha. Keywords: gene expression array-based (RNA / in situ oligonucleotide)

DESIGN
siRNA against Drosha or DGCR8 were trasnfected into HeLa cells. siRNA against GFP was used as a control. Biologically duplicated total RNAs were prepared from HeLa cells, 24 hrs and 48 hrs after siRNA transfection.
