TITLE
Characterization of histone modifications in mouse embryonic stem cells under control conditions or Phf5a knockdown

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Phf5a regulates transcription elongation in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), through regulation of the Paf1 complex. In this study we assayed for genome-wide localization of H3K4me3, H3K79me2 and H3K36me3 in mouse ESCs under conditions of shControl and shPhf5a knockdown. These results revealed that downregualtion of Phf5a results in the decrease of the elongation marks H3K79me2 and H3K36me3 from the gene bodies of pluripotency genes in ESC, wherease the promoter-associated mark H3K4me3 remains unaffected.

DESIGN
Ten million cells were treated with micrococcal nuclease to generate mono-nucleosomes and for the ChIP chromatin was precipitated using 10 micrograms of antibody against H3K4me3 (Millipore, 07-473), H3K79me2 (Active Motif, 39143) and H3K36me3 (Abcam, ab9050).
