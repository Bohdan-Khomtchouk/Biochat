TITLE
Array CGH in mentally retarded patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This series represents the data set described in the publication “Impact of low copy repeats on the generation of balanced and unbalanced chromosomal aberrations in mental retardation” by Erdogan et al. (Cytogenetics and Genome Research, accepted). Keywords: array CGH

DESIGN
This study aimed at defining the impact of low copy repeats on the generation of balanced and unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements in mentally retarded patients.  A cohort of 22 patients, pre-selected for the presence of sub-microscopic imbalances, was analysed by sub-megabase resolution tiling path array CGH and results were compared with a set of 41 patients with balanced translocations and breakpoints mapped to the BAC level by FISH.
