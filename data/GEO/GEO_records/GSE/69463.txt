TITLE
Epigenome analysis of angiogenin impact on bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated if Overexpression of ANG in UROtsaANG and RT112Scr could cause epigenetic changes, comparing to UROtsaEmpty and RT112KD-ANG, respectively . The alteration of genome-wide DNA methylation in these cells was analyzed using Illumina whole genome methylation array. Specifically, methylated DNAs with 5-mC were amplified using nonbiased conditions, labeled and hybridized to a BeadChip array covering over > 450,000 methylation sites. ANG expression was noted to be associated with a change in global DNA methylation levels compared to control cells

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 4 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. The bisulfite treatment, microarray service and analysis of the array were provided by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South Korea).

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
