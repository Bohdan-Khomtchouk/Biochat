TITLE
Discovery of genes regulated by the metastasis suppressor gene, RhoGDI2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A number of studies find that metastasis suppressor proteins, including RhoGDI2, may function in part though controlling expression of genes regulating metastasis (reviewed in Smith and Theodorescu, Nature Reviews Cancer, 2009, PMID: 19242414). To uncover systematically gene expression patterns dependent on RhoGDI2 expression, we profiled gene expression in stably transfected control (GFP empty vector) UM-UC-3 bladder carcinoma cells (which have lost endogenous expression of RhoGDI2, as occurs commonly in the progression of bladder cancer PMID: 15173088), as well as stably transfected GFP-tagged RhoGDI2 expressing UM-UC-3 cells.

DESIGN
Two paired biological replicates of GFP (control) and GFP-RhoGDI2 (experimental) UM-UC-3 cells were prepared at different times, isolated during log phase growth, and subjected to gene expression profiling using the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide microarray platform.
