TITLE
Polyunsaturated dietary fats decrease mortality and bacterial load during septic S. aureus infection, and improve neutrophil function in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Severe infections and sepsis is an increasing clinical problem that cause prolonged morbidity and substantial mortality. At present, antibiotics are essentially the only pharmacological treatment for sepsis. The incidence of antibiotic resistance is increasing and it is therefore critical to find new therapies for sepsis. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a major cause of septic mortality. Neutrophils play a major role in defense against bacterial infections. We have recently shown that a saturated high fat diet decreases survival in septic mice, but the mechanisms behind remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the dietary fat composition affects survival and neutrophils function after experimental septic infection in mice.  We found that, after S. aureus infection, mice fed polyunsaturated high fat diet (HFD/P) for 8 weeks had increased septic survival and decreased bacterial load compared with mice fed saturated HFD (HFD/S), and similar to that of mice given low fat diet (LFD). Furthermore, uninfected mice fed HFD/P had increased number of Ly6G+ neutrophils in bone marrow. In addition, mice fed HFD/P had a higher number Ly6G+ neutrophils recruited to the site of inflammation after peritoneal injection of thioglycollate.   In conclusion, polyunsaturated dietary fat increased both survival and the efficiency of the bacterial clearance during septic S. aureus infection. Moreover, this diet enhanced the number and chemotaxis of neutrophils, a key component of the immune response to S. aureus infections.

DESIGN
