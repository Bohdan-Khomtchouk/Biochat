Analyses of the SAGE expression of Human Embryonic Stem Cells

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A plethora of research has focused on the human embryonic stem cells (hESC) ever since they were first reported mainly due to their distinct features of self renewal and pluripotency. Probing of the hESC transcriptome using global expression profiling tools such as DNA microarray, Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE), Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) and Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) analysis have contributed significantly in our current understanding of hESCs. In fact, a large number of markers to assess the pluripotent and differentiation status of hESCs have been presented by such studies. However, till date clarity is lacking in identifying a robust set of markers to assess the true state of the hESCs. In this paper, we report the generation of long SAGE libraries for partially differentiated and differentiated HES3 along with a deeper profiling of our previously reported HES3 undifferentiated library. Clustering analysis of these libraries in concert with long and short SAGE libraries available in public databases using Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) as well as a poison-based approach helped in identification of expression patterns distinct from those reported for the well established pluriptency/differentiation markers. Almost all the previous studies reporting a robust set of markers have focused on a gene by gene comparison in listing out the upregulated and downregulated genes rather than look at the expression patterns in establishing a list of markers. In this analysis, however, we report a new set of markers as well as add confidence to some previously reported markers based on their novel expression patterns as identified by SAGE analysis and also confirm it by real-time PCR analysis. For the real-time PCR confirmation, instead of taking two extreme data sets such as undifferentiated and a late stage embryoid body, we profiled a time series of embryoid body stages so that we could identify those genes which show a dramatic increase or decrease upon differentiation and hence would serve as more reliable markers.
