TITLE
Ultraefficient irCLIP platform for characterization of protein-RNA interactions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The complexity of transcriptome-wide protein-RNA interaction networks is incompletely understood. While emerging studies are greatly expanding the known universe of RNA-binding proteins, methods for the discovery and characterization of protein-RNA interactions remain resource intensive and technically challenging. Here we introduce an advanced UV-C crosslinking and immunoprecipitation platform, irCLIP, which provides an ultraefficient, fast, nonisotopic method for the detection of protein-RNA interactions using 100-fold less material than standard protocols.

DESIGN
Nonisotopic interrogation of in vivo RNA-protein interactions

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
