TITLE
Epigenetic mechanisms regulate FOXP1 expression in CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-scaled profiling of naive and memory CD4+ T cells in activated and resting state. Differential methylation can be observed between resting naïve and memory cells at cg related to FOXP1 gene.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 12 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip
