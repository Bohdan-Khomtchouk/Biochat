TITLE
MtrA is involved in progression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell cycle

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra

SUMMARY
Synchronised cultures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb H37Ra DnaAcos115) were used to determine the cell cycle dependent gene expression.

DESIGN
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra DnaAcos115 strain was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth at 30C for 30h which arrests replication and later cultures were allowed to grow at 37oC for 30h. Samples were collected at 0, 2, 6, 12,18, 24 and 30 hours. Samples at 30oC for 30h were considered as '0' time point. A total of 18 samples, consisting of triplicates for 6 time-points were analyzed using microarray.
