TITLE
Comparasion between MCF7-NIK overexpressing cells, MCF7-control cells and MCF7-NIK depleted cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentially expressed genes in MCF7 cancer cells transfected with an expression vector containing the ORF of NIK,  a shRNA of NIK  and a control shRNA.  Transient transfections were performed in triplicates . We use micorarrays to elucidate the machanisms by which NIK regulates stem cells biology

DESIGN
Three groups were analyzed in triplicate each. The First  group was MCF7 groupÂ· transfected with an expression vector that overexpress NIK, other group was MCF7 cells transfected with a shRNA to inhibit NIK and the last group was transfected with a shRNA to inhibit luciferase expression.
