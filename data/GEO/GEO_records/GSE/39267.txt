TITLE
Stump project -- mRNA epidermis; Volar versus non-volar acral skin gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We were interested in defining the gene signature of volar skin.

DESIGN
Punch biopsies of skin were split into epidermis and dermis after dispase treatment. We collected RNA from epidermis  of palms, backs of hand, soles and backs of feet and  submitted for Affymetrix Exon arrays. 3 replicates of each site from distinct human donors were included; total of 12 samples analyzed

PLATFORM
GPL5175 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
