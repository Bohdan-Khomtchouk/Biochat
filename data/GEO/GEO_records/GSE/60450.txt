TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of luminal and basal cell subpopulations in the lactating versus pregnant mammary gland

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify genes specifically expressed in lactating mammary glands, the gene expression profiles of luminal and basal cells from different developmental stages were compared.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression in luminal and basal cells harvested from the mammary glands of virgin, 18.5 day pregnant and 2 day lactating mice (2 mice per stage).
