TITLE
Gene expression profiles in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from BCL11B-KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes is controlled by several transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), which are known as master regulators of adipogenesis. BCL11B is a zinc finger-type transcription factor that regulates the development of the skin and central nervous and immune systems. Here, we found that BCL11B was expressed in the white adipose tissue (WAT), particularly the subcutaneous WAT and that BCL11B−/− mice had a reduced amount of subcutaneous WAT. During adipogenesis, BCL11B expression transiently increased in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The ability for adipogenesis was reduced in BCL11B knockdown 3T3-L1 cells and BCL11B−/− MEFs, whereas the ability for osteoblastogenesis was unaffected in BCL11B−/− MEFs. Luciferase reporter gene assays revealed that BCL11B stimulated C/EBPβ activity. Furthermore, the expression of downstream genes of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was not suppressed in BCL11B−/− MEFs during adipogenesis. Thus, this study identifies BCL11B as a novel regulator of adipogenesis, which works, at least in part, by stimulating C/EBPβ activity and suppressing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

DESIGN
MEFs were derived from embryonic day 12.5 BCL11B+/+ and BCL11B−/− C57BL6 mice embryos. After 2 times passage, MEFs were differentiated using the adipocyte differentiation medium and 10 μM pioglitazone. After 12 h of adipocyte differentiation, gene expression profiles were analyzed by DNA microarray.
