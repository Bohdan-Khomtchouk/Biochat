TITLE
Expression profile of TRAMP-C1 cell line with PAX8-NFE2L2 overexpression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We synthesized the PAX8-NFE2L2 fusion transcript and cloned it into a lentiviral vector, and used this to overexpress it in the murine prostate adenocarcinoma cell line TRAMP-C1.

DESIGN
We used high coverage RNA sequencing ( > 30 million reads per sample) to compare the expression profiles of cells expressing the PAX8-NFE2L2 fusion transcript to cells transduced with an empty vector.
