CDK-4 inhibitor P276-00 sensitizes Pancreatic Cancer cells to Gemcitabine induced Apoptosis

SUMMARY
Despite advances in molecular pathogenesis, pancreatic cancer remains a major unsolved health problem. It is a rapidly invasive, metastatic tumor that is resistant to standard therapies. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways are frequently dysregulated in pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine (Gem) is the mainstay treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer. P276 is a novel CDK inhibitor that induces G2/M arrest and inhibits tumor growth in vivo models. Here, we determined that P276 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to Gem induced apoptosis, a mechanism mediated through inhibition of Akt-mTOR signaling. In vitro, the combination of P276 and Gem resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation and colony formation of pancreatic cancer cells but not with normal pancreatic ductal cells. This combination also induced apoptosis, as seen by activated caspase 3 and increased Bax/Bcl2 ratio. Gene profiling studies demonstrated that this combination down regulated Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, which was confirmed by western blot analyses. There was also a down regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 expression suggesting effects on angiogenesis pathway. In vivo, intraperitoneal administration of the P276-Gem combination significantly suppressed the growth of pancreatic cancer tumor xenografts. There was a reduction in CD31 positive blood vessels, and reduced VEGF expression, again suggesting an effect on angiogenesis. Taken together, these data suggest that P276-Gem combination is a novel potent therapeutic agent that can target the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway to inhibit both tumor growth and angiogenesis.
