TITLE
mRNA profiling of white  hMADS cells converted in brite adipocytes and transfected with mimic miR-125b-5p

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-125b-5p is a well known miRNA already describded in several forms of cancer. miR-125b-5p is expressed in adipose tissue, adipocytes as well as their precursor cells. We aim to invest the role of  miR-125b-5p in white adipocytes conversion into brite adipocytes.  To get an idea about putative targets of miR-125b-5p in adipocyte conversion, we transfected miR-125b-5p mimic in human Multipotent Adipose-Derived Stem (hMADS) cells,  differenciated in white adipocytes. Gene expression profiling is performed 48h after hMADSC transfection.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, hMADS cells at day 16 after conversion of white adipocytes into brite adipocytes, comparison of cells transfected with a mimic miR-125b-5p to cells transfected with a negative controle. Biological replicates: 4, indepently grown and harvested. On each array, one biological replicate of mimic miR-125b-5p transfected cells was directly compared to one biological replicate of mimic negative control transfected cells (serving as reference sample). All hybridizations were repeated with reversed dye assignment (dye-swap) as technical replicates.
