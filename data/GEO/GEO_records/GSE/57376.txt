TITLE
Synovial biopsies from RA and PsA patients and skin biopsies from Psoriasis patients under Infliximab treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Object: to understand Infliximab treatment effect on the molecular expression of tissue at disease site

DESIGN
4mm punch biopsies were performed on involved and uninvolved skin at baseline in 5 Ps patients. A repeat biopsy was performed at week 2 after IFX therapy at a site adjacent to the baseline biopsy of involved skin. Synovial biopsies were performed on the knee of 3 RA and 3 PsA paired-subjects with a Parker Pearson biopsy needle (Dyna Medical, London, Canada) under ultrasound guidance at baseline and repeated on the same knee at week 10
