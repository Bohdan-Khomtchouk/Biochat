TITLE
N4- cytosine DNA methylation epigenetically regulates gene expression and pathogenesis in Helicobacter pylori

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori 26695

SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can reveal putative target which can be regulated by m4C modification. Comparison of wild-type strain with the strain harboring deleted M2.hpyAII mtase gene was done to identify the differentially expressed gene.

DESIGN
Transcriptome sequencing of exponentially growing H. pylori 26695 wild-type strain and R-hpyAII-M2.hpyAII deletion strain (biological replicates) was carried out by Illumina HiSeq 2500

PLATFORM
GPL19992 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Helicobacter pylori 26695)
