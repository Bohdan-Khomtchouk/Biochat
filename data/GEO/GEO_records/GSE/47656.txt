TITLE
TGF-b Signaling Is Associated with Endocytosis  at the Pocket Region of the Primary Cilium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Digital gene expression tag profiling of P19CL6 cell model during differentiation to cardiomyocytes

DESIGN
Four replicates were anlyzed at five time-points during differentiation; day 1, day 4, day 7, day 10 and day 14. Spontanously beating cardiomyocytes was observed at day 14 Spreadsheet with Log2 difference expression values is filtered by FDR and thus incomplete.

PLATFORM
