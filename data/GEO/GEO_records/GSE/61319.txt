TITLE
Gene expression profiles in rat alveolar macrophages exposure to impurity-free single-wall carbon nanotubes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To further development of our gene expression approach to assess the effects of manufactured nanomaterials at the transcriptional level, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to distinguish characterization of physicochemical properties of impurity-free single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), namely, relatively small bundles and a short linear shape (CNT-1) and large bundles and a long linear shape (CNT-2).

DESIGN
Two kinds of the impurity-free singlewall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), CNT-1 or CNT-2 induced gene expression in rat alveolar macrophages were measured at 24 hours exposure to doses of 0.1mg/mL. The experiments were performed using control for each experiment (n=4).
