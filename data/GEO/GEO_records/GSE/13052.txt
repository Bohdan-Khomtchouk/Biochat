Dengue VN Microarray MD and DF study

SUMMARY
DNA microarrays and specific RT-PCR assays were used to reveal transcriptional patterns in the blood of children presenting with dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and well-matched patients with uncomplicated dengue. The transcriptome of patients with acute uncomplicated dengue was characterized by a metabolically demanding " host defense " profile; transcripts related to oxidative metabolism, interferon signaling, protein ubiquination, apoptosis and cytokines were prominent. In contrast, the transcriptome of DSS patients was surprisingly benign, particularly with regard to transcripts derived from apoptotic and type I interferon pathways. These data highlight significant heterogeneity in the type or timing of host transcriptional immune responses precipitated by DENV infection independent of the duration of illness. In particular, they suggest that if transcriptional events in the blood compartment contribute to capillary leakage leading to hypovolemic shock, they occur before cardiovascular decompensation occurs, a finding that has implications for rational adjuvant therapy in this syndrome.

DESIGN
Whole blood transcriptional profiles of children infected with dengue virus with different clinical outcomes were compared. The subjects including 9 acute dengue shock samples, 9 acute uncomplicated dengue samples, 6 autologous follow up dengue samples and 6 autologous follow up uncomplicated dengue patients. Microarray data was normalised using Genespring GX7 software, statistical analysis was performed in Multiexperiment viewer software. Pathway  analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway analysis online software.
