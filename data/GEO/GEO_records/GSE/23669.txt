TITLE
Changes in polysome loading as a consequence of RHA downregulation [Agilent]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA helicase A (RHA) binds its target transcripts at the post-transcriptional control element (PCE) located in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR). This interaction represents an “RNA switch” that regulates protein synthesis. Down regulation of RHA by siRNAs was used to identify transcripts with RHA-dependent translation. Reduced accumulation of RNA in polysomes was monitored with microarrays.
