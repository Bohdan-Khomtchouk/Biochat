TITLE
TLR4 senses oxidative stress mediated by partially oxidized microvesicles.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oxidative stress is a hallmark of inflammation in infection or sterile tissue injury. We show that partially oxidized phospholipids of microvesicles (MVs) from plasma of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or cells exposed to oxidative stress induce activation of TLR4. MVs from healthy donors or reconstituted synthetic MVs can be converted to TLR4 agonists by limited oxidation, while prolonged oxidation abrogates the activity. Activation by MVs mimics the mechanism of TLR4 activation by LPS. However, LPS and MVs induce significantly different transcriptional response profile in mouse BMDMs with a strong inflammation-resolving component induced by the endogenous signals. MVs thus represent a ubiquitous endogenous danger signal released under the oxidative stress, which underlies the pervasive role of TLR4 signaling in inflammation.

DESIGN
BMDMs (bone marrow derived macrophages) from C57BL/6J strain were stimulated with LPS (100ng/ml), oxidative stress-derived MVs (5000 MV/ml) or MVs-FR (5000 MV/ml). RNA was extracted 4 hours after stimulation. 3 biological replicates (BMDM cells isolated from three different mice) per group.
