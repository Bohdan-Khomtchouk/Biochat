TITLE
Sox11 inhibits osteoblast differentiation of adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we analyzed the expression level change of transcription factors in adipose derived stem cells during osteogenic differentiation and found a candidate target gene, Sox11. We defined that Sox11 suppresses osteogenic differentiation through overexpression and knock down of Sox11.

DESIGN
total RNA obtained from adipose derived stem cells subjected to 1,3,6,10 or 14 days in osteogenic differentiation compared to undifferentiated control adipose derived stem cells.
