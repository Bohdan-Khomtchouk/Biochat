TITLE
Mouse liver transcription profiling by array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of male and female B6C3F1 mice exposed to prototype treatments from five classes of model hepatotoxicants.  These hepatotoxicants include compounds that activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), induce the inflammatory response, activate the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), stimulate the hypoxia signal transduction pathway, and activate the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).  The results provide insights into the shared and unique pathways that are activated across these model hepatotoxicants.

DESIGN
Exposures of mice of  both sexes were initiated at 7 weeks of age. Matched vehicle controls were run concurrently with each exposure and gene expression levels in liver tissue compared between exposed and control animals.
