TITLE
Integrative analysis of haplotype-resolved epigenomes across human tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Allelic differences between the two sets of chromosomes can affect the propensity of inheritance in humans, but the extent of such differences in the human genome has yet to be fully explored.  Here, we delineate allelic chromatin modifications and transcriptomes amongst a broad set of human tissues, enabled by a chromosome-span haplotype reconstruction strategy1. The resulting haplotype-resolved epigenomic maps reveal extensive allele bias in the transcription of human genes as well as chromatin state, allowing us to infer cis-regulatory relationships between genes and their control sequences. These maps also uncover a new class of cis regulatory elements and detail activities of repetitive elements in various human tissues. The rich datasets described here will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms controlling tissue-specific gene expression programs.

DESIGN
One replicate of Hi-C experiment in four human tissues with four different individuals (Thymus STL001, Aorta STL002, Leftventricle STL003, and Liver STL011).

PLATFORM
