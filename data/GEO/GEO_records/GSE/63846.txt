TITLE
C.elegans treated with control or elt-2 RNAi during adulthood and exposed to E. coli or P. aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of adult C.elegans exposed to E.coli or to GFP-expressing P. aeruginosa (strain PA14). For P. aeruginosa exposure, worms were separated into 2 groups - fully colonized (green) or non-colonized (dark).

DESIGN
Six conditions ( control or elt-2 RNAi ; E.coli, P. aeurginosa colonized, and P. aeurginosa non-colonized). 2-color arrrays, each sample co-hybridized with the same reference RNA sample from mixed stage C.elegans cultures Worms were either sorted using the wormsorter (WS) or were hand picked (HP) under a fluorescent stereoscope
