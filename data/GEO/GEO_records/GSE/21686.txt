TITLE
Comparison of thymic epithelial cells and hair follicle stem cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are essential for thymopoiesis and form a complex three-dimensional network, the organization of which is strikingly different from other epithelia. Interestingly, TECs express simple epithelia keratins in the cortex, stratified epithelia keratins in the medulla and epidermal differentiation markers in Hassall's bodies. Here we investigate the relationship between thymic epithelium and epidermal differentiation and show that the thymus of the rat contains a population of clonogenic TECs that can be extensively cultured and cloned using conditions developed for epidermal cell therapy in human. Clonogenic TECs conserve a thymic identity and the capacity to integrate in a thymic epithelial network, but they acquire new functionalities when exposed to an inductive skin microenvironment, permanently adopting the fate of hair follicle multipotent stem cells. This change in fate, maintained over time in serial transplantation, correlates with a down-regulation of transcription factors important for thymic identity, and an up-regulation of epidermal markers. Consequently, the TECsâ€™ capacity to integrate in a thymic epithelial network is altered or even lost. Our results demonstrate that the thymus contains a population of holoclone-like epithelial cells that can function as bona fide multipotent keratinocyte stem cells, and that microenvironmental cues are sufficient to re-direct epithelial-cell fate, allowing crossing of primitive germ layer boundaries from endoderm to ectoderm. Keywords: Cell type comparison
