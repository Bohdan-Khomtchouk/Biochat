TITLE
Targeting Taxane-Platin Resistant Lung Cancers with JumonjiC Lysine Demethylase Inhibitors (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characterization of histone 3 lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation changes upon development of taxane-platin drug resistance in NSCLC cells and evaluation of these histone modifications after treatment with Jumonji KDM inhibitors, JIB-04 and GSK-J4.

DESIGN
Comparison of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 profiles between H1299 Parental cells (chemo-sensitive) and H1299 T18 cells (taxane-platin resistant), and assessment of Jumonji KDM inhibitors on H1299 T18 cells (JIB-04 treated vs DMSO treated, and GSK-J4 treated vs. DMSO treated).
