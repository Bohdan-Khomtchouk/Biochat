TITLE
Differential DNA methylation with age displays both common and dynamic features across human tissues that are influenced by CpG landscape [brain]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of 4 human tissues of various ages: 78 samples from Brodmann area 19 of the cerebral cortex.The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs. Sentrix barcode included for batch normalization

DESIGN
1ug of genomic DNA was bisulfite converted using EZ-96 DNA Methylation Kit from ZymoResearch, and hybridized to beadchips according to Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation standard procedures

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
