TITLE
Whole exome sequencing of murine derived intestinal tumour organoids [exome-capture]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA was isolated from Apcmin/+;KrasLSL-G12D/+;VillinCre;Lgr5DTReGFP (AKVL), Apcmin/+;KrasLSL-G12D/+;VillinCre;Lgr5DTReGFP;p53KO (AKVPL) and Apcmin/+;KrasLSL-G12D/+;VillinCre;Lgr5DTReGFP;p53KO,Smad4KO (AKVPSL) organoids as well as the spleen of the AKVL donor animal The " SAMPLE_ID " sample characteristic is a sample identifier internal to Genentech.

DESIGN
Whole exome sequencing of murine derived intestinal organoids containing increasing number of CRC driver mutations was performed to identify potential mutations in coding regions that were introduced by off-target binding of the CRISPR-Cas9 complex.

PLATFORM
