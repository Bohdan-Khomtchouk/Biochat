TITLE
Gene expression data from bone marrow CD34+ cells of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to determine the impact of the common mutations on the transcriptome in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We linked genomic data with gene expression microarray data and we deconvoluted the expression of genes into contributions stemming from each genetic and cytogenetic alteration, providing insights into how driver mutations interfere with the transcriptomic state. We modelled the influence of mutations and expression changes on diagnostic clinical variables as well as survival.

DESIGN
159 patients with MDS patients and 17 healthy controls were included in the study. CD34+ cells were isolated from bone marrow samples obtained from MDS patients and healthy controls. Samples were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays
