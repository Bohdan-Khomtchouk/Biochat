TITLE
Systems genetics approach to low dose radiation sensitivity in BXD recombinant inbred mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The immune system illustrates the challenges of assigning risk to low dose radiation (LDR) exposure in a population. While high radiation doses clearly suppress immune function, a number of studies have shown that LDR affects immune cell subpopulations in ways that could be beneficial. In the intact organism, defining the consequences of LDR is further complicated by the impact of genetic background, particularly in systems such as the immune system for which both radiosensitivity and genetic effects are profound.  We employed a systems genetics approach to test for heritable differences in LDR responses. Mice from 39 BXD recombinant inbred (RI) strains were exposed to 10cGy gamma radiation to determine effects on immune function and oxidative stress 48h after irradiation. LDR significantly enhanced neutrophil phagocytosis in a manner that was independent of genetic background. In contrast, genetic background significantly impacted LDR-induced changes in spleen superoxide dismutase activity. Transcriptome data from spleens of the BXD parental strains highlighted the impact of genetic background on LDR responses and also indicate that genetic variation in radiosensitivity is further unmasked at low radiation doses. Taken together, these data highlight the need to consider genetic variation when assessing LDR outcomes.

DESIGN
Adult C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice (10 weeks old) were exposed to low dose (10cGy) or high dose (1Gy) gamma radiation. Mice were sacrificed 24h after radiation or sham exposure & spleens were harvested for transcriptomic analysis.
