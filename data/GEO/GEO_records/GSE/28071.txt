TITLE
Chromatin architectures at fission yeast transcriptional promoters and replication origins

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We have used micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion followed by deep sequencing in order to obtain a higher-resolution map than previously available of nucleosome positions in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our data confirm an unusually short average nucleosome repeat length, ~152 bp, in fission yeast and that transcriptional start sites (TSSs) are associated with nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs), ordered nucleosome arrays downstream and less regularly spaced upstream nucleosomes. In addition, we found enrichments for associated function in four of eight groups of genes clustered according to chromatin configurations near TSSs. At replication origins, our data revealed asymmetric localization of Pre-Replication Complex (pre-RC) proteins within large NDRsâ€”a feature that is conserved in fission and budding yeast and is therefore likely to be conserved in other eukaryotic organisms.
