TITLE
Insights into the proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancer from genome-wide profiling of estrogen receptor beta 2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human ERβ variant, ERβ2, is expressed at higher levels than ERβ1 in many breast cancer cell lines and breast tumours and increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that ERβ2, in contrast to ERβ1, is associated with aggressive phenotypes of various cancers. We identified a breast cancer cell line that expresses endogenous ERβ2, but not ERα or ERβ1, allowing studies of ERβ2 in the absence of other ER isoforms. Importantly, we show that knockdown of endogenous ERβ2 inhibited cell proliferation and cell invasion. To  gain insights into the molecular mechanism responsible for these cellular phenotypes, we assayed ERβ2 dependent global gene expression profiles. A total of 263 genes were identified as potentially ERβ2-upregulated genes and 662 as ERβ2-downregulated genes. ERβ2-regulated genes were involved in cell morphology, DNA replication and repair, cell death and survival. Our findings demonstrate that ERβ2 alone has a key role in enhancing cell proliferation and invasion, beyond modulation of ERα and ERβ1 signalling.

DESIGN
BT549 cells grown in antibiotic free medium were transfected with a control siRNA, siRNA targeting ERβ2, ERβ2 cDNA, empty vector control, and then global gene expression profiles were assessed. Three biological replicates were used for each group.
