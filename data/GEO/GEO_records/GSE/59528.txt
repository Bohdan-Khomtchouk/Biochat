TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation map reveals widespread epigenetic variation in healthy individuals (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using neutrophils from a cohort of normal individuals, we generated transcriptomic profile of 4 individuals.

DESIGN
Here we generated gene expression profile of neutrophil cells of 4 normal individuals.This data was integreated with DNA methylation profiles of same individuals.

PLATFORM
