TITLE
Expression data from Burkholderia multivorans cystic fibrosis clinical isolates

ORGANISM
Burkholderia multivorans

SUMMARY
Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) comprises opportunistic bacteria infecting hosts such as cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Bcc long-term infection of CF patient airways has been associated with emergence of phenotypic variation. Here we studied two Burkholderia multivorans clonal isolates (D2095 and D2214) displaying different morphotypes from a chronically infected CF patient in order to evaluate traits development during lung infection.

DESIGN
For expression profiling, overnight cultures of the mucoid D2095 and the nonmucoid D2214 isolates grown in SM medium were diluted to an initial OD640 nm of 0.1 into the same medium. Triplicate samples were cultured at 37ÂºC with 250 r.p.m. agitation for 17 h and RNA extracted from the two bacterial isolates.
