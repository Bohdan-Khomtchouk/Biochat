TITLE
Expression data from Burkholderia multivorans cystic fibrosis clinical isolates

ORGANISM
Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315

SUMMARY
Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) comprises opportunistic bacteria infecting hosts such as cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Bcc long-term infection of CF patient airways has been associated with emergence of phenotypic variation. Here we studied two Burkholderia multivorans clonal isolates (D2095 and D2214) displaying different morphotypes from a chronically infected CF patient in order to evaluate traits development during lung infection.
