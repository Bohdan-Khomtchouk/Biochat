TITLE
Expression data from non-infected macrophages treated with conditioned medium from macrophages persistently infected with RSV virus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Persistent Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in humans, animal models and cell lines have proven persistence of viral genomic RNA and mRNA for long periods of time. Cell lines are well-established models that can be used to study alterations in the expression profile of the host genome. We postulate that RSV persistence might also indirectly induce changes in the homeostasis of non-infected cells through soluble factors. Thus, we evaluated the effect of conditioned medium (CM) from MΦP cultures on the transcriptional profile of non-infected macrophages through gene expression microarrays

DESIGN
The persistently RSV infected macrophage-like cell line P388D1 (MΦP) was cultured during 24 and conditioned medium (CM-MΦP) was collected. Then, non-infected P388D1 macrophage-like cells (MΦN) were treated for 3 or 12 h with CM-MΦP or control-conditioned medium (CM-C) obtained from cultures of MΦN, passages 99 and 105.Total RNA was isolated and gene expression experiments were conducted per duplicate on the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array.
