TITLE
Comprehensive profiling of DNA methylation in colorectal cancer reveals subgroups with distinct clinicopathological and molecular features

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina GoldenGate® methylation array was used to evaluate DNA methylation at 1,505 CpG sites in 807 cancer-related genes in 91 consecutive CRC samples and 28 matched normal colonic mucosa.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 119 samples (91 CRC, 28 matched normals) were hybridised to the Illumina GoldenGate® methylation array.
