TITLE
Early expression data of H69 xenograft tumors following PDT treatment.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The response of tumors to PDT treatment is expected to provide information on effects of oxygen depletion, induced apoptosis, induction of an inflammatory response and induction of an ani-tumor immune response. Keywords: comparison of treatment vs control

DESIGN
NCI-H69 human SCLC xenografts were induced in SCID mice.  Three pairs of xenograft tumors, PDT treated and untreated controls, were harvested four hours after PDT treatment. RNA was isolated and prepared for hybridization to human Affymetrix GeneChip arrays.
