TITLE
Jarid1b targets genes regulating development and is involved in neural differentiation [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the genome-wide binding profile of Jarid1b in mouse ESCs. We find that Jarid1b localizes mainly to transcription start sites, of which more than 50% are also bound by Polycomb proteins and are enriched for genes encoding developmental regulators. Furthermore, we generated genome-wide mapping of H3K4me3 in LKO Scramble and LKO Jarid1b mouse ESCs. Virtually all Jarid1b binding sites are positive for H3K4me3. Upon knockdown of Jarid1b, H3K4me3 is significantly increased at Jarid1b positive regions.
