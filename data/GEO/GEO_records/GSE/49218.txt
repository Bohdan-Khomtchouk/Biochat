TITLE
Gene regulation by CBP-p300 in the lens placode - E10.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild type or CBP/p300 fx/fx; Pax6-Cre-positive (CBP/p300-/-) surface ectoderm from E10.5 mouse embryos was laser micodissected from three embryos of each genotype. Total RNA was purified, pooled for each genotype and triplicate samples were reverse transcribed and amplified using a NuGEN kit. cDNA was biotinylated and hybridized to Illumina Mouse6v2.0 bead arrays.

DESIGN
Three wild type and three knockout embryos were used. The RNA from embryos of the same genotype was purified and pooled and triplicate samples were amplified and used for microarray analysis.
