TITLE
Ozone effect on airways hyperpermability

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ozone is a very common environmental pollutant and has been associated with the exacerbation of cardiopulmonary diseases like asthma. In this study the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of ozone on airways hyperpermability were investigated. Two strains of mice, HeJ (Tlr4 mutant) and OuJ (wildtype) were exposed continuously to air or 0.3ppm of ozone. Lungs were removed and RNA was collected to generate expression profiles.
