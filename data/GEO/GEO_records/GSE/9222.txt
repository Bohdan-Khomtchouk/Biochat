TITLE
Structural Variation of Chromosomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromosomal abnormalities have been identified in some individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but their full etiologic role is unknown. Submicroscopic copy number variation (CNV) represents a considerable source of genetic variation in the human genome that contributes to phenotypic differences and disease susceptibility. To explore the contribution CNV imbalances in ASD, we genotyped unrelated ASD index cases using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® 500K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping array.
