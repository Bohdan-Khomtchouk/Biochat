TITLE
Expression data from HeLa cells transfected with SLC44A5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified SLC44A5 as a gene associated with birth weight in cattle based on genome wide association studies. To identify the mechanisms involved in growth and choline transporter, we performed genome-wide mRNA expression analysis in HeLa cells transfected with SLC44A5.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were transfected with negative control, siRNA against SLC44A5, bovine SLC44A5 expression plasmid, and an empty vector control for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
