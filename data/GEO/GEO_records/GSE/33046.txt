TITLE
Gene expression in response to the expression of the bacterial type 3 effector DspA/E

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au10-11_dspa - Induction of DspA/E expression in a transgenic A. thaliana line - Does DspA/E repress defenses at the transcriptionnal level? What defenses are triggered directly in response to the perception of DspA/E? - Transgenic lines expressing a GFP::DspA/E fusion or GFP alone were treated with estradiol or with DMSO. Sample were collected 6 hours following treatment.

DESIGN
8 dye-swap - gene knock out,genotype comparaison,treated vs untreated comparison
