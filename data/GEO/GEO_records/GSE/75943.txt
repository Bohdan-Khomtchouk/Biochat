TITLE
Genome-wide characterization of Zac1 target genes reveals its role as a broad regulator of the imprinted gene network including extracellular matrix genes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to determine the imprinted transcription factor Zac1 targets, we overexpressed Zac1 in a neuroblastoma cell line and measured both the regulated expressed genes by Differential Gene Expressed analysis and Zac1 binding sites throughout the mouse genome by ChIP-seq. We have shown that Zac1 regulates and binds closed to many genes belonging to the Imprinted Gene Network.

DESIGN
Determination of the genes regulated after Zac1 overexpression by measuring the transcriptomes of CAT (Chloramphenicol Acetyl Transferase) and Zac1-transfected Neuro-2A cells using Digital Gene Expression. 2 biological (transfection) replicates were perfomed.
