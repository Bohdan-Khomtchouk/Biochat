Expression data from mouse embryo fibroblast (MEFS)

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of p53 in assuring longevity through prevention of cancer is well established, but how it specifically regulates aging is still controversial. Our assumption is that distinct p53-pathways regulate tumor suppression and aging and that p66Shc is one of the master regulators of the p53 aging function. p66Shc longevity determinant protein acts as a downstream target of p53 and it is indispensable for the ability of activated p53 to induce elevation of intracellular oxidants and apoptosis. We used microarray to gain insight into the mechanism through which p66Shc could regulate p53 oxidative stress dependent activity.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from Primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from 13.5-day-old embryos according to standard procedures from WT, p53KO and p66ShcKO mice. Treatment: Early passage (p.2) MEFs were washed twice with PBS1X solution, and then incubated in DMEM media containing 400 μM of H2O2 or 0.25μg/ml of Doxorubicin (SIGMA) at 37°C for four hours.
