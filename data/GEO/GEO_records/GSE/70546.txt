TITLE
Foxd3 promotes the exit from naïve pluripotency and prevents germline specification through enhancer decommissioning [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Following implantation, mouse epiblast cells transit from a naïve to a primed state in which they are competent for both somatic and primordial germ cell (PGC) specification. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) as an in vitro model to study the transcriptional regulatory principles orchestrating peri-implantation development, here we show that the transcription factor Foxd3 is necessary for the exit from naïve pluripotency and the progression to a primed pluripotent state. During this transition, Foxd3 acts as a repressor that dismantles a significant fraction of the naïve pluripotency expression program through the decommissioning of active enhancers associated with key naïve pluripotency and early germline genes. Subsequently, Foxd3 needs to be silenced in primed pluripotent cells to allow the reactivation of relevant genes required for proper PGC specification. Our findings uncover a wave of activation-deactivation of Foxd3 as a crucial step for the exit from naïve pluripotency and subsequent PGC specification.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles were generated by RNA-seq in duplicates for each of the following mESC lines: Foxd3fl/fl;Cre-ER  mESC maintained in " Serum+LIF " (SL) treated with TM for three days (SL Foxd3-/-); untreated Foxd3fl/fl;Cre-ER SL mESC (SL Foxd3fl/fl); tetON Foxd3 SL mESC treated with Dox for three days; WT SL mESC treated with Dox for three days;  Foxd3fl/fl;Cre-ER mESC maintained in " 2i+LIF " (2i) treated with TM for three days (2i Foxd3-/-); untreated Foxd3fl/fl;Cre-ER 2i mESC (2i Foxd3fl/fl).
