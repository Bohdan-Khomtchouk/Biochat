TITLE
Abscisic acid effect on wild type and the abh1 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of the abh1 mutant Arabidopsis plants following treatment with 50 uM abscisic acid (ABA). ABH1 encodes the large (80kDa) subunit of the nuclear mRNA cap binding complex and affects early ABA signal transduction events (Hugouvieux et al., 2001, Cell 106, 477). Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
4 week old wild-type and abh1 plants were mock-treated or treated with 50uM ABA by spraying. After 4 hours, samples were collected. Total RNA from three biological replicates was pooled for each array hybridization. 2 repliclates were performed. cRNA synthesis and hybridizations were performed  according to standard Affymetrix procedures. Data analysis was run with Affymetrix Micro Array Suite 5.0
