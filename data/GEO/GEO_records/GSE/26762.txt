TITLE
Expression and functional validation of new p38α transcriptional targets in tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
p38α MAP kinase plays an important tumor suppressor role, which is mediated by both its negative effect on cell proliferation and its pro-apoptotic activity. Surprisingly, most tumor suppressor mechanisms coordinated by p38α have been reported to occur at the post- translational level. This contrasts with the important role of p38α in the regulation of transcription and the profound changes in gene expression that normally occur during tumorigenesis. We have analyzed whole genome expression profiles of Ras-transformed wild- type and p38α-deficient cells and have identified 202 genes that are potentially regulated by p38α in transformed cells. Expression analysis has confirmed the regulation of these genes by p38α in tumors, and functional validation has identified several of them as likely mediators of the tumor suppressor effect of p38α on Ras-induced transformation. Interestingly, about 10% of the genes that are negatively regulated by p38α in transformed cells contribute to EGF receptor signalling. Our results suggest that inhibition of EGF receptor signalling by transcriptional targets of p38α is an important function of this signalling pathway in the context of tumor suppression.

DESIGN
We have investigated how transcriptional regulation contributes to the tumor suppressor effect of p38α, by comparing whole-genome expression profiles of wild-type (WT) and p38α- deficient (p38α-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing oncogenic H-RasG12V
