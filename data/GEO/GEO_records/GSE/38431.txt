TITLE
Gene expression from induced CB-derived neurons at different time of differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression from cord blood stem cells and respective derived neuronal cells at different times point of differentiation:CD133+ cells; Keywords: Expression Profiling by array

DESIGN
We analyzed 3 arrays from each condition and 2 arrays for the positive controls:CB CD133+ untreated,CB-iNCs after SOX2 and cMYC overexpression, CB-neurons after differentiation (6 weeks), HUES6-NPCs control, HUES6-neurons control

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
