TITLE
Liver gene expression signatures for type 2 diabetic mice and normal mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Over the past decade, considerable progress has been made regarding the discovery of gene targets by nanobiotechnologies. However, a huge gap frequently exists between candidate and therapeutic relevant genes due to the limitations associated with functional analyses. We report herein on the use of an integrated technologies involving a DNA microarray and an in vivo siRNA delivery system to rapidly and efficiently discover gene targets. Using DNA microarrays, we were able to show that the expression of a monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (MOGAT1), an enzyme involved in triglyceride synthesis and storage, is elevated in the livers of obese diabetic mice. The in vivo silencing of hepatic Mogat1 via a non-viral siRNA delivery system resulted in a dramatic improvement in systemic glucose and lipid homeostasis. These interdisciplinary approaches have the potential to accelerate not only for identification of target gene, but also drug discovery and development.

DESIGN
Gene expression in liver was measured in 4- and 11-week-old KKAy and C57BL/6J mice.
