TITLE
microRNA expression profiling among human embryonic stem cells, differerentiated EBs and adult cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic stem (hES) cells have unique features: self-renewal ability and pluripotency. They can be continuously cultured in undifferentiated state and give rise to cells and tissues of all three germ layers. Thus hES cells provide a resource not only for cell replacement therapy but also for studying human developmental biology. We aimed to identify the unique signature of miRNAs in human embryonic stem cells. Keywords: cell type comparison design

DESIGN
We performed microRNA expression profiling on 3 passages from 2 different hES cell lines (WA09 (H9) and BG01v) and 4 passages from 1 hES cell line (TE06 (I6)), EBs samples derived from WA09 cells at 4 different time points with replicates, and 5 types of adult cells (HUVEC, HMVEC, UASMC NHA, and LFB).
