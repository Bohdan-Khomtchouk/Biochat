TITLE
Identification of STAT5 target genes in human CB HSC, CMP, GMP and MEP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CB CD34+ cells were isolated by Miltenyi miniMACS column. Cells were prestimulated in HPGM with 100 ng/ml KITL, FLT#L and TPO for 48 hrs. Cells were transduced with control MiNR1 or STAT5A-ER in three rounds over 48 hrs. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs), and megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (MEPs) were sorted (for details see Blood 2011, Fatrai et al). cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml 4OHT for 24 hrs after which RNA was isolated for Illumina beadhchiop arrays HT12 v3
