TITLE
Gene expression profiles of Lhcgr-deficient testes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) provide foundation for spermatogenesis by undergoing continuous self-renewal division. Previous studies have reported conflicting results on the role of the pituitary gland activity in SSC self-renewal. In this study, we analyzed the role of hormonal regulation of SSCs using Lhcgr (luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor) knockout mice. Analysis of gene expression profiles showed that testes of Lhcgr-deficient mice exhibit significantly enhanced Wnt5a expression in Sertoli cells.

DESIGN
Lhcgr KO and control WT mice were treated with busulfan in order to eliminate germ cells. The total RNA samples from their testes were subjected to microarray analysis to compare their gene expression profiles.
