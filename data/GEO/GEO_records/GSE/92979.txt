TITLE
The flightless I protein is involved in the genome-wide mRNA post-transcriptional regulation in lung carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the function of Flightless I involved in the overall nuclear export, and genome-wide translation of mRNAs in H1299 cells. By using high-throughput transcriptome and translatome sequencing combined with cell fractionation, we generated genome-wide transcriptome and translatome maps of lung carcinoma cells and normal cells. We find that flightless I protein could modulate the genome-wide translation and mRNA traffiking, suggesting that the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA might be a major mechanism of action for Flightless I.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA expression, ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC) expression and mRNA traffiking in overexpressed-FLII H1299cells and knockdown-FLII HBE cells.

PLATFORM
