TITLE
Gene expression data for liver, adipose, and skeletal muscle tissues of MKR and Healthy mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MKR mice is a Type 2 Diabetic mice, which was created by expressing mutation in IGF1 receptor in the skeletal muscle, and is widely used in diabetes research. Gene expression differences between MKR mice and Healthy (Wild type) mice are poorly understood. We used microarrays to detail the differences between gene expression in liver, fat, and skeletal muscle of MKR and Healthy mice.

DESIGN
Male 10-weeks old FVB/N â€“ MKR and wild type mice were used for the microarray studies. 3 biological replicates for each tissue type  and for both MKR and WT mice were used in the studies.
