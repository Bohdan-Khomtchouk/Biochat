TITLE
Array CGH of Drosophila ChrX deficiencies_duplications on heterochromatin custom array.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Mapping the Drosophila melanogaster X heterochromatin by CGH analysis of embryos lacking specific regions of the X chromosome.

DESIGN
Eight ChrX deficiencies and duplications were tested: 168 (Dp(1;Y)y[2]67g), 175 (Dp(1;Y)y[2]sc), 114n (Dp(1;Y)y[+]mal[126]), 114f (Df(1)fog[114]), 186n (Dp(1;Y)y[+]mal), 186f (Df(1)mal12), B2580 (Dp(1;Y)ct y[+]), B5280 (Dp(1;Y)ct[+]y[+]). To generate embryos lacking different portions of the X heterochromatin, two types of stocks were used: (1) males carrying a deficient X chromosome missing part of the heterochromatin (generally fog-) and a duplication on the Y chromosome that complements the deficiency, and (2) males carrying a duplication of X on the Y chromosome which covers part of the X heterochromatin. In both cases males were crossed to attached X females. In the first case, one quarter of embryos lack most of the X chromosome except the duplication of X on Y. These embryos were identified according to their defects during cellularization. Another quarter of the embryos carry the deficient X chromosome as their sole X chromosome. These embryos were identified according to their defects in posterior midgut formation during early gastrulation. In the second case, one quarter of embryos that lack most of the X chromosome except the duplication of X on Y were identified according to their defects in cellularization or posterior midgut formation. All embryos were collected at room temperature.
