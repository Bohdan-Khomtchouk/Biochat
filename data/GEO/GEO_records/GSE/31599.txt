TITLE
MiRNA expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MiRNA expression is known to be deregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To get insight into miRNA expression pattern in CLL, we compaired miRNA expression profiling of peripheral blood-derived CLL cells and the healthy donor, peripheral blood-derived B-lymphocytes. A set of differentially expressed miRNAs was revealed.

DESIGN
MiRNA expression profiling was performed on 18 CLL samples and one sample, which is a pool of 5 RNA samples of healthy donor peripheral blood-derived B-lymphocytes
