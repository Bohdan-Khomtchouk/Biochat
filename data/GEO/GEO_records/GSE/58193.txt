TITLE
Characterizing the profiles of Ebf1 in mouse fat cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
gene expression data from mouse adipocyte, with and without Ebf1 knock-down

DESIGN
To ascertain the functional targets of Ebf1 in adipocytes, we depleted Ebf1 from mature 3T3-L1 cells by transducing them with lentivirus harboring one of two different Ebf1-specific hairpins or a scrambled control. We then performed expression profiling using Affymetrix arrays with triplicate samples for each hairpin.
