TITLE
Expression data from P8 mouse postnatal retina with various Rb mutant conditions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse retinal samples  were collected at postnatal day 8 (P8). Each contain different perturbations in retinoblastoma (RB) gene function in order to evaluate the dependency of CDK2 on the RB-E2F axis.

DESIGN
Murine retina with different RB family perturbations were collected at P8. RNA from each sample was isolated then hybridized on Affymetrix microarray. Each n represents a biological replicate.
