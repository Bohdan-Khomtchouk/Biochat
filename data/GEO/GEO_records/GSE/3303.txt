TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles of Intact and Regenerating Zebrafish Retina

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Purpose: Investigate the molecular determinants of retinal regeneration in adult vertebrates by analyzing the gene expression profiles of control and post-lesion retina of adult zebrafish, a system that regenerates following injury. Methods: Gene expression profiles of zebrafish retina and brain were determined with DNA microarray, RT-PCR, and real-time quantitative PCR analyses.  Damaged retinas and their corresponding controls were analyzed 2-5 days post-lesion (acute injury condition) or 14 d post-lesion (cell regeneration condition). Results: Expected similarities and differences in the gene expression profile of zebrafish retina and brain were observed, confirming the applicability of the gene expression techniques.  Mechanical lesion of retina triggered significant, time-dependent changes in retinal gene expression.  The induced transcriptional changes were consistent with cellular phenomena known to occur, in a time-dependent manner, subsequent to retinal lesion, including cell cycle progression, axonal regeneration, and regenerative cytogenesis. Conclusions: The results indicate that retinal regeneration in adult zebrafish involves a complex set of induced, targeted changes in gene transcription, and suggest that these molecular changes underlie the ability of the adult vertebrate retina to regenerate.
