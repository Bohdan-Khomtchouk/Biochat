TITLE
Gene expression profile of E. coli MG1655 cells grown at different growth rates in mixed substrates culture

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
E. coli MG155 cells were grown at different grwoth rates in mixed substrate culture. To facilitate different metaoblic status, cells adjust substrate consumption behavior which must be reflected in the gene expression profiles of metablism network. The metabolism network including the substrate transporter systems is our study focus. We use microarrays to capture the adjustments and switches in substrate transporter and central metabolism network along growth rate changes.

DESIGN
E. coli MG155 cells were cultured in a continuous-feed chemostat culture with growth rate control through dilution. Cells were confirmed with a stable growth rate then collected and analyzed 24 hrs after each dilution change.
