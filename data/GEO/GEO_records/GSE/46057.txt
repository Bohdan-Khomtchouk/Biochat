TITLE
Investigation of Alterations in Gene Expression in the Retina Induced by Intravitreal Injection of SH-42 and SH-80

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we demonstrate that SH-42 and SH-80, novel heat shock protein 90 inhibitors, suppress retinal neovascularization via inhibition of hypoxia-mediated angiogenesis. To figure out any genotoxic effect of these compounds related with heat shock protein 90 inhibition, we performed microarray analyses with retinal tissues treated with SH-42 and SH-80 for 7 days.

DESIGN
We intravitreally injected PBS, SH42, or SH80 into the right eyes of C57BL/6 male mice (n = 12 per group). PBS-treated mice were regarded as negative control. Four retinal tissues were pooled into 1 test tube and prepared for further analyses.
