TITLE
Host transcription profile in nasal epithelium and blood of hospitalized children under two years old with Respiratory Syncitial Virus infection [whole blood]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptional profiles in whole blood and nasopharyngeal swaps from children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections at their admission and their discharge, and diagnosed with either RSV or rhinovirus infections. The hypothesis is that this information will contribute to better understand the viral specific immunity and host responses to RSV infection and may suggest leads for the develoment of vaccines and specific treatment.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from whole blood and nasopharyngeal swaps (lysed with PreAnalyti X and Rneasy Mini kit respectively) drawn from individual pediatric patients with acute RSV and hRV acute respiratory tract infection. A total of 332 samples are analyzed in pairwise comparisons (acute versus convalescent phase for blood and nasopharyngeal swaps): 60 with hRV, 76 with acute RSV and 30 with acute RSV co-infected .
