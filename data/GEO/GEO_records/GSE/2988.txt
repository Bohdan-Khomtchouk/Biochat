TITLE
The gene expression program of the developing mammary gland

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The developing mammary gland contains distinct microenvironments that perform specialized functions for branching and ductal invasion.  These microenvironments include the terminal end buds (TEBs) at the tips of invading primary ducts and the more differentiated proximal ducts that give rise to side branches.  We have devised a novel microarray approach to identify genes that are expressed in the epithelium and stroma of these distinct microenvironments. Keywords: spotted oligonucleotide
