TITLE
Distribution of H3K27me3, H3K27ac, and H3K4me1 in E(z) temperature sensitive cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
PcG protein complex PRC2 is a methyltransferase specific for histone H3 lysine27, and H3K27me3 is essential for stable transcription silencing. Here we have determined genomic distributions of H3K27me3, H3K27ac, and H3K4me1 in cultured Drosophila E(z) temperature sensitive cells at 25째C and 31째C where E(z) is largely inactivated by hybridization of ChIP products with tiling microarrays.

DESIGN
Genomic distributions of H3K27me3, H3K27ac, and H3K4me1 in cultured Drosophila E(z) temperature sensitive cells (EZ2-2) at 25째C and 31째C where E(z) is largely inactivated by hybridization of ChIP products with tiling microarrays
