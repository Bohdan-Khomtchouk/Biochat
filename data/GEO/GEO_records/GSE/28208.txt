TITLE
Analysis of the Aedes aegypti transcriptome during flavivirus infection

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis on days 1, 2 and 7 post-infection with dengue, yellow fever and West Nile virus in Aedes aegypti Rockefeller strain mosquitoes RNA was purified and hybridized with Nimblegen X4 microarray chips using 81-mer probes designed from 18,000 open reading frames (ORF) found in the Ae. aegypti genome, with 2 different probes per ORF

DESIGN
Nimblegen X4 array format, 81mer probes, RNA samples taken mostly in triplicate, microarray analysis done in triplicate. Thirty seven samples in total. Fold change data with infection/mock on the Series record.

PLATFORM
GPL13335 Aedes aegypti whole genome array
