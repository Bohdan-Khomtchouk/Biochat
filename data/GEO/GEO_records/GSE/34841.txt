TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic responses to compatible and incompatible plant-virus interactions that lead to cell death

ORGANISM
Nicotiana tabacum

SUMMARY
Hypersensitive response-related programmed cell death (PCD) has been extensively analyzed in various plantâ€“virus interactions. However, little is known about changes in gene expression associated with cell death caused by compatible viruses. The synergistic interaction of Potato virus X (PVX) with Plum pox virus (PPV) results in increased symptoms that lead to systemic necrosis (SN) in Nicotiana benthamiana. Here, we performed three transcriptome comparisons in response to i) a PVX recombinant virus expressing the helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) gene from PPV that leads to SN, ii) a systemic incompatible interaction conferred by the Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-resistance gene N (SHR), and iii) the depletion of the PBE subunit of the proteasome that leads to PCD by virus induced gene silencing (VIGS Prot), at early and late stages of infection. Our analysis indicated that the SN response was clustered with SHR by the similarity of their overall gene expression profiles. However, the expression profiles of defence-related and hormone-responsive genes in response to SN were more closely related to the response to VIGS Prot than to that elicited by SHR. This suggests the potential contribution of proteasome dysfunction to the increase in pathogenicity observed in PVX-potyvirus infections
