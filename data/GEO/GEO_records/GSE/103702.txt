TITLE
Gene expression profile of A549 cells cultured with LA717

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Preclinical cancer drug discovery efforts have employed two-dimensional (2D)-cell-based assay models, which fail to forecast in vivo efficacy and contribute to a lower success rates of clinical approval.  Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models are recently expected to bridge the gap between 2D and in vivo models. We have developed a novel 3D culture method that is suitable for imaging analysis and improves the growth of spheroid-forming cancer cells under anchorage-independent condition by leveraging a feature of LA717, a seaweed-derived polysaccharide. Gene microarrays were used to observe the global gene expression in A549 cells cultured with or without LA717 and identified distinct classes of up or down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
A549 cells were cultured for 7 days in normal attachment plates with normal medium (as control) or normal attachment plate with LA717 containing medium. Each sample was collected three times.
