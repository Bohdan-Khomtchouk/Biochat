TITLE
RNA-sequencing of abdominal fat body-enriched tissue of Drosophila fat body-specific Sdc RNAi knockdown and control

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptome profile of one sequenced sample of mRNA isolated  from pooled (20 from each genotype) abdomen fly extracts enriched in fat body content of fat body-specific Sdc RNAi knockdown and control flies

DESIGN
Abdominal fat body mRNA profiles of 4-6-day old control and fat body-specific Sdc RNAi knockdown were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500

PLATFORM
GPL17275 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
