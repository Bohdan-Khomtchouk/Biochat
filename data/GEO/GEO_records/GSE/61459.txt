TITLE
Variation in the immune and inflammatory responses during pneumonia, an important role of the host and pathogen genetic background

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the pulmonary gene expression in two mouse strains BALB/cOlaHsd (BALB/c) and CBA/CaOlaHsd (CBA/Ca) after infection with various serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae. BALB/c mice show high resistance to infection with S. pneumoniae strain D39 (serotype 2), while CBA/Ca mice are highly susceptible. The lung samples of BALB/c and CBA/Ca were collected at 6h post-infection with one of the tested pneumococcal serotypes (2, 3, 6B and 19F) and for control animals (PBS-treated). Additionally lung samples from both mouse strains were collected at 12h and 24h post-infection with pneumococcal strain D39. The lists of differentially expressed genes were created by the comparison of infected versus PBS-treated animals and infected BALB/c versus infected CBA/Ca for each pneumococcal strain. The tested hypotheses were: 1) infection with S. pneumoniae will change the pulmonary transcriptomes of both mouse strains 2) The pulmonary gene expression will be specific for mouse strains and for the pneumococcal serotype and 3) The change in the pulmonary gene expression will associate with future clinical outcome of infection or with the type of observed inflammatory responses.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from lung tissue from BALB/cOlaHsd and CBA/CaOlaHsd mouse strains (Harlan) post intranasal infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae of various serotypes (2, 3, 6B and 19F) dose 5.0E06 CFU or PBS-treated animals
