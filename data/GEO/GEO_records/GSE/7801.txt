TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Destructured Pig Semimembranosus Muscle

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The destructured meat syndrome is clearly detrimental to cooked ham industry but still poorly understood. The affected muscles lose their fibrous aspect and give a soft whitened muscular mass without any organised structure. Normal (n=7) and destructured (n=7) groups of pigs were allotted 36 h post-mortem based on meat L* values. Transcriptome analysis of Semimembranosus muscles was conducted to identify genes potentially involved in this syndrome. Fifty nine genes were differentially expressed (p < 0.01) and 90% of them were upregulated in the affected muscles. Myofibrillar proteins involved in the contractile properties (TNNC2 and TNNT3) or in the integrity (TMOD4) of the sarcomere were increased in the affected muscle. Moreover, eight genes encoding enzymes of glycolysis (ALDOA, ENO3, GAPDH, LDHA, PGAM2, PKM2) or glycogenolysis (PGM1, PYGM) were upregulated in the destructured muscles. These results suggest that both myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins might be involved in the etiology of this syndrom. Keywords: meat quality comparison
