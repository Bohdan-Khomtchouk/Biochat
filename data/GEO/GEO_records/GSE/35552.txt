TITLE
Penetrance of biallelic SMARCAL1 mutations is associated with environmental and genetic disturbances of gene expression (2)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Biallelic mutations of the DNA annealing helicase SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF-related  matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a-like 1) cause  Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD, MIM 242900), an incompletely penetrant  autosomal recessive disorder. Using human, Drosophila, and mouse models, we show  that the proteins encoded by SMARCAL1 orthologues localize to transcriptionally active  chromatin and modulate gene expression. We also show that similar to SIOD patients,  deficiency of the SMARCAL1 orthologues alone is insufficient to cause disease in fruit  flies and mice although such deficiency causes modest diffuse alterations in gene  expression. Rather, disease manifests when SMARCAL1 deficiency interacts with genetic  and environmental factors that further alter gene expression. We conclude that the  SMARCAL1 annealing helicase buffers fluctuations in gene expression and that  alterations in gene expression contribute to the penetrance of SIOD.

DESIGN
For analysis of gene expression in flies, 5.0 μg of total RNA from three biologically independent replicates was extracted from 1) yw, 2) Marcal1del/del, 3) RpII2154/FM7, and 4) RpII2154/FM7;Marcal1del/del ovaries at 20°C and from yw and Marcal1del/del at 25°C, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 arrays.
