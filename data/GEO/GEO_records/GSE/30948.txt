TITLE
E. faecalis transcriptional responses to manganese stress

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Enterococcus faecalis V583 comparing the transcriptome of cells grown in M17 + glucose 0.5% (GM17) with the transcriptome of cells grown in M17 + glucose 0.5% + 4 mM MnSO4

DESIGN
2 condition experiment: V583 grown in GM17 vs. V583 grown in GM17 + 0.4mM MnSO4. Three biological replicates, one of which is a dye-swap. Three replicates per array.

PLATFORM
GPL13826 LMGFM E. faecalis V583 oligo 3.6K v.2
