TITLE
Expression data from Control or ShSuz12 rat Intestinal epithelial cells IEC-6

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Polycomb-group proteins form multimeric protein complexes involved in transcriptional silencing. The Polycomb Repressive complex 2 (PRC2) contains the Suppressor of Zeste-12 protein (Suz12) and the histone methyltransferase Enhancer of Zeste protein-2 (Ezh2). This complex, catalyzing the di- and tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 27, is essential for embryonic development and stem cell renewal. However, the role of Polycomb-group protein complexes in the control of the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) phenotype is not known. We investigated the impact of Suz 12 depletion on gene expression in IEC-6 cells.

DESIGN
Multiple shRNA lentiviral constructs were tested in IEC-6 cells for their ability to down-regulate Suz12 expression (MISSION shRNA lentiviral transduction particles, Sigma–Aldrich Canada, Oakville, ON). Forty percent confluent cells were infected in medium supplemented with 4 mg/ml polybrene (Sigma–Aldrich Canada) for 6 h. Two days after infection, cell populations were selected with 2 mg/ml puromycin (Sigma–Aldrich Canada). The clone TRCN0000038728 was selected: the shRNA against Suz12 (GCTGACAATCAAATGAATCAT) is conserved in rat (accession number FM084383), murine (accession number NM_199196) and human (accession number NM_015355.2) Suz12 sequences. Efficiency of infection was estimated at 25%. Control or ShSuz12 IEC-6 cell total RNAs were isolated with the Rneasy kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA samples from three independent experiments were used for microarray analysis.
