TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between SDR and HHR mammary glands tissue

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To examine whether factors responsible for early involution of HHR mammary gland are different from those involved in physiologic involution of the SDR tissue, gene expression profiles of HHR tissue at lactation day 1 and SDR tissue at involution day 1 were evaluated by microarray analysis

DESIGN
Microarray results of the mammary glands of SDR, heterozygous HHR and homozygous HHR at lactation.

PLATFORM
GPL1355 [Rat230_2] Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array
