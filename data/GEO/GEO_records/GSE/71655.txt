TITLE
Expression data from 3-week old Arabidopsis seedlings of WT and brm-1 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Chromatin, in addition to its purely structural functions, is considered a major regulatory system coordinating various genetic networks in eukaryotes. External and developmental signals can be transmitted through signaling cascades to chromatin remodeling complexes like SWI/SNF, which alter chromatin structure by moving, ejecting or restructuring nucleosomes. Genetic studies in Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are critical for proper plant development and growth. Especially, BRM, a catalytic subunit of the complex, was shown to directly regulate several genes with important functions in leaf development, flowering initiation, as well as gibberellin and abscisic acid signaling. In addition, SWI/SNF complexes were also shown to be involved in regulation of enhancer activity in animal cells and RNA-mediated transcriptional silencing in plants. In this study we performed transcript profiling of WT and brm-1 mutant using Agronomics microarrays for detecting changes in expression of both sense and antisense transcripts.

DESIGN
3-week old Arabidopsis seedlings of WT and brm-1 null mutant were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix Agronomics microarrays.
