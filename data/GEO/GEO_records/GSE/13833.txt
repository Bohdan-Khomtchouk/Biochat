TITLE
Transcriptome changes triggered by the synthetic defense elicitors DCA and INA in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
DCA (3,5-Dichloroanthranilic acid) is a newly identified synthetic defense elicitor. To perform a comparative analysis of defense responses triggered by DCA and the structurally related defense inducer INA (2,6-Dichloroisonicotinic acid) Affymetrix chip experiments were performed with Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings treated with one of these two compounds.
