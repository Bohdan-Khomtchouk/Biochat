TITLE
Expression data from ependymal layer of wild type and FoxJ1 null postnatal male mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FoxJ1 dependent gene expression is required for establishment of ependymal cells in the postnatal brain.  This data set compares gene expression profiles of wildtype and FoxJ1 null microdissected dissected tissues at multiple postnatal time points. We used microarrays to detail the FoxJ1-dependent programme of gene expression underlying ependymal cell differentiation in the mouse brain.

DESIGN
Using FoxJ1-EGFP brains, EGFP(+) domains were microdissected using laser capture microscopy from P1, P7 and P14 wildtype and FoxJ1 null brains.
