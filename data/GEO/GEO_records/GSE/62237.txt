TITLE
Secondary proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib resistant myeloma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Modulation of the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway with the proteasome inhibitor (PI)  is an established component of therapy for plasma cell disorders. However, resistance emerges and the mechanism is incompletely understood. We generated carfilzomib-resistant (CR) myeloma cell lines by exposing drug-naive ANBL-6, KAS-6/1, U266, and OPM-2 cells to increasing concentrations of carfilzomib and then performed gene expression profiling (GEP) to identify prominent changes compared to their vehicle-treated counterparts, followed by exploration of the mechanism(s) of proteasome inhibitor resistance.

DESIGN
We generated carfilzomib-resistant (CR) myeloma cell lines by exposing drug-naive ANBL-6, KAS-6/1, U266, and OPM-2 cells to increasing concentrations of carfilzomib.  These were then subjected to gene expression profiling (GEP) to identify prominent changes compared to their vehicle-treated counterparts.
