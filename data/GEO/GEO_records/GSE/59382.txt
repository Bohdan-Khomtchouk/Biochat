TITLE
Alteration of gene expression in MCF-7 cells induced by king cobra venom L-amino acid oxidase (OH-LAAO)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alteration of gene expression in MCF-7 cells using array-based whole genome gene expression technology . Results provide useful information on the molecular events leading to cell death induced by L-amino acid oxidase enzyme.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were treated with IC20 value of OH-LAAO or PBS (control). Treated and control cells were harvested and the RNA were extracted. RNAs were pooled from three independent experiments (n=3) (Replicate 1 and replicate 2) and were subjected to microarray analyses.
