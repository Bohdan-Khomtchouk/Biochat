TITLE
Expression data from human Dupuytren's disease cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to analyze gene expression associated to extracellular matrix components of normal palmar fascia and tissues affected by Dupuytren's disease. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression associated to Dupuytren's disease.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from three different samples corresponding to two different individuals with Dupuytren's disease: Dupuytren's diseased contracture cords (DDC), palmar fascia clinically unaffected by Dupuytren's disease contracture (NPF), and normal forehand fascia (NFF).
