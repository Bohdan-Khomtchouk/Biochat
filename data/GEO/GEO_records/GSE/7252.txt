TITLE
Expression profiling in alp13 deletion, clr6-1 mutant and pst1-1 mutant, versus WT S. pombe cells.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Expression analyses in alp13 deletion (Clr6-complex II mutant), clr6-1 partial mutant (Clr6 complexes I and II mutant) and pst1-1 partial mutant (Clr6-complex I mutant) S.pombe cells. Keywords: Expression

DESIGN
Wild type or mutant cDNA reverse transcribed from total RNA was labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5. Four experiments were performed for each genotype with two experiments in which the dyes were swapped. Agilent 44K in situ 60mer DNA microarray that tiles the entire Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome every 300 bp alternately on both strands was used to probe expression of transcripts up-regulated in alp13 null, clr6-1 and pst1-1 cells versus wild-type cells.
