TITLE
Reanalysis of GSE8884 Samples with Breast Epithelial Samples from GSE3744.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the differentiation process of embryonic stem cells into hemangioblasts, gene expression profiles of ES, EB and Blast cells (BL) were analyzed. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from purified BC cells, day3.5-EBs and undifferentiated ESCs (from two hESC lines, H1 and H9) using the Qiagen RNAeasy kit  We sought to obtain homogeneous populations of cells at each developmental stage in order to increase the purity of each sample.
