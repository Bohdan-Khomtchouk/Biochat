TITLE
NHDF Cells (Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts): Control (unstimulated fibroblasts) vs. Borrelia infected cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of NHDF Cells comparing control untreated fibroblasts with fibroblasts coincubated with three different species of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group.

DESIGN
Four-conditions experiment (unstimulated NHDF; NHDF stimulated by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto strain IBS19; NHDF stimulated by Borrelia garinii strain IBS6; NHDF stimulated by Borrelia garinii strain IBS17).  There is 6 Biological replicates for each condition (i.e. 6 different batches of NHDF cells from 6 independent human donor), independently grown and harvested.
