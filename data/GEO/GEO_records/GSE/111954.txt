TITLE
Expression data of E7.5 primary germ layers [microarray]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Alternative splicing (AS) and alternative promoter (AP) usage expand the repertories of mammalian transcriptome profiles and thus diversify gene functions. However, our knowledge about the extent and functions of AS and AP usage in mouse early embryogenesis remains elusive. Here, by performing whole-transcriptome splicing profiling with high-throughput next generation sequencing, we report that AS extensively occurs in embryonic day (E) 7.5 mouse primary germ layers, and may be involved in multiple developmental processes. In addition, numerous RNA splicing factors are differentially expressed and alternatively spliced across the three germ layers, implying the potential importance of AS machinery in shaping early embryogenesis. Notably, AP usage is remarkably frequent at this stage, accounting for more than one quarter (430/1648) of the total significantly different AS events. Genes generating the 430 AP events participate in numerous biological processes, and include important regulators essential for mouse early embryogenesis, suggesting that AP usage is widely used and might be relevant to mouse germ layer specification. Our data underline the potential significance of AP usage in mouse gastrulation, providing a rich data source and opening another dimension for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of mammalian early development. The Microarray was used to measure gene expression in E7.5 mouse primary germ layers, which was compared to an independent RNA-seq data performed in our lab.

DESIGN
The gene expression patterns were obtained using Microarray and compared between different germ layers.
