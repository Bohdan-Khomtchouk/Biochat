TITLE
The role of subclonal population of cells on tumor growth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we activated subclonal differentiation in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells to study the role of differentiated cells on tumor growth. Mesenchymal pancreatic adenocarcinoma (MiaPaCa) cells differentiated into adipose and endothelial cells to assess the tumor initiation potential of the differentiated cells and molecular changes associated with cell differentiation. Epithelial (TC-2742-2) cells expressed with Ebf2 were analyzed for its tumorigenic potential and molecular changes associated with Ebf2 expression.

DESIGN
MiaPaCa: Control cells were compared with differentiated Adipose and Endothelial cells. TC-2742-2: Control cells were compared with Ebf2 expressed cells
