TITLE
RNAseq analysis of the human neutrophil transcriptome, with and without in vitro cytokine stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report cytokine specific changes in gene expression in the human neutrophil transcriptome using TNF-alpha and GM-CSF stimulation of healthy neutrophils

DESIGN
Healthy human neutrophils were stimulated with TNF-alpha or GM-CSF for 1h in vitro. RNA was analysed by SOLiD and Illumina sequencing.  RNA from one biological donor was sequenced on both platforms, and two different biological donors were sequenced by Illumina.
