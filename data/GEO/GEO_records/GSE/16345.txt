TITLE
Expression analysis of GFP+ and GFP- populations of B.subtilis strain DS901

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in GFP+ and GFP- populations of B.subtilis strain DS901

DESIGN
An 8 chip study using total RNA recovered from B.subtilis strain DS901 (Phag-gfp). With a Cytopeia Influx cell sorter, cells were sorted in GFP+ and GFP- populations. Each B. subtilis subsp. subtilis strain 168 NC_000964 chip measures the expression level of 4,104 genes in two-fold from with eight 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene.

PLATFORM
GPL8614 TNO/NimbleGen 60-mer TI224308 Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis strain 168 array
