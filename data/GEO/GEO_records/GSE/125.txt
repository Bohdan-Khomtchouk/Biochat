ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice used were in a mixed background between 129/SvEv and C57BL/6. They were Rp1 knockout mice (Rp1-/-). Triplicates of RNA samples from Rp1-/- neural retinas for hybridization were collected at P14. Each RNA sample included a pool of neural retinas from 3-4 mice. Retinas were all collected at 1-2 pm of the day. Keywords: repeat sample
