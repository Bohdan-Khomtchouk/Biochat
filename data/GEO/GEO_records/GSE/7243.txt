TITLE
Expression data from overnight minimal medium culture

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene experission profiles of Ecoli WT3110 and phoU mutant Keywords: one time point

DESIGN
DNA microarray analysis of the PhoU mutant with the wild type strain W3110 as a control. The PhoU mutant and the wild type strain were grown in MOPS minimal medium overnight when the RNA was isolated using MasterPure RNA Purification Kit and reverse transcribed for making probes for array hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
