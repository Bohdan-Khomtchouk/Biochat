TITLE
Female BALB/c Mouse Testosterone-Treated Submandibular/Lacrimal/Meibomian Glands

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our objective was to determine the nature and extent of androgen regulation of gene expression in the female lacrimal, meibomian,and submandibular glands, and to explore the degree to which this control is the same as in male glands. Keywords: Hormone treatment

DESIGN
Series includes pooled (n = 5-6 mice per biological replicate) samples from lacrimal, meibomian, and submandibular glands of male palcebo- and testosterone-treated BALB/c mice. All experiments were run in triplicate (pooled biological replicates) on CodeLink Mouse Uniset I Microarrays
