TITLE
Small RNA profiling of RNase III enzyme deficient DN3 thymocytes, Tregs, activated CD4+ T cells, and embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we analyze the small RNA species in the following: 1. DN3 thymocytes following inactivation of LoxP flanked Drosha and Dicer alleles with Lck-cre 2. Tregs following inactivation of LoxP flanked Drosha and Dicer alleles with CD4-cre 3. activated CD4+ T cells following inactivation of LoxP flanked Drosha and Dicer alleles with CD4-cre 4. MEFs following inactivation of LoxP flanked Drosha and Dicer alleles with Rosa26-CreER and 4-OH tamoxifen treatment

DESIGN
Fractionation of small RNAs (19-30nt) and cloning of only RNA with 5' phosphates and 3' hydroxyls

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
