TITLE
Gene expression profiles of PML knockdown or WDR4 overexpression in A549 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung cancer cell line, A549 cells, was transfected with siPML or siCtrl for 48hr to knockdown PML expression. WDR4 or vector was overexpressed in A549 cells for 48hr. These four sets of cells were then subjected to microarray profiling using the Human OneArray microarray (version HOA6.1, GEO Platform GPL19137) from Phalanx Biotech Group.

DESIGN
Comparison of transcriptomes from siPML/siCtrl and W4/vec in A549 cells

PLATFORM
GPL19137 Phalanx Human OneArray [Annotation HOA6 release 1.0]
