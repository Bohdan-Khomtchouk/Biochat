TITLE
Comparison of SCG expression profiles from Bax null versus NGF-Bax double null mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that developmental competition between sympathetic neurons for survival is critically dependent on a sensitization process initiated by target innervation and mediated by a series of feedback loops.  Target-derived nerve growth factor (NGF) promoted expression of its  receptor TrkA in neurons and prolonged TrkA-mediated signals.  NGF also controlled expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT4), which, through the receptor p75, can kill neighboring neurons with low retrograde NGF–TrkA signaling whereas neurons with high NGF–TrkA signaling are protected.  Perturbation of any of these feedback loops disrupts the dynamics of competition.  We suggest that three target-initiated events are essential for rapid and robust competition between neurons: sensitization, paracrine apoptotic signaling, and protection from such effects. Keywords: comparative gene expression analysis

DESIGN
This experiment examine gene expression differences in superior cervical ganglia fro P0 bax null versus NGF-Bax double null animals. The Bax genotype was used in order to prevent the neuronal cell death normally observed in the NGF null animal.
