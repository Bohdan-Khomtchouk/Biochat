TITLE
Gene expression profiling of hormone resistant prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we performed transcriptional profiling of transurethral resections of hormone resistant prostate cancer and compared it with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), untreated localized prostate cancer and hormone sensitive prostate cancer. Keywords: time course; disease state analysis

DESIGN
Each sample (= Array) is derived from a different patient with the following subsequent disease states: 3x BPH, 7x localized prostate cancer samples, 2 horomone sensitive prostate cancer samples, one locally advanced prostate cancer, 4x hormone resistant prostate cancer early stage and 3x hormone resistant prostate cancer late stage. Platform was Affymetrix
