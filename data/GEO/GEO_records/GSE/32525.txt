TITLE
Study of the functional implication of altered nuclear morphology on global gene expression profile in Drosophila S2R+ cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
A probe of the coupling of gene expression and nuclear structure in Drosophila S2R+ cells was undertaken by a study of altered expression profile following a 6 day RNAi mediated genetic perturbation of Klaroid (CG18584), Lamin (CG6944) and Msp-300 (CG33715).

DESIGN
Genotypic Technology designed  Custom  Gene Expression Drosophila 8x15k array ( Agilent-AMADID:020441)
