TITLE
Analysis of IgM and IgG Autoatibodies NOD.B10Sn-H2b/J female mice and age and gender-matched C57BL/10 controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NOD.B10Sn-H2b/J mice are a mouse model of primary Sjogren's syndrome.  We compared IgM and IgG autoantibody levels from NOD.B10Sn-H2b/J females with clinical disease to those of healthy controls.

DESIGN
We collected serum from female NOD.B10Sn-H2b/J and C57BL/10 mice at 26 weeks of age. We performed autoantigen arrays at the Microarray Core Facility of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center

PLATFORM
GPL23314 Multi-species Autoantigen Microarray 94
