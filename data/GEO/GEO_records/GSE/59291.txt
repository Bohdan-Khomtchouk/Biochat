TITLE
Expression data from shMiwi/shCaf1 transduced mouse elongating spermatids

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We reasoned that the pi-RISC, by virtue of the enormous sequence portfolio of piRNAs, might mediate elimination of a large variety of mRNAs in late stages of spermiogenesis. Both Miwi-null and Caf1-null mice showed early spermiogenic arrest, preventing us from determining the role of MIWI and CAF1 in elongating spermatids using the existing genetic models. We therefore used microarrays to detail the global effect of MIWI or CAF1 on mRNA levels in mouse elongating spermatids.

DESIGN
Using GFP+ elongating spermatids sorted from mouse testes transduced with shMiwi:GFP, shCaf1:GFP, or control pSilencer:GFP, we performed transcriptome profiling on Affymetrix mouse arrays.
