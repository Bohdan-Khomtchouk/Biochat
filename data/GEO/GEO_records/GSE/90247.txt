TITLE
polyA depleted RNA-seq from HeLa-S3 (ENCSR000CQJ)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from the whole cell fraction of independent growths of cell line HeLa-S3. They are stranded PE76 Illumina GAIIx RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted and DSN normalized Poly-A- RNA > 200 nucleotides in size.
