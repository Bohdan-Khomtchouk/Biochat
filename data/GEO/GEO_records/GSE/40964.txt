TITLE
Agilent 44K Rice Oligo DNA Microarray RAP-DB (G2519F#15241); genome-wide transcriptional analysis of Aluminum-responsive genes in rice (Oryza sativa).

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
By comparing transcriptional profiling between a wild-type rice and an Al-sensitive rice mutant star1, we found that rice possesses novel mechanisms of Al-tolerance in addition to ART1-regulated mechanism in rice.

DESIGN
The transcriptional profiling between the wild-type rice and an Al-sensitive mutant, star1. +Al vs. -Al in the roots of wild-type rice and star1 mutant. Biological replicates: +Al/-Al WT root tip 4 replicates, +Al/-Al WT basal tip 4 replicates, +Al/-Al star1 root tip 4 replicates, +Al/-Al star1 basal tip 4 replicates
