TITLE
Expression data from wildtype and spy-3 roots

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
SPY is an O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase involved in many signaling and developmental processes in Arabidopsis. SPY also has a role in root development. In the spy mutant, a middle cortex is produced prematurely. To understand how SPY regulates root cortex proliferation, we sought to identify the genes affected by the spy mutation in the root.

DESIGN
The transciptomes from the root of one-week-old seedlings, Col or spy-3 mutant, were compared. The seedlings were grown on a nylon membrane placed on 1X MS agar medium and the plates are positionally vertically in a Pecival growth chamber with 16 hr light and 8 hr dark. Three biological replicates were performed.
