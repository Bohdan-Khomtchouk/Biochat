TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of antigen-specific CD8 T cells from wildtype and mutant mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand CD8 effector T cell differentiation in more detial we have used transcriptional profiling of antigen-specific CD8 T cells deficient in Blimp1, IL-2ra, or both, or Tbet. We reveal a common program of effector differentiation regulated by cytokine signaling and the combined activities of Blimp1 and T-bet, indicating remarkable redundancy and specificity in the control of genes involved in the differentiation of effector T cells.

DESIGN
Bone marrow chimeric mice were generated containing congenically marked wildtype and mutant heamatopoietic cells. The mice were infected with primed with PR8 influenza virus. Six weeks later they were infected with the heterologous HKx31 influenza virus. Antigen-specific (NP366) positive CD8 T cells were sorted. RNA was exracted and RNA sequening performed.
