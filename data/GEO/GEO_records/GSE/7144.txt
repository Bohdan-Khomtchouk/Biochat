TITLE
TGF-beta1 and 2 treatment of human trabecular meshwork cells (Russell-3U24NS043571-01S1-2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGF-beta levels are known to increase in the aqueous humor of eye cells in patients with glaucoma.  Increase TGF-beta is assumed to have a biochemical impact on the trabecular meshwork, and an increase in extracellular matrix formation, which may be responsible for decrease outflow facility of the eye.  This may increase extracellular pressure, causing glaucoma.  TGF-beta 1 may be the cause of abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrices in trabecular meshwork of eyes with primary open angle glaucoma.  Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta2 regulates the expression of proteoglycans in aqueous humor from human glaucomatous eyes. To identify gene expression changes as a result of TGF-beta1 and 2 treatment of human trabecular meshwork cells. We expect to see a change in expression of the proteoglycans in HTM cells as a response to TGF-beta treatment. Human Trabecular Meswork cells in the eye were bathed by aqueous humor.  TM cells were removed from individuals with the following ages: 16,66,67,73, and 76.  Each individual was treated with EtOH (control), TGF-beta1, or TGF-beta2.  Total RNA from each individual was pooled for each chip.  Technical replicates were created for each treatment type, for a total of 6 chips. Keywords: dose response
