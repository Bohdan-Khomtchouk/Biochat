TITLE
Gene expression in rice leaves (Pia) in response to inoculation with rice blast fungus

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Fourth leaves of rice seedlings (4.5 leaf stage) grown in hydroponic culture were inoculated with rice blast fungus and gene expression profiles were analyzed by microarray.

DESIGN
Fourth leaves of the two isogenic lines of rice cv Nipponbare (blast-resistance gene: Pia or its mutant, pia) were inoculated with rice blast fungus, P91-15B, carrying avirulence gene, AvrPia.  Total RNA was isolated, labeled with cy3, and probed with agilent rice oligoarray (4x44).

PLATFORM
GPL6864 Agilent-015241 Rice Gene Expression 4x44K Microarray (Feature Number version)
