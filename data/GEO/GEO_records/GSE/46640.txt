TITLE
Comparison of the translational program in oocytes from wild type and Areg KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study tests the hypothesis that maternal mRNA translation in oocytes is sensitive to the environment in which the oocytes mature. Amphiregulin (AREG) is a critical signal for oocyte maturation but also for oocyte developmental competence. Here we have used a genome-wide approach to determine whether the oocyte translational program is affected when oocytes mature in vivo in the absence of AREG. To this aim, polysome arrays were used to define patterns of transcript recruitment to the polysomes in oocytes derived from wild type mice and mice homozygous null for the Areg gene.

DESIGN
Forty-eight hours (h) after PMSG injection, mice were stimulated with hCG for 0, or 14 h, and GV, and MII stage oocytes were collected. Polysome bound mRNAs were purified, reverse-transcribed and linearly amplified with WT-Ovation FFPE RNA Amplification System V2 (NuGEN). 5Âµg cDNA were fragmented and hybridized with Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430.2 array chips. Experiments were done using 3 independent sample sets.
