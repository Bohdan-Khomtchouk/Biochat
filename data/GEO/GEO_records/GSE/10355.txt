TITLE
flg22 treatment & mutants 2-Gene profiling upon biotic stress treatment. Gene profiling in microRNA mutants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs06-06_mirna - flg22 treatment & mutants 2 - Time course : What are the genes (incuding microRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated upon flg22 treatment? miRNA : What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of microRNA mutants? siRNA : What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of siRNA mutants? - Col-0, dcl4-1, rdr6-1 were grown for 12-day on MS solid medium ,seedlings were then transferred in MS liquid medium 2 days after and treated with 10uM flagellin active or inactive. Samples were harvested at 30 min after treatment. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison

DESIGN
3 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
