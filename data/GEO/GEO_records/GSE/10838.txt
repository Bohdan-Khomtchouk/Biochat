TITLE
Meiotic time course of Histone H3 occupancy in a mutant Spo11F

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To study the meiotic dynamic of the methylation of H3K4, in relation with the transcriptomic regulation, we determine the meiotic time-course of H3 occupancy by ChIP-chip in a mutant Spo11F. Keywords: ChIP-chip, meiotic time course, histone modification
