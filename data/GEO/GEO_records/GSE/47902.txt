TITLE
Expression profiles of wildtype and SHOX transgenic embryonic mouse limbs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Deficiency of the human short stature homeobox-containing gene (SHOX) has been identified in several disorders characterized by reduced height and skeletal anomalies such as Turner, Leri-Weill and Langer syndrome as well as idiopathic short stature. Although highly conserved in vertebrates, rodents lack a SHOX orthologue. Here, we compared gene expression profiles of wildtype and SHOX transgenic mouse limbs using microarray experiments to identify SHOX target genes in the developing limb.

DESIGN
Limbs of E12.5 mouse embryos were dissected, fore- and hindlimbs were pooled and genotyped for RNA extraction. RNA from 2 to 4 littermates was pooled per genotype (Wildtype and SHOX transgene) and compared. In total, 2 microarray hybridization experiments were performed using RNA from 2 biological replicate samples for each genotype.
