SUMMARY
Host response to systemic bacterial challenge (sepsis) with E. coli strains CFT073 and F11 at 6 and 12 hours post inoculum

DESIGN
48 hpf embryos were manually dechorianated, briefly anesthetized with 0.77 mM ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt (tricaine) (Sigma-Aldrich), and embedded in 0.8% low melt agarose (MO BIO Laboratories) without tricaine. After the agarose solidified, embryos were immersed in E3 media lacking methylene blue. Prior to injection, 1 ml of bacterial culture was pelleted, washed with 1 ml sterile PBS, and re-suspended in PBS to obtain ~1X109 CFU/ml. PBS. One nl of this bacterial suspension containing  ~1000 CFU was microinjected into the bloodstream via the circulation valley using an Olympus SZ61 or SZX10 stereomicroscope together with a YOU-1 micromanipulator (Narishige), a Narishige IM-200 microinjector, and a JUN-AIR model 3-compressor. For each experiment, the average CFU per injection was determined by adding 10 1-nl drops to 1 ml of 0.7% NaCl, which was then serial diluted and plated on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates. Mock-infected controls were inoculated with 1 nl sterile PBS.  Following injection, embryos were removed from agar and placed individually into wells of a 48-well plate (Nunc) containing E3 medium and incubated at 28.5Â°C. Experiments were performed in biological quadruplicate.
