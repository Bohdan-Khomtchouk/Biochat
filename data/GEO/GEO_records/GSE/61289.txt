TITLE
screen miRNAs specifically regulated by mTORC1 or mTORC2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To screen miRNAs specifically regulated by mTORC1 or mTORC2, a global miRNA expression profile in MCF-7 cells treated with rapamycin or PP242 (mTORC1/2 kinase inhibitor) was developed using microarray.

DESIGN
control,  rapamycin or PP242 treated human MCF-7 cells were harvested 48h post-treatment and subjected to total RNA extraction.
