TITLE
GTF2I Mutations are Common in Thymic Epithelial Tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Within a project aim to define the genomic aberration of thymic epithelial tumors, we performed array CGH in 65 thymic epithelial tumors. Tumor samples were collected during surgery or by image-guided biopsies and immediately frozen. Section from frozen material were cut and stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin. A pathologist reviewed the slides and selected only cases with > 80% of cancer cells.

DESIGN
Copy number aberrations of a series of 65 thymic epithelial tumors were evaluated using array CGH. Differences in copy number aberrations between different histotypes were evaluated. Significant regions of CN aberrations were defined using GISTIC algorithms.
