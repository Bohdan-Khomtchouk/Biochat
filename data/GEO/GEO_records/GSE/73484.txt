TITLE
Expression data of LPS-induced genes in bone marrow derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TLR ligands consistently induce expression of two Hes family members Hes1 and Hey1 in macrophages.To evaluate the effects of these two factors on inflammatory responses, we generated mice lacking both Hes1 and Hey1 (DKO). WT and DKO BMDMs were then untreated or exposed to LPS for 3 hours, and microarray was performed to examine global gene expression profiles to identify Hes1 and Hey1-regulated inflammatory genes

DESIGN
Examination of Hes1 and Hey1-regulated inflammatory genes in macrophages
