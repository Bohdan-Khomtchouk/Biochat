TITLE
16 prostatic cancer cell lines and sensitivity to an anticancer tumor agent dasatinib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling was conducted on RNA from 16 prostatic cancer cell lines to identify genes whose expression level correlate with sensitivity of an anti-tumor agent (dasatinib). Keywords: comparison of sensitive group versus resistant group of cell lines to agent

DESIGN
Baseline gene expression profiling was performed using 16 prostatic cancer cell lines to identify expression signatures highly correlated with in vitro sensitivity to dasatinib.
