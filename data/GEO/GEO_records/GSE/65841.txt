TITLE
Effect of DBC1/CCAR2 knockout on global gene expression in SW480 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Deleted in breast cancer (DBC1; also known as CCAR2) is a coactivator for nuclear receptors (NRs) and other transcription factors as well as a negative regulator of epigenetic modifiers such as deacetylases SIRT1 and HDAC3. We performed genome-wide gene expression analysis in wild-type and DBC1 knockout SW480 cells to investigate global gene expression changes induced by DBC1 knockout.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from SW480 wild-type and DBC1 knockout cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The integrity of RNA was analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Three independent biological replicates were assayed for each sample. The microarrays were performed following the Affymetrix standard protocol.
