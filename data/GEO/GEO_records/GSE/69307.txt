TITLE
Expression data in histone-depleted cells [gene-level]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
How chromatin controls transcription elongation and splicing is an open question. Here we determine the transcriptomic changes of cells partially depleted of core histones. For that we construct a cell line with Doxycycline-controlled levels of the histone regulatory protein SLBP (HCT-shSLBP). HCT-shSLBP is derived from the human colon cancer cell line HCT116. Exon level and gene level transcriptomic data of Doxycycline-treated cells is compared with that non-treated cells. The final goal is to determine how chromatin depletion affects transcription and splicing.

DESIGN
HCT-shSLBP cells from three independent Doxycycline-treated or nontreated cultures were recovered and processed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
