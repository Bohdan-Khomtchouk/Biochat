SUMMARY
The TLX1 and TLX3 transcription factor oncogenes play an important role in the pathogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)1,2. Here we used reverse engineering of global transcriptional networks to decipher the oncogenic regulatory circuit controlled by TLX1 and TLX3. This Systems Biology analysis defined TLX1 and TLX3 as master regulators of an oncogenic transcriptional circuit governing T-ALL. Notably, network structure analysis of this hierarchical network identified RUNX1 as an important mediator of TLX1 and TLX3 induced T-ALL, and predicted a tumor suppressor role for RUNX1 in T-cell transformation. Consistent with these results, we identified recurrent somatic loss of function mutations in RUNX1 in human T-ALL. Overall, these results place TLX1 and TLX3 atop of an oncogenic transcriptional network controlling leukemia development, demonstrate power of network analysis to identify key elements in the regulatory circuits governing human cancer and identify RUNX1 as a tumor suppressor gene in T-ALL.
