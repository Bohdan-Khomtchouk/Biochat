TITLE
Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344 response to cyanide vs. ammonium or nitrogen starvation

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes CECT 5344

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of the cyanotroph Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344 in response to cyanide present in wastewaters from industrial activities, such as jewelry and electroplating activities

DESIGN
Four-conditions experiment, including three different nitrogen sources (ammonium, sodium cyanide or a cyanide-containing wastewater). One experiment without nitrogen added to the media (nitrogen limited condition). Four biological replicates for each condition (added nitrogen source to the media) plus the experiment without nitrogen source added.

PLATFORM
