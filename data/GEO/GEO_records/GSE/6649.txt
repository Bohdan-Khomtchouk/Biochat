TITLE
LongSAGE during the initiation of ligninolytic enzymes production in Phanerochaete chrysosporium

ORGANISM
Phanerochaete chrysosporium

SUMMARY
White rot fungi are able to degrade woody lignin and other persistent organic compounds including artificial chemicals (e.g. chlorinated dioxin) in secondary metabolism. This ability has potential in a wide range of biotechnological applications including remediation of organopollutants and the industrial processing of paper and textiles. Ligninolytic fungi secondarily secrete extracellular oxidative enzymes thought to play an important role in these compounds decay. However, detail of metabolic pathway and initiation signals of the degradation system is unclear. To investigate genes directly and indirectly related to it, we constructed long serial analysis of gene expression (Long SAGE) library from the most studied white rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Keywords: transcriptome profiling

DESIGN
To analyze the transcriptome profile during the initiation of manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) production in Phanerochaete chrysosporium, we constructed the day 3 culture (just started the enzyme production) library and the day 2 culture (the activity of enzymes is not detected) library.
