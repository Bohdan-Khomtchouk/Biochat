TITLE
Transcriptional profiling during rainbow trout ovarian development

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
The study aimed to characterize gene expression in rainbow trout ovary during ovarian development from immature to mature stages. Whole ovary were collected at the following stages: immature pre-vitelogenesis (IMM), mid-vitellogenesis (MV), late vitellogenesis (LV), post-vitellogenesis (PV) and mature while meiotic maturation is in progress (MAT).

DESIGN
Gene expression in rainbow trout ovary was measured at 5 different stages (immature, mid-vitellogenesis, late vitellogenesis, post-vitellogenesis and mature).  Three to four biological replicates were used for each stages.
