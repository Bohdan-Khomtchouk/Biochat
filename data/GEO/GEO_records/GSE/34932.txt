TITLE
miRNA expression profile in PCa And BPH tissue from Chinese patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the miRNA modulating network and different expressed miRNA lists in prostate cancer, we use high-throughout method to genomically detect the expression profile of miRNA, mRNA and protein.

DESIGN
Agilent microarray products for miRNA and mRNA expression profile were chose. With GE Ettan DIGE System, the differentiated expression proteins are detected. As possible as we can to use the same sample for miRNA, mRNA and protein experiment. 4 prostate cancer tissues and 4 normal tissues are applied to mRNA microarray experiment. The mRNA microarray experiment service are supplied by ShanghaiBio Corporation (Shanghai,China).
