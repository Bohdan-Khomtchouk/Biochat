TITLE
In vitro ischemia triggers a transcriptional response to down-regulate synaptic proteins in hippocampal neurons.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The present study has used whole-rat genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes whose expression is significantly altered in hippocampal neuronal cultures submitted to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), an established in vitro model for cerebral global ischemia that is suitable for investigations at the molecular level. To do so, total RNA was extracted from hippocampal neuronal cultures at an early (7h) and delayed (24h) time point after OGD, as well as from control neurons. Analysis of gene ontology showed that OGD followed by 7h or 24h of recovery induces changes in the expression levels of genes related with inflammation, response to oxidative stress, metabolism, apoptosis, synaptic proteins and ion channels and, importantly, genes that show different expression levels are mainly specific to one of the two time points of recovery analyzed. The expression levels of several genes were confirmed by qPCR and were in good agreement with the microarray data, showing that the combined use of the OGD model and the microarray technology can be a useful tool for the study molecular mechanisms contributing to the neuronal demise after transient global ischemia.

DESIGN
Ischemia induced gene expression in primary hippocampal neuronal rat cultures was measured at 7 and 24 hours after exposure to Oxygen and Glucose deprivation (OGD).  Three independent experiments were performed at each time (7 or 24 hours) as independent biological replicates.
