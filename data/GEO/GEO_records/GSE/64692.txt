TITLE
Gene expression profiles of hexadecyl-4-124I-iodobenzoate(124I-HIB)-labeled adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in vitro and in vivo

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
[1] Microarray analysis in the rat myocardial tissue: 124I-HIB transplanted MI model Vs. phosphate buffered saline (PBS) injected myocardial infarction (MI) model Vs. Sham operated model [2] Microarray analysis in the rat adipose derived stem cells: 124I-HIB-labeled ADSCs Vs. Unlabeled ADSCs

DESIGN
[1] We investigated the change of gene expression profile in sham operated-, PBS injected- and 124I-HIB-labeled ADSCs transplanted myocardium in rat myocaridial infarction (MI) model. [2] We compared gene expression profile with 124I-HIB labeled ADSCs and unlabeled ADSCs in vitro.
