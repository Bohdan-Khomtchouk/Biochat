TITLE
KAT6A determines CD8+ T cell diversity via regulation of co-receptors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify genes specifically expressed in WT or Kat6a knockout CD8+ T cells, the gene expression profiles of T cell subsets from na√Øve or LCMV WE infected mice were compared.

DESIGN
Three wildtype and three Kat6a knockout P14 transgenic mice were infected with LCMV WE for 8 days. Two wildtype and two knockout mice were uninfected. CD8+ T cells were harvested from the spleens of all mice. In the infected cohort, the T cells were further subsetted into KLRG1+ and KLRG1-.
