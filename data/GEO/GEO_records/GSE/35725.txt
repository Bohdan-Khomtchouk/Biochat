TITLE
Transcriptional Signatures as a Disease-Specific and Predictive Inflammatory Biomarker for Type 1 Diabetes [T1D_114]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The complex milieu of inflammatory mediators associated with many diseases is often too dilute to directly measure in the periphery, necessitating development of more sensitive measurements suitable for mechanistic studies, earlier diagnosis, guiding selection of therapy, and monitoring interventions.  Previously, we determined that plasma of recent-onset (RO) Type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients induce a proinflammatory transcriptional signature in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) relative to that of unrelated healthy controls (HC). Here, using an optimized cryopreserved PBMC-based protocol, we analyzed larger RO T1D and HC cohorts. In addition, we examined T1D progression by looking at longitudinal, pre-onset and longstanding T1D samples.

DESIGN
UPN727 cells were stimulated with autologous plasma (n=7), unrelated healthy control plasma (n=44), recent onset T1D plasma (n=46), longstanding T1D plasma (n=11), or longitudinal series plasma (n=6 time points) from pre/post onset. Gene expression analysis was performed in order to evaluate the transcriptional signature associated with T1D.
