TITLE
Chromosomal aberration of ESCC and HSCC cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify putative targets in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a survey of parallel chromosomal alterations and gene expression studies in 10 SCC cell lines were performed using array-CGH and microarray techniques. The most frequent changes were gains of 11q13.1-13.3 and losses of 18q12.1-23 in SCC. Furthermore, the expression levels of the sets of genes at both these loci in SCC were measured using microarray analysis. By combining the array-CGH with the microarray data, 10 genes at 11q13.1-13.3 and 6 genes at 18q12.1-23 whose expression correlated with chromosomal alterations were identified. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Genomic DNAs from 10 cell lines and normal diploid cells were subjected to array CGH analysis to identify genomic alterations in the each cell lines. These DNAs were labeled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively.
