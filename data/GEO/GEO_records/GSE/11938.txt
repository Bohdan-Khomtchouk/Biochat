TITLE
Chromosomal aberration of ESCC and HSCC cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify putative targets in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a survey of parallel chromosomal alterations and gene expression studies in 10 SCC cell lines were performed using array-CGH and microarray techniques. The most frequent changes were gains of 11q13.1-13.3 and losses of 18q12.1-23 in SCC. Furthermore, the expression levels of the sets of genes at both these loci in SCC were measured using microarray analysis. By combining the array-CGH with the microarray data, 10 genes at 11q13.1-13.3 and 6 genes at 18q12.1-23 whose expression correlated with chromosomal alterations were identified. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
