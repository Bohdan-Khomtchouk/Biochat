TITLE
Sociogenomics of self vs. non-self cooperation during development of Dictyostelium discoideum [NC105.1_RFP_vs_NC85.2]

ORGANISM
Dictyostelium discoideum

SUMMARY
Dictyostelium discoideum, a microbial model for social evolution, is known to distinguish self from non-self and show genotype-dependent behavior during chimeric development. Aside from a small number of cell-cell recognition genes, however, little is known about the genetic basis of self/non-self recognition in this species. Based on the key hypothesis that there should be differential expression of genes if D. discoideum cells were interacting with non-clone mates, we performed transcriptomic profiling study in this species during clonal vs. chimeric development. Wild strains isolated from North Carolina, which have been shown to form a dominance hierarchy when co-developing in chimeras, were used. The transcriptomic profiles of D. discoideum cells in clones vs. different chimeras were compared at five different developmental stages using a customized microarray. Effects of chimerism on global transcriptional patterns associated with social interactions were observed. The chimera developmental program may also provide insights on behavioral changes associated with social conflicts in this species.

DESIGN
two-condition chimera experiments: two conditions (chimeric: NC105.1-RFP + NC85.2 vs. control: NC105.1-RFP + NC105.1), five time points for each condition (4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 16 h, and 20 h), two biological replicates for each condition at each time point, two technical replicates for each biological replicate (Cy5 vs. Cy3)

PLATFORM
GPL18629 Agilent-032431 DictyEX1
