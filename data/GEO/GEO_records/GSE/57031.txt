TITLE
Transcriptional regulation by Pho23 modulates the frequency of autophagosome formation.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Autophagy as a conserved degradation and recycling machinery is important in normal development and physiology, and defects in this process are linked to many kinds of disease. Because too much or too little autophagy can be detrimental, the process must be tightly regulated both temporally and in magnitude. The transcriptional induction and repression of the autophagy-related (ATG) genes is one crucial aspect of this regulation, but the transcriptional regulators that modulate autophagy are not well characterized. In this study, we identified Pho23 as a master transcriptional repressor for autophagy, with transcriptome profiling revealing that ATG9 is one of the key target genes. Physiological studies with a PHO23 null mutant, or with strains expressing modulated levels of Atg9, demonstrate a critical role of this protein as a regulator of autophagosome formation frequency; Atg9 protein levels correlate with the number of autophagosomes generated upon autophagy induction, and the level of autophagy activity.

DESIGN
WT yeast and pho23 deletion mutants were grown under nutrient rich or nitrogen starvation conditions; gene expression was quantified across these 4 samples.
