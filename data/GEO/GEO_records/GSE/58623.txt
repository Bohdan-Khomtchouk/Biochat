TITLE
BolA is a transcriptional switch that turns off motility and turns on biofilm development (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Bacteria are extremely versatile organisms which rapidly adapt to changing environments. When Escherichia coli cells switch from planktonic growth to biofilm, flagellum formation is turned off, and the production of fimbriae and extracellular polysaccharides is switched on. Here we show that BolA protein is a new bacterial transcription factor which modulates the switch from planktonic to sessile lifestyle. BolA negatively modulates flagella biosynthesis and thus swimming capacity. Furthermore, BolA overexpression favors biofilm formation and involvesinvolving fimbriae-like adhesins and curli production. Our results unraveled for the first time that BolA is a protein with high affinity to DNA, involved in the regulation of several genes of E. coli at a genome-wide scale level. Moreover, this observation further demonstrated that the most significant targets of this protein involved a complex network of genes encoding proteins extremely necessary in biofilm development processes. Herein we propose that BolA is a motile/adhesive transcriptional switch, specifically involved in the transition between the planktonic and the attachment stage of biofilm formation process.

DESIGN
In the study presented here DNA enrichment was analyzed in 2 different strains, a strain containing bolA-3xflag-tag and a deletion mutant for this gene, which was used as the control sample.
