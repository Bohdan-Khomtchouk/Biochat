TITLE
Transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression in dark-grown WT and pif mutant seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from WT and PhytochromeInteractingFactor (pif) mutant seedlings grown for 2d in darkness.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiles of the wild-type (WT), pif1, pif3, pif, pif5 monogenic mutants, pif3pif4pif5 (pif345), pif1pif4pif5(pif145), pif1pif3pif5 (pif135) and pif1pif3pif4 (pif134) triple mutants and pif1pif3pif4pif5 (pifq) quadruple mutant seedlings. Biological triplicate samples were analyzed from libraries constructed using a 3'-capture, 5' to 3' directional method.

PLATFORM
