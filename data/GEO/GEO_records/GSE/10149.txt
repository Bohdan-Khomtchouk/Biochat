TITLE
Identification of RNA molecules associated with the RNA-chaperone Hfq

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
We used high-throughput methods to discover the Salmonella RNAs that are targeted by the bacterial Sm-like protein, Hfq. Our generic approach, using chromosomal epitope tagging and coIP-on-chip will also be useful to identify the post-transcriptional regulons of many other RNA-binding proteins. Keywords: coIP-chip
