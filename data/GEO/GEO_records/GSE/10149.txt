TITLE
Identification of RNA molecules associated with the RNA-chaperone Hfq

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
We used high-throughput methods to discover the Salmonella RNAs that are targeted by the bacterial Sm-like protein, Hfq. Our generic approach, using chromosomal epitope tagging and coIP-on-chip will also be useful to identify the post-transcriptional regulons of many other RNA-binding proteins. Keywords: coIP-chip

DESIGN
To identify the direct Hfq RNA targets, we co-immunoprecipitated RNA from a strain expressing a 3xFLAG-tagged Hfq-protein using an anti-3xFLAG antibody. As a negative control, we used the same antibody (anti-3xFLAG) to co-immunoprecipitate RNA from an isogenic strain expressing the non-tagged Hfq-protein. Two independent biological replicates were generated.
