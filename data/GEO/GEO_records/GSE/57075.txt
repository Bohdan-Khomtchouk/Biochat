TITLE
Transcript Profiling of Maize Embryo Sac and Preliminary Identification of Genes Involved in Embryo Sac-Pollen Tube Interactions

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
In this study, we identified the genes specifically/preferentially expressed in maize embryo sac and genes differentially expressed before and after pollination in maize embryo sac via RNA-seq. In total, more than 30% of them are unknown functions and more than 80% of which are first reported in maize embryo sac.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different tissues of maize to provide  a comprehensive and much more important data for further analysis of embryo sac-pollen tube interactions.
