TITLE
Predominant TRUB1-dependent pseudouridylation of mammalian mRNA via a predictable and conserved code

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this accession we provide pseudouridylation measurements upon knockdown and/or overexpression three pseudouridine synthases, two of which (TRUB1 and PUS7) we find to be with predominant activity on mammalian mRNA.

DESIGN
Examination of pseudouridylation upon genetic perturbation of three pseudouridine synthases

PLATFORM
