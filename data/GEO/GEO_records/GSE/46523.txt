TITLE
Whole transcriptome RNA-seq of undiseased human prefrontal cortex

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of high-throughput RNA sequencing to the human prefrontal cortex. The brain dataset was obtained by sequencing total RNAs extracted from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of five deceased human patients with no apparent pathology, followed by depletion of ribosomal RNA to obtain all non-rRNA coding and non-coding RNAs in the human brain transcriptome.

DESIGN
Five samples were sequenced, four coming from frozen brain tissue (frontal cortex) of deceased female human patients with no remarkable pathology, and one from a male patient with no remarkable pathology.
