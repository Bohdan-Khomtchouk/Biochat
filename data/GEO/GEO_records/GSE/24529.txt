TITLE
Expression analysis of transgenic embryos carrying the mitf-BRAFV600E allele in the presence or absence of p53 function

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Investigation of expression differences between melanomas harvested from MiniCoopR-GFP versus MiniCoopR-SETDB1 transgenic zebrafish The embryos described in this study are further analyzed in a manuscript submitted for publication by White, et al.

DESIGN
A 12 chip study comparing gene expression levels in 80hpf animals either WT (Tu), mitf-BRAFV600E, p53-/-, or mitf-BRAFV600E;p53-/- (double)
