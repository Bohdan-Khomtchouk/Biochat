TITLE
Gene expression profiling associated with knockdown of LKB1 in human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment was designed to display differential gene expression profiling in three human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) cells upon knockdow of LKB1 tumor suppressor, by using RNAseq technology.

DESIGN
LKB1 was first attenuated in three ICC cells: HuH-28, RBE, and SSP-25 by siRNA-mediated knockdown. Total RNA was extracted from duplicated cancers cells transfected with control siRNA and LKB1 specific siRNA at 48h posttransfection for RNAseq analysis. Differentially expressed genes in LKB1-attenuated ICC cells were identified in comparison to that in ICC cells transfected with control siRNA.
