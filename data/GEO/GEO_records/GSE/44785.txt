TITLE
Human dendritic cell microRNA profile after NOD2 and / or TLR2 stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA expression in human monocyte-derived DCs following stimulation with NOD2 ligand MDP, TLR2 ligand Pam3CSK4, or both.

DESIGN
4 condition experiment with two timepoints, and 4 biological replicates. Conditions: unstimulated; MDP stimulated; Pam3CSK4 stimulated; MDP + Pam3CSK4 stimulated. Timepoints: 4 hours and 24 hours.
