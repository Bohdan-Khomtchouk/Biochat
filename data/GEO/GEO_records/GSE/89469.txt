TITLE
Analysis of the role for TgAP2IV-3 in regulating gene expression in Toxoplasma development

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
Analysis of TgAP2IV-3 overexpression (pH7.0, pH7.8) and knockout parasites(ph8.2) in the developmental CTG (Type III) genetic background, in vitro, 32-48hrs The role for TgAP2IV-3 was evaluated  in the overexpression system of ddFKBP(DD) fusion protein with a-tubulin promotor controlled by Shield 1 (100nM)

DESIGN
12 total samples.  Each condition presented as 2 biological replicates
