TITLE
Effect of TIF1γ gene deletion on hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of KLS cells purified from bone marrow of mice conditionally inactivated for TIF1γ gene. TIF1γ deletion results in multiple defects in adult hematopoiesis. Results provide insight into the role of TIF1γ in hematopoietic stem cells functions. We used microarrays to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological properties of KLS cells lacking TIF1γ

DESIGN
KLS (lin-,c-kit+, Sca+) cells were purified by cell sorting
