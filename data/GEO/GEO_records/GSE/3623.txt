SUMMARY
A fuller study of UV-induced biological effects lies beyond the scope of this paper. I will focus on the genetic interaction of cells irradiated by UV. Accordingly, in respect to genomic, the regulation of the gene expressions in cells represents how they response to the stress and repair themselves. In the past, Northern Blot has been used to detect the expression level of a few genes in one experiment. Thus, this assay is always limited to a small scope of a huge unknown network of gene expression. However, to investigate gene expression networks made of thousands of genes, a powerful tool must be implemented. As anticipated, the interactions between regulated genes in UV irradiation time-course experiment can be analyzed by cDNA microarray analysis with experimental loop design. This study provides a platform to investigate the gene networks regulated by UV irradiation. Keywords: UV, cDNA microarray, mitochondria respiratory chain, ROS, carcinogenesis
