TITLE
Transcriptional Activation of Mitochondria Respiratory Chain by UV irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A fuller study of UV-induced biological effects lies beyond the scope of this paper. I will focus on the genetic interaction of cells irradiated by UV. Accordingly, in respect to genomic, the regulation of the gene expressions in cells represents how they response to the stress and repair themselves. In the past, Northern Blot has been used to detect the expression level of a few genes in one experiment. Thus, this assay is always limited to a small scope of a huge unknown network of gene expression. However, to investigate gene expression networks made of thousands of genes, a powerful tool must be implemented. As anticipated, the interactions between regulated genes in UV irradiation time-course experiment can be analyzed by cDNA microarray analysis with experimental loop design. This study provides a platform to investigate the gene networks regulated by UV irradiation. Keywords: UV, cDNA microarray, mitochondria respiratory chain, ROS, carcinogenesis

DESIGN
We used a loop design in this study, cDNA microarray experiment consisted of eight RNA samples, including UV-treated samples and their corresponding controls of 4 time points after UV irradiation. ***WARNING***  All samples have identical data.
