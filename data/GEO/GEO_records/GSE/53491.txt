TITLE
Phenotype specific analyses of p53 reveal distinct regulatory mechanism for chronically activated p53

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
p53 ChIP seq and Histone mark ChIP Seq data in IMR90 (normal human diploid fibroblasts)

DESIGN
Phenotypes were created by overexpression of RasG12V, E1A/RasG12V in IMR90 cells, growing IMR90 and 24 hour Etoposide treated IMR90 cells were subjected to p53 and histone mark ChIP Seq
