TITLE
mRNA tagging (intestine)

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
For each experiment (as described in Pauli et al. 2006): Channel 1: whole worm lysate from strain SD1084 carrying transgene Pges-1::FLAG::PAB-1 Channel 2: mRNA immunoprecipitated from strain SD1084 carrying transgene Pges-1::FLAG::PAB-1  mRNA was amplified and hybridized to C. elegans DNA arrays from the Stuart Kim lab Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments Keywords: Biological Replicate, mRNA tagging
