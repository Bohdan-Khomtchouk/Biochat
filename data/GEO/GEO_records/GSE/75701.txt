TITLE
Human expression data from iPSCs, motor neurons derived from iPSCs and ESCs, and fetal spinal cords

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compare transcriptomic profiles of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), motor neurons (MNs) in vitro differentiated from iPSCs or human ESCs containing a HB9::GFP reporter for MNs, and human fetal spinal cords. The purpose of this comparison is to assess the extent of molecular similarities between in vitro differentiated MNs and in vivo fetal or adult spinal cord MNs. Data for adult spinal cord MNs are published from other studies: GSE3526, GSE19332, GSE20589, and GSE40438.

DESIGN
Human induced pluripotent stem cells, pluripotent stem cell derived motor neurons, and fetal spinal cords for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix arrays.
