TITLE
ALV-J and REV synergistically increase the accumulation of miRNAs

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify the miRNAs in  CEF in response to synergistic infection of ALV-J and REV, as well as attempt to reveal the mechanism underlying pathogenesis and immune suppression symptoms.

DESIGN
CEFs infected with Mock, ALV-J, REV or both viruses were analyzed using miRNA whole-genome sequencing at 72 hpi,

PLATFORM
GPL19005 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Gallus gallus)
