TITLE
Examination of smallRNA in wildtype and transgenic Arabidopsis grown under different temperature

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
A thermosensory system interacts with epigenetic machinery and disarms a RNA-silencing mechanism in Arabidopsis.

DESIGN
Examination of small RNA in five samples of wildtype or transgenic Arabidopsis plants grown under different temperature by high throughput sequencing.
