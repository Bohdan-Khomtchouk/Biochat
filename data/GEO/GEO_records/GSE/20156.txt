TITLE
RNA-Seq of melanoma short-term cultures and cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of RNA-based alterations in melanoma by RNA-Seq, including gene fusions, sequence mutations, and aberrant gene expression levels (to compare to expression level estimates obtained by microarray).

DESIGN
melanoma short-term cultures and cell lines were propagated in vitro, and total RNA was extracted for sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
