A549 lung pneumocytes cell line infected with wildtype and deletion mutation PAK strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
The bacterial type III secretion system (TTSS) is dedicated to directly effect host cell pathways by pathogens. In order to identify the key host responses of the various parts of the TTSS, we utilized expression profiling of a lung pneumocytes cell line, A549, exposed to various isogenic mutant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK. We have devised a novel filtering method to isolate the key responses to the effector proteins as well as the translocation machinery. Individually, the effector proteins elicited host responses that were consistent with the known function of each, many of which either regulated, or are regulated by the cell cycle. However, our analysis has shown that the effector proteins elicit a distinct host expression pattern when present in combination, suggesting that these proteins function in synergy. Furthermore, the host transcriptional response to the translocation complex involved genes that are involved in remodeling of the plasma membrane, suggesting that the host cell is able to sense the protrusion of the TTSS machinery. This study shows that the individual components of the TTSS define an integrated system and that a systems biology approach is required to fully understand the complex interplay between pathogen and host.
