TITLE
MicroRNA Expression Analysis of Advanced Colorectal Cancer Reveals a microRNA Signature with Prognostic and Predictive Value

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a prospective cohort study in patients with advanced CRC to identify a miRNA signature that could predict the benefit of receiving first-line chemotherapy for these patients.

DESIGN
Twenty-one paired tumours and adjacent normal tissues were collected from patients with advanced CRC and analysed by miRNA microarrays.
