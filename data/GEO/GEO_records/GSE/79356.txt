TITLE
Polycomb-mediated deactivation of AR-feedback loop leads to castration-resistant prostate cancer [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a lethal disease, often characterized by aberrant  androgen receptor (AR) activation independently of androgen. We have previously reported that  AR can directly repress the expression of many target genes, one of which is NOV/CCN3. Here  we show that NOV, primarily localized in the cytoplasm, physically interacts with AR at its Nterminus  and sequesters AR and AR variants in the cytoplasm, thereby reducing AR chromatintargeting.  This negative feedback loop, however, is disrupted in CRPC due to epigenetic silencing of NOV by the   Polycomb group protein EZH2, rendering AR transcriptional activities and drug-resistant prostate cancer   progression. Our findings thus suggest a working model wherein AR-repressed genes critically prevent   CRPC through negative feedback loops inhibiting AR signaling.
