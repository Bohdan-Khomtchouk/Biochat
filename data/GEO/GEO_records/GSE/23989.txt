TITLE
Global gene expression in Head and neck squamous carcinoma (KB) cells treated with the combination of 2-DG + 6-AN followed by irradiation (2-Gy)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome expression profiling of head and neck squamous carcinoma (KB) cells comparing control untreated cells as well as irradited (2 Gy) alone cells with carcinoma cells treated with the combination of 2-DG and 6-AN followed by irradiation (2 Gy). Goal of this study was to study the global gene expression involved in radiosensitization of Head and neck squamous carcinoma (KB cells) treated with the combination of two metabolic modifers namely 2-deoxy-D-Glucose (2-DG) and 6-Aminonicotinamide (6-AN) followed by irradiation (2 Gy). This will enable us to understand the role of metabolic oxidative stress (MOS) involved in the radiosensitization of cancer cells and regulation between complex molecular circuits to develop better therapeutic approaches/ protection against oxidative damage.
