TITLE
A novel epigenetic regulated gene and involved in phenotypic switch classifies primary melanomas depending on the aggressiveness grade (Illumina)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Loss of methylation of a GTPase-activating protein in melanoma mediates higher proliferation, lower migration, and aggressiveness of primary melanomas.

DESIGN
Sequencing of bisulfite converted DNA and array based analysis of melanoma, breast, and colon primary and metastatic related tumorigenic cell lines.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
