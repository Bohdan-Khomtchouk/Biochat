TITLE
Transcriptional changes in breast cancer cell lines associated with vascular mimicry

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine the transcriptional changes associated with breast cancer cells undergoing vascular mimicry in a 3D assay.  Two breast cancer cell lines were plated on matrigel in the presence or absence of serum.  MDA-MB-231 cells undergo vascular mimicry on matrigel in the absence of serum, MDA-MB-453 cells do not.

DESIGN
Four samples were analyzed.  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cells were plated for 24 hours on matrigel in the presence or absence of serum.  MDA-MB-231 cells undergo vascular mimicry when plated on matrigel in the absence of serum, while MDA-MB-453 cells do not.
