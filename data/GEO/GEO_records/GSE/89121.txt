TITLE
Exogenous expression of Lox, Loxl1 and Loxl2 regulate gene expression in primary murine lung fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Primary murine lung fibroblasts were transfected with either control (scrambled) or sequence-specific siRNA against Lysyl oxidase (Lox), Lysyl oxidase-like (Loxl1) or Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (Loxl2) genes. Cells were harvested 48 hours after the transfection. Multiple changes in gene expression were found in the corrected p values in this microarray study.

DESIGN
Four control (scrambled), four siLox, four siLoxl1 and four siLoxl2 transfected samples were used for this microarray study.
