TITLE
Subepithelial telocytes are an indispensable source of Wnt ligands supporting intestinal crypts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We successfully sequenced and annotated Foxl1 positive and Foxl1 negative mouse intestine mesenchymal cells ( triplicate for each group). We also report that Foxl1 positive cells express molecules of key signaling pathways such as Wnt, BMP,Shh, Tgfb and NFkB.

DESIGN
Foxl1 positive and Foxl1 negative sorted mouse intestine mesenchymal cells from three Foxl1Cre;Rosa-YFP or Foxl1Cre;Rosa-mTmG  mice were sequenced.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
