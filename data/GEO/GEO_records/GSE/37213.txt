TITLE
MiR-21 function in T-lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T-lymphocyte activation is efficiently mimicked in vitro by treatment with anti CD3 / anti CD28 antibodies. We report miR-21 induction upon CD3/CD28 stimulation of primary T-lymphocytes. In order to assess the function of miR-21 in T-lymphocytes we interfered with miR-21 function by lentiviral transduction of a miR-21 sponge construct. MRNA profile of miR-21 sponge and control transduced T-lymphocytes 48hrs after stimulation.

DESIGN
mRNA microarray profile of T-lymphocytes tranduced with either a miR-21 sponge or control construct. 3 biological replicas have been performed.
