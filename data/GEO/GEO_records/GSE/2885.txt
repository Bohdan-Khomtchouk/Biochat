TITLE
PA2384 and iron starvation in P. aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
The gene PA2384 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, annotated originally as unknown function, has been previously shown to be dramatically responsive to iron limitation. In the present study, PA2384 is shown by bioinformatics analysis to have a weak similarity to the N-termini DNA binding domain of fur, a well-known ferric uptake regulator. To experimentally investigate the function of PA2384 P. aeruginosa PAO1 recombinant (pUCP20::PA2384) overexpressing PA2384 and PA2384 knock-out mutant PAO1-23844 are constructed and studied. Physiological characterization in a carefully controlled cultivation system shows that the knockout strain needed a longer lag phase to grow and exhibited a significantly reduced production speed of siderophore (pyoverdine and pyochelin) in the stationary phase. Genome-scale transcriptional profiles at different growth stages are compared between the wild type and âˆ†PA2384 mutant grown under iron-limiting conditions. The expression of more than 350 genes is affected. Among them, seventy-one genes involved in iron uptake are significantly induced by PA2384. 102 quorum sensing (QS) dependent genes exhibited differential transcription. They include genes related to the biosynthesis of some important virulence factors such as pyocyanin, rhamnolipids and hydrogen cyanide. Transcription of genes responsible for the synthesis of Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (PQS) is greatly advanced by the knockout of PA2384. We postulate that PA2384 affects QS via PQS. Furthermore, the knockout of PA2384 also results in altered expression of genes involved in electron transfer, central metabolism, phosphorus starvation and translation. It implies that PA2384 may affect more basic physiology than only respond to iron uptake and is a versatile global regulator in P. aeruginosa under iron starvation.
