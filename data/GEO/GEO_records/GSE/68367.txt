TITLE
MiRNA expression profile in mouse CD34+/CD105- cells derived from the renal artery subsequent to renal ischemia/reperfusion injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MiRNA regulate the maintenance, differentiation and function of stem cells and progenitor cells. miRNA expression of progenitor cells located in the adventital layer of arterial vessels has not been characterized in either animal or human models.  Further it is unknown if local arterial miRNA expression profiles change after injury of end organs supplied blood by these arterial conduits.  CD34+/CD105- cells were extracted and analyzed for changes in miRNA expression after kidney specific ischemic injury.

DESIGN
CD34+/CD105- cells were isolated from mouse renal artery after microvascular clamping of renal arteries bilaterally
