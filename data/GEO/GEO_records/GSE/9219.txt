TITLE
RNA quality and the influence on gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We created RNA with different degree of degradation and investigated if the RNA quality influenced gene expression We used oligo-cDNA-microarrays to compare gene expressions Keywords: RNA quality, breast cancer, gene expression

DESIGN
Six breast cancer samples were used, each sample were divided in four and the pieces were left in room temperature for four different time periods (50 sec, 2-3 min, 10 min, 30 min) Stratagene Universal Human RNA was used as reference
