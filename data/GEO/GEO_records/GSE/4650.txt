TITLE
Genes responsive to bisphenol A in testicular Sertoli cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed global scale microarray analysis to identify detailed mechanisms by which bisphenol A (BPA) induce cell death by using an Affymetrix GeneChip system. Testicular Sertoli TTE3 cells used in the present study were derived from transgenic mice harboring a temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen. Cell death accompanying endoplasmic reticulum stress was observed in the cells treated with 0.2 mM BPA. Of the 22,690 probe sets analyzed, approximately 1,300 genes were down- and up-regulated by a factor of 2.0 or greater in the cells treated with BPA. Keywords: bisphenol A, gene expression, testicular Sertoli cell

DESIGN
TTE3 cells were treated with BPA for 0, 3, 6, and 12 h. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells. Gene expression was analyzed by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with the Mouse Expression Array 430A which was spotted with 22,690 probe sets. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacture’s instructions.
