TITLE
Genes responsive to bisphenol A in testicular Sertoli cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed global scale microarray analysis to identify detailed mechanisms by which bisphenol A (BPA) induce cell death by using an Affymetrix GeneChip system. Testicular Sertoli TTE3 cells used in the present study were derived from transgenic mice harboring a temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen. Cell death accompanying endoplasmic reticulum stress was observed in the cells treated with 0.2 mM BPA. Of the 22,690 probe sets analyzed, approximately 1,300 genes were down- and up-regulated by a factor of 2.0 or greater in the cells treated with BPA. Keywords: bisphenol A, gene expression, testicular Sertoli cell
