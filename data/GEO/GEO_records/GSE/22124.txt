TITLE
Microarry datasets for RAW cells stimulated with R848 in the absence or presence of apilimod or API09

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Apilimod is a reported TLR pathway antagonist in clinical trial. To understand the mode of action of apilimod, we applied global microarray analysis to explore the effect of apilimod on gene expression of RAW cell in the absence of presence of R848 (TLR7 ligand).

DESIGN
RAW cells were stimulated with R848 in the absence or presence of apilimod (1Î¼M).  mRNAs were extracted at 0h, 1h,3h, 7h, and 22h for affymetrix analysis. The inactive analog of apilimod (API09) was included as a control.
