TITLE
Rat right heart pulmonary embolism microarray

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Time and dose related expression profiles of rat right heart tissue in microsphere bead model for Pulmonary embolism Keywords: Time course and dose response in experimental PE

DESIGN
Rat right tissues of the Vehicle(no beads- control), low dose and high dose from rat bead model for Pulmonary Embolism were collected after 2, 6 and 18 hour time points. The extracted RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Rat 230-2.0 microarrays to look for the dose and/or time related transcriptional changes associated with experimental Pulmonary Embolism.
