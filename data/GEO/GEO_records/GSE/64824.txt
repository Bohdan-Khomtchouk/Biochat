TITLE
Hepatic transcriptome profiling of liver-specific Xbp1 knockout mice fed a high fat diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Xbp1 is an important regulator of unfolded protein response and lipid metabolism. Its dyregulation has been associcated in human NASH. Feeding a high fat diet with fructose/sucrose to mice causes progressive, fibrosing steatohepatitis. This study is to use RNA-Seq to identify differentially expressed genes in hepatic Xbp1 deficient mice livers fed with a high fat diet compared to controls.

DESIGN
Hepatic Xbp1 deficient mice or flox controls were fed either regular chow or a high fat diet (n=4). Samples from each cohort were pooled into two replicates.
