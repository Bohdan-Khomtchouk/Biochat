TITLE
Salivary cytokine alterations in HIV infection part 1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Systemic and local (oral mucosal) immune responses in acutely infected HIV individuals before the initiation of HAART have not been well characterized. Protein microarrays were used to analyze saliva and plasma from HIV infected and HIV uninfected subjects to identify new biomarkers for HIV disease progression and pathogenesis.

DESIGN
A 507 protein microarray was employed to provide a broad view of cytokines and chemokines in saliva and plasma in acutely HIV infected subjects as compared to uninfected subjects. A custom array derived from the initial results was refined to highlight those molecules with significant change relative to control subjects indicating the potential for biological impact.
