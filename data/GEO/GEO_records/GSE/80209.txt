TITLE
CD54–NOTCH1 axis controls tumor initiation and cancer stem cell functions in human prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using high sensitive ArrayStar Human, we detected differentially expressed genes and circRNAs, these part of data is the aberrent expressed genes.

DESIGN
12 Male NOD/SCID mice were obtained from the Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China). For xenograft generation, 1×10^6 LNCaP cells were subcutaneously injected into the backs of NOD/SCID mice (n=24). When tumors reached a diameter of 5 mm after 3 d, mice were randomly divided into two groups without castration (12 per group). Mice in the treatment group were administered with cisplatin at a dose of 5 mg/kg every 3 d for 30 d. Mice in the control group were treated with vehicle PBS. Tumors were taken out for microarray assay after 30 d.
