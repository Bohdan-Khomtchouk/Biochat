TITLE
Affymetrix gene chip analysis for the whole mouse genome transcripts of epithelial and stromal cells from mouse uterine primary co-culture treated with either vehicle or E2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the present study, to identify potential paracrine factor for the stromal regulation of E2-induced epithelial cell proliferation, we treated epithelial and stromal cell populations of mouse uterine primary co-culture with either oil or E2. Three independent RNA pools prepared for each population were then subjected to the Affymetrix gene chip analysis for the whole mouse genome transcripts. Our data revealed up-regulation of 119 genes and down-regulation of 28 genes in epithelial cell populations and up-regulation of 144 genes and down-regulation of 192 genes in stromal cell population.

DESIGN
We analyzed whole gnenome transcription from epithelial and stromal cell populations of mouse uterine primary co-culture using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array (vehicle vs. E2). 3 replicates were performed.
