TITLE
Limited effects of an eIF2αS51A allele on neurological impairments in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of hippocampal RNA samples from wild-type, 5xFAD, 5xFAD;eIF2α+/S51A and eIF2α+/S51A mice Our transcriptome analyses showed clear transcriptional alterations in hippocampi of 5xFAD compared to wild type mice that were not corrected by the eIF2αS51A allele.

DESIGN
Hemizygous 5xFAD mice, which were on a genetic background of B6/SJL, were crossed with eIF2α+/S51A mice (C57BL/6J background), to generate the offspring that was analyzed in the microarray. Hippocampal samples of 12 mice (4 groups: wild-type, 5xFAD, 5xFAD;eIF2α+/S51A and eIF2α+/S51A) were processed using Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool. No technical replicates were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL6193 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
