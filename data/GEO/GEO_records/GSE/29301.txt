TITLE
Exon-Level Expression Data from Primary Human B Cells and Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs) on HuEx and U133 2.0 plus Platforms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Eptstein-Barr Virus, an oncogenic herpesvirus, infects and immortalizes human B cells in culture into indefinitely-prolerifating LCLs.  We examined the gene expression of primary B cells during the process of infection and growth transformation at the exon level to analyze virus-induced changes in expression and exon usage.

DESIGN
4 samples each of total RNA were extracted from purified resting B Cells and monoclonal LCLs, for a total of 8. These samples were subjected to either Human Exon Array 1.0 or Affymetrix U133 2.0 plus. Data was then RMA normalized and analyzed using SplicerEx
