TITLE
Courtship-exposed male flies

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
I hypothesized that social interactions, such as those involved in reproductive behaviors, would lead to immediate and assayable changes in gene expression that may have important effects on individual reproductive success and fitness through alterations in physiology or via short-term or long-term changes in nervous system function. Keywords: exposed compared to unexposed treatment

DESIGN
Four-day males were exposed or mock-exposed to a virgin female fly for 5 min. Exposed males that courted as well as mock-exposed males were collected for RNA extraction. Three samples for each treatment were hybridized to Affymetrix Drosophila Genome arrays for a total of 6 arrays.
