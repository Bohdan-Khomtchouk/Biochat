TITLE
Courtship-exposed male flies

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
I hypothesized that social interactions, such as those involved in reproductive behaviors, would lead to immediate and assayable changes in gene expression that may have important effects on individual reproductive success and fitness through alterations in physiology or via short-term or long-term changes in nervous system function. Keywords: exposed compared to unexposed treatment
