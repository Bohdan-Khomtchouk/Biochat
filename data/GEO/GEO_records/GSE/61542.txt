TITLE
Quantitative trait loci mapping and transcriptome analysis reveal candidate genes regulating the response to ozone in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The formation of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been detected in all cellular departments and even in apoplastic space of plants. As multifaceted molecule, ROS are known to accumulate in response to various stresses, and ROS burst accompanied with transcriptomic reprogramming leading to defense response or programmed cell death. Acute ozone exposure has been used as a noninvasive tool to study ROS burst induced defense response and cell death for a long time. Moreover the variation of ozone sensitivity in different Arabidopsis accessions highlights the flexibility of complex genetic architecture to adapt to specific stresses. In this study, we combine classic Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping and RNA-seq to identify the cause QTLs and potential gene candidates in response to ozone. RNA sequencing was performed on both control and ozone treated 3 weeks old accessions C24 (ozone tolerant), Te (ozone sensitive) and on a RIL line CT101 (a hypersensitive line of RIL population from reciprocal cross between C24 and Te), in triplicate. We identified 69 potential genes candidates inside the QTL regions and about 200 potential genes outside QTL region in response to ozone by comparing control to treatment within same genotype or comparing control between genotypes.

DESIGN
