TITLE
Physiology study of Escherichia coli harboring high intracellular ATP driven by artificial Pck expression

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)

SUMMARY
We have previously reported that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase(Pck) overexpression under glycolytic conditions enables Escherichia coli to harbor a high intracellular ATP pool resulting in enhanced recombinant protein synthesis and biohydrogen production. To understand possible reasons of the high ATP haboring cell, we carried out transcriptome and metabolic flux analysis.

DESIGN
Comparison of main metabolic gene and regulator expression profiling using RNA-seq data of BL21(DE3) vs. BL21(DE3)_Pck_over under glucose LB

PLATFORM
GPL16760 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Escherichia coli BL21(DE3))
