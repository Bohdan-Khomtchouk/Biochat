TITLE
Gene expression profile of Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile of Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) reveals murine targets for preclinical development of human prostate cancer therapy In this study, we have generated an open source TRAMP microarray dataset to identify differentially expressed genes from human prostate cancer that have concordant expression in TRAMP tumors, and thereby represent lead targets for preclinical therapy development. Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 chips were used for microarrays of total RNA from 9 TRAMP tumors and 9 normal prostates (ventral and dorsolateral lobes). Keywords: prostate cancer, TRAMP
