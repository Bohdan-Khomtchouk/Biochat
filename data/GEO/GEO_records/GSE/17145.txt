TITLE
Gene expression profiles of E15.5 developing podocytes in the developing kidney isolated from MafB-GFP transgenic mice using FACS on 1.0 ST Array chip. (GUDMAP Series ID: 33)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing kidney. The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in FACS isolated components of the developing kidney. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone.

DESIGN
MafB-GFP BAC transgenic mice were utilized to isolate the podocyte cells from the developing embryonic kidneys. Podocyte cells were isolated from the kidney using trypsinization and FACS. RNA was isolated and the gene expression profiles were determined by microarrays.
