TITLE
human Ino80 chromatin remodeling complex downstream gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HeLa cells were cultured in 6-well tissue culture plates (~2x105 cells/well) in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Arp8 siRNA (sc-60072) was obtained from Santa Cruz, while all specific siRNAs including non-targeting siRNA (D-001206), Ino80 siRNA (D-004176), Ies6 siRNA (D-019327) and Ies2 siRNA (D-009848) SMART pool were from Dharmacon (U.S.A.). The cells were transiently transfected with 10~20 pmol specific siRNAs using Lipofetamine RNAMAX transfection kit (Invitrogen, Cat.No-864425) following the manufacture’s instruction. 24 hours after transfection, cells were divided into new 6-well plates for western blot, RT-PCR, and DNA microarray analysis. 48 hours after siRNAs transfection, cells were harvested and lysed. Whole-cell extract (WCE) were prepared by adding 4 x SDS sample buffer, and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol® LS Reagent (Invitrogen). In addition, cells from 1 well of a 6-well plate were rinsed twice with warm PBS and harvested. Cells were then stored in an RNA hold solution (ER501-01, Beijing Transgen Biotech Co., Ltd.). After the knockdown efficiency was confirmed, cells in RNA hold solution were sent to EMTD Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) for DNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
RNA obtained from knock down four subunits of human INO80 complex in Hela cells and control sample
