TITLE
Epithelial-Mesenchymal Micro-Niches Govern Stem Cell Lineage Choices (SC RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adult tissue stem cells (SCs) reside in niches, which through intercellular contacts and signaling, influence SC behavior. Once activated, SCs typically give rise to short-lived transit-amplifying cells (TACs), which then progress to differentiate into their lineages. Here, using single cell RNA-sequencing, we unearth unexpected heterogeneity among SCs and TACs of hair follicles. We trace the roots of this heterogeneity to micro-niches along epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces, where progenitors display molecular signatures reflective of spatially distinct local signals and intercellular interactions. Using lineage-tracing, temporal single cell analyses and chromatin landscaping, we show that SC plasticity becomes restricted in a sequentially and spatially choreographed program, culminating in seven spatially arranged uni-lineage progenitors within TACs of mature follicles. By compartmentalizing SCs into micro-niches, tissues gain precise control over morphogenesis and regeneration: Some progenitors specify lineages immediately; others retain potency, preserving self-renewing features established early while progressively restricting lineages as they experience dynamic changes in microenvironment.

DESIGN
Mouse bulge hair follicle stem cell, hair germ, basal transient amplifying cells (TACs) and dermal papilla at the indicated hair cycle were FACS-purified for single cell RNA-seq. The cell type of each sample is available in the file " GSE90848_cell_type_definitions.txt.gz " on the series record.
