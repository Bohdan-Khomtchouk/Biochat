TITLE
Gene expression profile induced by moderate physical exercise in heart left ventricles in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Physical exercise training is a known protective factor against cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, the underlying specific molecular mechanisms still remain uncompletely explored. To identify molecular mechanisms by which exercise training induces this favorable phenotype a genomic approach was used in an animal model of mild exercise previously demonstrated by our group to induce cardioprotection. Our data indicate that mild exercise by inducing no or few permanent changes in gene expression profile is able to determine cardioprotection without induction of cardiac hypertrophy. Keywords: Case-Control: Response to physical exsercise

DESIGN
We investigated the gene expression profile by Affymetrix technology (230 2.0 GeneChip rat genome array) induced by mild exercise training (treadmill running: 25 m/min, 10% incline, 1 h/day, 3 days/week, 10 weeks) on left ventricle (LV) of exercise-trained (n=10) and sedentary control (n=10) rats.
