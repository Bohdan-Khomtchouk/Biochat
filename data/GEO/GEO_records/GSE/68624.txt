TITLE
Genome-wide bisulfite sequencing reveal enhancer as main target of DNA methylation in neural conversion [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide bisulfite sequencing and corresponding transcriptome are analyzed together to seek for methylation target during neural differentiation

DESIGN
H1 human embryonic stem cells are able to differentiated into neural stem cells with induction of compound C in 72h. We extracted RNA from 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72h samples during dinduction and measured their expression level with Illumina microarray, with 4 replicates each time point.
