TITLE
qPCR array study for cell cycle related genes in Caco-2 cells treated with human lectin ZG16p

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ZG16p (zymogen granule protein 16) is a mannose- and heparin/heparan sulfate-binding lectin highly expressed in the human gut. In this study, the cell cycle related genes regulated by ZG16p were identified by qPCR array. Caco-2, a human adenocarcinoma cell line, was cultured in medium containing ZG16p for 72 h. qPCR array profiling revealed that, with an arbitrary fold change cut-off of 2, ZG16p  significantly (p < 0.05) up-regulated the expression of 6 genes, while down-regulated that of 3 genes.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. Caco-2 cells were cultured with or without ZG16p. Total RNA was extracted from individual cell samples.
