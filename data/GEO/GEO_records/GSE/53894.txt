TITLE
G9a-dependent gene expression in mouse AML cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The methyltransferase G9a was found to play a role in the disease progression of a murine model of AML. Mouse HSPCs were transformed with HoxA9/Meis1 and treated with G9a/GLP inhibitor UNC0638.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression that depends on the methyltransferase activity of G9a in murine AML cells.
