TITLE
Expression data from infected with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and uninfected bone marrow derived macrophages from wild type (C67BL/6) and Nod2 knock out mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this dataset we include the data obtained from 3 hour stimulation with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) of bone marrow macrophages(BMDM) from wild type (C57BL/6) and Nod2 knock out mice (in C57BL/6 background).

DESIGN
Murine BMDM from C57BL/6 mice or NOD2 deficient mice on C57BL/6 background, plated in 6 well plates, were infected with GC at MOI 10:1 or left uninfected. At 3 hrs after infection, cells lysates were made and RNA was isolated. All conditions were done in triplicates(3 wells per condition. The experiment was done once). Whole genome microarray analysis was carried out using the Affymetrix GeneChip Gene 1.0 ST Array System. A 2-way ANOVA was applied to analyze the effects of genotype and infection by GC as well as the interaction between genotype and infection by GC.  Raw affinity data was normalized using a Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) method at probe level Microarray Core, Boston University Medical Center
