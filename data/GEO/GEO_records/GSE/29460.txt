TITLE
Extensive characterization of NF-kappaB binding uncovers non-canonical motifs and advances the interpretation of genetic functional traits

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the DNA binding preferences  of 4 NF-kappaB dimers (p52p52, RELARELA, RELAp50, RELAp52)

DESIGN
Proteins of the Nf-kappab family  were bound to DNA oligonucleotides containing a degenerate region. The protein-DNA complexes were selected after one or multiple rounds of SELEX and the DNA molecules were deep sequenced.
