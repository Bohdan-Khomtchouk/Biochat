TITLE
Transcriptional profile of XBP1-deficient ovarian cancer-associated dendritic cells (DCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ID8-based ovarian tumors were developed for 3 weeks in wild type (WT, N=3) or conditional knockout mice selectively deleting XBP1 in CD11c positive cells (KO, N=3). Tumor-associated DCs were independently sorted via FACS and used for transcriptional profiling.

DESIGN
Total RNA from sorted tumor-associated DCs (N=3/genotype) was independently isolated using the miRVANA kit (Life Technologies) and further purified and concentrated using minElute columns (Qiagen). RNA integrity was confirmed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
