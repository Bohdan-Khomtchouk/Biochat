TITLE
Expression data of early skin development mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice with the spontaneous uncv mutation are hairless.  We utilize the uncv null mouse to investigate the underlying mechanisms giving rise to the relevant phenotypes and reveal significant changes in certain signaling pathways by microarray. Keywords: RNA expression study

DESIGN
Dorsal skins were taken from 4-day-old uncv null mice and wild type mice (as control), and they are sisters-german.  The parent is uncv heterozygosis(uncv +/-), and their children has 3 genotype: wild(uncv +/+), heterozygosis(uncv +/-) and null (uncv -/-).  We can easily distinguish them by their beard length and shape or identify their genotype by PCR using specific primers.  HR 02 is a wild mouse sample and uncv null mice expresses as HR 03 and HR 04.  RNA isolation was performed with the QIAGEN RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) following standard instructions.
