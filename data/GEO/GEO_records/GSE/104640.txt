TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of peripheral monocyte gene expression in subjects with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) in peripheral monocytes at the gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that monocyte gene expression would be predictive of HAND. Results provide  information of the associations between monocytes and global neurocognitive function.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from monocytes purified from the blood of HIV+ and HIV- subjects with neurocognitive profiling.
