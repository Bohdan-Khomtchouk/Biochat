TITLE
ischemic tolerance time course

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Comparison of time-series gene expression pattern in hippocampus of hypoxia tolerant or sensitive rats. At 12 time-points ({0h, 1h, 3h, 12h, 24h, 48h} x 2) after ischemia operation, microdissected CA1 regions of the two groups were respectively subjected to oligonucleotide-based microarray analysis. MIAME information can be obtained at the web link. Keywords = Rattus norvegicus Keywords = hippocampus Keywords = ischemic tolerance Keywords: time-course
