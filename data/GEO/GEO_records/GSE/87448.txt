TITLE
Activation of Notch1 synergizes with multiple pathways in promoting castration-resistant prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chronic activation of Notch1 synergizes with multiple oncogenic pathways altered in early prostate cancer to promote the development of prostate adenocarcinoma. Expression profiling revealed that these tumors display features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a cellular state associated with increased tumor aggressiveness.Tumors driven by Notch1 intracellular domain in combination with multiple pathways altered in prostate cancer are metastatic and resistant to androgen deprivation.

DESIGN
Mouse prostate tumors initiated by the combination of NICD1/kRasG12D, NICD1/myrAKT, or NICD/Myc and normal mouse prostates were subjected to high-throughput RNA-sequencing and differential gene-expression analysis

PLATFORM
