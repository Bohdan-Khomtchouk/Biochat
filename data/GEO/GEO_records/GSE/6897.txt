TITLE
Ini1 ChIP-ChIP from K562 Cells using the NimbleGen ENCODE Array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ini1 ChIP DNA was isolated from K562 cells and surveyed for binding in the ENCODE regions on NimbleGen ENCODE arrays. Use of this data requires permission from its producers. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
Ini1-ChIP DNA and reference ChIP DNA (background obtained with normal rabbit IgG) were isolated from untreated K562 cells. Combined Ini1 and reference ChIP DNA samples were hybridized to a NimbleGen ENCODE tiling array that contains overlapping 50nt oligonucleotide probes. The series is comprised of three biological replicates, hybridized separately to three arrays.

PLATFORM
