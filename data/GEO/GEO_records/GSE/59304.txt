TITLE
Global hepatic transcript data from LRH-1 WT and LRH-1 K289R livers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcript data from LRH-1 WT and LRH-1 K289R livers from mice fed ad libitum and sacrificed at 7 am We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying hepatic function in ad libitum fed mice.

DESIGN
17-19-week-old mice were fed ad libitum, sacrificed at 7 am, and livers snap-frozen in liquid nitorgen for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL18741 Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array with ERCC probe sets [transcript (gene) version]
