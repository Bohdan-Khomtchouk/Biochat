TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression under different light conditions

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The size of tomato fruits are largely dependent on growth conditions. To obtain insights on how light intensity contributes to translocation from a leaf and a fruit, we developed a plant irradiation system based on light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to a leaf. By using this system, we investigated the changes of transcript profiles of tomato leaves and fruits grown under different light conditions.

DESIGN
20 samples were analyzed (14 leaf samples and 6 pericarp samples); 2-3 biological replicates were used.
