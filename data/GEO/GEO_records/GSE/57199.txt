TITLE
Confrontation of fibroblasts with cancer cells in vitro: gene network analysis of transcriptome changes and differential capacity to inhibit tumor growth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Different fibroblast cells (eight in total) with different inhibitory capacity were analyzed and compared for their gene expression profile by whole genome microarray.

DESIGN
Different fibroblast cells (eight in total) were analyzed with Affymetrix Whole Target (WT) Assay (GeneTitan plate format Gene ST 1.1) in order to find out gene expression differences.
