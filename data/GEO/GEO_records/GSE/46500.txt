TITLE
Gene expression data for three mouse auditory brainstem nuclei at two times of development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide gene expression was obtained in three auditory brainstem nuclei (defined below), at two different ages in mice, postnatal day (P)3 and P14. The primary aim was to identify genes which are differentially expressed between the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and the superior olive (LSO), at both age groups.

DESIGN
Tissue samples from the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN), the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and the lateral superior olive (LSO) were collected from 200 Î¼m thick fresh transverse mouse brainstem slices prepared with a vibratome tissue slicer. Individual brainstem nuclei were dissected out with fine forceps under optical control with a binocular. For each nucleus (VCN, MNTB, and LSO), the tissue from six male C57Bl6 mice at postnatal day (P) 3, and from three male C57Bl6 mice at P14 was pooled. The RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen); RNA samples were amplified using a WT ovation Pico RNA amplification (Nugen, CA, USA). The cDNA was hybridized onto mouse Affymetrix microarrays 430 2.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA).
