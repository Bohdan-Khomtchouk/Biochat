TITLE
SIRT7 suppresses tumorigenesis by attenuating MYC activity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SIRT7 is a member of the mammalian sirtuin family of NAD+ dependent deacylases, and  interacts with RNA polymerase I and UBF to regulate rDNA transcription. Various  studies in mammalian cells and human clinical data have linked SIRT7 to cancer.  However studies differ as to whether SIRT7 is oncogenic or tumor suppressive. Here we  analyzed SIRT7 knockout mice and found SIRT7 deficiency caused sub-Mendelian birth  numbers and a reduction in body size. Moreover, at 18 month of age, roughly 60 % of  the SIRT7 knockout mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in many cases  leading to suspected metastasis. Several HCC associated genes were up-regulated in  livers of mice as young as 6 months of age, particularly targets of the proto-oncogene, c-  MYC. Indeed SIRT7 interacts with MYC at endogenous protein levels and also represses  MYC activity. Our findings thus show that SIRT7 acts as a tumor suppressor in vivo, and  may suggest novel strategies to treat liver cancer.
