TITLE
Comparison of expression profiles of Ba/F3 cells transduced with human CALR or human CALR + Type 1 mutation (hCALR-del52) by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine Ba/F3 cells were transduced with retroviral vectors (pMSCV-IRES-GFP) expressing hCALR or hCALR-del52 and treated with 1ng/ml interleukin-3 (IL-3). RNA-seq was performed in triplicates, with on average 109 M reads per group (36 M reads per replicate).

DESIGN
Three replicates of Ba/F3 cells constitutively expressing hCALR or hCALR-del52 were treated with IL-3 and subjected to RNA-seq, followed by differential expression analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
