TITLE
RNA sequencing quantitative analysis of RNA editing levels in ADAR1, ADAR2, AIMP2 overexpression and wild type HEK293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We overexpressed ADAR1, ADAR2 and AIMP2 in HEK293 cells and examined editing using RNA-seq.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of wild type (WT) and ADAR1, ADAR2 and AIMP2 overexpression HEK293 cells were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
