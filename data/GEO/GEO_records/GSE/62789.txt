TITLE
Genome-wide modelling of transcription kinetics reveals patterns of RNA processing delays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We descrive a joint model of transcriptional activation and mRNA accumulation, using estrogen receptor ERÎ± activation in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, which can be used for inference of transcription rate, RNA processing delay and degradation rate given data from high-throughput sequencing time course experiments.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were mock treated or with 10nM 17b-E2 to nine time points (5', 10', 20', 40', 80', 160', 320', 640' and 1280'). Genome-wide identification of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy and transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) following E2 induction of MCF-7 cells Please note that the information in the wig.txt files is in gene-specific coordinates, not chromosomic coordinates, as this is the most sensible format for the associated project/paper.
