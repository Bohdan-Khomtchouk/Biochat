TITLE
Transcriptome profiles and comparison of Arabidopsis thaliana woody (soc1-ful) and WT (Col-0) stems.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The douple mutant Arabidopsis thaliana soc1 ful, in contrast with WT, produces an interfascicular cambium and a large wood cylinder is the flowering stem. We present the RNAseq data for polyA mRNA of different developmental stages of cambium and wood formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. We sequenced 7 stages; 4 in the woody mutant soc1-6 ful-7 (herbaceous, cambium initiation, wood initiation and leaf) and 3 stages in the WT Col-0 (herbaceous, cambium and leaf). The corresponding stem anatomy is also presented in the manuscript indicating the stage of cambium development and the production of secondary xylem.

DESIGN
Sequencing of 7 differents stem developmental stage and leaf using 3 biological replicates.
