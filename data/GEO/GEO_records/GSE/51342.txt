TITLE
Comparative gene expression analysis of dental follicle and periodontal ligament in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the gene expression profiles of dental follicle and periodontal ligament in humans, which can possibly explain their functions of dental follicle and PDL such as eruption coordination and stress resorption. That may apply this information to clinical problem like eruption disturbance and to periodontal tissue engineering.

DESIGN
PDL samples were obtained from permanent premolars (n=11) and dental follicle samples were obtained during extraction of supernumerary teeth (n=4). Comparative cDNA microarray analysis revealed several differences in gene expression between permanent PDL and dental follicles.
