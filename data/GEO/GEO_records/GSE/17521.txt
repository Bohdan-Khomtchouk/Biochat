TITLE
Features of cryptic promoters and their varied reliance on bromodomain-containing factors

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The Set2-Rpd3S pathway is important for the control of transcription memory.  Mutation of components of this pathway results in cryptic transcription initiation within the coding region of approximately 30% of yeast genes. Specifically, deletion of the Set2 histone methyltransferase or Rco1, a component of the Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex leads to hyperacetylation of certain open reading frames (ORFs). We used this mutant as a system to study the role of histone modifications and co-activator recruitment in preinitiation complex (PIC) formation. Specifically, we looked at the dependence of promoters on the bromodomain-containing RSC complex and the Bdf1 protein. We found that the dependence of cryptic promoters for these proteins varied. Overall, our data indicates that cryptic promoters are independently regulated, and their activation is dependent on factors that govern gene activation at canonical promoters.

DESIGN
Two-sample experiment: chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sample vs. input. Biological replicates: 3 independent ChIP samples for each yeast strain.
