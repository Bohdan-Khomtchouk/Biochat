TITLE
Discovery of immediate YAP target genes with inducible form of YAP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analyses with cells/tissues overexpressing YAP have revealed many transcription targets of YAP (Dong et al, 2007; Zhao et al, 2008). However, as YAP induces transformation of non-cancerous cells, we thought many of known targets of YAP may be indirect consequence of transforming property of YAP. To identify the immediate transcription targets for YAP, we utilized immortalized mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells expressing a tamoxifen inducible, hyperactive (S127/381A) YAP mutant (MCF-10A ERT2-YAP 2SA).

DESIGN
MCF-10A ERT2 and MCF-10A ERT2-YAP 2SA are generated. Each cell line was treated with 0.1% of ethanol (solvent) or 1uM of 4-hydroxytamoxifen for 2 or 6 hours. This makes 6 samples per set. The experiments were done in duplicate. The expression data from MCF-10A ERT2 and MCF-10A ERT2-YAP 2SA before tamoxifen treatment can serve as control.
