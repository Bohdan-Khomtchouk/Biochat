TITLE
Emodin inhibits macrophage classical activation [Control-LPS-IFNg-Emodin]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to fully characterize emodin's effects on macrophage activation, peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with LPS+IFNg with or without emodin and gene expression was analyzed using a whole genome microarray. Emodin significantly attenuated the IFNg/LPS induced changes in a large percentage of responsive genes (31%) through inhibiting multiple signaling pathways. RT-qPCR was used to confirm the results in several genes associated with M1 macrophage activation including: TNF, IL6, IL1b, iNOS, MMP2, and MMP9.

DESIGN
Three-condition, one-color experiment: Vehicle control, LPS-IFNg or LPS-IFNg-Emodin treated periferal WBC PMN samples: 4 biological replicates each.

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
