SUMMARY
Amartya Sanyal (Wet Lab), Bryan R. Lajoie Gaurav Jain (Dry Lab), Job Dekker (Principal Investigator) This track contains chromatin interaction data generated using the 5C (Chromatin Conformation Capture Carbon Copy) method by the ENCODE group (Dekker Lab) located at the University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA. This track shows the significant looping interactions between transcriptional start sites (TSS) and distal regulatory elements in the context of the 44 ENCODE pilot regions spanning 1% of the human genome. Although the DNA is a linear sequence, the chromatin, which is packed and organized inside the nucleus, does not function linearly. This is most clearly illustrated by the fact that genes are often regulated by elements that are located hundreds of kilobases away in the linear genome. Imaging techniques have shown that regulatory elements can act over large genomic distances by engaging in direct physical interactions with target genes, resulting in the formation of chromatin loops. Based on these observations, we have envisaged that the spatial organization of the genome resembles a three-dimensional network that is driven by physical associations between genes and regulatory elements, both in cis (within the same chromosome) and in trans (between different chromosomes) (Dekker, 2006). Apart from imaging technology which is labor intensive and low-throughput, long-range chromatin looping interactions can be detected using the Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) technology (Dekker et al., 2002). The 3C method employs formaldehyde cross-linking to covalently link interacting chromatin segments in intact cells. Cells are subsequently lysed and chromatin is digested with a restriction enzyme of choice. The digested fragments are then ligated under dilute conditions to facilitate intramolecular ligation. The result is a genome-wide interaction library of ligation products corresponding to all possible chromatin interactions. Specific ligation products can then be detected by PCR using specific primer pairs. The 5C method was developed to dramatically increase 3C throughput (Dostie et al., 2006; Dostie and Dekker, 2007). The 5C method greatly increases the scale of chromatin interaction detection by replacing the PCR detection step of 3C with ligation-mediated amplification (LMA). LMA is advantageous due to a much higher level of multiplexing by using thousands of primers in a single reaction to detect millions of chromatin interactions (ligation junctions) in parallel. The LMA step effectively " copies " 3C ligation products into much smaller 5C ligation products that precisely correspond to ligation junctions formed during the 3C procedure. The products of the multiplexed LMA reaction constitute the 5C library. The composition of the 5C library is determined using high-throughput DNA sequencing.
