TITLE
STAT3 knockdown during transformation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
siSTAT3 knockdown of a tamoxifen initiated, transformation inducible, breast cancer model system (MCF10A-ER-Src), with associated controls of EtOH and siNEG treatments. A description of MCF10A-ER-Src cells can be found here: www.encodeproject.org

DESIGN
In order to determine the contribution of STAT3 to the gene expression profile of cells undergoing transformation, STAT3 was depleted prior to transformation.
