TITLE
Effect of GSH on the gene expression profile of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
GSH, being a versatile molecule, is actively involved in various bilogical processe of plant system. Our previous studies identifies an active role of GSH in plant defense signaling network. Here, we used microarray under GSH treated condition to obtain a global expression profiling under this altered GSH conditions.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. A.thaliana, much accalimed model system of plant biology and being fully sequenced, we used this system to explore the specific relation of GSH with metabolic processes, phisiological conditions, etc.
