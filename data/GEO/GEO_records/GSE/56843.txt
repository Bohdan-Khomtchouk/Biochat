TITLE
Steroid Receptor Coactivator 1 is an Integrator of Glucose and NAD(+)/NADH Homeostasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SRC-1 affects the expression of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, a set of enzymes responsible for the conversion of NADH to NAD(+). NAD(+) and NADH were subsequently identified as metabolites that underlie SRC-1's response to glucose deprivation. Knockdown of SRC-1 in glycolytic cancer cells abrogated their ability to grow in the absence of glucose consistent with SRC-1's role in promoting cellular adaptation to reduced glucose availability

DESIGN
RNA profiling was used to examine the effects of SRC-1 perturbation on gene expression in the absence or presence of glucose.
