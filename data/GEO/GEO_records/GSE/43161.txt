TITLE
An RNA-binding protein Spo5 promotes meiosis II through the regulation of cyclin Cdc13

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
To determine the range of genes whose expression is regulated by Spo5 under nitrogen starbation, comparison of gene expression profiles between a wild-type strain and a deletion mutant of spo5, which encodes the meiosis specific RNA-binding protein Spo5.

DESIGN
Cells of the wild-type (JY882) and spo5∆ (MA482) fission yeast strains were grown to the mid-log phase in liquid MM and shifted to nitrogen-free MM–N at 25ºC. The cells were harvested 6 h after this shift, the tempereture was raised to 34ºC. RNA was prepared from each sample after the temperature shift and analyzed on a DNA microarray covering 5,073 genes.
