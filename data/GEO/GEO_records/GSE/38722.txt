TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of  non-heading Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis)

ORGANISM
Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis

SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing has been applied on seedling of two genotypes of noheading Chinese cabbage, Huaq and Wut. The goals of this study are to compare the different expression of small RNAs which is possible effect the phynotype of close genetic relation cultivars.

DESIGN
Two genotypes small mRNA profiles of 21-day old Huaq and Wut seedling were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina GAIIx.

PLATFORM
GPL13353 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis)
