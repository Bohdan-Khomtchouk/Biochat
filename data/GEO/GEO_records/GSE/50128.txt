TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Runx3 bound regions in splenic IL-2-activated CD8+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq was conducted on isolated splenic WT CD8+ T cells, TCR-activated and cultured with IL-2 using anti-Runx3 antibodies (Ab), anti-H3K4me1 Ab and non-immune serum (NIS) as control.

DESIGN
Two biological Runx3 and two NIS IP repeats from TCR-activated and IL-2 cultured splenic CD8+ T cells isolated by positive selection on anti-CD8 magnetic beads.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
