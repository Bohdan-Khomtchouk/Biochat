TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of  satellite cells isolated from an animal model of skeletal muscle hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle is a post-mitotic tissue with unique plasticity. It has an extraordinary ability to adjust to changes in its physiological environment by altering its metabolic phenotype and its mass. Satellite cells are the most important myogenic progenitor cells involved in muscle regeneration and remodeling. The activation of these cells is governed by genetic programs involving complex transcriptional responses and can be involved in muscle hypertrophy adaptations. We described here gene expression variations evaluated by microarray analysis in satellite cells isolated from wild type and Magic-F1 transgenic mice, a model of skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The transcriptome analysis shows  an altered gene signature in proliferating Magic-F1  satellite cells compared to controls, involving genes associated to muscle growth and vasculogenesis.

DESIGN
Biological triplicates of Magic-F1+/+ and control satellite cells were used for microarray analysis.
