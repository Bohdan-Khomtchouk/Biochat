TITLE
array CGH analysis of the aur2-1 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The gDNA of wild type (WT, Col-0), aur2-1 mutant (AAa), and WT trisomy 2 (AAA) were labeled and hybridized with Affymetrix Arabidopsis Tilling 1.0R arrays. The ratio of signal intensity of chromosomes in trisomy (AAa and AAA) to diploid (Col-0) were analyzed. The results indicated that the aur2-1 mutant was a tertiary trisomy (2n + 2L.3S).

DESIGN
Three samples (Wild type, WT, Col-0; aur2-1, AAa; WT trisomy 2, AAA) were analyzed.
