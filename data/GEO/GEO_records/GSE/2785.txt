TITLE
How different diets alter skeletal muscle in pig

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
we want to test how different diets (high energy diet HED and low energy diet LED) alter muscle methabolism in pigs. we perform different array experiments using an human platform (GPL2011) and RNA extracted from pig skelethal muscle. thank's this we also test cross-species hybridisation. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridisation

DESIGN
extraction of RNA from pig skeletal muscle by a modification of Chomczynski protocol. cDNA was purified and labelled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorochromes using the cDNA labeling purification module kit (Invitrogen). The HED samples were analysed in comparison to LED samples, used as reference. The labelled cDNA were appropriately coupled and used for competitive hybridisation on the same microarray at 42Â°C for 16h. The relative intensity of labelled cDNA in HED and LED was acquired with ScanArray LITE scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc). platform used for our experiments is GPL2011.

PLATFORM
GPL2011 Human Array 2.0
