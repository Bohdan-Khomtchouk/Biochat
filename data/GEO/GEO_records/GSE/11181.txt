TITLE
Non-invasive electric magnetic fields: Effects on keratinocyte migration and proliferation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although evidence has shown that very small electric currents produce a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds, non-invasive EMF therapy has consisted mostly of anecdotal clinical reports with very few well controlled laboratory mechanistic studies. In this study, we evaluated the effects and potential mechanisms of a non-invasive EMF device on skin wound repair. In vitro analyses with human skin keratinocyte cultures demonstrated that the non-invasive EMF has a very strong effect on accelerating keratinocyte migration and a relatively weaker effect on promoting keratinocyte proliferation. The positive effects of the non-invasive EMF on cell migration and proliferation seem keratinocyte specific without such effects seen on dermal fibroblasts. cDNA microarray and RT-PCR performed revealed increased expression of CRK7 and HOXC8 genes in treated keratinocytes. This study suggests that a non-invasive electric magnetic field accelerates wound reepithelialization through a mechanism of promoting keratinocyte migration and proliferation, possibly due to upregulation of CRK7 and HOXC8 genes.
