TITLE
Response of Shewanella oneidensis wild type and arcA mutant strains to H2O2

ORGANISM
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1

SUMMARY
We undertook a transcriptional profiling to identify genes coping with H2O2-induced oxidative stress in S. oneidensis. The data revealed that the well conserved scavenging genes such as as ahpCF, katB, and katG formed the first line of defense while iron-sulfur protecting proteins may not play a significant role.
