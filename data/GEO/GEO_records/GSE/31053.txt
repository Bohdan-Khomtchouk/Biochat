TITLE
Response of Shewanella oneidensis wild type and arcA mutant strains to H2O2

ORGANISM
Shewanella oneidensis

SUMMARY
We undertook a transcriptional profiling to identify genes coping with H2O2-induced oxidative stress in S. oneidensis. The data revealed that the well conserved scavenging genes such as as ahpCF, katB, and katG formed the first line of defense while iron-sulfur protecting proteins may not play a significant role.

DESIGN
Experimental cells collected 5 min after H2O2 treatment; Control cells collected just before H2O2 treatment. In total, 8 samples were studied (4 for wild type and 4 for arcA mutant, 4 replicates).
