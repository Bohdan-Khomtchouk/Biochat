TITLE
Comparison of R1, R2 and R3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
3 samples of R1, R2 and R3 bone marrow monocytes were compared from 3 biological replicates in 3 separate experiments. R1, R2 and R3 were sorted from triplicate experiments from pools of mice

DESIGN
Ly6Chi CD115+ cells from murine bone marrow was sorted into the Flt3-CD11c- (R1), Flt3+CD11c- (R2), Flt3+CD11c+ (R3) cells for analysis of their transcriptional profiles
