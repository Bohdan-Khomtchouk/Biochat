TITLE
Analysis of altered gene expressions in valproate-treated Disc1-L100P mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis revealed that changes in genes expressions are brain region-dependent; expression of several genes are affected by point mutation L100P, which was verified by RT-PCR (Lcn2, Cyr61, Slc6a12, Slc40a1, Egr2), a few genes are affected by genotype and valproate (Dusp1 and Purb), suggesting their role in valproate-induced benificial effect on sensorimotor gaiting in Disc1-L100P mutant mice. The final conclusion will be drawn after series of RT-PCR confirmation. Keywords: drug response and genetic modification

DESIGN
Unequal two-factor, two-level experiment with drug/control and genetic-variation/wild-type as the factors. 4 datasets of 4 different tissues

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
