TITLE
mRNA profiling in HIV-1 latently infected cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in HIV-1 latented infected cells, compared to the replicated cells and control cells.

DESIGN
In this study, the in vitro steady cell culture was used to explore the mRNA transcription signatures in HIV-1 infection. mRNA profiles were performed and compared among normal control,HIV-1 latency and HIV-1 replication .

PLATFORM
GPL13635 Nimblegen Homo sapiens HG18 Expression Array (12x135k)
