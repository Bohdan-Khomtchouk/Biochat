TITLE
Expression Array analysis of MTAP in HT080 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylthioadenosine Phosphorylase (MTAP) is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes an enzyme responsible for the catabolism of the polyamine byproduct 5′deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA).  To elucidate the mechanism by which MTAP inhibits tumor formation, we have created isogenic MTAP+ and MTAP- HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. In this experiment we have performed expression array analysis on MTAP-, MTAP+, and MTAP+ cells treated with the MTAP inhibitor MT-DADMe-ImmA.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of each sample were grown and analyzed.  M- is MTAP-. M+ is MTAP+, and M+I is MTAP treated with inhibitor (48 hours).
