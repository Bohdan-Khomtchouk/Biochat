TITLE
Role for DNA methylation in response to Gata4 activation in embryonic stem cell-derived mesoderm

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During embryogenesis, many key transcription factors are used repeatedly, achieving different outcomes depending on cell type and developmental stage. The epigenetic modification of the genome functions as a memory of a cell’s developmental history, and it has been proposed that such modification shapes the cellular response to transcription factors. To investigate the role of DNA methylation in the response to transcription factor Gata4, we examined expression profiles of Dnmt3a-/-Dnmt3b-/- ES cell-derived mesoderm cells cultured for 4 days with or without Gata4 activation, as well as the wild-type counterparts, using Affymetrix microarrays.

DESIGN
Wild-type and Dnmt3a-/-Dnmt3b-/- (DKO) ES cell clones stably expressing dexamethasone (Dex)-inducible Gata4 were generated by introducing an expression plasmid for Gata4 fused with the ligand-binding domain of the human glucocorticoid receptor (Gata4GR) driven by the CAG promoter, by electroporation. For mesoderm differentiation, 1 x 10^5 ES cells were plated on a type IV collagen-coated 10-cm dish and cultured for 4 days. Cultured cells were harvested and collected as single-cell suspensions using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, followed by incubation in differentiation medium at 37˚C to allow cell-surface markers to recover. Flk1(+)/PDGFRalpha(+) double-positive (DP) cells, which are considered equivalent to the lateral plate mesoderm, were sorted by FACS-Aria (BD Biosciences). Sorted DP cells were further cultured on type IV collagen-coated culture dishes in the absence or presence of 100 nM Dex for 4 days. For reference data, primitive endoderm (PE) cells were directly differentiated from undifferentiated ES cells by addition 100 nM Dex in ES cell-maintenance medium.
