TITLE
Global Nucleosome Positioning in Arabidopsis using whole genome Tiling Microarray

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We identified genome-wide nucleosome occupancy positions in Arabidopsis thaliana by comparing hybridization intensity difference between salicylic acid (induced) and water treated (uninduced) conditions with reference to genomic DNA.

DESIGN
Genome-wide study of nucleosome dynamics in Arabidopsis thaliana in response to Salicylic acid (3 replicates) vs. Control Water (3 replicates) condition with comparison to genomic hybridization (2 replicates) using Tiling  Microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL1980 AtTile1R to Arabidopsis Tiling 1.0R
