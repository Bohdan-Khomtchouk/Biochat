TITLE
Global Nucleosome Positioning in Arabidopsis using whole genome Tiling Microarray

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We identified genome-wide nucleosome occupancy positions in Arabidopsis thaliana by comparing hybridization intensity difference between salicylic acid (induced) and water treated (uninduced) conditions with reference to genomic DNA.
