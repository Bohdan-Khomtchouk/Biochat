TITLE
transcriptome analyses of n8514 and wox14-Floral stem gene expression affected by the AtWOX14 gene mutation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au11-01_wox14bis - transcriptome analyses of n8514 and wox14 - Our scope is to establish a functional link to organ initiation and development in Arabidopsis by identifying genes that are deregulated in the wox14 mutant background. - The WOX13 OG contained the most conserved plant WOX proteins including the only WOX detected in the highly proliferating basal unicellular and photosynthetic organism Ostreococcus tauri. In Arabidopsis thaliana, an intriguing clade, represented by the functional AtWOX14 gene inside the WOX13 OG, was only found in the Brassicaceae. Compared to AtWOX13, the gene expression profile of AtWOX14 was transient during lateral root formation, anthers and stem development . A mutational insertion upstream of the AtWOX14 homeodomain sequence led to abnormal root development, a delay in the floral transition and premature anther differentiation. Transcriptome analyses of the N8514 transposon donor line and the issued wox14 floral stem basis grown on soil for 8 weeks (growth stage 6) in LD condition is done to identify genes that are deregulated in the wox14 mutant background.

DESIGN
2 dye-swap - gene knock out,normal vs transgenic comparaison
