TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of gastric epithelial cells infected with wild type or arginase-deficient Helicobacter pylori

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied the differential gene expression in the gastric cell line AGS infected with wild type (WT) or arginase gene mutant (rocF) Helicobacter pylori (Hp). We found that the presence of the gene regulates the inflammatory responses in terms of IL8 and MIP-1B. We conclude that arginase may be involved in regulating inflammatory responses which improves the chances of survival against the human immune response.

DESIGN
AGS cells were infected for 16 hours with WT, the rocF, or a complemented H. pylori strain (rocF+). The RNA was extracted with TRIzol, treated with DNAse I (both from invitrogen). cRNA was made with the Illumina TotalPrep RNA amplification Kit (ambion AMIL1791).
