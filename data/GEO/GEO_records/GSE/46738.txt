TITLE
The overexpression of microRNA 21 correlates with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to utilize a microarray platform to determine the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile in prostate cancer tissue from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and were followed for an average of 47 months. The GeneChip® miRNA Array (Affymetrix) contains more than 46,000 probes, and more than 1,100 mature human miRNAs and transcripts. An expression level higher or lower than 1.1 with a p < 0.05 were considered to be differentially expressed. When tumors with a GS < 7 were compared with those with a GS≥7, five miRNAs were down-regulated and nine were up-regulated. In comparing tumors from patients with PSA < 10 ng/mL vs. those with PSA ≥10 ng/mL, 21 miRNAs were down-regulated and 29 were overexpressed. There was decreased expression of 21 miRNAs and increased expression of 22 miRNAs when pT2 and pT3 tumors were compared. The comparison of the expression profiles of men with vs. without recurrent disease (PSA > 0.2 ng/mL) revealed that 14 miRNAs were down-regulated and 17 were up-regulated.  Considering the three prognostic factors and biochemical recurrence, miR-335 was overexpressed in pT3 tumors in patients with PSA > 10 ng/mL, miR-1202 was overexpressed in recurrent tumors in which PSA > 10 ng/mL, and miR-885 and miR-1226 were overexpressed in recurrent pT3 tumors. Six miRNAs (miR- 361, 378, 548, 574, 652 and 892) had decreased expression in pT3 tumors in patients with PSA > 10 ng/mL. miR-16 was down-regulated in recurrent pT3 tumors. miR-92 and miR-450 exhibited decreased expression in recurrent tumors in patients with PSA > 10 ng/mL. miR-28 was down-regulated in pT3 adenocarcinomas with a GS ≥ 7. The differentially expressed miRNAs in recurrent tumors were validated using qRT-PCR in 74 additional specimens.  miR-21 was overexpressed in recurrent tumors, and in the Cox model, expression levels higher than 0.64 were indicative of biochemical recurrence with a risk of 2.4. These results, which were based on clinical specimens from patients treated in a standardized way and followed for an average of 47 months, provide an initial understanding of the role of miRNAs in prostatecancer progression; the foremost representative is miR-21, which has been implicated in the progression of various human cancers.

DESIGN
Fifty-three patients underwent a radical prostatectomy performed by the same surgeon (MS) to treat localized PC between August 2000 and June 2002. The mean age was 65 years (SD: 7.5, range: 49 - 77). The mean Gleason score was 7 (SD: 1.1, range: 5 - 10); 15 tumors had a score of 5 or 6, and 38 had a score between 7 and 10. Twenty-four (45.3%) of the patients had pT2 tumors, and 29 (54.7%) had pT3 tumors.  The control group consisted of three patients with lower urinary tract symptoms, a mean age of 55.3 years and a diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who consented to open surgery.
