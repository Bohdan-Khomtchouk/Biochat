TITLE
Gene expression in ischemic, end-stage failing and non-failing human hearts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A goal of this study was to identify and investigate previously unrecognized components of the remodeling process in the progression to heart failure by comparing gene expression in ischemic, failing (F) to non-failing (NF) hearts.  These results also were compared to the changes observed in a proteomic analysis of F and NF hearts.

DESIGN
RNA extracted from the left ventricle was hybridized to Affymetrix arrays to identify gene expression differences in ischemic, end-stage failing versus non-failing hearts. biological replicate:  LV_NF_001, LV_NF002, LV_NF004, LV_NF005 biological replicate:  LV_F_003, LV_F005, LV_F009, LV_F006
