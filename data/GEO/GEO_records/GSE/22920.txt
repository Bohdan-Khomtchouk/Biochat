SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. They play a critical role in developmental and physiological processes and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases including cancer. To identify miRNA signatures associated with different stages of neoplastic development, we examined the expression profile of 776 primate miRNAs in the following cells: primary African green monkey kidney (pAGMK) cells; spontaneously immortalized, non-tumorigenic, low-passage VERO cells (10-87 LP); tumorigenic, high-passage VERO cells (10-87 HP); and a cell line (10-87 T) derived from a 10-87 HP cell tumor xenograft in athymic nude mice.  When compared with pAGMK cells, the majority of miRNAs were expressed at lower levels in 10-87 LP, 10-87 HP, and 10-87 T cells. We identified 10 up-regulated miRNAs whose level of expression correlated with VERO cell evolution from a non-tumorigenic phenotype to a tumorigenic phenotype. Several miRNAs that were components of the tumorigenic phenotype-specific signatures in our AGMK model are also found in a variety of human tumors. This may prove to be of general relevance to the biology of neoplastic development as it occurs both in vivo as well as in vitro. In addition, one or more of these miRNAs could be potential biomarkers for the expression of the tumorigenic phenotype of VERO cells.
