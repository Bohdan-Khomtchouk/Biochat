TITLE
CNVs of chromosome 17p13.1 might be linked to high risk of lung cancer in heavy smokers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There are inherited genetic factors that cause different responses to cigarette smoking exposure among individuals. We tried to identify these differences in heavy smokers by examining copy number variations (CNVs) between lung cancer patients and healthy controls. To rule out the CNVs infulenced by age, smoking history and sex, those were matched in both groups.
