TITLE
Muscle mitochondrial stress-induced metabolic adaptations do not require FGF21 action

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a key metabolic regulator which was recently discovered as stress-induced myokine and common denominator of muscle mitochondrial disease. However, its precise function and pathophysiological relevance remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that white adipose tissue (WAT) is the major target of muscle mitochondrial stress-induced FGF21. Strikingly, substantial browning and metabolic remodeling of subcutaneous WAT, together with the reduction of circulating triglycerides and cholesterol are fully FGF21 dependent. Unexpectedly and in contrast to prior expectations, we found a negligible role of FGF21 in muscle stress-related improved glycemic control, obesity resistance and hepatic lipid homeostasis. Furthermore, we show that the protective muscle mitohormesis and metabolic stress adaptation does not require FGF21 action. Taken together, our data imply that although FGF21 drives WAT remodeling, this effect and FGF21 as stress hormone per se may not be essential for the adaptive response under muscle mitochondrial stress conditions.

DESIGN
Wildtype male mice and FGF21-knockout male mice, together with muscle specific UCP1-transgenic male animals, and double cross of FGF21-KO with UCP1-Tg male mice, were kept on a standardized low fat diet for 40 weeks. After sacrifice, subcutaneous white adipose tisseu (scWAT) was rapidly removed, weighed, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for RNA isolation and whole genome gene expression microarray hybridisation using Agilent arrays.
