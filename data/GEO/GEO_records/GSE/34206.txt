TITLE
Gene regulation in macrophages from irradiated tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumors engender an environment dominated by M2 differentiated tumor macrophages that support tumor invasion, metastases and escape from immune control. In this study, we demonstrate that following radiation therapy of tumors in mice there is an influx of tumor macrophages that polarize towards wound repair and immune suppression. To investigate changes in the phenotype of tumor macrophages following radiation therapy, we FACS sorted tumor macrophages from Panc02 tumors. We have previously shown that we can distinguish mature tumor macrophages from immature myeloid and MDSC populations by expression of Gr1 and IA (MHC class II). To isolate these sub-populations, we first gated CD11b+ cells in the untreated or irradiated tumors, then sorted the CD11b+IA+ macrophage population and the CD11b+Gr1hi MDSC population. Cytospins of the sorted populations demonstrates that the CD11b+Gr1hi MDSC predominantly have a granulocyte morphology and the CD11b+IA+ cells have a macrophage morphology in both the untreated and irradiated tumors. RNA was purified from CD11b+IA+ macrophages from untreated or irradiated tumors 1 day or 7 days following radiation therapy and Gene Expression Microarray analysis was performed.

DESIGN
There are untreated and irradiated samples at time points 1 day and 7 days following radiation therapy. The experiment was repeated in entirety, generating a second gene array sample for each. For analysis, the untreated samples of 1 day and 7 days were grouped together.
