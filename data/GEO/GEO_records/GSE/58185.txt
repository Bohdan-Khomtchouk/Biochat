TITLE
Targeting the epigenetic regulation of Hedgehog transcriptional output through BET bromodomain inhibition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression changes in Ptch-deficient mouse medulloblastoma cell line SmoWT-MB upon treatment with SMOi GDC-0449 or BETi JQ1. The hypothesis is that they can both inhibit the expressions of Hh signaling target genes in this Hh-driven tumor cell line.

DESIGN
Total RNA from JQ1 or GDC-0449 treated SmoWT-MB cells in comparison with DMSO treated cells

PLATFORM
GPL18752 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip [gene symbol version]
