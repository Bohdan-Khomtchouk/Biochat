TITLE
Microarray analysis on livers, spleens and hearts of mice fed an atherogenic diet and supplemented with either oil palm phenolics (OPP) or distilled water

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
OPP (1500 ppm gallic acid equivalent (GAE)) was supplemented to BALB/c mice given an atherogenic diet for six weeks to observe for possible anti-atherogenic effects. The control group received distilled water instead of OPP. Livers, spleens and hearts were harvested six weeks after the feeding regimen for gene expression studies. Results from the separate microarray data analysis carried out on the different organs show that OPP attenuated the effects of the atherogenic diet in the organs.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from livers, spleens and hearts of BALB/c mice given OPP (six weeks after administration of an atherogenic diet) were compared to controls given distilled water (liver: three replicates in the treatment group versus four replicates in the control group; spleen and heart: three replicates in the treatment group versus three replicates in the control group for both organs)
