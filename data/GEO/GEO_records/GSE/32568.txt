TITLE
Gene expression comparison of wild-type and IL15ko thymic NKT cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Semi-invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells are thymus-derived innate lymphocytes that  modulate microbial and tumour immunity as well as autoimmune diseases. These  immunoregulatory properties of NKT cells are acquired during their development.  Much has been learnt regarding the molecular and cellular cues that promote NKT cell  development, yet how these cells are maintained in the thymus and the periphery and  how they acquire functional competence are incompletely understood. We found that  IL-15 induced several Bcl-2 family survival factors in thymic and splenic NKT cells in  vitro. Yet, IL15-mediated thymic and peripheral NKT cell survival critically depended  on Bcl-xL expression. Additionally, IL-15 regulated thymic developmental stage 2 (ST2)  to ST3 lineage progression and terminal NKT cell differentiation. Global gene expression  analyses and validation revealed that IL-15 regulated Tbx21 (T-bet) expression in thymic  ST3 NKT cells. The loss of IL15-dependent T-bet expression resulted in poor expression  of IFN-Î³ and several NK cell receptors in NKT cells. Taken together, our findings reveal  a critical role for IL-15 in NKT cell survival, which is mediated by Bcl-xL, and effector  differentiation, which is regulated by T-bet.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in NKT cells sorted from pooled thymi of wild-type (3 replicates) or IL-15 deficient (2 replicates) mice.
