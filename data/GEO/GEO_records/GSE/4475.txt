TITLE
A Biologic Definition of Burkitt's Lymphoma from Transcriptional and Genomic Profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The distinction between the Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is imprecise using current diagnostic criteria. We applied transcriptional and genomic profiling to molecularly define Burkitt lymphoma. Gene expression profiling employing Affymetrix GeneChips (U133A) was performed in 220 mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas, including a core group of eight Burkitt lymphomas, which fulfilled all diagnostic criteria of the WHO classification. A molecular signature of Burkitt lymphoma was generated. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected by interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization and array comparative genomic hybridization. The molecular Burkitt lymphoma signature identified 44 cases. Fifteen of these cases lacked a morphology typical for Burkitt/Burkitt-like lymphoma. The vast majority (88%) of the 176 lymphomas without the molecular Burkitt lymphoma signature represented diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. In 20% of these cases a MYC break was detectable which was associated with complex chromosomal changes. Our molecular definition of Burkitt lymphoma sharpens and extends the spectrum of Burkitt lymphoma. In mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas without a Burkitt lymphoma signature, a chromosomal break in the MYC locus proved to be associated with adverse clinical outcome. Keywords: Gene expression
