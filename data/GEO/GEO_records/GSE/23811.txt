TITLE
Campylobacter jejuni murine adaptation: unadapted v. adapted during growth in C57 BL/6 IL-10-/- germ-free mice.

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni NCTC 11168 = ATCC 700819

SUMMARY
Expression arrays comparing Campylobacter jejuni 11168 before and after serial passage in C57 BL/6 IL-10 deficient mice.  Transcript abundance was compared between C. jejuni variants during growth in the ceca of C57 BL/6 IL-10 deficient germ-free mice.

DESIGN
Unpassaged (p0) C. jejuni 11168 was compared to the same strain after three passages (p3) through the mice. Biological replicates: 4; 2 biological replicates were dye swaps.
