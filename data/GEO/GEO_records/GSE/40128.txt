TITLE
Deregulation of miRNAs in Infant Outflow Tract Myocardium of Non-syndromic Tetralogy of Fallot

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is one of the most common heart defects in children and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. miRNAs are a recently discovered class of regulators of gene expression and are becoming increasingly recognized as important regulators of heart development and function. The objective of the present study was to identify miRNAs that are abnormally expressed in clinical infant outflow tract myocardium tissues of TOFs.

DESIGN
Microarray was used to analyze miRNA expression profiles in infant outflow tract myocardium tissues of TOFs and paired normal ones.
