TITLE
Deregulation of miRNAs in Infant Outflow Tract Myocardium of Non-syndromic Tetralogy of Fallot

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is one of the most common heart defects in children and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. miRNAs are a recently discovered class of regulators of gene expression and are becoming increasingly recognized as important regulators of heart development and function. The objective of the present study was to identify miRNAs that are abnormally expressed in clinical infant outflow tract myocardium tissues of TOFs.
