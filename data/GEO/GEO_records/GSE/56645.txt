TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of LSD2-depleted HepG2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of LSD2-depleted HepG2 cells revealed that many of the target genes were related to lipid metabolism. We found that LSD2 is an important epigenetic regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism.

DESIGN
We depleted LSD2 in HepG2 human hepatic cells using three different siRNAs, and then carried out an expression microarray experiment.
