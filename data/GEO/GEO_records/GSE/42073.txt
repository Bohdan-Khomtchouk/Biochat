TITLE
Expression data of PTK7+ and PTK7- cells from differentiated pluripotent stem cells (PSC), and expression data from undifferentiated PSC and definitive endoderm

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As PSCs differentiate, they display characteristics of EMT as well as PTK7 expression.  We sought to discover novel markers and regulators of this process by comparing purified PTK7+ and PTK7- populations We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying this EMT process and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
PTK7+ and PTK7- populations were purified by FACS and subjected to lysis and RNA extraction.  Undifferentiated PSCs and definitive endoderm were washed with PBS, then subjected to lysis and RNA extraction
