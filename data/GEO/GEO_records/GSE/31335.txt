TITLE
Characterization  of the small RNAome in acute myeloid leukemia and discovery of novel small RNA species by deep sequencing (Illumina)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used small RNA seq (Illumina) to characterise and quantify the miRNA and small non-coding (snc)RNA transcriptome of 38 libraries of size-fractionated RNA obtained from AML patients and normal bone marrow. We detected the expression of 765 known miRNAs and 2554 uniquely located species of sncRNAs. A total of 575 potential miRNA candidate hairpins were identified. We also identified 37 C/D Box and 51 H/ACA Box, potential novel snoRNAs.

DESIGN
We sequenced 38 libraries obtained from 34 cytogenetically distinct cases of AML and 1 normal bone marrow from healthy donor. Duplicate experiments, which involved 2 independent RNA size fractionation and library preparation, were performed for 2 patient samples and for the normal bone marrow.

PLATFORM
