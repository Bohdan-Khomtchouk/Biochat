TITLE
Smc3 deacetylation by Hos1 facilitates efficient dissolution of sister chromatid cohesion during anaphase

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Sister chromatid cohesion relies on cohesins, a group of proteins that forms a ring-shaped complex embracing sister chromatids. Cohesion is established during S phase and is removed when cohesin Scc1 is cleaved by the protease separase at anaphase onset. During this process, the cohesin subunit Smc3 undergoes a cycle of acetylation: Smc3 acetylation by Eco1 in S phase stabilizes cohesin association with chromosomes, and its deacetylation by Hos1 in anaphase allows re-use of Smc3 in the next cell cycle. Here we find that Smc3 deacetylation by Hos1 has a more immediate effect in early anaphase of budding yeast. Without Hos1, sister chromatid separation and segregation are significantly delayed. Smc3 deacetylation facilitates removal of cohesins from chromosomes, without changing the Scc1 cleavage efficiency, thus promoting dissolution of cohesion. This action is probably due to disengagement of Smc1â€“3 heads, prompted by de-repression of their ATPase activity. We suggest Scc1 cleavage per se is insufficient for efficient dissolution of cohesion in early anaphase, but subsequent Smc3 deacetylation, which is triggered by Scc1 cleavage, is also required.
