TITLE
Gene expression profiling in human glioma stem cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastomas show heterogeneous histological features. These distinct phenotypic states are thought to be associated with the presence of glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are highly tumorigenic and self-renewing sub-population of tumor cells that have different functional characteristics. To investigate gene expression profiling in GSC, we have performed microarray experiment using Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays (G4112F).

DESIGN
Microarray experiment was performed as single-color hybridization on Agilent human whole genome catalog 4x44k array.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
