TITLE
A food deprivation affects the miRNome in the lactating goat mammary gland

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
Nutrition affects milk composition influencing its nutritional properties. Nutrition also modifies the expression of mammary genes, whose regulation is not completely known. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNA that work as important post-transcriptional gene expression regulators by targeting messenger RNAs. Our goal was to characterize miRNA whose expression is regulated by nutrition in the lactating goat mammary gland, and which may give clues to decipher the regulations of milk components biosynthesis and secretion. Using high-throughput sequencing technology, miRNomes of the lactating mammary gland have been established from 4 goats fed ad libitum and 6 goats food deprived during 48h. Food deprivation affected the expression of 30 miRNA (padj < 0.1), 16 were downregulated and 14 were upregulated. Prediction tools Diana-microT suggests a potential role of several nutriregulated miRNA in the lipid metabolism. Among putative targets 19 differently expressed genes (DEG) previously identified in the same sample, were found. Functions of these 19 DEG revealed their involvement in tissue remodeling. This study constitutes the first evidence of nutriregulated miRNA in the ruminant mammary gland. The characterization of these 30 miRNA could contribute to a better understanding of genes regulations in the mammary gland in response to nutrition.

DESIGN
MicroRNA profiles of mammary glands from 10 Alpine goats at the peak of lactation (48 Â± 2 days post-partum) generated by a HiSeq 2500 using Illumina Solexa technic.
