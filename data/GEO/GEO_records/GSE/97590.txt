TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing RNA Seq data from UKE Phase I rVSV ZEBOV vaccine clinical trial, from full blood samples on Days 0,1,3,7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
10 adult participants of dose group 3x10^6 pfu, and 10 participants of dose group 20x10^6 pfu. Reads were aligned to the human reference assembly (GRCh38.p7) using STAR software (v2.4.2a; option '--quantMode GeneCounts'). Gene annotation was obtained from Ensembl (release 79, ensemble.org). VOOM+Limma analysis (R software, version 3.2.2) was used to assess differential gene expression at each post-vaccination day (d1, d3 and d7) against baseline (d0). Next, we intergreted gene expression data and antibody response using an sPLS algorithm, in order to down-select genes correlating with multivariate antibody responses at days 28, 54, 84,180.

DESIGN
56 samples from D0, D1, D3 and D7 were analysed. Data from samples with low RIN (RIN < 8, 17 samples), low RNA or library concentration (2 samples), missing samples (5 samples)  were set to missing.

PLATFORM
