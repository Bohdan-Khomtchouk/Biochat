TITLE
microRNA profile of human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma vs. normal intrahepatic bile duct tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression profiles were sucessfully contructed in 63 patients with ICC and 9 normal intrahepatic bile ducts using a custom microarray containing probes for 1094 miRNAs and an outcome prediction of miRNA signature was successfully identified for predicting prognosis in ICC.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a consecutively operated, well-defined cohort of 63 ICC cases, followed up more than three years, was used to acquire miRNA expression profiles of 1094 miRNAs and identify a miRNA signature, leading to the successfully for predicting prognosis in ICC.
