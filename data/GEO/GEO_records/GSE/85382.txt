TITLE
Comprehensive gene expression analysis identifies a unique molecular profile and macrophage infiltration in undifferentiated uterine sarcomas [aCGH]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sarcomas originating from the endometrial stroma include low- and high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS) that are associated with specific translocations, and highly malignant undifferentiated uterine sarcomas (UUS). UUS is considered a poorly defined group of tumors and is often seen as a “diagnosis of exclusion” after ESS and leiomyosarcoma (LMS) have been ruled out. Using aCGH, we showed that UUS more complex genomic aberrations that low- and high-grade ESS.

DESIGN
aCGH was performed using genomic DNA was extracted from 19 frozen tumor specimens (9 low-, 3 high-grade ESS and 7 UUS).
