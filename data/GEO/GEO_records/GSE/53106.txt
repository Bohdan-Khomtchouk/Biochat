TITLE
Expression data from control (F/F) and Snai1 knockout (KO) embryoid body (EB) and teratoma â„¢

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Snai1 is a master factor of epithelial to mesenchymal transitioin (EMT), however, its role in embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation and lineage commitment remains undefined. We used microarrays to compare the global programme of gene expression between control and Snai1 knockout ESCs-derived EB and teratoma.

DESIGN
For EBs, control and Snai1 knockout ESCs were cultured as embryoid bodies in spotaneous differentiation media, RNA of 5 days EBs were collected for Affymetrix microarrays. For teratomas, control and Snai1 knockout ESCs were injected into nude mice to form teratomas. RNA of 6 weeks were collected for Affymetrix microarrays.
