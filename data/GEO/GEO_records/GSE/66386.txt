TITLE
High-resolution nucleosome positioning from ATAC-seq chromatin accessibility data

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We describe the NucleoATAC algorithm for high-resolution nucleosome positioning and occupancy determination using ATAC-seq.

DESIGN
ATAC-seq was performed on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccaromyces pombe. Nucleosomes were called for both species as well as for the human GM12878 cell line using data from GSE47753.  Additionally, ATAC-seq was performed on S. cerevisiae undergoing an osmotic stress time-course and nucleosomes were called for each time point.
