TITLE
Transcriptional response to histone deacetylase inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Histone deacetylase inhibitors are a class of drug which rapidly induce hyperacetylation of histone proteins. Here, we aimed to study the association between HDACi-induced histone acetylation and changes in gene expression. To study the early responses to HDACi treatment we treated cells with three different concentrations of two HDACi, sodium valproate (VPA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid over a short timecourse.

DESIGN
AH LCL cells were treated with 0.2mM, 1mM or 5mM valproic acid (VPA) or 0.5, 2.5 or 12.5ÂµM suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). GM12878 cells were treated with 1mM VPA. Samples were collected at 0, 30, 60 and 120 minutes. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. One replicate of AH LCL, 0.2mM VPA, 30min and one replicate of AH LCL, 5mM VPA, 30min were eliminated as outliers
