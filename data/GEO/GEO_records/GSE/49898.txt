TITLE
Identification of stage specific genes associated with lupus nephritis and response to remission induction in NZB/W and NZM2410 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The CEL files of this study are additional to the GSE32583 and GSE44691; they are microarrays of lupus nephritis NZBW mouse model at 30 wks old, or treated with CTX+CTLAIg+anti-CD154 (early and late after remission) or Ad-TACI-Ig+CTLA4Ig (late after remission) and NZM2410 treated with Ad-BAFF-R-Ig.

DESIGN
Expression data from lupus NZB/W mouse kidneys at 30 wks old and treated and from NZM2410 mouse kidneys treated. RNA from whole kidneys was extracted and processed for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
