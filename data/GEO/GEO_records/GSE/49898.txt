TITLE
Identification of stage specific genes associated with lupus nephritis and response to remission induction in NZB/W and NZM2410 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The CEL files of this study are additional to the GSE32583 and GSE44691; they are microarrays of lupus nephritis NZBW mouse model at 30 wks old, or treated with CTX+CTLAIg+anti-CD154 (early and late after remission) or Ad-TACI-Ig+CTLA4Ig (late after remission) and NZM2410 treated with Ad-BAFF-R-Ig.

DESIGN
Expression data from lupus NZB/W mouse kidneys at 30 wks old and treated and from NZM2410 mouse kidneys treated. RNA from whole kidneys was extracted and processed for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL7546 Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array [CDF: Mm_ENTREZG_10]
