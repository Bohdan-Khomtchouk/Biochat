TITLE
Long non-coding RNAs expression study of a Rett syndrome mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify some lncRNA potentially involved in Rett syndrome we performed a mouse lncRNA expression microarray on whole brain samples coming from wild-type and MeCP2 Knock-out littermates. We found 2 lncRNAs directly bound by MeCP2 and upregulated in KO samples. We then focused on AK081227 because it overlaps with Gabrr2. The expression of this GABA receptor and the overlapping AK081227 are inversely correlated in thalamus, suggesting the long non-coding is regulating his own host.

DESIGN
Whole brain total RNA was extracted from two Wild type mice (P60) and two MeCP2 KO littermates (P60)
