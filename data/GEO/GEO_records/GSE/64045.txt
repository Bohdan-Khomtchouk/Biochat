TITLE
DosS Is Required for the Complete Virulence of Mycobacterium  tuberculosis in Mice with Classical Granulomatous Lesions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we are including replicate mouse microarray data from Kramnik mice infected over the course of different time points with M. tuberculosis H37Rv and its isogenic mutants in dosR, dosS and dosT genes.

DESIGN
Mice from day 1 infection universally served as controls and RNA derived from these was always labeled with Cy3. RNA derived from mice at 4, 8 and 16 weeks was labeled with Cy5

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
