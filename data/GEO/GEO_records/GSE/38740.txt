TITLE
Global gene expression of Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 during ammonium-limited, ribose phosphate-, methylphosphonate-, or potassium phosphate-excess growth regimes or during potassium phosphate-limited, ammonium-excess regime

ORGANISM
Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3

SUMMARY
We used the previously designed oligonucleotide microarrays (Bürgmann et al., 2007, Environmental Microbiology, 9: 2742-2755) to detect the mRNA transcripts of R. pomeroyi DSS-3 when the cells were cultured under steady-state conditions limited with ammonium (NH4Cl, 0.26 mM) but with an excess of D-ribose-5-phosphate (C5H9Na2O8P*2H2O, 0.5 mM), methylphosphonic acid (CH5PO3, 0.5 mM), or potassium phosphate (KH2PO4, 0.5 mM), or during ammonium excess (NH4Cl, 2.8 mM) but were limited with potassium phosphate (KH2PO4, 9.2 μM).

DESIGN
A total of 13 microarray hybridizations were performed: three biological replicates each from ribose phosphate, methylphosphonate, or potassium phosphate excess growth regimes, three biological replicates from potassium phosphate limited growth regime, and one technical replicate for the potassium phosphate excess growth regime. Data for the technical replicates were averaged and combined, resulted in a total of 12 samples.
