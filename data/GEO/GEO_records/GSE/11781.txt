TITLE
EST mining of yellow potato and gene expression profiling of its infection by P. infestans using SAGE - SOLEXA

ORGANISM
Solanum phureja

SUMMARY
The late blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans has a broad host range within the Solanaceae family, including yellow potato (Solanum phureja). The disease caused by P. infestans in S. phureja is poorly understood and is a major concern in Colombia. Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) libraries obtained from a normalized library constructed from healthy plant tissue revealed high levels of sequence similarity between S. phureja and S. tuberosum. Then, utilizing Serial Analysis of Gene Expression and high-throughput sequencing (SAGE-Solexa), we characterized yellow potato gene expression during infection by P. infestans. Four-week-old yellow potato plants were inoculated with P. infestans and were collected at 12 and 72 hours post inoculation for RNA extraction. We detected differentially expressed genes by comparing inoculated to non-inoculated and resistant to susceptible plants. The discovery and characterization of the proteins mediating this hostâ€“pathogen interaction enable the understanding of the pathosystem and is the key for developing resistant plants.
