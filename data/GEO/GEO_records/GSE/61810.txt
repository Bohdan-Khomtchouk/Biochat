TITLE
The Role of cis Regulatory Evolution in Maize Domestication

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Modification of cis regulatory elements to produce differences in gene expression level, localization, and timing is an important mechanism by which organisms evolve divergent adaptations. To examine gene regulatory change during the domestication of maize from its wild progenitor, teosinte, we assessed allele-specific expression in a collection of maize and teosinte inbreds and their F1 hybrids using three tissues from different developmental stages. Our use of F1 hybrids represents the first study in a domesticated crop and wild progenitor that dissects cis and trans regulatory effects to examine characteristics of genes under various cis and trans regulatory regimes. We find evidence for consistent cis regulatory divergence that differentiates maize from teosinte in approximately 4% of genes. These genes are significantly correlated with genes under selection during domestication and crop improvement, suggesting an important role for cis regulatory elements in maize evolution.

DESIGN
We assayed genome-wide cis and trans regulatory differences between maize and its wild progenitor, teosinte, using deep RNA sequencing in F1 hybrid and parent inbred lines for three tissue types (ear, leaf and stem) followed by assessment of allele-specific gene expression.
