TITLE
Transcriptome comparison of pancreatic islets of Urocortin3 null islets and wild type controls.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The peptide hormone Urocortin3 (Ucn3) is abundantly expressed by mature beta cells, yet its physiological role is unknown. Transcriptome data from Ucn3 null islets compared to wild type controls reveals selective depletion for delta cell markers and supports a role for Ucn3 as a trigger for somatostatin-mediated negative feedback.

DESIGN
Isolated islets from Ucn3 knockout animals compared to wild type littermate controls. Islets from three indivual males were used for each genotype, lysed in Trizol for RNA isolation and library construction.

PLATFORM
