TITLE
Efficient Generation of Integration-free and Engraftable induced Neural Stem Cells (iNSC) from Epithelial-like Cells in Human Urine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human neural stem cells (NSCs) hold great promise in reparative therapy for neural diseases and injuries. However, the isolation of NSCs from either fetal or adult tissue and their application remain difficult due to ethical and immune-rejection concerns.  One promising solution is to generate patient specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and subsequently differentiate them into NSCs. Alternatively, induced neurons (iN) can be generated directly from fibroblasts by retroviral delivery of neural specific transcription factors or miroRNAs.  The later two approaches remain inefficient and with safety concerns.  Here, we describe a process to generate, from epithelial-like cells present in human urine, integration free and engraftable NSCs (UiNSC) efficiently.  Using an episomal system to deliver reprogramming factors and microRNAs into human urine cells and subsequently culture them in a chemically defined medium supplemented with a cocktail of small molecules, we generated UiNSCs capable of proliferation and without the transgenes upon prolonged expansion.   These transgene free UiNSCs express typical neural stem cell markers and are able to differentiate into all neuronal subtypes and glial cells in vitro and more importantly could engraft and differentiate in vivo upon transplantation into the brain of new born rat.  Thus, our work provides an efficient and highly practical platform to generate patient specific NSCs for regenerative medicine.
