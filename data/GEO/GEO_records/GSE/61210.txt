TITLE
Swi/Snf dynamics on stress responsive genes is governed by competitive bromodomain interactions.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Acetylation of Snf2 regulates Swi/Snf recruitment during stress

DESIGN
ChIP was done for Snf2 in unstressed and stressed condition fro WT, Snf2 K1493R K1497R, Wt delta bromodomain, Snf2 K1493R K1497R delta bromodomain using Snf2 antibodies, Mnase-seq was done for Snf2 in unstressed and stressed condition fro WT, Snf2 K1493R K1497R
