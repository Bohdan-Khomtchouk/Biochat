TITLE
Polyglutamine expansion in TBP alters transcription in cellular model of SCA17

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The poorly conserved N-terminal half of TATA binding protein (TBP) harbours a polyglutamine stretch of 29 to 42 in normal individuals.  Expansion of this stretch leading to more than 42 is associated with a neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia 17 (SCA17).  This study compares the espression profile of mouse neuro 2a cells expressing a vector control and TBP varient with 59 polyglutamines known to form intra nuclear aggregates. Keywords: Neuro 2a, SCA17, TBP, polyglutamine
