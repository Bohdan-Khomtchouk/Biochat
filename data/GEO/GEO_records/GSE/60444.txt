TITLE
miRNA expression in healthy carriers of heterozygous BRCA1 mutation and healthy WT controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate whether carriers of BRCA1 heterozygous mutation show altered miRNA expression profiles, we established a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) harboring either mutated or WT BRCA1 (control) and investigated their miRNA expression profiles. We were especially interested whether we find differences in miRNA expression between carriers of missense versus truncating mutation in BRCA1 gene.
