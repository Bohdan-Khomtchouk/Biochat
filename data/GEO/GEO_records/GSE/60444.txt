TITLE
miRNA expression in healthy carriers of heterozygous BRCA1 mutation and healthy WT controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate whether carriers of BRCA1 heterozygous mutation show altered miRNA expression profiles, we established a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) harboring either mutated or WT BRCA1 (control) and investigated their miRNA expression profiles. We were especially interested whether we find differences in miRNA expression between carriers of missense versus truncating mutation in BRCA1 gene.

DESIGN
We evaluated the miRNA expression in a panel of 21 non-treated lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Among them, 6 LCLs with WT BRCA1, 5 LCLs carrying missense mutation in BRCA1, and 10 LCLs harboring truncating mutation in BRCA1 were included in this study.
