TITLE
Expression and regulation of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 2Î² in developing and mature mouse skeletal muscle.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of the study was to further understand the molecular mechanisms mediating the effect of Crhr2 signaling on insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. To that end we compared the gene expression profile of skeletal muscle obtain from both Crhr2 KO and WT littermates using gene expression microarray.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from skeletal muscle of 4 Crhr2 KO and 4 WT littermates. RNA from 2 KO or 2 WT mice was pooled and analyzed using Affymetrix U74Av2 GeneChips.
