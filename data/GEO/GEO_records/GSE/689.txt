SUMMARY
HMF3A cells, created from adult human mammary fibroblasts by immortalisation with a thermolabile SV40 large T antigen and the catalytic sub-unit of human telomerase, undergo co-ordinated induction of cellular senescence upon inactivation of T antigen. Given the importance of p53, we sought to determine what gene changes were affected if its activation was inhibited. To do this we used the Genetic Suppressor Element (GSE)56 which inhibits the transcriptional activity of p53 (Ossovskaya, 1996). The presence of the GSEp53 delayed the arrest of the HMF3A cells when LT was inactivated. However the cells did arrest. We thus examined the array profiles for 3A-GSEp53 cells after 2 and 7 days of LT inactivation (against 3A-GSEp53 cells at 33Â°C) and compared these to the profiles for 3A-puro cells. Keywords = p53 Keywords = LT antigen Keywords = fibroblast Keywords = senescence Keywords = Rb Keywords: other
