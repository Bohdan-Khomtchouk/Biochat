TITLE
Identification of sigB inhibitors in L. monocytogenes

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes 10403S

SUMMARY
The extensively studied intracellular pathogen, L. monocytogenes, is an ideal model for identifying small-molecule agents for treating bacterial infections. By selecting specific biological targets in L. monocytogenes, which are common to Gram-positive pathogens, we could extrapolate drug discovery information derived from this well-studied bacterium. Attenuating the pathogen’s virulence and stress response attributes without killing it, eliminates selective pressure caused by disruption of essential gene functions (as done by current antibiotics) and reduces the likelihood of developing microbes that are impervious to the effects of antibiotics. To this end, we have assessed multiple libraries of small organic compounds to identify inhibitors of L. monocytogenes σB, the alternative sigma factor common to several clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus anthracis. The role of σB as a transcriptional regulator of stress response and virulence makes it an ideal, well conserved target for chemotherapeutic development.

DESIGN
Independent RNA isolations were performed for each growth experiment (log phase cells exposed to BHI+0.3M NaCl and BHI+0.3M NaCl + CMPD). Four biological replicates were used in competitive whole-genome microarray experiments. For the hybridizations, RNA from the wildtype parent strain L. monocytogenes 10403S were hybridized to RNA from the wildtype parent strain 10403S treated with CMPD.
