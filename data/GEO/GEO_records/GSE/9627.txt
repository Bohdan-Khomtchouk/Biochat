TITLE
Comparison between saprotrophic and biotrophic-like mycelia of cacao WBD causal agent Moniliophthora perniciosa II

ORGANISM
Moniliophthora perniciosa

SUMMARY
Moniliophthora perniciosa is the causal agent of cacao WitcheÂ´s broom disease. This disease has been causing extensive damages to Brazilian cacao plantation, especially in Southern Bahia. Using glass slides microarrays, we analyzed the expression profile of 3872 whole genome shotgun reads from M. perniciosa genome, comparing two stages of development (Biotrophic-like mycelia and saprotrophic mycelia). Keywords: Moniliophthora perniciosa, Witches Broom Disease, Pathogenesis, Cacao

DESIGN
Pools from RNA of axenic cultures were amplified by RNA technique and labeled with Cyanine-3 CTP and Cyanine-5 CTP. Comparison was performed between biotrophic and necrotrophic mycelia, both grown in glycerol with cacao meristem extracts, using saprotrophic mycelia grown in glycerol as a control.
