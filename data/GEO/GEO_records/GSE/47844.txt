TITLE
Temporal examination of Clofibrate and WY-14,643 elicited gene expression in C57BL/6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Temporal hepatic gene expression elicited by PPARα agonists Clofibrate and WY-14,643 was examined. These data were used to select PPARα regulated genes that may demonstrate species-specific regulation for assessment by QRT-PCR in a novel human adult stem cell model.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates for each treatment were compared to time-matched vehicle control
