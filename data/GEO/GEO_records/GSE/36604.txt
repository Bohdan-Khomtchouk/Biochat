TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of cumulus cells differentiation throughout oocyte competence acquisition in the murine ovarian follicles.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte were sampled at the following stages: developmentally incompetent or poorly competent prophase I oocytes (NC1 oocytes), developmentally competent prophase I oocytes (C1 oocytes), and developmentally competent metaphase II oocytes (C2 oocytes). NC1 samples were collected from immature, unexpanded cumulus-oocytes complexes (COC)  from prepubertal (3-week-old) mice, C1 samples from immature, unexpanded cumulus-oocytes complexes (COC)  from adult (8-week-old) and C2 samples from mature, expanded COCs obtained from the oviduct  from 8-week-old mice after standard superovulation protocol.

DESIGN
Global transcriptional profiling was performed using cumulus cells collected from murine ovarian follicles during in vivo oocyte developmental competence acquisition. Cumulus cells were collected at 3 stages: early stage follicles (prophase I arrested oocytes, meiotically competent but developmentally incompetent, n=5), late stage follicles (prophase I arrested oocytes, meiotically competent and developmentally competent, n=5) and ovulatory follicles collected in vivo (metaphase II arrested oocytes, developmentally fully competent, n=5).
