TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in mLTC-1 cells following siRNA-mediated Gata4 inhibition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The effects of Gata4 inhibition on global gene expression in mLTC-1 cells was analysed. Using microarray analysis we identified a set of genes that are downregulated or upregulated following siRNA-mediated silencing of Gata4 in the murine Leydig tumor cell line mLTC-1.  Among the downregulated genes were enzymes of the androgen biosynthetic pathway. mLTC-1 cells were transfected with non-targeting (NT) siRNA and Gata4 siRNA respectively. 72h post transfection cells were lysed and RNA was extracted.

DESIGN
n=3 of each sample group; control samples are samples 3-6 (mLTC-1 cells treated with non-targeting siRNA)

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
