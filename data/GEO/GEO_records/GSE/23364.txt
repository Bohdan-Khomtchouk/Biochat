TITLE
Dual-species microarray for assessing gene expression in stromal microenvironment, cancer cells and their interactions (v2 array)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Design a human-mouse dual-species microarray to provide a technology for investigation of cancer-stromal interaction in xenograft model. The 2 reference RNA were used to evaluate and identify probes with potential the cross-species hybridization, so that we can label these probes and exclude them before analysis of biological samples/data.

DESIGN
Reference RNA from human and mouse were labeled using Cy3. Samples were hybridized on customized-commercial array with Agilent probes and user-designed species-specific probes (Human-mouse dual-species array HomoMus_v2). This array is designed and improved from hte first version GPL10714

PLATFORM
GPL10749 Human-mouse dual-species array HomoMus_v2
