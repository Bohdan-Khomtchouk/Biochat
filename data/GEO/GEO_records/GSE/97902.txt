Dynamic modeling of the murine oocyte and somatic cell metabolome during follicle development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Explore in vivo ovarian follicle transcriptomics from primordial follicles to the antral stage. Ovarian follicles were isolated from CD-1 mice. Entire ovaries were collected at post-natal day 3 and day 4 to collect primordial follicles. Primary follicles (70-90 µm in diameter), two-layered secondary follicles (100-130 µm), multi-layer secondary follicles (150‒180 µm), and pre-antral follicles (200‒300 µm) were mechanically isolated from post-natal day 10, 12, 16, and 18 ovaries, respectively. Antral follicles (400‒600 µm) were mechanically isolated from pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG)-treated mice ovaries at post-natal day 20. Follicles were then aspirated and combined per ovarian follicle maturation stage (e.g., primary, two-layered secondary). Three different samples were collected from each pooled follicular stage for transcriptomic analysis. RNA was purified and hybridized in MouseRef-8 v2.0 Expression BeadChip Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), as previously described (Skory, Bernabe et al., 2013).
