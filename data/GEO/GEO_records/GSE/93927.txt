TITLE
Transcriptomics analysis of gene expressions and DNA 5mC enrichment levels in control and dnmt1 morphants zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
RNA and whole-genome DNA were isolated from control and dnmt1 morphants zebrafish cells using the TRIzol (Tiangen) reagent and phenol-chloroform extraction by following the  manual, respectively. The cDNA library for RNA-seq and DNA library for MeDIP-seq were sequenced using HiSeq2000 (Illumina) in single-end read and paired-read mode, reapectively.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expressive levels and 5mC enrichment levels in normal and dnmt1 morphants zebrafish cells

PLATFORM
GPL14875 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Danio rerio)
