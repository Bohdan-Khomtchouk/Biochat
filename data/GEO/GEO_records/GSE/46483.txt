TITLE
High throughput screening for chemical inducers of stumpy formation in Trypanosoma brucei

ORGANISM
Trypanosoma brucei brucei

SUMMARY
During the bloodstream stage of the Trypanosoma brucei lifecycle, the parasite exists as the proliferative slender-form or the non-proliferative, transmissible, stumpy-form. The transition from the slender to stumpy-form is stimulated by a density-dependent mechanism and is important in infection dynamics, ordered antigenic variation and disease transmissibility. Here, we use a monomorphic reporter cell line in a whole-cell fluorescence-based assay to screen over 6000 small molecules from a kinase-focussed compound library for their ability to induce stumpy-like formation in a high-throughput screening programme. This identified one compound able to induce modest, yet specific, changes in gene expression indicative of a partial differentiation to stumpy forms. This not only provides a potential tool for the further understanding of stumpy formation, but also demonstrates the use of high throughput screening in the identification of compounds able to induce specific phenotypes, such as differentiation, in African trypanosomes.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression in response to treatment with DDD00015314.
