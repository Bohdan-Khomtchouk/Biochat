TITLE
Profile of gene expression with HCV infection in Huh7.5 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential expression study of lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) and mRNAs in HCV infection. For this we infected Huh7.5 cells with HCV (JFH-1) virus and control cells were mock infected. 48h post infection we isolated total RNA using qiagen RNeasy kit as per manufacturer's protocol. The total RNA was then subjected to microarray for both lncRNAs and mRNAs. The resultant profile can be used to compare gene expression in HCV infection versus mock infected cells.

DESIGN
Agilent Human Whole Genome Microarray Gene expression 8X60K (AMADID: 039494) , Labeling kit: Agilent Quick-Amp labeling Kit (p/n5190-0442) Huh7.5 cells were infected with HCV (JFH-1) virus and control cells were mock infected.

PLATFORM
GPL21061 Agilent-039494 8x60k Human Whole Genome Microarray Gene expression  (Probe name version)
