TITLE
Avian arcopallium

ORGANISM
Calypte anna ; Melopsittacus undulatus ; Taeniopygia guttata ; Coturnix japonica ; Streptopelia risoria

SUMMARY
To determine what kind of genes are involved in vocal learning ability, we performed microarray experiments using 3 vocal learning species (zebra finch, budgerigar, Anna's hummingbird) and 2 non-vocal learning species(ring dive, and Japanese quail) from bird group. All of the animals are adult males. They were isolated over night and had 1hour light exposure at morning. Birds who did not sing were used in this experiment.

DESIGN
We used 2-3 animals each species. We use arcopallium song nucleus for vocal learners and intermediate arcopallium for non-vocal learners. We used surrounding arcopallium as control area for both groups.
