TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of mutations inducing the loser status in Drosophila wing discs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the mechanisms of cell competition, we analyzed the molecular differences between the prospective winner and loser cells in Drosophila wing discs. For this purpose we analyzed RNA-seq profiles generated for wild-type cells (prospective winners) and cells mutant for RpS3 and mahj, genes seemingly functionally unrelated, yet both causing the loser phenotype. As an interesting reference, we also generated data from cells with mutations in RpS15, which, like RpS3, is a ribosomal gene but itself does not trigger cell competition. Through in depth analysis we homed in on the subset of genes misregulated in both prospective loser cells mutants, which defines " the molecular signature of prospective loser cells " . Additionally, we provide RNA-seq data for RpS3 mutant discs upon inhibition of the JNK signalling pathway (by overexpression of the pathway inhibitor puckered) and compare this to reference RpS3 mutant cells, hence identifying those genes in RpS3 mutants that are differentially expressed in a JNK-dependent manner.

DESIGN
Analysis of RNA-seq profiles from wild type and mutant Drosophila wing discs (RpS3, RpS15, mahj), each condition in at least two repeats. Additionally, provided are samples in triplicate of RpS3 mutant wing discs overepressing the JNK inhibitor puckered.
