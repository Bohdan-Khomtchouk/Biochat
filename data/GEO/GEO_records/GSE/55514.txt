TITLE
MeDIP-chip from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) tissue from wildtype mice, for 5-methyl-cytosine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nerve injury in the peripheral  nervous system allows spontaneous regeneration, in contrast to injury of central nerves, which lead to a differential expression pattern of regeneration-associated genes and others. These genes might be regulated by promoter DNA methylation As regeneration model, DRG tissue was analyzed for methyated gene promoters and CpG islands following both injury types. A differential methylation pattern could be identified, although most genes remained unmethylated.

DESIGN
comparison of DRG following either sciatic nerve axotomy (SNA) or dorsal column axotomy (DCA) - each 'real injury or sham' - at 1, 3 or 7 days post-injury vs. 'naive', Each sample was pooled from two mice, yielding an immunoprecipitated sample ('Test') and an input genomic DNA sample (Ref). altogether 33 microarrays were used for 13 conditions with triplicate arrays for 'real injury' or 'naive' samples, and duplicate arrays for 'sham' samples.
