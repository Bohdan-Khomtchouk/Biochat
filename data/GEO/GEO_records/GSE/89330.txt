TITLE
Identification and characterization of long non-coding RNAs in osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate expression profile and potential role of lncRNAs in osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), whole genome lncRNA microarray was employed to identify lncRNAs that differentially expressed during osteogenesis of ASCs. Four individual human ASCs derived from four different donors were induced to differentiate into osteoblast in vitro. Expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs of undifferentiated and osteogenic differentiated ASCs were obtained by microarray and compared. The genes that meet both fold change â‰¥2.0 and p < 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed genes during osteogenic differentiation of human ASCs. Expression of five upregulated lncRNAs (SAA3P, LOC284080, XLOC_001453, XLOC_011980, HHIP-AS1) and five downregulated lncRNAs (XLOC_007489, CTC-564N23.3, XLOC_010397, XLOC_002619, LINC00638) from the microarray were quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, validating the microarray data.

DESIGN
Human ASCs derived from four different donors were induced to differentiate into osteoblast for 14 days. Expression of lncRNAs and mRNAs of four paired undifferentiated and differentiated human ASCs was measured by microarray.
