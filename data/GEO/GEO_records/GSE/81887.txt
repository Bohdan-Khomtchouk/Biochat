TITLE
Impact of Runx3 deficiency on the epigenome of early effector CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Define how ablating Runx3 affects histone marks and active enhancers in early effector CD8 T cells

DESIGN
Wild-type or Runx3-deficient (RKO) naive P14 CD8 T cells were adoptively tranferred into congenic recipient mice followed by infection with LCMV armstrong. Four days later, the donor-derived CD8 effector T cells were sorted for the KLRG1 high and IL-7Ra low phenotype subset. The sorted cells were used for ChIPseq analysis of various histone marks. The genomic occupancy of the Runx-CBF complex was determined by ChIP-Seq of CBF in naive CD8+ T cells and CD8+ effectors, sorted on day 8 post-infection.
