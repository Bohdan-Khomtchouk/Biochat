TITLE
Three-dimensional disorganisation of the cancer genome occurs coincident with long range genetic and epigenetic alterations [Hi-C]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A three-dimensional chromatin state underpins the structural and functional basis of the genome by bringing regulatory elements and genes into close spatial proximity to ensure proper, cell-type specific gene expression profiles. Here, we perform Hi-C chromosome conformation to investigate how the three-dimensional organization of the cancer genome is disrupted in the context of epigenetic remodelling and atypical gene expression programs.

DESIGN
Hi-C, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq were conducted in three human prostate cell lines: normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and prostate cancer cells (PC3 and LNCaP).
