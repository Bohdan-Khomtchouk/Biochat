TITLE
Expression data of germinating Arabidopsis seeds

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In depth temporal profiling of transcript changes at 10 time points during germination in Arabidopsis seed was carried out. The time course utilised, encompassed seed maturation, stratification, germination and post-germination and provided a global investigation into the tightly regulated, phasic changes that define seed germination. A previously unidentified transient expression pattern was identified for a group of genes, whereby a significant rise in abundance was observed at the end of stratification and significantly lower expression observed up to 6 hours later.

DESIGN
Total RNA extraction was carried out on 80 mg of Arabidopsis seeds at 10 time points during germination in triplicate. The time points selected were: freshly harvested seed (H), seeds following 15 days of ripening (0 h), seeds after; 1 h of stratification (1 h S), 12 h of stratification (12 h S), 48 h of stratification (48 h S), followed by seed collected 1 hour into the light (1 h SL), 6 hours into the light (6 h SL), 12 hours into the light (12 h SL), 24 hours into the light (24 h SL) and 48 hours into the light (48 h SL).
