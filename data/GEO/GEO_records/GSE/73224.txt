TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Cohesin Mutant HSPC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transciptome analysis of CD34+ enriched human HSPC lentivirally transduced with cohesin WT or mutant

DESIGN
CD34+ enriched HSPCs from cord blood were transduced with a constitutive lentiviral vector expressing cohesin WT or mutant tagged to GFP. After 72hrs cells were GFP+ sorted and subjected to downstream microarray protocol.
