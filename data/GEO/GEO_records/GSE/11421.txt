ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of undifferentiated HIEC cells stably infected with a retroviral inducible expression vector (RevTet system) comparing DOX-induced HIEC pTetON with DOX-induced HIEC cells expressing either HNF1 and CDX2 or HNF1, CDX2 plus GATA4. Keywords: Differential gene expression
