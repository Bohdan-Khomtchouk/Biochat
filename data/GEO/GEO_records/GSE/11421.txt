TITLE
HNF-1alpha Triggers Initiation of the Human Intestinal Cell Differentiation Program in Cooperation with Cdx-2 and GATA-4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of undifferentiated HIEC cells stably infected with a retroviral inducible expression vector (RevTet system) comparing DOX-induced HIEC pTetON with DOX-induced HIEC cells expressing either HNF1 and CDX2 or HNF1, CDX2 plus GATA4. Keywords: Differential gene expression

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, DOX-induced HIEC expressing HNF1-CDX2 vs DOX-induced HIEC pTetON, DOX-induced HIEC expressing HNF1-CDX2 plus GATA4 vs DOX-induced HIEC pTetON.
