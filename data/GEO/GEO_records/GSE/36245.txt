SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable brain tumor carrying a dismal prognosis, which displays considerable heterogeneity. We have recently identified recurrent H3F3A mutations affecting two critical positions of histone H3.3 (K27, G34) in one-third of pediatric GBM. Here we show that each of these H3F3A mutations defines an epigenetic subgroup of GBM with a distinct global methylation pattern, and are mutually exclusive with IDH1 mutation (characterizing a CpG-Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) subgroup). Three further epigenetic subgroups were enriched for hallmark genetic events of adult GBM (EGFR amplification, CDKN2A/B deletion) and/or known transcriptomic signatures. We also demonstrate that the two H3F3A mutations give rise to GBMs in separate anatomic compartments, with differential regulation of OLIG1/2 and FOXG1, possibly reflecting different cellular origins. To further dissect the biological differences between epigenetic glioblastoma subgroups, we looked at the transcriptomic profiles of glioblastoma samples.
