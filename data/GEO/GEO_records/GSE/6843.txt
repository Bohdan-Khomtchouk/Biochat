TITLE
Male and female embryonic chicken hearts (arnol-affy-chick-445639)

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The study is relevant to an understanding of the forces that lead to sex differences in the brain and other somatic tissues. Many neural and psychiatric diseases affect men and women differently, so the understanding of sex differences in brain function impacts on our understanding of why the male and female brain differ in their susceptibility to disease. Using Affymetrix chicken arrays, we will measure the gene expression in male and female embryonic chicken heart, and compare to previous studies of brain and liver. Gene expression differs in the male and female embryonic chicken heart, liver, and brain.  Higher expression of Z-chromosome genes in males is found in heart, liver and brain.  Comparison of heart and brain will reveal brain-specific patterns of sex differences, and patterns that apply to multiple tissues. 20 male and 20 female chicken embryos will serve as source of heart tissue. In late stage embryos, we will remove the tissue and extract total RNA. Four birds will comprise each individual sample. Thus, we will have 5 biologically independent male samples, and an equal number of female samples. Keywords: dose response
