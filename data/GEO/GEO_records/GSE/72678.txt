TITLE
Expression data from neuroblastoma of TH-MYCN/KI RetM919T mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The RET gene has been identified previously as a target of activated ALK at the mRNA level in both human neuroblastoma cell lines and primary tumors as well as in murine tumors driven by mutated Alk and MYCN. Moreover, it has been shown that tumor growth of murine TH-MYCN/KI Alkmut tumors was impaired upon Ret inhibition by the vandetanib inhibitor, suggesting RET as a therapeutic target in ALK mutated neuroblastoma. To further demonstrate the crucial role of RET in ALK mutated driven neuroblastoma oncogenesis, transgenic TH-MYCN mice were bred with KI RetM919T tumors. We document an oncogenic cooperation between activated Ret and MYCN overexpression in neuroblastoma formation. We used microarrays to analyze the global programme of gene expression of MYCN/RetM919T tumors and compare these profiles with profiles of MYCN/Alkmut tumors (GSE46583). Altogether, our data show that MYCN/RetM919T tumors present with expression profiles close to MYCN/Alkmut tumors.

DESIGN
We selected 6 murine neuroblastoma tumors from MYCN/RetM919T mice for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
