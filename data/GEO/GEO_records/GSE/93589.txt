TITLE
Identification of endometrial cancer methylation features using combined methylation analysis methods

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed at identifying a methylation signature for a hypermethylation phenotype in endometrial cancer.  Specifically, this data set consisting of 9 primary endometrial cancer tissue samples was investigated with a Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip in order to technically validate the findings from the larger MethylCap-Seq study deposited in BioProject PRJNA360573.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 9 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip GPL13534

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
