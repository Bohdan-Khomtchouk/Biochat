TITLE
Analysis of Curdlan Production in Agrobacterium sp. ATCC 31749

ORGANISM
Agrobacterium sp. 31749

SUMMARY
Gene Expression Analysis of Curdlan Production in Agrobacterium sp. ATCC 31749

DESIGN
Two conditions are compared with four biological replicates of each condition, corresponding to eight total samples. The control condition was sampled at 22 hours during the exponential growth phase when no curdlan is produced. The second condition was sampled at 70 hours after the initiation of curdlan production, corresponding to approximately 100 hours.
