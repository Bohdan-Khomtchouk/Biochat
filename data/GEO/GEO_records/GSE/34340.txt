TITLE
Bisulphite sequencing of native LNCaP and PrEC DNA [methylation array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As a reference dataset to compare BisChIP-seq and other methylated DNA capture experiments against, we have collected Illumina 450k to profile CpG methylation status on native DNA.

DESIGN
Illumina 450k array for LNCaP and PrEC cell lines

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
