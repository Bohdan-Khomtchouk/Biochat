TITLE
Expression data from early diphyodont morphogenesis in minature pig

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The miniature pig is diphyodont, making it a valuable alternative model for understanding human tooth development and replacement.  However, little is known about gene expression and function during swine odontogenesis. The goal of this study is to undertake the survey of differential gene expression profiling with Affymetrix Porcine GeneChip and functional network analysis during morphogenesis of diphyodont dentition in miniature pigs. The identification of genes related to diphyodont development should lead to a better understanding of morphogenetic patterns and the mechanisms of diphyodont replacement in large animal models and humans.

DESIGN
The staged miniature pig embryos and fetuses were obtained by cesarean section at E40, E50, and E60.  The last deciduous molar germs, including the dental lamina in mandibles from the same litter were isolated and pooled. The gestational age of embryos used in our study just cover 3 characteristic stages: Dm3 in cap stage without secondary dental lamina (E40); Dm3 in bell stage with secondary dental lamina initiation (E50); Dm3 in secretory stage without evidence of morphological changes in the secondary dental lamina.
