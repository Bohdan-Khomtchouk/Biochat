TITLE
New schwann cell markers identified by gene profiling analysis after axonal contact

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Elucidating the genes regulated during cell-cell communication remains fascinating considering the importance of cell recognition and downstream signaling through development and in many diseases. In the peripheral nervous system, the interaction between Schwann cells (SCs) and axons is crucial as it allows their survival and induces SCs to differentiate and engage a process of myelination. To get further insight the molecular mechanisms resulting from this cell interaction, comparative gene analysis between SCs and SCs co-cultured with DRG neurons were performed and led us to identify a set of 32 genes regulated in SCs in the early stage of neuron-SC contact. Expression of several candidates were analyzed by QPCR during development and we demonstrate using a blocking antibody approach in an in vitro myelination assay that one candidate was not only upregulated in response to axonal contact but also controls peripheral myelination.
