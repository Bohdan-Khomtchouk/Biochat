TITLE
RNA-seq of Wildtype Staphylococcus aureus USA300 NRS384

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus USA300-0114

SUMMARY
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections result in more than 200,000 hospitalizations and 10,000 deaths in the United States each year and remain an important medical challenge. To better understand the transcriptome of Staphylococcus aureus USA300 NRS384, a community-acquired MRSA strain, we have conducted an RNA-Seq experiment on WT samples.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq analysis was performed on log phase WT Staphylococcus aureus USA300 NRS384 grown at 30 degrees C and grown at 37 degrees C. Each condition was performed in triplicate thereby yielding a total of 6 samples for RNA-Seq analysis.

PLATFORM
