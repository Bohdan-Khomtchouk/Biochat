TITLE
Runx3 function in splenic NK cells (IL-2 or IL-15)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NK cells are innate immune cells that recognize and kill foreign, virally-infected and tumor cells without the need for prior immunization. NK expansion following viral infection is IL-2 or IL-15-dependent.

DESIGN
To identify Runx3 responsive genes, NK cells were isolated from spleen of WT and Runx3-/- mice . Ten samples (5 WT and 5 Runx3-/-)  of freshly isolated NK cells  were separately obtained from individual mice. Cells were cultured for 7 days  with IL-2 or IL-15.
