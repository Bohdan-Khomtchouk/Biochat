TITLE
microRNA profiling in paired human prostate cancer and benign prostate tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the altered microRNA expression signature in human prostate cancer compared to benign prostate tissue. To determine the altered mRNA expression signatures upon overexrpession miR-31 in prostate cancer cells.

DESIGN
Two condition experiments:1) Total RNA from 21 pairs of prostate cancers and matched benign prostate tissues were collected and processed for microRNA detection. 2) In LNCaP prostate cancer cells, miR-31 was overexpressed and compared to control miR-NC.
