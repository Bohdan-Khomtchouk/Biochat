TITLE
Kinetics of glycosyltransferase expression during the T-cell response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This lab investigates how protein-carbohydrate interactions affect cell fate in the immune system. The specific focus is on the mechanism of galectin-1 mediated death of T lymphocytes, and the role of galectin-1 in immune development, lymphocyte homeostasis, response to pathogens, autoimmunity and tumor cell evasion of the immune response.
