TITLE
GeneChip expression profiling of Glud1 (glutamate dehydrogenase 1) transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Glud1 (glutamate dehydrogenase 1) transgenic mice release more excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate to synaptic cleft throughout lifespan and show signs of accelerated aging. Here we compared transcriptomic profiles of these animals to their wild-type counterparts. The hippocampus was used for the analysis. Keywords: transgenic analysis

DESIGN
Three Glud1 transgenic mice vs. three age-matched wide-type mice. Age: 9-month-old. Tissue: hippocampus.
