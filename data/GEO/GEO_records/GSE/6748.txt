TITLE
renal ischemia vs sham - 24h

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to determine alterations in gene expression in rat kidney following ischemia reperfusion injury. Several genes were identified that were significantly up regulated in kidneys at 24 hours following a 45 min ischemic injury.  This group comprises data from 4 different hybridizastion deriving from 4 pairs of animals (1 sham vs 1 ischemic animal) per hybridization Keywords: disease state
