TITLE
renal ischemia vs sham - 24h

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to determine alterations in gene expression in rat kidney following ischemia reperfusion injury. Several genes were identified that were significantly up regulated in kidneys at 24 hours following a 45 min ischemic injury.  This group comprises data from 4 different hybridizastion deriving from 4 pairs of animals (1 sham vs 1 ischemic animal) per hybridization Keywords: disease state

DESIGN
Rat angiogenesis slides were produced with angiogenesis genes printed 6-12 times.  4 pairs of animals were compared with 1 hybridization each to determine ratio of expression in injured vs. sham. Data analysis were used to first combine data from replicate spots per slide and then to combine data for each genetic element across multiple hybridizations
