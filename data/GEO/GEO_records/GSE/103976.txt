TITLE
Detecting Activated Cell Populations Using Single-Cell RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse amygdala using Drop-Seq

DESIGN
Drop-Seq was performed for amygdala cells dissociated from male C57BL/6J mice in different experimental groups using different single-cell dissociation methods. Single-cell suspensions were generated using the Act-Seq protocol or conventional dissociation protocol, and processed through Drop-Seq to produce single-cell cDNA libraries attached to microbeads. cDNAs were amplified by PCR and prepared for sequencing through tagmentation.

PLATFORM
