TITLE
Tissue Transcriptome Driven Identification of Epidermal Growth Factor as a Chronic Kidney Disease Biomarker

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified EGF as the top candidates predicting kidney function through an intrarenal transcriptome-driven approach, and demonstrated it is an independent risk predictor of CKD progression and can significantly improve prediction of renal outcome by established clinical parameters in diverse populations with CKD from a wide spectrum of causes and stages
