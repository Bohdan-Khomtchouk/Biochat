TITLE
Characterization of Stem-cell derived Retinal Pigmented Epithelium (RPE)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess the geome-wide similarities between primary fetal retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and stem-cell derived RPE, we performed whole genome microarray expression on primary RPE and both embryonic stem cell (ESC) derived RPE and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived RPE. We found ES-derived RPE better resembles fetal RPE than iPS-derived RPE.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in primary fetal RPE, ES-derived RPE, iPS-derived RPE. ES cells and BJ fibroblasts were used as controls.
