TITLE
Primary and adjacent non-malignant tissue samples of 100 HCC patients (miRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide miRNA expression profiles of 100 primary and matched non-malignant tissues of HCC patients from a Singapore patient cohort. HCC is a hetergenous disease and it is important to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we studied the role of microRNAs in HCC by integrating microRNA and gene expression profiles of HCC patients.

DESIGN
Profiling of 100 primary and adjacent non-malignant HCC tissue samples on mirXplore two-color miRNA expression microarray. All tissues were collected with approvals from the National Cancer Centre, Singapore; the Research Ethics Review Committee; and signed patient informed consent.
