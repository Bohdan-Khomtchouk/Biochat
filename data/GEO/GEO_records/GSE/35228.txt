TITLE
Cumulus cells genetic profile of patients stimulated with r-hLH or hCG evaluated with MicroArray analysis versus r-hFSH stimulated COCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to evaluate if different ovaric stimulation protocols modify gene expression profiles in COCs of infertile women. mRNA pools in COCs are essential for correct meiosis and activation of oocyte during fecondation and their alterations lead to reduced differentiation and oocyte functionality. In particular we tested the action of 2 different stimulation protocol on COCs transcriptome by MicroArray analysis of COCs after stimulation with r-hLH or h-CG versus COCs stimulated with r-hFSH. We identified genes and networks selectively altered after the different treatment protocols involved in proliferation and activity of COCs.

DESIGN
The study was based on MicroArray analysis of COCs obtained from infertile women after ovaric stimulation. We performed a total of 6 experiments using COCs pools from each woman. 4 experiments were biological replicates and 2 were dye swaps replicates.
