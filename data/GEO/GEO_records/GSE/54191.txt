TITLE
ChIP-Seq analysis of BATF, IRF4, the Jun proteins, and histone modifications in effector CD8+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor BATF is required for Th17 and TFH differentiation. Here, we show that BATF also has a fundamental role in regulating effector CD8+ T cell differentiation.  BATF-deficient CD8+ T cells show profound defects in effector expansion and undergo proliferative and metabolic catastrophe early after antigen encounter.  BATF, together with IRF4 and Jun proteins, binds to and promotes early expression of genes encoding lineage-specific transcription-factors (T-bet and Blimp-1) and cytokine receptors, while paradoxically repressing genes encoding effector molecules (IFNg and granzyme B). Thus, BATF amplifies TCR-dependent transcription factor expression and augments inflammatory signal propagation but restrains effector gene expression.  This checkpoint prevents irreversible commitment to an effector fate until a critical threshold of downstream transcriptional activity has been achieved.

DESIGN
This is an examination of 5 different transcription factors (TFs) with 5 different histone modifications in effector CD8+ T cells.  Two of the TFs (BATF and IRF4) and the histone modifications were replicated.  Appropriate control sequence files for ChIP input, IgG ChIP, and Total H3 are also included.
