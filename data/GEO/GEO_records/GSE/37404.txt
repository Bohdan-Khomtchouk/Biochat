TITLE
Ionizing Radiation-induced expression response in Drosophila Larvae

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression analysis comparison with and without ionizing radiation in p53 mutant and wild type Drosophila larvae

DESIGN
Genome-wide expression analysis comparison with and without ionizing radiation in p53 mutant (p53^5A-1-4) and wild type (y^1 w^1118)  Drosophila third instar larvae. 4000R of X-rays used in IR-treated Drosophila. Analyzed 2hr and 18hr after exposure with age-matched larvae in non-treated controls.
