TITLE
Exogenous slaicylic acid (SA) treatment of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
0.5 mM SA plus 0.02% Silwet or 0.02% Silwet (control) was sprayed on leaves of 3.5 week old Arabidopsis plants.  Samples were harvested at 0 (prior to treatment) , 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours post treatment.  A subset of these samples were processed.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis plants grown in parallel under standardized conditions were treated with SA + Silwet or Silwet alone (control).  Only mature leaves of the same developmental age were harvested using leaves from 2-4 plants, totalling ~0.2 grams per sample.  Plants were not resampled.  In our hands, experimental replicates are highly reproducible.  This was an exploratory experiment to look for candidate genes impacted by exogenous SA treatment.  We were only able to process a subset of samples and chose to process key time points, sacrificing replicates at each time point.
