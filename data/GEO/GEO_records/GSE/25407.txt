TITLE
Expression data from breast tumors and reduction mammoplasty explants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast tumorigenesis involves modulation of gene expression. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying breast tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Three examples of stage I breast tumor and 3 samples of breast reduction mammoplasty tissue were expanded as explant cultures for RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays.
