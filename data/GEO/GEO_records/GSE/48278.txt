TITLE
Skeletal muscle gene expression changes with exercise mode, duration and intensity: STRRIDE study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle adapts to exercise training of various modes, intensities and durations with a programmed gene expression response. This study dissects the independent and combined effects of exercise mode, intensity and duration to identify which exercise has the most positive effects on skeletal muscle health. Full details on exercise groups can be found in: Kraus et al Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2001 Oct;33(10):1774-84 and Bateman et al Am J Cardiol. 2011 Sep 15;108(6):838-44.

DESIGN
This study uses a middle aged group of subjects that have 3+ markers of metabolic syndrome. One group remains an inactive control, while 5 groups undergo 9 mo supervised exercise training. Exercise groups are as follows: Inactive control (group B); Mild aerobic exercise - low amount/mod intensity (group A); Moderate aerobic exercise - low amt/vig intensity (group D); High aerobic exercise - high amt/vig intensity (group C); resistance training only (group F); and mod aerobic + resistance training (group E). Each group has 10 subjects (5 men and 5 women), however 3 subjects failed array QC, leaving 8 subjects in group E and 9 subjects in group F. Data were all analyzed pre to post training in a RM ANCOVA, covaried for age and sex or regression to determine genotype/phenotype interactions.
