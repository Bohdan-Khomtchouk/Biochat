TITLE
Expression data from testes of the mouse X-chromosome substitution strains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the evolutionary divergence of transcriptional regulation between the mouse subspecies, we performed transcriptome analysis by microarray on testes from the X-chromosome substitution strain, which carries different subspecies-derived X chromosome on the host subspecies genome. Transcription profiling showed that large-scale aberrations in gene expression were occurred on the introgressed X chromosome. This improper expression was restored by introducing chromosome 1 from the same donor strain as the X chromosome, suggesting that the genetic incompatibility between trans-acting regulatory gene(s) on chromosome 1 and X-linked downstream genes might be a cause of the misregulation.

DESIGN
Testes were collected from 5- and 7-day-old males for RNA extraction and the microarray experiments were performed by using Affymetrix microarrays. Testes from three different males for each strain were tested independently. Tested males are from control C57BL/6J (B6) strain, MSM strain, X-chromosome substitution strain (B6-ChrXMSM), partial X-chromosome substitution strain 1 (B6-ChrXTMSM), partial X-chromosome substitution strain 2 (XS39-tel), and restored (B6-ChrXTMSM X B6-Chr1MSM) F1.
