TITLE
Identification of genes responsive to mild hyperthermia in human cervical squamous cell carcinoma HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hyperthermia (HT) is widely used to treat patients with various cancers. In general, HT elicits a wide spectrum of stress responses such as induction of heat shock proteins, protein aggregation and cell death in mammalian cells. Although many biological processes are affected by HT, the overall responses to HT in mammalian cells remain unknown. The effects of heat stress at 41°C for 30 min (mild hyperthermia) on the gene expression in human cervical squamous cell carcinoma HeLa cells were investigated using an Affymetrix GeneChip system.

DESIGN
Human cervical squamous cell carcinoma HeLa cells were treated with heat stress (41°C for 30 min) and followed by incubation for 0, 1, or 3 h at 37°C. Non-treated cells were served as control. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells, and quality of the RNA was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100. Gene expression was monitored by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with a Human Genome U133-plus 2.0 array. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacturer’s instructions.
