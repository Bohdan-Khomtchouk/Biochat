TITLE
Gene expression Tet-mev-1 mouse fed either normal diet or high fat high sucrose diet compared with wild type mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To assess the effect of steatosis and oxidative stress on progression of liver fibrosis, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes that are related with oxidative stress- and steatosis-induced hepatic fibrogenesis. When wild type mice were fed high-fat/high-sucrose diet for 24 weeks, expression of 69 genes was changed more than 10-fold compared with wild type animals fed normal diet, 11 of which were categorized to lipid metabolic process. Moreover, expression of 208 genes showed more than 5-fold changes in Tet-mev-1 mice fed high-fat/high-sucrose diet compared with the same transgenic animals fed normal diet, and gene ontology analyses indicated significant changes in chemokine activity and chemokine receptor binding as well as defense and immune responses.

DESIGN
oxidative stress and high fat high calorie induced gene expression in wild type or Tet-mev-1 mouse liver tissue. wild type and Tet-mev-1 mice were fed either normal diet or high fat high sucrose diet for 4 months, and have been given doxycycline-containing water from embryo. Each group were perfomed by duplicate.
