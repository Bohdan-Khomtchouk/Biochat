TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis seed compartments at the pre-globular stage

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We collected pre-globular stage seed compartments from 7-micron paraffin sections using the Leica LMD6000 system in order to identify the mRNAs present in different compartments of seeds containing pre-globular-stage embryos was identified as those seeds containing embryo propers made up of  between 2 and 8 cells. For the purposes of this study we captured 6 compartments: embyro proper, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat and general seed coat. Serial sections of entire seeds were also captured for comparison. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Pre-globular stage seed compartments or whole seeds were isolated using the LMD6000 system. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized with Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis array for 14 samples (embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, chalazal endosperm, general seed coat, chalazal seed coat, whole seeds, 2 biological replicates each).
