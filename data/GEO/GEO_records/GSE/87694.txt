TITLE
Olfactory receptor accessory proteins play crucial roles in receptor gene choice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice with olfactry accessory protein RTP1 and RTP2 knocked out show severe bias in their olfactory receptor repertoire. Surprisingly, even though RTP1,2(-/-) animals have fewer OSNs, we discovered ~8% of the ORs are expressed in larger numbers than the wild type.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq in RTP1/2 dKO vs wild type mice olfactory epithelium

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
