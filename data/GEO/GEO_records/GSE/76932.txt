TITLE
Next generation sequencing comparing effects of vehicle, PTH, and YKL-05-093 in Ocy454 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study are to compare the effects of vehicle, PTH, and YKL-05-093 on gene expression by NGS-derived RNA-sequencing

DESIGN
Methods: Ocy454 cells were grown at 37C for 14 days . Cells were then treated with vehicle, PTH (1 nM), or YKL-05-093 (0.5 uM) for 4 hours. Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen Rneasy columns, and submitted for NGS library generation and sequencing. All experiments performed in duplicate.

PLATFORM
