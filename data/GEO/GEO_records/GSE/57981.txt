TITLE
Refined Candidate Region for F4ab/ac Susceptibility situated proximal to MUC13 in Pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
A GWAS study was then performed in 52 non-adhesive and 68 strong adhesive pigs for F4ab/ac ETEC originating from 5 Belgian farms. A new refined candidate region (chr13: 144,810,100-144,993,222) for F4ac ETEC susceptibility was identified with MUC13 adjacent to the distal part of the region.

DESIGN
All pigs were phenotyped for the presence of the F4ab/ac receptor (F4ab/acR) using the in vitro villous adhesion assay with 4×108 F4ac E. coli (strain GIS26, serotype O149:K91, F4ac+) or F4ab E. coli (strain G7, serotype O8:K87, F4ab+) . A total of 120 F4ab/acR phenotyped pigs were genotyped using the Porcine SNP60 BeadChip (Illumina) containing 62,163 SNPs, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The position of the SNPs was based on the current pig genome assembly (Sscrofa10.2).
