TITLE
Small RNA expression in wild-type sciatic nerves during myelination

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNAs are critical for myelination in the peripheral nervous system. We report the differential expression of miRNAs during myelination in sciatic nerves of wild-type mice. This data serves as a starting point to identify physiologically relevant regulatory miRNAs in the peripheral nervous system.

DESIGN
total RNA from sciatic nerves of wild-type C57BL6 from embryonal day 17.5, postnatal (P) day 1, P4, P10, P30, P60 each in 2 biological replicates was used to perform the study. Additionally total RNA from differentiated primary rat Schwann cells has been included.
