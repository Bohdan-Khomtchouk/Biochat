TITLE
High depth sequencing of BrU-labeled nascent RNA.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BrU incorporation into nascent RNA followed by immunoprecipitation with a BrU specific antibody. The nascent RNA was subsequently eluted with BrU competition.

DESIGN
HEK293T cells were incubated with 2mM bromouridine for 15min labeling time and chased with 20mM uridine for different time intervals (0min, 15min, 30min and 60min). Nascent RNA was purified during BrU-IP with anti-BrdU.
