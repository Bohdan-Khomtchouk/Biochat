TITLE
Microarray analysis of an RXR agonist HX630 regulated gene expression in murine pituitary corticotroph tumor cells (AtT20 cell)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the functional mechanisms of an RXR agonist HX630 in murine pituitary corticotroph tumor cells (AtT20 cell), especially concerning cell proliferation and apoptosis, we conducted whole genome microarray analysis to identify gene expression patterns, networks, and pathways in AtT20 cells treated with HX630 at 10 μM for 48 hr. 2,173 up-regulated and 3,169 down-regulated genes were identified that demonstrated fold-changes of at least 1.5 and a P-value < 0.01 in AtT20 cells with HX630 at 10 uM compared with control.  Both the up- and down-regulated differentially expressed genes were submitted to IPA, which groups significant genes according to biological processes in which they function, and identifies various functions, networks, and pathways. These analyses showed that the categories of the biological functions and diseases significantly regulated by HX630 were associated with cell death, growth and cancer. Furthermore, it was identified that a gene network associated with caspase 3 was significantly induced by HX630.These data indicated that HX630 induced cell death and suppressed cell growth in AtT20 cells, consistent with the results of in vitro studies.

DESIGN
AtT20 cells grown to 50 % confluence in regular medium in 12-multiwell plates were incubated either without or with HX630 at 10 μM in DMEM supplemented with 1 % stripped FBS media for 48 hr. The cells were then lysed and their total RNAs were isolated for microarray analysis.
