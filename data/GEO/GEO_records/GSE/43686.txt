TITLE
Myc and PI3-k induced gene expression in RWPE1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptional changes during Myc or PI3K induced oncogenic transformation in RWPE1 cells (benign prostate epithelial cell line). The aim of the present study was to identify key epigenetic gene silencing events that occur during the oncogenic transformation events, hence emphasis was placed on downregulated genes. Results provide important information on which are the tumor suppressive pathways or genes that will be epigenetically silenced by during Myc or PI3K induced oncogenic transformation.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from oncogenic transformed RWPE1 cells which were either overexpressing Myc or constitutive active mutant of PI3K (E545K) as compared to RWPE1 cells expressing the empty vector control PMN.
