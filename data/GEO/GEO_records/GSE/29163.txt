TITLE
Genome-Wide Transcript Profiling During Soybean Seed Development and Throughout the Soybean Life Cycle

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
We report the genome-wide transcriptome of soybean seeds across several stages of seed development and the entire life cycle using Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. Specifically, we profiled whole seeds containing globular-stage, heart-stage, cotyledon-stage, early maturation-stage, mid-maturation-stage, and late-maturation-stage embryos. We also profiled dry soybean seeds, and vegetative and reproductive tissues including leaves, roots, stems, seedlings, and floral buds.

DESIGN
IIllumina sequencing of transcripts from whole seeds at five stages of seed development (globular, heart, cotyledon, early-maturation, mid-maturation, late-maturation, dry), and vegetative (leaves, roots, stems, seedlings) and reproductive (floral buds) tissues.

PLATFORM
