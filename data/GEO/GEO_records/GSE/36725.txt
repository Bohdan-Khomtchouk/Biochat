TITLE
Gene profiling in mucosal biopsies of Eosinophilic Esophagitis patients pre and post glucocorticoid steroid treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Eosinophlic esophagitis (EoE) is increasely recognized as an antigen-drived disorder. The goal of this study is to reveal the gene expression changes in EoE before and after a successful glucocorticoid steroid treatment. We used microarrays to identify distinct genes involving the pathophysiology of EoE.

DESIGN
Esophageal mRNA from the epithelial layers of 5 paired paraffin-embedded biopsies before and after treatment with glucocorticosteroids were harvested and profiled using  Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array to generate differentially regulated mRNA transcripts.
