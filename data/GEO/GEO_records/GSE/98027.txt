TITLE
Changes in gene expression due to alpha-crystallin mutations cryaa-R49C and cryab-R120G in mutant knock-in mouse lenses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the relationship between histones, chaperone function, and cataracts, we performed RNA-seq, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), size-exclusion chromatography, and gel electrophoresis of histones. The RNA-seq of postnatal lenses from 2-day-old cryaa -R49C  mice revealed increased histone gene expression, suggesting that a α-crystallin mutation regulates histones via a transcriptional mechanism .

DESIGN
RNA-seq studies on lenses of 2-day-old wild-type and 2-day-old cryaa-R49C heterozygous mutant and cryaa-R49C homozygous mutant knock-in mice; and 14-day old wild-type and 14-day-old cryab-R120G heterozygous mutant and cryab-R120G homozygous mutant knock-in mice
