TITLE
High-frequency stimulation of the ventrolateral thalamus regulates gene expression in hippocampus, motor cortex and caudate-putamen

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of rat hippocampus comparing  rats subjected to chronic (1 hour daily during 14 days) vetrolateral thalamus stimulation  (DBS group) with sham operated rats (with electrode placement but without stimulation) and with naive rats.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, DBS, sham and naive. Every sample consisted of pooled hippocampi from three rats. Slices between Bregma levels -2 and -4 were used for dissections of the hippocampi.  Common reference design, comparing every condition versus a brain pooled tissue consisting of pooled hippocampal, thalamic and cortical brain tissue of the naive (n=4), sham-operated (n=5) and stimulated (n=4) rats. Biological replicates: 4 DBS, 4 sham and 3 naive.  One replicate per array. Deep brain stimulation
