TITLE
Expression data from Rbp2f/f and Rbp2-/- ES cells before and after differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aberrations in epigenetic processes, such as histone methylation, can lead to cancer. Retinoblastoma Binding Protein 2 (RBP2)(also called JARID1A or KDM5A) can demethylate tri- and di-methylated lysine 4 in histone H3, which are epigenetic marks for transcriptionally active chromatin, whereas the MEN1 tumor suppressor promotes H3K4 methylation.  Previous studies suggested that inhibition of RBP2 contributed to tumor suppression by pRB. Here we show RBP2 loss promotes cellular differentiation in vitro.  We use mouse expression array 430 2.0 array to profile gene expression patterns of Rbp2f/f and Rbp2-/- ES cells in ES cell medium and after 6 days in ES cell medium without LIF.

DESIGN
Subconfluent Rbp2f/f and Rbp2-/- ES cells in ES cell medium and after 6 days in ES cell medium without LIF were harvested for RNA isolation using RNeasy mini kit with on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen). Gene expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays. Duplicate samples were used
