TITLE
Identification of miRNAs specific for prostate cancer (PCa)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study are:  - To identify new biomarkers specific for prostate cancer (PCa) that can be used as diagnostic markers in the urine of individuals with high probability of PCa (abnormal PSA and/or digital rectal examination).  - To validate the utility of these new biomarkers, as well as others already known such as PCA3, fusion gene TMPRSS2-ERG, GOLPH2 and SPINK1.  - To establish a prediction model for the diagnosis of PCa based on the expression of these biomarkers.  - To validate this model within the framework of an opportunist programme of early diagnosis.  - Within the framework of this programme, to associate a series of social-demographic, antropometric, life-style and occupational variables for establishing a risk model predictor that could be associated with the model based on the biomarkers.

DESIGN
Methodology: The study is divided in three phases based on three different cohorts of patients:  -Phase 1. Identification of biomarkers. This phase includes 60 patients (10 normal prostates and 50 PCa). Form these tumors a screening of miRNAs will be performed.  -Phase 2. Validation of the new biomarkers and others already known by means qRT-PCR on urine samples from 300 patients (200 with histological diagnosis of PCa and 100 with an histological negative result).  -Phase 3. Prospective validation in a prospective cohort iof 1065 patients included in an opportunist programme of early detection of PCa.
