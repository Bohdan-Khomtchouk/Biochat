TITLE
Gene expression in 16 dpp Tex19.1-/- mouse testes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray experiment to identify changes in gene expression in 16 day post partum prepubertal Tex19.1-/- mouse testes. Tex19.1 is expressed in germ cells in testes. Tex19.1-/- mice have spermatogenic defects and errors in progression through meiosis. Data provides insight into the changes in gene expression in developing testes at the time when meiotic defects first start to become apparent.

DESIGN
Testes from four Tex19.1-/- animals (ko) and four Tex19.1+/- littermate controls (het) are included in the analysis.
