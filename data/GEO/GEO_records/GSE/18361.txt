TITLE
Temporal gene expression analyisis from rice root (cv. Nipponbare) infected with Magnaporthe oryzae strain Guy11

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Magnaporthe oryzae causes rice blast, the most devastating foliar fungal disease of cultivated rice. During disease development the fungus simultaneously maintains both biotrophic and necrotrophic growth corresponding to a hemi-biotrophic life style. The ability of M. oryzae to also colonize roots and subsequently develop blast symptoms on aerial tissue has been recognized. The fungal root infection strategy and the respective host responses are currently unknown. Global temporal expression analysis suggested a purely biotrophic infection process reflected by the rapid induction of defense response-associated genes at the early stage of root invasion and subsequent repression coinciding with the onset of intracellular fungal growth. The same group of down-regulated defense genes was increasingly induced upon leaf infection by M. oryzae where symptom development occurs shortly post tissue penetration. Our molecular analysis therefore demonstrates the existence of fundamentally different tissue-specific fungal infection strategies and provides the basis for enhancing our understanding of the pathogen life style.

DESIGN
We investigated global transcriptome response overtime of Mock- and M. oryzae inoculated rice root tissue in vitro. Two independant replicates were perfomed for each treatments and samples were collected at 2, 4 and 6 days post-inoculation.
