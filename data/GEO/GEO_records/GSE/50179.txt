TITLE
miRNA high throughput sequence analysis of AKXD recombinant inbred panel mammary tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA sequencing of mammary tumor RNA from 18 [AKXD subline(n) x PyMT]F1. The PyMT strain was FVB/N-TgN(MMTV-PyVT)634Mul.

DESIGN
Mammary tumor total small RNA from mice representing each of the 18 AKXD RI strains was pooled to represent each strain and sequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx sequencer.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
