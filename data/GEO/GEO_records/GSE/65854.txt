TITLE
Global cellular biological processes governed by MET amplification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to probe the global programme of gene expression under treatment with c-Met inhibitor and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes during this process

DESIGN
We treated MET addicted EBC-1 and MKN-45 cells with selective c-Met kinase inhibitor SGX-523 at 1uM for 24 and 48 hours, using HCC827 cells with activated c-Met but lacking MET dependency as a negative control
