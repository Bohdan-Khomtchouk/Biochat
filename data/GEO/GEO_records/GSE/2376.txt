TITLE
To compare expression profiles of CD4 cells isolated from an ENU induced mouse mutant Sanroque to wildtype

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with ENU to generate single base substitutions,  the variant genome sequences were breed to homozygosity in inbreeding pedigrees, and screened for antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA). The sanroque pedigree contained multiple progeny with ANA of mixed homogeneous nuclear and cytoplasmic immunofluorescence pattern by 12 weeks of age, due to an autosomal recessive gene variant. Comparison of the gene expression profile of CD4 cells from  Sanroque to wild type was performed. Keywords: repeat sample
