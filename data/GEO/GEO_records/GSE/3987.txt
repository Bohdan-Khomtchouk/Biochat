TITLE
Combinatorial regulation of estrogen receptor alpha-responsive promoters

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In breast cancer and normal estrogen target tissues, estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) signaling results in establishment of spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression. A time-course series of ChIP-chip experiments were performed to identify direct ERalpha target genes and determine whether these targets were transcriptionally activated or repressed by ERalpha. Keywords: Time-course ChIP-chip
