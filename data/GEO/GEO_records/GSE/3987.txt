TITLE
Combinatorial regulation of estrogen receptor alpha-responsive promoters

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In breast cancer and normal estrogen target tissues, estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) signaling results in establishment of spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression. A time-course series of ChIP-chip experiments were performed to identify direct ERalpha target genes and determine whether these targets were transcriptionally activated or repressed by ERalpha. Keywords: Time-course ChIP-chip

DESIGN
A total of 24 samples were analyzed. MCF7 cells were treated with E2 for 0 (control), 3, 12 and 24 hours. ChIP assays were performed using antibodies against ERalpha and specific histone modifications (acetyl-H3-K9 and dimethyl-H3-K9). The immunoprecipitated DNA was used to probe the 12K CGI microarray. Two independent experiments were performed for each time-point treatment and antibody.
