TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of microRNA in keratinocytes and reconstituted epidermis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of microRNA expression in keratinocytes by relative quantification (RQ) using the comparative Ct method. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of microRNA in keratinocytes or reconstituted epidermis exposed to IL-22, LPS or UV radiation or a small molecule drug.

DESIGN
Keratinocytes or reconstituted human epidermis were exposed to indicated treatments. A qPCR analysis of 365 microRNAs in keratinocytes. RNA (20 ng per reaction) reverse transcribed using 8 x Multiplex RT pools. Each resulting cDNA pool was mixed with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and loaded in corresponding port on the TaqMan Array.
