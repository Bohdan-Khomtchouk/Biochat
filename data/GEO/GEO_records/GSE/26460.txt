TITLE
Expression data from primary hepatocytes isolated from miR-143DOX mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The contribution of altered posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus so far remains elusive. We have described that expression of microRNAs (miR)-143 and -145 is dysregulated in genetic and dietary mouse models of obesity. Induced transgenic overexpression of miR-143, but not miR-145, causes insulin resistance and impaired insulin-stimulated AKT activation. We used microarrays to analyze the underlying molecular mechanisms of miR-143-mediated development of insulin resistance.

DESIGN
miR-143DOX mice (n=3) and wildtype littermate controls (n=3) were treated with doxycycline via the drinking water to induce miR-143 overexpression in the transgenic animals. Primary hepatocytes were isolated for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
