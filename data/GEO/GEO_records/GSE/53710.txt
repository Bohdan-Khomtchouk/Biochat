TITLE
Global transcriptional study of Burkholderia pseudomallei wild type and ∆BPSS1356 mutant strains

ORGANISM
Burkholderia pseudomallei K96243

SUMMARY
This study describes the global transcriptional changes upon deletion of a hypothetical gene BPSS1356. The BPSS1356 deletion strain of B. pseudomallei was generated via homologous recombination. Global gene expression profiling of wild type and ∆BPSS1356 mutant strains was performed to elucidate of biological functions of BPSS1356.

DESIGN
The wild type and ∆BPSS1356 mutant strains were grown using Luria Bertani medium until exponential phase. Total RNAs were isolated from both strains and subjected to microarray analysis. The experiment was performed with three biological replicates for each strain. The microarray data obtained from both strains were compared.

PLATFORM
GPL18120 Agilent-019078 Custom Burkholderia pseudomallei 8X15K microarray (Probe Name Version)
