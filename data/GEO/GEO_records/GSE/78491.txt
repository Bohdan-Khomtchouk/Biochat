TITLE
small RNA-seq from SK-MEL-5 (ENCSR964EPR)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from nuclear fractions of a malignant melonoma immortalized cell line SK-MEL-5 derived from a metastatic axillary node of a 24 year old female. They are stranded SE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted TAP pretreated Total RNA < 200 nucleotides in size.
