TITLE
Effect of an anti-myostatin antibody on skeletal muscle gene expression in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
More than 2,000 genes appear to be upregulated or downregulated in skeletal muscle of mice with constitutive knockout of myostatin (Steelman et al., FASEB J 20:580-2, 2006). This study was done to determine whether inhibition of myostatin activity in mature mice has similar effects on the pattern of gene expression. Keywords: Differential expression in treated and control mice

DESIGN
Ten samples from JA16 antibody-treated mice were compared with 10 samples from saline-treated mice
