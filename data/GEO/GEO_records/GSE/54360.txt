TITLE
Genexpression profiling of wild type, HIF-1α knockdown, or HIF-2α knockdown HepG2 tumor spheroids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
10 days old tumor spheroids were processed for RNA isolation using the Quiagen RNeasy Micro Kit and cDNA synthesis was done using the Ambion WT Expression Kit. Wt, HIF-1α k/d and HIF-2α k/d samples were compared to each other.

DESIGN
Samples from 4 different spheroid experiments of wt, HIF-1α knockdown and HIF-2α knockdown HepG2 cells, respectively, were compared with each other
