TITLE
Gene expression profiling of lung cancer serum or health plasma cultured human monocytes-derived dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cancer-induced DC dysfunction plays an important role in the tumor immune escape and cancer development. By using lung cancer patientsâ€™ sera, we built an in vitro model of tumor induced DCs dysfunction, and gene expression analysis was performed basing on Operon Human Genome Array-Ready Oligo Set (Version 4.0).

DESIGN
Immature MoDCs cultured with two tumor sera pools separately (named as Exp1 and Exp2) or healthy controls were collected. Total RNA were isolated, and aRNA were then synthesized. Gene expression profiling were performed with CY5 (health group) or CY3 (cancer group) labeled aRNA.
