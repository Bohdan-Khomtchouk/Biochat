TITLE
Expression genes induced by intermittent mechanical stress (MS) in human periodontal ligament (PDL) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Excessive MS is known to result in disappearance of the alveolar hard line, enlargement of thePDL space, and destruction of alveolar bone, leading to occlusal traumatism. The regulatory role of MS is believed to play a critical role in the process of alveolar bone remodeling. However, little is known about the effect of excessive MS on expression of osteoclastogenesis-related genes in human PDL cells.

DESIGN
Human PDL cells were cultured in silicon chambers, which was attached to a stretching apparatus (STB-140; Strex Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) The cells were allowed to attach to the chamber base for 48 hours, after which uniaxial sinusoidal stretching (conditions: 60 sec/returns, resting time; 29 sec, stretch length; 1.6 mm, stretch ratio; 105%) was applied at 37Â°C, 5% CO2. We compared to the genes expression between 0 and 48 hours after MS stimulation.
