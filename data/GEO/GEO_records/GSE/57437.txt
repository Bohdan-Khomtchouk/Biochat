TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of Immunity- and Reproduction-related Differential Gene Expression in Parasitized Locusta migratoria

ORGANISM
Locusta migratoria

SUMMARY
The transcriptome and DGE analysis of the fat body and ovary of L. migratoria based on the Illumina short-read sequencing technology and De novo assembly. Research on the trade-offs between immunity and reproduction is contributing significantly to the understanding of the fitness of organisms in nature.

DESIGN
The cDNA libraries for the mixed tissue samples of the fat body and ovary collected from the Sephadex group, the bacterial parasite group, and the dipteran parasite group at 4 hours and 6 days post-treatment were made for the DGE analysis. Every experimental treatment sample had one DGE-seq and one parallel replication.

PLATFORM
