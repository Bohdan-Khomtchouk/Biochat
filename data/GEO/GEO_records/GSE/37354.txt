TITLE
Gene expression profiling of ovaries collected from wild type (WT) mice and progesterone receptor (PR) knock out mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previous studies have shown that PR is a critical regulator of ovulation. The PR-null mice (PRKO) failed to ovulate due to a failure in the rupture of the preovulatory follicles.

DESIGN
To experimentally induce ovulation, the wild type and PR null mice (C57BL/6, 24â€“28 d old) were injected ip with 5 IU of PMSG and 48 h later by 5 IU of hCG.  Ovaries were collected at 11 h and total RNA was analyzed using Affymetrix mouse arrays
