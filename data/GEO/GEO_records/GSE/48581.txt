TITLE
Potential impact of microarray diagnosis of T cell-mediated rejection in kidney transplants: the INTERCOM study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The authors report that in INTERCOM, a prospective international study of 300 kidney transplant biopsies, a microarray-based molecular score for T cell-mediated rejection changed the assessment of 26% of all biopsies, illustrating the potential of precision diagnostics to impact practice.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis of 300 kidney transplant biopsies (non-TCMR, TCMR) and 6 nephrectomies.
