TITLE
Caulobacter vibrioides CB15N mRNA expression in M2-Glucose Vs. M2-Inositol

ORGANISM
Caulobacter vibrioides

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to examine the differential transcriptional profiles of Caulobacter CB15N grown in M2-Glucose versus M2-Inositol.

DESIGN
mRNA expression was compared between Caulobacter CB15N cells grown in M2-Glucose vs. M2-Inositol. Four arrays were run, two of each dye combination.
