TITLE
Gene expression analysis of cells sensitive to necrosis (L929) and cells sensitive to apoptosis (NIH3T3).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore gene expression profiles of cells sensitive to necrosis (such as L929 cells) and those sensitive to apoptosis (such as NIH3T3 cells), we conducted expression microarray analysis of L929 cells and NIH3T3 cells.
