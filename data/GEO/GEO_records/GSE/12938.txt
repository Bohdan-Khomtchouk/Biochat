TITLE
dgpp-2 DGPP-regulated genes: Identification of diacylglycerol pyrophosphate-regulated genes in ABA signaling

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs05-06_dgpp - dgpp - 2.  The specific plant phosphorylated form of phosphatidic acid (PA), diacyglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP), was recently shown to be a second messenger in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. The aim of the project is to identify among the set of ABA-regulated genes the ones also regulated by DGPP and/or PA.

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - CATMA arrays 5ml of 3 days-old suspension cells were incubated with ABA or DGPP 18:1 for 3hours under the conditions of culture. DGPP was emulsified by sonication for 1min 4 times at 4Â°C in 1ml of culture medium then added to 4ml of suspension cells. Cells were filtrated under vacuum, frozen in liquid nitrogen and RNA extracted. DGPP is from Avanti Polar Lipids.

PLATFORM
GPL4346 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.2
