TITLE
Pof D119 mutant expression analysis

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in pof deletion mutants. Chromosome 4 genes are down-regulated in pof mutants compared to wildtype control. 200 Drosophila melanogaster first instar larvae were used for each of three biological replicates of y1 w67c23; PofD119/PofD119 and three biological replicates of y1 w67c23 as controls. Keywords: Mutant vs Wt expression
