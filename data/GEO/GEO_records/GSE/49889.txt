TITLE
Identification of copy number variation using aCGH in Chinese chicken breeds

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
CNV plays an important role in the chicken genomic studies,it is imperative need to investigate the extent and pattern of CNVs using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in chinese chicken breeds for future studies associating phenotype to genome architecture. we describe systematic and genome-wide analysis of CNVs loci in five Chinese indigenous chicken breeds were evaluated by aCGH.

DESIGN
5 Chinese native chicken were detected using ANKA broiler as reference.
