TITLE
Effect of Runx2 Knockdown by siRNA in granulosa cell cultures.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
LH-indced RUNX2 expression is important for luteal gene expression.

DESIGN
Granulosa cells were treated with Runx2 siRNA and forskolin to knockdown agonist-induced Runx2 expression. Two separate cultures were performed (n=2) and universal siRNA was used for negative control. Total RNAs were isolated from cultured granulosa cells and used for DNA microarray.
