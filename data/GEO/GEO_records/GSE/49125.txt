TITLE
Identification of direct target genes of the tomato FRUITFULL homologs during ripening by promoter ChIP-chip

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) has two MADS-box FRUITFULL homologs, FUL1 and FUL2, both of which are able to interact with the master ripening regulator RIN.  Here, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with a DNA microarray (ChIP-chip) for the 2-kb upstream putative promoters of whole tomato predicted genes (ITAG2) for a large-scale identification of the direct target genes of FUL1 and FUL2 during ripening. The ChIP-chip with antibodies of FUL1 and FUL2 identified 1,877 and 1,919 of FUL1- and FUL2-binding sites, respectively, each of which was assigned a significantly high peak score (FDR < 0.05) in at least two of the three biologically independent analyses. Using the information about genomic position of the FUL1- and FUL2-binding sites, we found 1,943 and 2,051 potential direct targets of FUL1 and FUL2, respectively, that carried one or more binding sites in the putative promoter or in other gene regions, such as exons, introns or a downstream region from the translation termination site (1-kb), where the promoter region of a neighbor gene are overlapped.  The majority of the direct target genes are common between FUL1, FUL2 and RIN, suggesting that FUL1 and FUL2 act redundantly in the regulation of fruit ripening, and that these factors regulate the expression of their targets in a form of heteromer complex.  Interestingly, the analysis also found direct targets unique to each of FUL1, FUL2 and RIN, implying their exclusive roles during ripening.

DESIGN
Three biologically independent samples (chromatin-immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNA) recovered from the ripening tomato fruits.
