TITLE
Renal fibrosis mRNA classifier: validation in experimental lithium-induced interstitial fibrosis in the rat kidney

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Metzincins and related genes (MARGS) play important roles in ECM remodeling in fibrotic conditions. In this investigation, gene expression was examined in a rat model to investigate whether the previously described MARGS based fibrosis classifier had diagnostic value in an experimental rat model of lithium-induced renal fibrosis

DESIGN
Male Wistar rats (n=12) were divided into 2 groups (n=6) One group was given a diet containing lithium (40 mmol/kg food for 7 days, followed by 60mmol/kg food for the rest of the experimental period, while a control group (n=6) was fed a normal diet. After six months, animals were sacrificed and the renal cortex and medulla of both kidneys removed for analysis. For microarray investigation, 24 GeneChipÂ® Affymetrix Rat Exon 1.0 ST arrays were used. Statistically relevant genes (p-value < 0.05, fold change > 1.5, t-test) were further examined.
