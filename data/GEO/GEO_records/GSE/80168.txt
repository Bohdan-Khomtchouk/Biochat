TITLE
Single cell sequencing of Dgcr8 knockout embryonic stem cells plus/minus miR-294 or let-7

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed Fluidigm C1 single cell sequencing analysis of wild-type and microRNA deficient (Dgcr8 knockout) mouse embryonic stem cells mock treated or transfected with either miR-294 or let-7.

DESIGN
Wild-type and Dgcr8 knockout cells grown in na√Øve culture conditions were mock transfected or transfected with miRNA mimics for let-7b or miR-294, single cells were captured on Fluidigm C1 24 hours post-transfection and then prepared for sequencing on Illumina HiSeq1000 following manufacturer's protocol.
