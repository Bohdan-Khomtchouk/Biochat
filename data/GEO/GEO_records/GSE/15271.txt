TITLE
Expression data from CXCR4pos (centroblast) and CXCR4neg (centrocyte) Human Germinal Center B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Functional discrimination between normal centroblast and centrocyte obtained from human inflamed tonsils after cell sorting. We used microarrays to detail the segregation between these two B cell subsets

DESIGN
Flow cytometry analysis was done on human germinal center B cells and cell subsets, i.e. CXCR4pos and CXCR4neg, sorted before RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Both B-cell subsets where obtained from an identical tonsil allowing paired statistical analysis.
