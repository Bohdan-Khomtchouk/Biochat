TITLE
Comparison of human aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) exposed to cyclic stretch to static samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AVICs were exposed to cyclic stretch to examine the role of mechanical stimuli on gene expression AVICs cultured on collagen 1 coated Bioflex were exposed to 14% stretch at 1 hz or static conditions using a Flexcell-5000

DESIGN
14% stretch was the experimental condition while the static condition was the control
