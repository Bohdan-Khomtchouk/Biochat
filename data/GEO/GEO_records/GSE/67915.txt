TITLE
Transcriptome Signature and Regulation in Human Somatic Cell Reprogramming

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reprogramming of somatic cells produces induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that are invaluable resources for biomedical research. Transcriptional and epigenetic changes have been investigated to facilitate our understanding of the reprogramming process. Here, we extended the previous transcriptome studies by performing RNA-seq on cells defined by a combination of multiple cellular surface markers. We found that transcriptome changes during early reprogramming occur independently from the opening of closed chromatin by OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC (OSKM). Furthermore, our data identify multiple spliced forms of genes uniquely expressed at each progressive stage of reprogramming. In particular, we found a pluripotency-specific spliced form of CCNE1 that significantly enhances reprogramming. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) expression analysis reveals that monoallelic gene expression is induced in the intermediate stages of reprogramming while biallelic expression is recovered upon completion of reprogramming. Our transcriptome data provide unique opportunities in understanding human iPSC reprogramming.

DESIGN
RNA samples from intermediates of hiPSC reprogramming were obtained. Gene expression of those cells were analyzed.
