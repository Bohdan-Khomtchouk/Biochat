TITLE
Human breast cancer SKBr-3 cells: trastuzumab-resistant vs. parental

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human breast cancer SKBr-3 cells selected with trastuzumab for 6 month compared with parental SKBr-3 cells; Goal was to screen for microRNAs involved in development of trastuzumab resistance.

DESIGN
Human breast cancer SKBr-3 cells were continuously cultured in the presence of  5µg/ml trastuzumab for 6 months, and the resulting alive cells were regarded as trastuzumab-resistant. Total RNAs were prepared from these cells and cells cultured in parallel in control media, and were subjected to hybridization on the miRCURY LNA Array (Exiqon, version 11.0).

PLATFORM
