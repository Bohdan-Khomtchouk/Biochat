TITLE
Comparison of CD4+ T cell function between HIV-1 resistant and HIV-1 susceptible individuals (Immune)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Understanding why some indidivual resist HIV-1 infection despite continued exposure is an important goal for vaccine development. We compared CD4+ T cell gene expression at baseline and after antigenic stimulation in HIV-1 resistant commercial sex-workers from Nairobi, Kenya to HIV-1 low-risk negative (non-resistant) non-commercial sex-workers using immune-focused gene expression arrays Keywords: Case-control, disease state analysis
