TITLE
Gene expression profiles of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are severe psychiatric conditions, with a lifetime prevalence of about 1%. Both disorders have a neurodevelopment component, with onset of symptoms occurring most frequently during late adolescence or early adulthood. Genetic findings indicate the existence of an overlap in genetic susceptibility across the disorders. These gene expression profiles were used to identify the molecular mechanisms that differentiate SZ and BP from healthy controls but also that distinguish both from healthy individuals. They were also used to expand an analysis from an experiment that searched molecular alterations in human induced pluripotent stem cells derived from fibroblasts from control subject and individual with schizophrenia and further differentiated to neuron to identify genes relevant for the development of schizophrenia (GSE62105).

DESIGN
Brain tissue (frontal cortex) from 30 healthy controls, 29 bipolar disorder patients and 29 schizophrenia patients were analyzed. The reference is an in-house pool of RNA extracted from 15 human cell lines.
