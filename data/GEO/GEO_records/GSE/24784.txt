TITLE
Gene expression profile of pellicle cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
To investigate the gene expression profile of pellicle cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, microarray analysis was performed. Transcriptome profiles of pellicle cells and planktonic cells grown in LB medium were determined by Affymetrix GeneChip. Gene expression pattern that is specific to pellicle cells was evaluated by comparing the data set with that of planktonic cells.

DESIGN
Pseudomonas aeruginosa wild type (PAO1ut) strain was cultivated aerobically in LB in Erlenmeyer flasks under static or shaking conditions, and total RNAs were extracted at 24 hours (static culture) and early stationary phase (OD600 = 1.4, shaking culture). The experiment was performed in duplicate independent cultures.
