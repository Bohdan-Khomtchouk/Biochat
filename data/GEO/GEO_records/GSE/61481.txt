TITLE
Expression data from  human endometrial cancer cell line AN3-CA treated with 300 nM AZD4547

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AZD4547,pan-FGFR inhibitor, have been reported to have profound therapeutic effects on FGFR-deregulated cancers. AN3-CA is one of endometrial cancer cell lines harbouring FGFR2 mutants.  AZD4547 showed a potent antiprolierative effect on AN3-CA cells. we used microarray to investigate transcriptome-wide change in gene expression followinig 300 nM AZD4547 treatment to explain the chemotherapeutic effect.

DESIGN
compound treatment with or without ligand stimulus.
