TITLE
Expression data from  CD28+/- resting CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the loss of CD28 co-receptor on primary human CD8+ T cells. We identified distinct classes of differentially regulated genes between sorted T cell subsets.

DESIGN
Primary human CD8 T cells from blood from HIV- individuals were isolated, and CD28+ and CD28- T cells subsets were sorted for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
