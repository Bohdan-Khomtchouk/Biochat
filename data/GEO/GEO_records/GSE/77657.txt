TITLE
Reference annotation for small RNA-producing genes in maize

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
The goal of the project is to produce a standard annotation of the loci producing small RNAs in the maize genome. To achieve this goal we produced small RNA libraries from four different maize tissues, which will allow the identification of tissue-specific small RNA expression. The availability of bilogical replicates for three of the four tissues analyzed will guarantee robustness in the small RNA genes identification process.

DESIGN
sRNA profile of maize expanded leaf, wrapped leaf, pollen and embryo, collected from B73 wt plants grown under control conditions. Leaves and pollen samples are replicated three times, embryo one time.

PLATFORM
