TITLE
Gene expression in response to AGL15 during somatic embryogenesis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcript accumulation was measured using the Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array [ATH1-121501] to document changes in response to the MADS-domain transcription factor AGAMOUS-Like 15 during somatic embryogenesis. A somatic embryo system was used where mature seed is allowed to complete germination in liquid MS media containing 2,4-D and seedlings produce somatic embryos from the shoot apical meristem (SAM) region. The frequency with which these embryos are produced directly correlates with AGL15 accumulation.

DESIGN
Wild type Arabidopsis (Columbia ecotype) with normal amounts of AGL15 were compared to (1) 35S:AGL15 that constitutively expresses AGL15 and produces more somatic embryos from the shoot apical region than wild type and (2) agl15 agl18 double loss-of-function mutants that produce less somatic embryos from the shoot apical region than wild type.
