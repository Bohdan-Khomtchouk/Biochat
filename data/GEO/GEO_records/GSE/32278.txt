TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of lupus immune complex stimulation of purified CD14+ monocytes and how this response is regulated by C1q

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine what genes are up- and down-regulated in response to lupus immune complexes in purified CD14+ monocyte stimulations. Our results have shown that novel genes are induced by immune complexes but the response is less robust when using purified monocytes versus total PBMCs

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from CD14+ monocytes from 2 donors after 5 hours with the following conditions: 1) Unstimulated, 2) Lupus immune complex alone, 3) Lupus immune complex + C1q, 4) C1q alone
