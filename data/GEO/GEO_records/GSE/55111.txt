TITLE
DNA METHYLATION DURING αβ T CELL DEVELOPMENT IN THE HUMAN THYMUS [methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Thymocyte differentiation is a complex process which involves well-defined sequential developmental stages that finally result in the generation of mature αβ and γδ T cells. Here, we analyzed DNA methylation and gene expression profiles at successive human thymus developmental stages from early T-cell progenitors to single positive (SP) CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations

DESIGN
Methylation data sets were generated from two biological replicates per cell type (except CD34+/CD1a+) and each biological replicate was obtained from a pool of  3 individuals each

PLATFORM
