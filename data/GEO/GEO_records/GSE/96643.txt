TITLE
RNA_seq and Ribo_seq analyses of control and CPT-treated MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq and Ribo-seq analyses to examine the effect of CPT treatment of translation efficiency (TE)

DESIGN
We measured expression levels (RNA.seq) and ribosome densities (ribo-seq) using biological duplicates of control and CPT-treated (5 hrs) MCF7 cells
