TITLE
Adipose tissue in the presence or absence of kinin B1 receptors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We studied adipose tissue from wild type mice, kinin B1 receptor knockout mice (B1KO), and B1KO mice with rescued expression of kinin B1 receptor selectively in fat. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression profile of the epididymal fat of these mice.

DESIGN
Three-month-old mice were killed and tissue was collected for RNA processing and microarray analysis.
