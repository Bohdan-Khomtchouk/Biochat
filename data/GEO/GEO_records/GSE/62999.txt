TITLE
Expression data from study on IL33 signaling in Dusp5 deficient eosinophils

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dusp5 regulates ERK phosporylation following IL-33 receptor ligation in cultured eosinophils. Dusp5 deficient eosinophils show increased ERK phosphorylation, and as a result are less apoptotic. Since ERK stimulation results in downstream activation of transcription factors, we are utilizing a microarray approach to find alterations in gene expression to uncover potential mechanisms for increased cell survival.

DESIGN
Day 12 bone marrow derived eosinophils from Dusp5+/+ and Dusp5-/- mice (5 mice per genotype) were left untreated (media only) or IL-33 (25ng/ml) stimulated for 4 hours. Treated cells were washed with ice cold PBS and cell pellets were directly lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen) followed by immediate RNA isolation (RNEasy plus mini kit with genomic DNA eliminator columns). Sample group names: Group 1- Dusp5+/+ Untreated (N=5) Group 2- Dusp5-/- Untreated (N=5) Group 3- Dusp5+/+ IL-33 4hrs (N=5) Group 4- Dusp5-/- IL-33 4hrs (N=5) Sample Names: Group 1- BM Eos unstimulated WT-1....WT-5 Group 2- BM Eos unstimulated Dusp5-/- -1......Dusp5-/- -5 Group 3- BM Eos IL-33 4hrs WT-1....WT-5 Group 4- BM Eos IL-33 4hrs Dusp5-/- -1......Dusp5-/- -5
