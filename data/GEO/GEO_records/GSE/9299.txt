TITLE
Expression profiles of mouse medulloblastoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dysregulatio of Hh signaling has been shown to be involved in the formation of human medulloblastoma. We generated a mouse model (CAGGS-CreER;R26-SmoM2) of Hh related tumors. We used microarray to profile gene expression in Hh induced mouse medulloblastoma and identified distinct classes of up-regulated or down-regulated genes during Hh dependent tumorigenesis . Keywords: Tumor vs wild type tissue

DESIGN
Medulloblastoma samples and adjacent wild type cerebellar tissue from CAGGS-CreER;R26-SmoM2 mice were isolated for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
