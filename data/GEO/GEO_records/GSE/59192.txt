TITLE
A strand-specific switch in noncoding transcription switches the function of a Polycomb/Trithorax response element

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Polycomb/Trithorax response elements (PRE/TREs) can switch their function reversibly between silencing and activation, by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here we show that a switch in forward and reverse noncoding transcription from the Drosophila vestigial (vg) PRE/TRE switches the status of the element between silencing (induced by the forward strand) and activation (induced by the reverse strand). In vitro, both ncRNAs inhibit PRC2 histone methyltransferase activity, but in vivo only the reverse strand binds PRC2. Overexpression of the reverse strand evicts PRC2 from chromatin and inhibits its enzymatic activity. We propose that interactions of RNAs with PRC2 are differentially regulated in vivo, allowing regulated inhibition of local PRC2 activity. Genome-wide analysis shows that strand switching of ncRNAs occurs at several hundred PcG binding sites in fly and vertebrate genomes. This work identifies a novel and potentially widespread class of PRE/TREs that switch function by switching the direction of ncRNA transcription.

DESIGN
E(Z) and H3K27me3 profile in Drosophila embryos of two transgenic lines (pKC27.vg.fwd' and pKC27.vg.rev') that were crossed to daGAL4 in order to overexpress the forward or the reverse vg PRE/TRE ncRNA from an ectopic site ('site 1' in this study).
