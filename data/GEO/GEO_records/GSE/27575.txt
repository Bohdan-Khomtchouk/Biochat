TITLE
Expression data for UPEC and GBS cystitis in female C57BL/6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Data defines for the first time a whole bladder transcriptome of UPEC cystitis in female C57BL/6 mice using genome-wide expression profiling and temporal analysis to map early host response pathways stemming from UPEC colonization We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in GBS UTI in mice over time and in UPEC UTI in mice at 24h

DESIGN
Whole mouse bladder collected at 2h and 24h following transurethral infection for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Non-pooled samples were used, with one array per mouse to expand power of expression profiles. Control mice for each time point received only PBS as a mock infection. Group sizes were five mice per group, and therefore five arrays were used per group.
