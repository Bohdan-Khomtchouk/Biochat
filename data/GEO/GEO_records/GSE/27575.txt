TITLE
Expression data for UPEC and GBS cystitis in female C57BL/6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Data defines for the first time a whole bladder transcriptome of UPEC cystitis in female C57BL/6 mice using genome-wide expression profiling and temporal analysis to map early host response pathways stemming from UPEC colonization We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in GBS UTI in mice over time and in UPEC UTI in mice at 24h
