TITLE
Expression data from human peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Peripheral blood lymphocytes were separated in the Ficoll gradient and subjected for stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antiobodies upon time (6h, 12h and 18h). Next, total RNA was isolated and trenscriptional analysis of stimulated cells was performed.

DESIGN
11 total samples were analysed. Analysis was performed using samples from two healthy donors and one sample from patient. Unstimulated samples were used as a controls.
