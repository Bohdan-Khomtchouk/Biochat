TITLE
A novel recurrent mutation in MITF predisposes to familial and sporadic melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified a novel germline mutation of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF - E318K).  This mutation was found to be present in numerous melanoma families, as well as the general population, where its association with melanoma has a significant effect.  We determined the effect of the E318K mutation on global MITF target gene transcription. We developed a tetracycline-inducible system for expression of wild type MITF or the E318K variant in melanoma cell lines with constitutively low or undetectable levels of endogenous MITF (HT144 and C32).  We examined whole-genome expression profiles in these cells following induction of either wild-type or E318K MITF for 48 hours.  Analysis suggests that the MITF E318K mutant exhibits differential transcriptional activity against some, though not all, target genes.
