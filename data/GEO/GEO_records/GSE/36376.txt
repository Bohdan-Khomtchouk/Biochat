TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles of both tumor and adjacent non-tumor liver Identify Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients at High Risk of Recurrence after Curative Hepatectomy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often leads to vascular invasion and intrahepatic metastasis, which correlate with recurrence after surgical treatment and poor prognosis. It is crucial to identify patients with a high risk of recurrence and develop more intensified or targeted treatment strategy to improve disease outcome.

DESIGN
In the training set, tumor and non-tumor liver were profiled separately, and each was used to generate a prediction model which was validated with the use of independent validation set.
