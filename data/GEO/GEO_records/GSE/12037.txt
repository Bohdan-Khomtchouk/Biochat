TITLE
ARGONAUTE-small RNA Interactions in Arabidopsis thaliana Identified by High-Throughput Sequencing

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify small RNA-ARGONAUTE interactions in Arabidopsis. Co-immunoprecipitation assays followed by high-throughput sequencing were done to identify small RNA associated with HA-AGO2 and HA-AGO7. Keywords: small RNA - ARGONAUTE interactions

DESIGN
Sequencing-by-synthesis technology was used to sequence small RNA from input and co-immunoprecipitation fractions from cell lysates of inflorescence  tissue from Arabidopsis plants transformed with HA epitope-tagged AGO2 or AGO7 constructs. Meaningful intepretation requires comparison between the input and co-immunoprecipitation datasets. Fastq files are not available for this series as only ELAND output files were provided by the sequencing facility at the time of sequencing (2007).
