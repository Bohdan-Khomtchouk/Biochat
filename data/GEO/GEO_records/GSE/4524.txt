TITLE
High risk HPV infection effect on expression profile mediated by tumor necrosis factor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previous studies have shown that normal and HPV immortalized keratinocytes are sensitive to TNF anti-proliferative effect. Conversely, HPV18-immortalized keratinocytes are resistant to the cytostatic effect mediated by this cytokine. In this study we have compared gene expression patterns in primary cultures of human foreskin epidermal keratinocytes (PHK or NHFK) and HPV16 (HF698) and HPV18(HF18Nco)-immortalized cell lines, and profile the transcriptional changes 3 and 60 hours after TNF treatment. Keywords: global expression profile, microarray, HPV, TNF
