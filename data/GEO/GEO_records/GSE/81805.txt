TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing profile of leukemia from distinct cells-of-origin [ATAC-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify genomic signatures predicitve of cell-of-origin in acute myeloid leukemia Cryopreserved leukemic bone marrow samples were thawed, and 50,000 LSCs (L-GMP; GFP+ Lin- Sca-1- c-Kit+ CD34+ FcÎ³R+) were sorted by FACSAria (BD). Samples were placed at 37oC and 5% CO2 in IMDM plus 10% fetal calf serum for 30 minutes, then harvested, washed with 1X PBS, and ATAC-seq libraries were prepared. Quantitative PCR using the Library Quantitation kit (Kapa Biosystems) was used to estimate library concentrations. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform generating 2x150bp paired end reads at a sequencing depth of ~30-50 million reads per sample. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.

DESIGN
ATAC-seq profiles of MLL-AF9 L-GMP AML samples to identify open chromatin signatures associated with leukemia cell-of-origin
