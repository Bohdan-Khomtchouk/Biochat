TITLE
Profiling Transcriptomic Alterations in Postmortem Prefrontal Cortex Tissues of Individuals with Alcohol Use Disorders

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptiomic alternations related with alcohol use disorders (AUDs). The hypothesis is that chronic alcohol consumption might alter genome-wide gene expression patterns. The results suggest that differential gene expression in the prefrontal cortex is implicated in neuroadaptations to alcohol.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from postmortem prefrontal cortex tissues from 23 AUD cases and 23 matched controls. Both AUD cases and matched controls were assessed with DSM-IV.
