TITLE
CDDP treated KYSE140

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the gene expression profiles of KYSE140 cell line to identify distinct up and down-regulated genes during treatment with cisplatin.

DESIGN
KYSE140 cell line were treated with 10 mM cisplatin for 12 hrs and selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to gene expression profiles of KYSE 140 cell line treated with cisplatin.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
