TITLE
Gene Expression in wild type and CCR5 knockout mice with lung metastasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have shown that  C57BL/6J CCR5 knockout mice develop 30.4% Â± 8.6% fewer B16 F10 lung nodules compared to wild type mice after the intravenous injection of 100,000 B16 F10 cells.  We sought to understand this phenomenon by comparing gene expression in the lungs of these mice at 6, 24, and 48 hours after tumor injection.

DESIGN
There were 6 groups or conditions (CCR5 - 6 hours, WT - 6 hours, CCR5 - 24 hours, WT - 24 hours, CCR5 - 48 hours, WT - 48 hour); each group had 4 to 5 mice.  All of the mice were injected with 100,000 B16 F10 melanoma cells by tail vein.  At the designated time, the mice were anesthetized with Avertin and their lungs were perfused with  PBS.  After this, the lungs were harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.  They were kept at minus 80 degrees C until processing.  mRNA was extracted as described below and equivalent amounts of mRNA (by weight) was pooled by group.
