TITLE
Sexual Dimorphism in the Th17 Signature of Ankylosing Spondylitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Male AS patients have an elevated Th17 cell frequency vs. female AS patients (Gracey et al, Arthritis and Rheumatology, 2015). This analysis was performed to further examine differences between male and female AS patients

DESIGN
AS patients were compared to healthy controls (HC). For sex-specific anaylsis, three groups were compared: F-HC vs. M-HC, M-AS vs. M-HC and F-AS vs. F-HC. A one way ANOVA was performed to identify genes differentially regulated in male and female AS patients
