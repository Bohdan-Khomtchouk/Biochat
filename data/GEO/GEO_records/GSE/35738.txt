TITLE
2009 pandemic H1N1 virus causes disease and upregulation of genes related to inflammatory and immune response, cell death, and lipid metabolism in pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
This study used virological, histological, and global gene expression data to compare the virulence of two 2009 pH1N1 isolates from human (A/California/04/2009) and swine (A/swine/Alberta/25/2009) to that of a 1918-like classical swine influenza virus (A/swine/Iowa/1930) in a pig model of infection. The overall goal of this study was to characterize the clinical, histological, virological and global gene expression responses to three distinct influenza A isolates in an experimental pig model of influenza infection. We compared the pathogenesis of two pH1N1 viruses, one derived from a human patient (A/CA/04/09 [CA09]) and the other from swine (A/swine/Alberta/25/2009 [Alb09]), with that of the 1918-like classical swine influenza virus (A/swine/Iowa/1930 [IA30]) in the pig model. Both pH1N1 isolates induced clinical symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, decreased activity, fever, and labored breathing in challenged pigs, but IA30 virus did not cause any clinical symptoms except fever. Although both the pH1N1 viruses and the IA30 virus caused lung lesions, the pH1N1 viruses were shed from the nasal cavities of challenged pigs whereas the IA30 virus was not. Microarray was used to assess global gene expression in the lungs at 3 and 5 days post-infection.

DESIGN
Crossbred pigs fwere obtained from a healthy herd free of SIV and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. These studies included two experiments: the classical H1N1 SIV (IA30) study was completed at Kansas State University's biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) facility in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Kansas State University, and the pH1N1 virus study was completed at the Central States Research Center (CSRC), Inc., BSL-3 facility (Oakland, NE), in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at CSRC. In each experiment, 10 pigs were inoculated with noninfectious cell culture supernatant as controls. For the classical H1N1 SIV experiment, 10 4-week-old crossbred pigs were inoculated intratracheally with 10^6 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/pig of egg-derived IA30 virus. For the pH1N1 virus experiment, 10 4-week-old crossbred pigs were inoculated intratracheally with 10^6 TCID50/pig of either egg-derived CA/09 or Alb/09 virus. Five animals per group were euthanized at 3 and 5 days postinfection (dpi), respectively.
