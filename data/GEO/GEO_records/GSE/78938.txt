Gene expression profile of chemical-induced neural stem cells from defined fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Cellular reprogramming using chemically defined conditions, without genetic manipulation, is a promising approach for generating clinically relevant cell types for regenerative medicine and drug discovery. However, small molecule-driven approaches for inducing lineage-specific stem cells from somatic cells across lineage boundaries have been challenging to develop. Here, we report highly efficient reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into induced neural stem cell-like cells (ciNSLCs) using a cocktail of nine small molecules (M9). The resulting ciNSLCs closely resemble primary neural stem cells molecularly and functionally. Transcriptome analysis revealed that M9 induces a gradual and specific conversion of fibroblasts towards a neural fate. During reprogramming specific transcription factors such as Elk1 and Gli2 that are downstream of M9-induced signaling pathways bind and activate endogenous master neural genes to specify neural identity. Our study therefore provides an effective chemical approach for generating neural stem cells from mouse fibroblasts, and reveals mechanistic insights into underlying reprogramming process.

DESIGN
Total RNA from mouse tdMEFs that were collected at day 0 (D0), day 4 (D4), day 8 (D8), and day 12 (D12) after M9 treatment, ciNSLCs, as well as two positive controls, including mouse primary embryonic neural progenitor cells and neural stem cell line SCR029, were used for library preparation and RNA-seq.
