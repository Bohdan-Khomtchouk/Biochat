TITLE
Profiling transcriptional and translational response to anoxia or hypoxia of genes in DNA damage response and repair pathways in human fibroblast and prostate cancer cells using NanoString nCounter.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of genes in DNA damage response and repair pathways differentially transcribed or translated under anoxia or hypoxia in GM05757 normal human fibroblast cells and DU145 human prostate cancer cells.

DESIGN
Comparison of mRNA abundance and translation efficiency of genes in DNA damage response and repair pathways in selected anoxia/hypoxia-treated cells with those in normoxia-treated controls.

PLATFORM
GPL17943 NanoString nCounter human DNA damage response and repair pathways platform
