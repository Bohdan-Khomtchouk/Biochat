TITLE
c-Jun promotes cell migration and drives expression of the motility factor ENPP2 in soft tissue sarcomas [array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix exon arrays to identify genes that were differentially expressed after c-Jun inhibition in LPS cell line with and with no Jun amplification.

DESIGN
We compared the consequences of c-Jun inhibition in LP6 (genomically c-Jun amplified) and LPS141 (non-amplified) DDLPS cells after Lentivrus modulation. We used lentivirus to deliver 2 control (shGFP, shNT) and 2 Jun (shJun1, shJun3) shRNAs and harvested total RNA on days 4 and 7 after infection, timepoints at which we observed maximum c-Jun inhibition by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting
