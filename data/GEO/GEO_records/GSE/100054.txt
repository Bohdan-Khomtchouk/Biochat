TITLE
Expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in normal controls and patients with Parkinson's disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Autophagy is a highly conserved degradation pathway whereby not only cytosolic components but also aberrant proteins are sequestered within double-membraned vesicles. Parkinson's disease (PD) is pathologically characterized by accumulation of  phosphorylated Î±-synuclein in the neuronal cytoplasm and its accumulation occurs in the peripheral autonomic nervous system as well as the central nervous system. In the brains of patients with PD, abnormal autophagy is known to occur and be involved with neurodegeneration. To investigate abnormal autophagy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the patients with PD, we performed whole transcriptome analysis of PBMC obtained from 9 normal controls and 10 patients with PD.

DESIGN
PBMC in 9 normal controls and 10 patients with PD were isolated by Ficoll-paque plus (GE Healthcare, 17144002) centrifugation of heparinized blood and frozen at -80 degrees Celsius until microarray or qRT-PCR.
