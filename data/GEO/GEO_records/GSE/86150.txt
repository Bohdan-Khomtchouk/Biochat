TITLE
Mapping of Long-Range Chromatin Interactions using Proximity Ligation Assisted ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report Proximity Ligation Assisted ChIP-sequencing (PLAC-seq), a method for comprehensive detection of long-range interactions associated with proteins of interest. PLAC-seq requires up to 500-fold less starting material compared to ChIA-PET and using experimentally determined input as control precisely reveals protein associated interaction upto single-element resolution. Application of PLAC-seq to mouse embryonic stem cells revealed a comprehensive map of regulatory interactions.

DESIGN
PLAC-seq experiments against H3k4me3 (2M cells), Pol2 (5M cells), H3k27ac (0.5M, 2.5M cells) and in situ Hi-C experiment in mouse embryonic stem cell (F123) PLAC-Seq data can be visualized at 3D Genome Browser (3dgenome.org)

PLATFORM
GPL21103 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)
