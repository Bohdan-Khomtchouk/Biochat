TITLE
Expression data from peritoneal macrophages stimulated with trehalose-6,6'-dimycolate (TDM)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle, Clec4e) is a pathogen sensor that recognizes pathogenic fungi and Mycobactrium tuberculosis. We perfomed microarray analysis using peritoneal macrophages stimulated with TDM, a mycobacterial cell wall glycolipid that is known to be a Mincle ligand. Many chemokine and cytokine genes were upregulated in wildtype macrophages stimulated with TDM. Upregulation of these genes were completely abolishd in Mincle KO macrophages.

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages from WT and Mincle KO mice were stimulated with TDM or vehicle for 24 h (3 samples each). Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0.
