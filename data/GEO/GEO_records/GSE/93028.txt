TITLE
Integration of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA reveals novel insights into reproductive regulation in honey bees

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
The present study is the first study to identify the involvement of mRNA, lncRNAs and miRNA in the ovary activation and oviposition regulation processes in honey-bee queens. mRNA, lncRNA and miRNA expresion profiles were examined in ovaries of virgin queens, egg-laying queens, egg-laying inhibited queens and egg-laying recovery queens.

DESIGN
To identify the involvement of mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs in the ovary activation and oviposition regulation processes in honey-bee queens, a total of four different ovaries samples were used in this study: (1) ovaries of virgin queens (n=3); (2) ovaries of egg-laying queens (n=3); (3) ovaries of egg-laying inhibited queens (n=3) (4) ovaries of egg-laying recovered queens (n=3). To sample the caged queens' ovaries, the queens were caged and placed in the original colony respectively for seven days. And at the end of the seventh day, ovaries samples were collected. To sample the recovered queens' ovaries, the queen was released after caged for seven days. And then, on the eighth day, the queen recovered to normal condition and laid eggs, and ovaries samples were collected. All the samples were collected immediately, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C.
