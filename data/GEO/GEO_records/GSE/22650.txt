TITLE
ChIP-chip from DmD8 cells with Twist antibodies after 30 minutes Notch activation

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Twist is a critical cooperating factor that confers transcriptional specificity to the Notch pathway in muscle progenitor cells (DmD8) ChIP analysis of Twi show that Twist binding is significantly enriched in Notch responsive region in DmD8 cells

DESIGN
3 replicates of Twist ChIP after30 min. Notch activation.
