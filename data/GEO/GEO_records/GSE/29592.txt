TITLE
The effect of Crem absence on gene expression in mouse adrenal glands.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CREM (cAMP responsive element modulator) together with CREB and ATF-1 belong to the CREB family of transcriptional factors, that respond to cyclic AMP signaling and bind to cAMP responsive element (CRE) sites in promoters of selected genes. CREM can produce isoforms that have either activating or repressing functions, depending on the transcription of specific exons. In adrenal glands it is involved in the regulation of expression of genes for steroid hormone synthesis. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from wild-type and Crem knock-out mouse adrenal glands.

DESIGN
2 condition experiment: 2 strains (WT, Crem-/-). 5 biological replications per condition.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
