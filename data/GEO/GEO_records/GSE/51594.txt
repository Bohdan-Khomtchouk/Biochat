TITLE
Expression data of human CD4 T cells with chronic or acute simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression profiles of a human CD4+ T-cell line 24 h after infection with a cell line of the same origin permanently releasing SIVmac251/32H. A new knowledge-based-network approach (Inter-Chain-Finder) was used to identify subnetworks leading to resistance to SIV-induced cell death. Notably, the method can identify not only differentially-expressed key hub genes but also non-differentially expressed, critical, ‘hidden’ regulators. 6 out of the 13 predicted major hidden key regulators were among the landscape of proteins known to interact with HIV. Several subnetworks were dysregulated upon chronic infection with SIV. Most prominently, factors engaged in early stages of viral infection were affected, e.g. entry,   integration and provirus transcription or cellular responses like apoptosis and proliferation.

DESIGN
Human CD4 T cells with different types of SIV infection were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix HG_U133A  microarrays.  Our aim is to identify subnetworks in T cells leading to resistance to SIV-induced cell death. To the end, we compared acute infection with chronic infection and mock control infection. Each pair (including three types of infection) was done in duplicate.
