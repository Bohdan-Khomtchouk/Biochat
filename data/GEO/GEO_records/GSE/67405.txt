TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To shed light on the molecular bases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia lacking known rearrangements (B-NEG ALL) and the differences between children and adults, we analyzed 168 B-NEG ALLs - including children, adolescents/young adults (AYA) and adults by genome-wide technologies, namely Next-generation sequencing and copy number aberration (CNA). Affymetrix SNP array analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from bone marrow sampled at diagnosis and paired germline DNA extracted from peripheral blood/bone marrow at complete remission or saliva.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays was performed for 13 B-NEG ALL samples and their paired normal (non-tumoral) DNA samples, included in the discovery panel, processed in the same experiment and deposited.
