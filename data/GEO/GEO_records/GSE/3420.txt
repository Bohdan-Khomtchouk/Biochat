TITLE
Effects of maternal vitamin A administration on the transcriptional profile of rat ductus arteriosus

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The effects of retinoic acid/vitamin A signal on the transcriptional profile of the ductus arteriosus during development were examined. Keywords: time course, development, response to a nutritional agent

DESIGN
Total RNA samples were isolated from pooled tissues obtained from Wister rat embryos on embryonic day 19 and 21, and from neonates on the day of birth (n > =120).  The RNA was converted to biotin-labeled cRNA, which was hybridized to Affymetrix RG_U34A microarray.  The hybridization experiments were performed in duplicate.
