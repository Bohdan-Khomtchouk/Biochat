TITLE
A blood RNA signature for predicting the treatment outcome in the Tuberculosis Treatment Response Cohort

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of blood biomarkers that prospectively predict Mycobacterium tuberculosis treatment response.

DESIGN
There are a total of 914 samples used in this design. This involves samples from 100 cases and 38 controls. Most of the samples have 2 technical replicates where as 2 samples have 4. Samples from the TB cases have been collected on the start day of TB treatment and on 1,4 and 24 weeks after treatment as well. For some subjects we also have samples after the subject has been cured. The case or TB Subjects have been categorized by the nature of their response as definite,probable or possible cure. The day of cure is presented in the time to negativity column. Also provided in the metadata are the MGIT -Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube and XPERT (cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test, automated diagnostic test that can identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)) values at the various times of sample collection for all TB Subjects.
