TITLE
The Transposon Insertion site Profiling Chip (TIP-chip)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We have developed a microarray intended for use in finding all transposons in a region of interest. By selectively amplifying and hybridizing transposon flanking DNA to our array, we can localize all transposons in the region present on our TIP-chip, a dense tiling array. We have tested our technology in yeast and have been successful. Keywords: transposon insertion profiling, genomic DNA, yeast

DESIGN
The two FY2 hybridizations are technical replicates and serve as a benchmark -- we compared these results to the published S288C sequence. The two GRF167 samples are also technical replicates and these are the base strain for the L27-10 hybridizations, and therefore serve as controls for those hybridizations. The three L27-10 hybridizations are all technical replicates.
