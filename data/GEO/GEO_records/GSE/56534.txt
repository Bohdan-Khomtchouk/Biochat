TITLE
Infection of macrophages by Toxoplasma Progeny from a Type II x Type III cross

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Infection of RAW264.7 cells for 24 hours with 32 Toxoplasma Progeny from a Type II x Type III cross To measure changes in gene expression induced in macropahges upon Toxoplasma infection, we infected RAW 264.7 macrophages in cell culture with one of 32 Toxoplasma parasite progeny from a Type II x Type III cross. RNA was harvested 24 hours post infection.

DESIGN
Cells were infected with Toxoplasma parasites, in vitro
