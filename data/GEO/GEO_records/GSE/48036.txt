TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of influenza A virus infected cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Small RNAs were profiled during influenza A virus infection of human A549 cells to identify changes in microRNA abundance during the cellular antiviral response.

DESIGN
Examination of microRNA abundance during influenza A virus infection.
