TITLE
Small non-coding RNA contents in preeclamptic and normotensive trophobalst debris

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Small RNA sequencing on trophoblast debris samples was employed to profile the small RNA contents in either normotensive or preeclamptic trophoblast debris. We have identified 1278 miRNAs and 2646 non-miRNA small RNA fragments across all trophoblast debris samples. Differential expression analysis was executed by iSRAP small RNA sequencing analysis pipeline and we identified 16 miRNAs, 5 tRNA fragments from 3 different tRNAs, 13 snRNA fragments and 85 rRNA fragments differentially contained between preeclamptic and normotensive trophoblast debris

DESIGN
Trophblast debris isolated from four individual preeclamptic placentae and four gestational matched normotensive placentae

PLATFORM
