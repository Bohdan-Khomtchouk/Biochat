TITLE
Microarray assay of the genetic response of Picea abies to Heterobasidion annosum infection - Loop2

ORGANISM
Pinus taeda

SUMMARY
The hypothesis of the experiment is that infected trees of high resistance express a wider variety of resistance genes than infected trees of low resistance, and that the level of expression of these resistance genes differs between infected and healthy branches. Also, some genes highly expressed in the infected state not expressed in the healthy state may be in response to the wounding rather than the actual infection. By comparing these expressions to that of wounded, uninfected branches, this could also be clarified. Keywords: stress response
