TITLE
Cyclin-dependent kinases are regulators and effectors of oscillations driven by a transcription factor network

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast cell cycle transcription dynamics in two S. cerevisae strains grown at 37Â°C: BF264-15DU (MATa ade1 his2 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3Dns, bar1) (wild type) and a mutant of the wild type strain lacking all Cdk1 activity, cdc28-4. We compared transcript levels of genes previously shown to be periodically expressed in wild-type cells (Orlando et al, 2008, Nature) to transcript levels in the absence of Cdk1 activity.

DESIGN
Two replicate time courses from cells lacking all Cdk1 activity and one control time course from cells with wild-type Cdk1 activity are included.
