TITLE
Genomic Analysis of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Reveals TME-based Subtypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed an integrated genomic analysis of NPC using a large clinical cohort of treatment-na√Øve tumor specimens which identified three gene expression-based subtypes differing in their pattern of immune and stromal gene expression.

DESIGN
mRNA-sequencing to quantify genome-wide transcript levels in 113 fresh, treatment-naive undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma tumors.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
