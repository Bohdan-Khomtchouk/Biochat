TITLE
Psh1-mediated Proteolysis Prevents the Budding Yeast   Centromeric Histone Variant from Mislocalizing to Promoter Nucleosomes [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Precise localization of the histone H3 variant CENP-A(Cse4) to centromeres is essential for accurate chromosome segregation. In budding yeast, CENP-A(Cse4) is regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis to ensure its exclusive localization to the centromere. Overexpression of CENP-A(Cse4) is lethal when the CENP-A(Cse4) E3 ubiquitin ligase, Psh1, is deleted. CENP-A(Cse4) mislocalizes to promoters in this condition, so we investigated if there was an effect on gene expression of downstream genes using RNA-seq.

DESIGN
RNA-seq from two or three biological replicates each, at t0 and t2 hours after adding galactose for each of 6 experimental genotypes.
