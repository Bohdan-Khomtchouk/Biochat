TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of FSS1-dependent genes in Fusarium graminearum Z-3639

ORGANISM
Fusarium graminearum

SUMMARY
Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae) is a prominent pathogen that infects major cereal crops, such as wheat, barley, and maize. FSS1 contains a Zn(II)2Cys6 fungal-type DNA-binding domain and localized exclusively to nuclei responding to sodium, suggesting that FSS1 is a TF required for sodium tolerance. By RNA-seq and genetic studies, we found a P-type ATPase pump (FgENA5) that is under control of FSS1 and is responsible for phenotypic defects of fss1 mutants. The wild-type, fss1 deletion, fss1 overexpression mutant strains were incubated in potato dextrose broth (PDB) with or without 1 M NaCl supplementation for an hour.

DESIGN
6 samples examined: 1 h after inoculation of Fusarium graminearum wild-type, Δfss1(Δfss1::gen), and fss1 overexpression mutant (fss1::gen-Pef1a-fss1) strains in potato dextrose broth with or without 1 M NaCl supplementation
