TITLE
Human hematopoietic stem cell engraftment in goat

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Capra hircus

SUMMARY
Robust human-goat chimerism was achieved by transplanting human CD34+Lin- cord blood cells into fetal goats. We observed a broad distribution of GFP-marked human cells in non-hematopoietic organs including kidney, muscle, lung, and heart of transplant goats.  Various marker techniques indicated that human genes were expressed in chimeric livers and blood. Keywords: other
