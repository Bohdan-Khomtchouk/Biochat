TITLE
Expression data from transfection of U87 glioma cells with miR-376a* for 72 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Several biological pathways can be under the regulation of miRNAs. These pathways can be indentified by the enforced expression of a miRNA and analysing the expression data for enrichment of specific pathways represented among the genes differentially expressed upon miRNA overexpression. We transfected unedited miR-376a* (376a*A) and edited miR-376a* (376a*G) into U87 cells to identify differentially regulated transcripts. List of differentially expressed genes were subject to pathway enrichment analysis to identify specific biological processes regulated by each of miR-376a*A and miR-376a*G.

DESIGN
U87 cells (100,000) were transfected with 50 nM of miR-376a*A, miR-376a*G or miR-control. Following incubation for 72 hours, total RNA was isolated from transfected cells. For each (miR-376a*A or miR-376a*G), genes differentially expressed upon miRNA transfection were determined based on comparison with miR-control-transfected samples. Biological triplicates were used for each sample type.
