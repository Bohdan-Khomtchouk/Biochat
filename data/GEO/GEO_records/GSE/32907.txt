TITLE
Beta-catenin Controls Metastasis in Braf-activated Pten-inactivated Melanomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Malignant melanoma is characterized by frequent metastasis, however specific changes that regulate this process have not been clearly delineated. Although it is well known that Wnt signaling is frequently dysregulated in melanoma, the functional implications of this observation are unclear. By modulating beta-catenin levels in a mouse model of melanoma that is based on melanocyte-specific Pten loss and BrafV600E mutation, we demonstrate that beta-catenin is a central mediator of melanoma metastasis to lymph node and lung. In addition to altering metastasis, beta-catenin levels control tumor differentiation and regulate both MAPK/Erk and PI3K/Akt signaling. Highly metastatic tumors with beta-catenin stabilization are very similar to a subset of human melanomas; together these findings establish Wnt signaling as a metastasis regulator in melanoma.

DESIGN
MoGene-1_0-st-v1: Four samples total. Two biological replicates of uncultured Pten/Braf murine melanomas and two biological replicates of uncultured Pten/Braf/Bcat-STA murine melanomas. MoEx-1_0-st-v1: Two samples total. Dissociated tumor and FACS-enriched Pten/Braf and Pten/Braf/Bcat-STA murine melanoma.
