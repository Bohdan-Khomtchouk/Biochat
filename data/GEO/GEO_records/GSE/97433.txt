TITLE
An arrayed CRISPR library for individual, combinatorial and multiplexed gene knockout III

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have combined a machine-learning approach with other strategies to optimize the efficiency of sgRNAs for CRISPR screens and have constructed a genome-wide, sequence-verified, arrayed CRISPR library.  This incorporates expression strategies to facilitate multiplexed or combinatorial screening.  By conducting parallel loss-of-function screens, we compare our approach to existing sgRNA design and expression strategies.

DESIGN
High throughput sequencing was performed to identify CRISPR/Cas9 induced genomic scars at olfactory receptor loci.
