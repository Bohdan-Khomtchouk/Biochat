TITLE
Measuring signaling and RNA-Seq in the same cell links gene expression to dynamic patterns of NF-κB activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We measure translocation dynamics of NF-κB and perform single-cell RNA-sequencing in the same individual cell. We use this data to identify genes that are responsive to the dynamics of NF-κB activation

DESIGN
Single-cell RNA sequencing libraries (Smart-Seq2) for ~800 RAW 264.7 cells across 10 libraries are given. Cells were stimulated with LPS on a fluidigm C1 chip - data for both stimulated and unstimulated (control) cells are provided.

PLATFORM
GPL16417 Illumina MiSeq (Mus musculus)
