TITLE
Expression analysis of human melanoma short-term culture WM451-Lu harvested after lentiviral infection with a GFP (control) or SETDB1 (experimental) viral vector

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of expression differences induced by expression of the histone methyltransferase SETDB1 in human melanoma short-term culture WM451-Lu.

DESIGN
A six-chip study using total RNA prepared from WM451-Lu melanoma short-term cultures infected with either a lentivirus encoding GFP (control) or SETDB1. Cells were allowed to grow for 2 days post-infection.
