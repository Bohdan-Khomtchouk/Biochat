TITLE
SAGA Is a General Cofactor for RNA Polymerase II Transcription

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The SAGA co-activator has been implicated in the regulation of a smal subset of genes in budding yeast in transcriptomic analyses performed in steady-state levels of RNA. We used microarrays to analyse newly-synthesized RNA in several mutants for the SAGA complex to disclose and readdress the impact of this complex in RNA Polymerase II transcription.

DESIGN
Newly-transcribed RNA in wild-type and mutant strains lacking diverse SAGA subunits were labeled using 4-thiouracil. Mutants were chosen according to its impact on SAGA activity in order to have a diverse representativity of the whole complex and its distinct funtions.
