TITLE
Analysis of Ets1 bound regions using ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ets1-/- mice have an increase in B cell differentiation to plasma cells and increased serum immunoglobulin levels. The genes in B cells that are transcriptionally regulated by Ets1 and help regulate B cell differentiation are largely unknown. Here, we identify Ets1-regulated target genes in B cells using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis. We found that Ets1 targets  genes associated with immune response, mature B cell differentiation and regulation of B cell activation.

DESIGN
Splenic purified B cells from wild type mice were used for ChIP-seq

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
