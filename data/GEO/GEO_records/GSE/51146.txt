TITLE
The gene expression profiling of human Glioblastoma multiforme and normal brain tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate the whole genome gene expression level changes of LncRNAs in human Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and normal brain tissues, and try to find out some LncRNA associated with the tumorigenesis of GBM.

DESIGN
The human LncRNA microarray analysis of 10 samples (5 GBM and 5 normal brain tissues) were completed. Total RNA from each sample was quantified and RNA integrity was assessed using standard denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Total RNA of each sample was used for labeling and array hybridization. Array scanning using the Agilent Scanner G250C. Scanned images were then imported into NimbleScan software (version 2.5) for expression data analysis. Differentially expressed LncRNAs were filtered out for further study.
