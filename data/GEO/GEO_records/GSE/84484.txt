TITLE
Expression and alternative splicing data of cartilage endplate-derived stem cells (CESCs) under hypoxia or normoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cartilage endplate-derived stem cells (CESCs) with chondro-osteogenic differentiation capacity may be responsible for the balance of chondrification and ossification in cartilage endplate (CEP). CEP is an avascular and hypoxic tissue, and hypoxia could influence the fate of CESCs. We used high-throughput scanning to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and alternatively spliced genes (ASGs) of CESCs under hypoxia compared to those under normoxia.

DESIGN
Human cartilage endplate-derived stem cells (CESCs) were cultured under normoxia and hypoxia for 21 days respectively.
