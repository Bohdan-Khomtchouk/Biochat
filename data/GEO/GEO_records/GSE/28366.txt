TITLE
SNP data from genomic DNA from a subject, fibroblasts, iPSCs and neurons with four copies of SNCA, and genomic DNA from an unaffected first degree relative and equivalent cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A major barrier to research on Parkinson’s disease (PD) is inaccessibility of diseased tissue for study. One solution is to derive induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with PD and differentiate them into neurons affected by disease. We created an iPSC model of PD caused by triplication of SNCA encoding α-synuclein. α-Synuclein dysfunction is common to all forms of PD, and SNCA triplication leads to fully penetrant familial PD with accelerated pathogenesis. After differentiation of iPSCs into neurons enriched for midbrain dopaminergic subtypes, those from the patient contain double α-synuclein protein compared to those from an unaffected relative, precisely recapitulating the cause of PD in these individuals. A measurable biomarker makes this model ideal for drug screening for compounds that reduce levels of α-synuclein, and for mechanistic experiments to study PD pathogenesis. This SNP microarray study was carried out to confirm presence of SNCA triplication in the affected subject and the derived cell lines.

DESIGN
11 samples were analysed: genomic DNA from the two subjects in the study, the two parent fibroblast lines (AST denoting alpha-synuclein triplication and NAS denoting normal alpha-synuclein), two iPSC lines from each parent fibroblast line (four in total), a human embryonic stem cell line (SHEF4) and two neuronal samples one each from AST and NAS iPSCs).
