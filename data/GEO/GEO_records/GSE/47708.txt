TITLE
Genome wide expression analysis of Ctbp2 knock down mouse F9 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using an RNA interference-based genetic screen in mouse F9 cells we identify the transcriptional corepressor CTBP2 as a coactivator critically required for retinoic acid (RA)-induced transcription. Here we perfom a whole genome transcriptome analysis in F9 cells expressing shRNA for Ctbp2 and Rxr in the absence or presence of retinoic acid (RA). A total of 2,754 genes were found to be upregulated ( > 2 fold) and 1518 genes were downregulated ( > 2 fold) in response to RA treatment in the control cells. We find that around 52% and 55% of upregulated genes are dependent on Ctbp2 and Rxr for activation respectively suggesting that Ctbp2 is a coactivator of RA signaling.

DESIGN
Whole genome RNA-sequencing in F9 cells expressing shGFP or shCtbp2 or shRxr
