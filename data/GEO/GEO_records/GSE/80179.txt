TITLE
A simple screening approach to prioritize genes for functional analysis identifies a role for IRF7 in the control of RSV disease.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of transcriptional profiles in children < 17 years of age with RSV infection and healthy controls

DESIGN
Patients with RSV were recruited at or after presentation to hospital. Main inclusion criteria were presence of illness of sufficient severity to warrant blood tests for clinical reasons, in child aged < 17 years. All patients had an illness consistent with RSV infection, with microbiological findings to match. Blood was collected into PAX gene tubes (PreAnalytiX). Total RNA integrity was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). Labeled cRNA was hybridized to Illumina Human HT-12 v4 Beadchips. Numbers of arrays analysed were as follows: RSV infection (n=27), Healthy controls (n=52).
