TITLE
Search for Meis1 target genes in embryonic sympathetic neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To uncover Meis1 functions during the embryonic development of sympathetic neurons, we perfomed a ChIP-seq analysis from mouse E16 embryonic superior cervical ganglia (SCG) using an antibody against Meis1. We identified 309 potential target genes with a particular enrichment in genes involved in vesicles formation, function and trafficking, leading to the hypothesis that Meis1 participate in late sympathetic neurons differentiation by coordinating target-field innervation, synaptogenesis and survival through the transcriptional control of the machinery necessary for endocytosis and exocytosis. We further confirmed that the expression of some of these genes was lost and/or modified in E16 SCGs of a HtPACRE/Meis1LoxP/LoxP mouse strain compared to wild type littermates. We additionaly confirmed that endocytosis and synaptogenesis is impaired in those mutants.
