TITLE
Expression profiling of Ovine Herpesvirus 2-infected lymph nodes from Bos taurus

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that the gene expression pattern of OvHV-2 may be important to understand the pathogenesis of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF). Therefore, RNA was extracted from lymph nodes of animals with MCF and healthy controls to be analyzed by a custom-made microarray. Two regions on the viral genome were transcriptionally active, one encoding a homologue to the latency-associated nuclear antigen (ORF73) of other gamma herpesviruses, the other with no predicted open reading frame. Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
Two biological replicates with two technical replicates each, with one of the technical replicates being a dye-swap.

PLATFORM
GPL7746 OvHV-2 Agilent custom 10K microarray
