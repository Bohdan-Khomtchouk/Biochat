TITLE
MITF and BRN2 contribute to metastatic growth after dissemination of melanoma.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Melanoma tumors are highly heterogeneous, comprising of different cell types that vary in their potential for growth and invasion.  Heterogeneous expression of the Microphthalmia-associated Transcription Factor (MITF) and the POU domain transcription factor BRN2 (POU3F2) has been found in malignant melanoma.  Changing expression of these transcription factors as the disease progresses has been linked to the metastatic mechanism of phenotype switching.  We therefore investigated the effects of MITF and BRN2 expression in melanoma growth and metastasis.  Depletion of MITF resulted in a cell population that had a slowed cell cycle progression, was less invasive in vitro and had hindered tumor and metastasis forming ability in mouse xenograft studies.  BRN2 depletion left a cell population with intact proliferation and invasion in vitro; however metastatic growth was significantly reduced in the mouse xenograft model.  These results suggest that the proliferative population within melanoma tumors express MITF, and both MITF and BRN2 are important for metastatic growth in vivo.  This finding highlights the importance of BRN2 and MITF expression in development of melanoma metastasis.
