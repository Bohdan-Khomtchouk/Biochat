TITLE
Graded Expression of IRF4 Coordinates Isotype Switching with Plasma Cell Differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Determine irf4 target genes in mouse B cells undergoing LPS differentiation to plasma cells in vitro. Determine targets of IRF4 by overexpression in a human GCB cell line. Keywords: cell type comparison design

DESIGN
Mouse lymphochip arrays consisted of a reference pool vs mouse Irf4+/- and mouse Irf4-/- samples. Human lymphochip arrays consisted of non-transduced vs IRF-4-transduced human cell line Oci-Ly7. Design included biological repeats at each time point. Only data from sequence-verified features were published. The mouse lymphochip consists of 701 confirmed features.
