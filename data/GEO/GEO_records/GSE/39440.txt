TITLE
microRNA Profiling in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a microRNA (miRNA) microarray on 10 metastatic RCC tumors and compared differential miRNA expresison to 19 primary clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC). We found there were 65 significantly dysregulated miRNAs; 9 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and 56 miRNAs were significantly downregulated in metastatic RCC when compared to primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

DESIGN
miRNA microarray was performed on 10 metastatic RCC tumors
