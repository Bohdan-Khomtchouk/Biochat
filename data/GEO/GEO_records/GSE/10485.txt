TITLE
Analysis of Potato Smooth Skin Mutant Susceptible to Powdery Scab Disease

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Russet Nugget and the corresponding smooth skin mutant tubers harvested from disease and healthy filed plots. Tubers were washed with 10% Clorox and dried before harvesting tissue. Cortex and peel tissue was collected from healthy and infected regions of the mutant. Healthy peel and cortex tissue was collected from Russet Nugget (wild-type) potato tuber and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 Â°C. RNA was extracted from frozen tissues using a hot phenol method in triplicate from the different sets of tuber tissue. Extracted RNA was purified by Qiagen kits after treatment with DNAse. In all of these experiments RNA from Russet Nugget peel and cortex tissue will be used as reference samples where as mutant tissue will be used as query samples. Keywords: Direct comparison
