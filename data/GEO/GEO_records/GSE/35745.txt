TITLE
Expression analysis with Phospholipase C over expression

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae through cis-acting upstream activating sequence inositol (UASino) and trans-acting elements, such as the INO2-INO4 complex and OPI1 by inositol supplementation in growth is thoroughly studied. In this study, we provide evidence for the regulation of lipid biosynthesis by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC) through UASino and two trans-acting elements. Gene expression analysis and radiolabelling experiments demonstrated that the overexpression of rice PLC in yeast cells altered phospholipid biosynthesis at the levels of transcriptional and enzyme activity.

DESIGN
There are two biological replicates two hour and five hour induction with galactose. The genome wide expression of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4741 harbouring (rice) rPLC-pYES2  and a vectro control (pYES2) were compare with each other.
