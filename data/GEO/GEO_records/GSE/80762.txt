TITLE
Genomics of decitabine responses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global DNA methylation was analyzed in total bone marrow cells of AML/MDS patients undergoing decitabine treatment.

DESIGN
Patients with AML or MDS were treated with decitabine 20 mg/m2/day on days 1-10. Bone marrow samples were collected on day 0 and day 10. DNA was generated from total bone marrow cells, and analyzed for changes in methylation.
