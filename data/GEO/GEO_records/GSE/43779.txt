TITLE
Expression data from 2-amino acetophenone (2-AA) treated mouse Skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Metabolic responses begin promptly upon the initiation of infection, and progress as a series of coordinated events. Mitochondria may play a key role in the development of insulin resistance. Reduced energy production and mitochondrial dysfunctional may further favor infection, and be an important step in the establishment of chronic and persistent infections. We have used mouse skeletal muscle transcriptome data which have led to the hypothesis that 2-AA causes harm to the host by triggering mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle.

DESIGN
The gastrocnemius muscles were isolated from control and 4days 2-AA treated mouse for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
