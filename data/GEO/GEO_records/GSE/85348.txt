TITLE
Vulnerability of Purkinje cells induced from spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 patient-derived iPS cells [2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. It is known to be caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in CACNA1A, the gene that encodes Cav2.1, Î±1A subunit of P/Q-type calcium channel. However, the pathogenic mechanism and effective therapeutic treatments are still unknown. Here we have succeeded in generation of mature Purkinje cells that carry the patient genes by combining patient-derived iPS cell and self-organizing culture technologies. Patient-derived Purkinje cells exhibited upregulation of whole Cav2.1 protein while downregulation of its C-terminal fragment and the transcriptional targets TAF1 and BTG1. We further demonstrate that patient Purkinje cells exhibit thyroid hormone depletion-dependent degeneration, which can be suppressed by two compounds, thyroid releasing hormone and Riluzole. Thus we have constructed an in vitro disease model recapitulating both ontogenesis and pathogenesis. This model would be useful for pathogenic investigation and drug screening
