TITLE
Impact of endurance training in MHC-I over-expressed Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myosine heavy chain I was overexpressed in mouse skeletal muscle. The transgenic mice, as well as the wild type mice, were endurance trained on treadmill for 5 days/week over  8 weeks at 80% peak aerobic capacity in comparison with untrained mice. The gene expression profiles of the skeletal muscles from wild-type trained (WTT) and untrained (WTUT), and transgenic trained (TGT) and untrained (TGUT) were measured using Affymetrix Mouse430A 2.0 GeneChips. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
There were 5 WTT, 5 WTUT, 5 TGT, and 5 TGUT mice used in microarray studies.
