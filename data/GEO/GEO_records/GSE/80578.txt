ppmax2 response to gr24-Strigopath/Physcomitrella patens

ORGANISM
Physcomitrella patens

SUMMARY
4plex_physco_2014-05 - ppmax2 response to gr24 - How does the Ppmax2 moss mutant respond to Strigolactone (GR24)?  - Two moss genotypes are used: WT and the Ppmax2 mutant. Moss tissues are fragmented, then plated on medium (Petri dish with cellophane disks) and cultivated for 3 weeks. Moss tissues are then transfered for 6 hours on acetone-containing medium (control treatment, for WT and Ppmax2) or GR24 (1 microM, in acetone)-containing medium (for Ppmax2). After 6 hours, the moss tissues are collected, quickly forzen in liquid nitrogen. RNA are isolated using the Quiagen RNeasy Plant mini kit (including a RNase-free DNase treatment on column). Two similar experiments (T1 and T2) have been led.
