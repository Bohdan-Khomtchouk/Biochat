TITLE
Analysis of the molecular dialogue between Botrytis cinerea and Vitis vinifera reveals a clear shift in defence mechanisms during berry ripening.

ORGANISM
Botrytis cinerea

SUMMARY
Full transcriptomes of the Botrytis cinerea wild-type strain B0510 inoculated on mature grapevine berries (Marselan cultivar) at 16h, 24h, 48h, and in vitro were compared to identify B. cinerea genes diffentially expressed during the infection stages.
