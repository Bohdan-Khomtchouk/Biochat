TITLE
Analysis of the molecular dialogue between Botrytis cinerea and Vitis vinifera reveals a clear shift in defence mechanisms during berry ripening.

ORGANISM
Botrytis cinerea B05.10

SUMMARY
Full transcriptomes of the Botrytis cinerea wild-type strain B0510 inoculated on mature grapevine berries (Marselan cultivar) at 16h, 24h, 48h, and in vitro were compared to identify B. cinerea genes diffentially expressed during the infection stages.

DESIGN
Grapevine berries were inoculated with Botrytis cinerea conidia and samples were taken at 16h, 24h and 48 hours post-inoculation. An additional control sample corresponding to mycelium growing on static liquid minimal medium was included in the experimental design in order to identify genes that would be differentially expressed between in vitro and in planta growth conditions. 3-4 replicates were performed. The 13 total-RNA samples were used for hybridization on NimbleGen 4plex gene expression arrays (20,885 gene models from Botrytis cinerea with three 60-mer probes per gene).
