TITLE
Gene expression profiles reveal the effect of a high-fat diet in brown fat development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-scale analysis of the genetic factors that govern the development of white and brown adipose tissue is still far from complete. In order to identify the key genes that regulate the development of white and brown adipose tissue in mice, the transcriptome analysis was performed on adipose tissues

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from interscapular brown adipose tissue of C57BL/6J mice fed normal diet or high fat diet for 2, 4, 8, 20 and 24 weeks
