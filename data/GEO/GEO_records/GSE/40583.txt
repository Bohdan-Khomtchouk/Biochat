TITLE
FAT1 knockdown in immortalized astrocyte and glioma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The FAT1 gene was knocked down using 2 independent siRNAs, in immortalized human astrocytes and U87 and U251 glioma cell lines. A non-targeted scramble siRNA was used as a control.

DESIGN
Scramble, FAT1 siRNA#1 and FAT1 siRNA#2 were transfected into each cell line, in duplicate, and RNA analyzed using the Affymetrix U133A 2.0 platform.
