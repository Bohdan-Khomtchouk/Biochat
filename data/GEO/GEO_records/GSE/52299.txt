TITLE
Small RNA next generation sequencing of mice skin biopsies from acetone-treated healthy skins and DMBA/PMA-treated hyperplastic skins, papillomas and cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FVB/N mice were subjected to 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) two-hit multistage skin carcinogenesis protocol. Mice were topically treated with 200 nmol of DMBA in 0.2 mL acetone then twice weekly for six weeks with 5 nmol PMA (Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate). A second hit of DMBA was performed on the eighth week followed by the resumption of PMA treatment for 14 more weeks. Control mice were only topically treated with 0.2 mL acetone vehicle. Healthy skins (acetone-treated), hyperplastic skins, papillomas and tumors were harvested throughout the protocol and biopsies were frozen for RNA extraction.

DESIGN
Small RNA libraries were generated from total RNAs of control skins, hyperplastic skins, papillomas and cSCCs biopsies (n=5 in each group) corresponding to a total of 20 samples, and sequenced on the Applied Biosystems SOLiD System.
