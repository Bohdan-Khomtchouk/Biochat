TITLE
mRNA profiling of liver-specific RORa KO mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor a (RORa) is a member of the NR1 subfamily of orphan nuclear hormone receptors. RORa is an important regulator of various biological processes, including cerebellum development, cancer and circadian rhythm. To determine molecular mechanism by which hepatic deletion of RORa induces obesity and insulin resistance, we performed global transcriptome analysis from high-fat diet (HFD)-fed RORa f/f and RORa LKO mouse liver tissues. This analysis provides insight into molecular mechanisms for RORa in high-fat-diet condition.

DESIGN
mRNA expression profiles of RORa f/f and RORa LKO mice liver with control diet or high-fat-diet were examined by Illumina HiSeq 2500.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
