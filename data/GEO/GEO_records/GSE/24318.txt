TITLE
seq-WA30534819_H3K4me3_N2_MXemb

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_3169 We analyzed H3 lysine 4 trimethylation levels in the C. elegans genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by Illumina sequencing. We used wild type (N2) mixed developmental stage embryos and performed the experiment in two biological replicates.

DESIGN
This series consists of two biological replicates of H3K4me3 ChIP-seq experiments and their input sequences. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf
