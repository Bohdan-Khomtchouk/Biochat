TITLE
The cohesin loader Scc2 regulates key regulatory genes critical for development

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741

SUMMARY
The evolutionarily conserved cohesin complex is crucial for holding sister chromatids together from the time of DNA replication until their segregation during the metaphase to anaphase transition. Human diseases associated with with mutations in the cohesin network are termed " cohesinopathies " . Scc2 is required for loading cohesin onto DNA prior to DNA replication. Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a developmental disorder characterized by growth and intellectual impairment is caused by mutations in Scc2. How mutations in Scc2 gives rise to these developmental defects is currently unknown, as overt defects in chromosome segregation are not observed in CdLS patients.This has led to the hypothesis that developmental disorders in CdLS patients are a result of dysregulated gene expression. To examine the transcriptional program of Scc2 mutants called scc2-4, RNA sequencing was performed. Analysis of gene expression program shows upregulation of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and downregulation of genes needed for oxidative phosphorylation. Studies are currently underway to investigate how scc2-4 mutation causes gene misregulation. The answer(s) could provide insight into the molecular etiology of CdLS.
