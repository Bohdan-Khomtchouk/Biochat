TITLE
Genome-Wide Binding of Ehf in mouse corneal epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cornea, composed of epithelium, stroma and endothelium, protects the anterior compartment of the eye from damage and allows transmission of light into the eye.  While well described morphologically, no studies have investigated the global gene expression changes in the cornea throughout the mouse’s life.   We characterized the global gene expression profile of mouse cornea from early development through aging, and compared to gene expression in other epithelial tissue, to identify cornea enriched genes, pathways, and transcriptional regulators.  We identified Ehf, an ets family transcription factor, as being highly selectively expressed in the corneal epithelium compared to the stroma, and highly expressed in cornea compared to other epithelial tissues. siRNA experiments and Ehf ChIP-Seq on mouse corneal epithelium confirm the role of this factor in promoting epithelial identity and cell differentiation, and suggest it carries out these functions through interactions with other cornea epithelial differentiation factors including Klf4.

DESIGN
Whole eye globes were dissected from wild type CB6 mice.  Corneal epithelium was isolated by digestion in 50% EMEM/dispase II with 50 mM sorbitol for two hours at 37°C. ChIP was performed with an Ehf antibody, and was sequenced with an input control.
