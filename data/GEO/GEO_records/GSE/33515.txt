TITLE
Roles for ATF6-regulated miRNAs in the ER stress response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We wished to determine the effects of activating the transcription factor, ATF6, on global miRNA expression. We utilized transgenic mice with a conditionally tamoxien-responsive form of ATF6 and assessed cardiac lysates from NTG and TG mice, both treated with tamoxifen and untreated, in order to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. We then focused on miRNAs of interest as well as the genes they are predicted to regulate.
