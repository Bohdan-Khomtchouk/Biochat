TITLE
Regulation of nucleosome positioning by a CHD Type III chromatin remodeller and its relationship to developmental gene expression in Dictyostelium [MNase-seq]

ORGANISM
Dictyostelium discoideum

SUMMARY
We utilized MNase-seq to profile nucleosome positions in wild type (Ax2) and ChdC null cells both in growing cells and a partially developed state (loose-mound) to study changes in nucleosome positioning and occupancy during development and the impact the deletion of ChdC an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller has on nucleosome positioning and occupancy. As a control for MNase sequence bias we also digested naked DNA with MNase.

DESIGN
Studying nucleosome positions in wild type and ChdC mutant cells
