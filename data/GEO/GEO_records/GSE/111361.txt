TITLE
Chip-SIP analysis of Pacifica pier surface waters incubated with organic and inorganic nitrogen and carbon substrates

ORGANISM
Bacteria

SUMMARY
October 2010 surface seawater collected from Pacifica pier was incubated with 14 different substrates for 12 hours. Community RNA was extracted and hybridized to a Roche Nimblegen microarray and analyzed by NanoSIMS to obtain isotope ratio data for all probe spots.

DESIGN
Three Chips for fluorescence, and 14 Chips for different substrates from samples incubated for 12 hours.
