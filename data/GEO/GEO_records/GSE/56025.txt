TITLE
The impact of calorie restriction and diet-induced obesity on microRNA expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the impact of calorie restriction and diet-induced obesity on expression of microRNAs in the mouse colon.  For this analysis, data was LOESS normalized in R.  Data was then imported into BRB Array for analysis. We identified microRNAs that were altered in response to calorie-restriction and diet-induced obesity

DESIGN
Total mRNA was extracted from mouse colon tissue that was flash frozen immediately after euthaniasia.  A total of 6 colons per the three groups were used for microarray analysis.  Briefly, 5 ug of RNA were biotin labeled and hybridized to OSU-CCC microRNA microarrays version 4.0.  We then analyzed differences in expression with BRB Array.

PLATFORM
GPL13716 OSU-CCC Human and Mouse MicroRNA Microarray Version 4.0
