TITLE
Large scale sequencing of PSTVd-RG1 sRNA in tomato plants

ORGANISM
Potato spindle tuber viroid

SUMMARY
In order to analyze the production of small RNA (sRNA) by Potato spindle tuber viroid- RG1 strain (PSTVd-RG1) upon infecting the plants, the tomato plants (Lycopersicum esculentum cv. Rutgers) were inoculated with the PSTVd-RG1. After 21-days of post inoculation, total RNA was extracted and subjected for deep-sequencing using Illumina MiSeq platform. The primers were trimmed and the 21- to 24-nt long small RNA species were filtered after quality check of the raw data.

DESIGN
Examination for the production of viroid specific small RNA by PSTVd-RG1 upon infection in tomato plants.

PLATFORM
GPL20595 Illumina MiSeq (Potato spindle tuber viroid)
