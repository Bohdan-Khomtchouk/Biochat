TITLE
Chromatin landscape of progenitor motor neurons [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Progenitor motor neurons can be generated with high-efficiency by differentiating ES cells in vitro in the presence of retinoic acid and hedgehog signalling. Here, we characterize the chromatin landscape associated with progenitor motor neurons (pMNs) in order to assess how histone modification domains shift during the differentiation process.

DESIGN
In this study, we characterize the genomic occupancy of H3K27me3, H3K4me3, H3K79me2 and Pol2 using ChIP-seq in progenitor motor neurons that have been differentiated in vitro from ES cells. An appropriate whole-cell extract control experiment for these ChIP-seq experiments is also included.
