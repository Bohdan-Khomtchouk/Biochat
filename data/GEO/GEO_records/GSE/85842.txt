TITLE
The Long Noncoding RNA SNHG1 Regulates both the Local and Distal Genes in Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Increasing evidence indicates that lncRNAs play important roles in various physiological processes and dysfunction of lncRNAs could be a prevalent cause in human diseases. Here, we functionally characterized the nuclear-enriched lncRNA SNHG1, which is highly expressed in multiple types of cancer. We also provide evidence that SNHG1 promotes cancer cell growth by regulating gene expression both in cis and in trans. SNHG1 was involved in the Akt signaling pathway as it promotes the neighboring transcription of the protein-coding gene SLC3A2 in cis, by binding the Mediator complex to facilitate the establishment of enhancer-promoter interaction. In trans, SNHG1 directly interacted with central domain of FUBP1 and antagonize the binding of FBP-Interacting Repressor FIR to FUBP1, thereby coordinating the expression of the oncogene MYC. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that lncRNA SNHG1 can function both in cis and in trans with distinct mechanisms to regulate transcription, promoting tumorigenesis and cancer progression.

DESIGN
Even, Odd probes targeting SNHG1 sequence, and control probes targeting LacZ. Probes was coupled with biotin, the captured DNA was prepared for library then sequencing.
