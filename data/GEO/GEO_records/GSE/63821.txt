TITLE
Effect of embryo in vitro culture on mESC transcriptome.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of mouse embryonic stem cell lines derived from embryos cultured in optimal and suboptimal conditions compared to cell lines derived from control embryos. The use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) has resulted in the birth of more than 5 million children. While children conceived by these technologies are generally healthy, there is conflicting evidence suggesting an increase in adult-onset complications like glucose intolerance and high blood pressure in IVF children. Animal models indicate similar potential risks. It remains unclear what molecular mechanisms may be operating during in vitro culture to predispose the embryo to these diseases. One of the limitations faced by investigators is the paucity of the material in the preimplantation embryo to test for molecular analysis. To address this problem, we generated mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) from blastocysts conceived after natural mating  (mESCFB) or after IVF, using optimal (KSOM + 5% O2; mESCKAA) and suboptimal (Whittenâ€™s Medium, + 20% O2, mESCWM) conditions.

DESIGN
We analyzed three female cell lines per group for a total of nine mouse embryonic stem cells on Affymetrix MoGene 1.0 ST Arrays.
