TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of 2 SCCOHT PDX models and the SCCOHT cell lines BIN67 and SCCOHT1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of 2 SCCOHT patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and 2 SCCOHT cell lines compared to normal ovary to investigate underlying biology of SCCOHT.

DESIGN
RNA from 2 SCCOHT PDXs and 2 SCCOHT cell lines were individually hybridized with a pool of 2 commercial normal ovary RNA on Agilent whole human genome 4x44K microarrays.

PLATFORM
