TITLE
Blood biomarkers of pancreatic cancer associated diabetes identified by peripheral blood-based gene expression profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is still very poor, how to detect pancreatic cancer from high-risk group in an early stage is essential for improving its long-time survival. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore specific biomarkers that can differentiate pancreatic cancer-associated diabetes from type-2 diabetes for the early detection of pancreatic cancer. In the current study, we used global gene transcription analysis with affymetrix gene chip to identify genes specifically expressed in pancreatic cancer-associated diabetes mellitus from peripheral blood samples in stead of from tissue samples.

DESIGN
32 peripheral blood samples were collected for microarray experiments to find differentially expressed genes specific for pancreatic cancer associated diabetes, which included 8 patients diagnosed as pancreatic cancer with diabetes, 8 patients of pancreatic cancer without diabetes, 8 patients with diabetes mellitus > 5years and 8 healthy controls. the comparision was done between pancreatic cancer with diabetes vs normal, pancreatic cancer vs normal and diabetes vs normal to identify a small group of genes that differently expressed in the pancreatic cancer with diabetes group.
