TITLE
NA-Seq reveals dynamic changes of gene expression in key stages of intestine regeneration in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus.

ORGANISM
Apostichopus japonicus

SUMMARY
Sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea; Echinodermata) have the capacity to regenerate lost tissues and organs.We used RNA-Seq to determine gene expression profiles associated with  intestinal regeneration in A. japonicus at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days post evisceration (dpe)

DESIGN
At least 15 individuals per stage, at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days post evisceration (dpe) were used for our experiments.
