TITLE
Analysis of conditioned media cytokine levels of breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the cytokines secreted by mesenchymal-like cancer cells that activate macrophages, the cytokine profiles of conditioned media from MCF7, MCF7 induced to undergo EMT by treatment of TGF-β, TNF-α and prolonged mammosphere culture, and MDA-MB-231 cells were analyzed by RayBio® Human Cytokine Antibody Array V.

DESIGN
5 samples. There are 5 groups: MCF7, MCF7 induced to undergo EMT by treatment of TGF-β (TGF-β-MCF7), TNF-α (TNF-α-MCF7), prolonged mammosphere culture (MCF7M), and MDA-MB-231 cells
