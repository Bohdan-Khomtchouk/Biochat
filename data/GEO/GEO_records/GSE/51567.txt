TITLE
Inheritance patterns and stability of DNA methylation variation in maize near-isogenic lines

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is a chromatin modification that contributes to epigenetic regulation of gene expression.  The inheritance patterns and trans-generational stability of 962 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were assessed in a panel of 71 near-isogenic lines (NILs) derived from maize (Zea mays) inbred lines B73 and Mo17.  The majority of DMRs exhibit inheritance patterns that would be expected for local (cis) inheritance of DNA methylation variation such that DNA methylation level was coupled to local genotype.  There are few examples of DNA methylation that exhibit trans-acting control or paramutation-like patterns.  The cis-controlled DMRs provided an opportunity to study the stability of inheritance for DNA methylation variation.  There was very little evidence for alterations of DNA methylation levels at the cis-controlled DMRs during NIL population development.  DNA methylation level was associated with local genotypes in all of the > 30,000 examined cases except one.  Additionally, the majority of the DMRs were not associated with small RNA.  Together, our results suggest that a significant portion of DNA methylation variation in maize exhibits cis-controlled inheritance patterns, is highly stable and does not require active programming by small RNAs for maintenance.
