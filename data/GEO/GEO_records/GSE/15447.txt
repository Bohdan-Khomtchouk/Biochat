TITLE
Gene expression profiling in mouse liver infected with Clonorchis sinensis metacercariae.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of host response to the infected Clonorchis sinensis metacercariae and adult worm. The infected tissues evidenced altered expression of genes involved in systems such as immune response and cell cycle regulation, as compared with normal tissues.
