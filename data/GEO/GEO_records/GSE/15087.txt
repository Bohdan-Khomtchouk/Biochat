TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in BMDCs stimulated with gamma-PGA nanoparticles, LPS and unparticulate gamma-PGA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The gene expression levels in murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells treated with γ-PGA NPs were examined by oligonucleitide microarray and compared with those in the cells treated with other adjuvants. The gene expression of proinflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and costimulatory molecules was upregulated considerably in DCs treated with γ-PGA NPs. The upregulation pattern was similar to that in DCs treated with LPS but not in DCs treated with unparticulate γ-PGA. The activation of DCs by γ-PGA NPs was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR analysis for the genes related to TLR signaling. The effect of γ-PGA NPs on DCs was not annihilated by treating with polymixin B, an inhibitor of LPS. Furthermore, the immunization of mice with γ-PGA NPs carrying OVA significantly induced Ag-specific CD8+ T cells and Ag-specific production of IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ from the cells. Such activities of γ-PGA NPs were more prominent, when compared to the immunization with OVA plus aluminum hydroxide or OVA plus CFA. These results suggest that γ-PGA NPs induce a CD8+ T cell response through activating innate immunity in a fashion different from that of LPS. Thus, γ-PGA NPs may be an attractive adjuvant to be further developed for vaccine therapy.

DESIGN
The gene expression in murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cell was measured at 6 hours after exposure to  γ-PGA NPs (300 µg/ml), LPS(1 µg/ml ), or unparticulate γ-PGA(300 µg/ml).  Three independent experiments were performed.
