TITLE
Hepatic transcriptome in wild-type and LXR-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LXR is a transcription factor. Two isoforms exist in mice (alpha and beta). They are both expressed in the liver. We examined the role of LXR by obtaining gene expression profiles from the livers of wild-type and LXR-/- mice from the same genetic background.

DESIGN
Liver gene expression was measured from male mice (5 mice/group) of genotypes wild-type and LXR-/- on a mixed Sv129/C57Bl6J background (Repa et al. , 2000, Science, 289(5484):1524-9; Cummins et al., 2006, J Clin Invest,116(7):1902-12) fed for 7 weeks a normal diet (ND) or a Western diet (WD).
