TITLE
CGH data from AID WT vs AID KO BCR-ABL1 mouse leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) specific amplifications and deletions in BCR-ABL1 positive Leukemia mouse cells. Bone marrow from Balb/CJ WT and Balb/CJ AID KO mice was transduced with BCR-ABL1. The AID specific amplifications and deletions where analyzed with an Agilent 244A mouse whole Genome CGH Array.

DESIGN
The AID specific amplifications and deletions where analyzed with an Agilent 244A mouse whole Genome CGH Array. 3 WT samples where compared to AID KO samples. 1.) WT MIG1_Cy5 vs KO MIG_Cy3 2.) WT MIG2_Cy5 vs KO MIG_Cy3 3.) WT MIG3_Cy5 vs KO MIG_Cy3
