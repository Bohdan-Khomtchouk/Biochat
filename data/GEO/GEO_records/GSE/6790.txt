TITLE
Dystrophin-deficient and dystrophin and utrophin double-deficient mice crossed with mice with full-length hDMD genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Crossing of hDMD mice that contain the full-length 2.3 Mb hDMD gene were crossed with dystrophin-deficient mdx mice and dystrophin and utrophin double-deficient mdx x utrn-/- mice resulted in a full rescue of the dystrophic features of these mice, as concluded from histological analysis. Analysis on Affymetrix gene chips demonstrated that also expression profiles of the dystrophic mice were normalized by crossing with transgenic hDMD mice. This confirms the full functionality of the hDMD transgene in mice. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
RNA from gastrocnemius muscle from individual mice was hybridized to Affymetrix U74Av2
