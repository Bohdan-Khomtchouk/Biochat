TITLE
Probing the initiation and effector phases of the somatic piRNA pathway in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Combining RNAi in cultured cells and analysis of mutant animals, we probed roles of known piRNA pathway components in the initiation and effector phases of transposon silencing.

DESIGN
total RNA and RNA associated with Piwi was isolated and size-fractionated by PAGE into 19-29nt. These were processed and sequenced on Illumina Genome Analyzer II.
