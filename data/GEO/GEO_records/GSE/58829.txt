TITLE
Expression data from prostate tumor of TRAMPxNOD/ShiLtJ F2 cross

ORGANISM
Musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesize that germline variation influences susceptibility to aggressive prostate tumor We examined the changes in gene expression in tumors obtain from TRAMPxNOD/ShiLtJ F2 mice in groups exhibiting metastasis versus no metastasis

DESIGN
Transgene-positive (Tg+) F2 males were bred by crossing Tg- sires to Tg+ dames. 126 tumor samples were analyzed, which were obtained from the Tg+ F2 male
