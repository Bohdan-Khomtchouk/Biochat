TITLE
Gene expression profile of HGPS skin fibroblasts upon treatment with JH4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain further insight into the biological effects of JH4, we investigated its impact on gene expression profiles. We defined a set of genes such as IL33, BRCA1, BLM, Rad51, IL6, IL8, and TNFSF18 whose expression is restored by JH4 treatment

DESIGN
4 total RNA samples from HGPS, JH4-treated HGPS, young (9-yr; N9) and old (81-yr; N81) fibroblasts are anlayzed. Young fibroblast (9-yr) was used control
