TITLE
Microarray expression profile and functional analysis of circular RNAs in osteosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Seven human osteosarcoma cell lines (U2OS, U2OS/MTX300, HOS, MG63, 143B, ZOS, ZOSM) and the human osteoblast hFOB1.19 were included in the study. Microarray based circRNA expression profiles were acquired using the Arraystar Human circRNA Array (8x15K, Arraystar). We identified circRNAs differentially expressed in human osteosarcoma cell lines compared to human osteoblast hFOB1.19 (control).

DESIGN
In the study presented here, the circRNA expression in human osteosarcoma cell lines was compared to circRNA expression in human osteoblast hFOB1.19 (control).
