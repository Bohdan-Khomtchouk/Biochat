TITLE
Gene expression profiles of lymphoma cells in homozygous Tet2 gene trap mice and CD4+ control cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TET2 is an enzyme for converting methylcytosine (mC) to hydorxymethylcytosine (hmC) and its mutations have been frequently found in myeloid malignancies and T-cell lymphoma in humans. We analyzed Tet2 gene trap mice and found that homozygous mice developed T-cell lymphoma with follicular helper T-cell-like features. To examine comprehensive gene expression patterns of lymphoma cells, We performed gene expression analysis using lymphoma cells in homozygousTet2 gene trap mice and CD4+ control cells.

DESIGN
Two pairs of total RNA were extracted from CD4+ lymphoma-developed splenocytes in homozygous Tet2 gene trap mice and CD4+ splenocytes in wild type control mice. Gene expression array was performed with these 4 samples.
