TITLE
Identification of expressed and conserved human non-coding RNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methods: RNA profiles of 12 tissues were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks. Results: This work has focused on identification of non-coding RNAs expressed in human tissues. We have identified a set of non-coding RNAs that are both expressed and conserved, as described in the manuscript accompagnying this work.

DESIGN
total RNA profiles of 12 normal human tissues, no replicates.
