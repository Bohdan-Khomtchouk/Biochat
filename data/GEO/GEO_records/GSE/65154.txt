TITLE
Wnt ligands from the embryonic surface ectoderm regulate bimetallic strip optic cup morphogenesis in the mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wnt signaling in early eye development, specifically the lens placode shows expression of 12 out of 19 Wnt ligands.  We these Wnt activities were suppressed using conditional deletion of Wntless, dramatic phenotypic changes in morphogensis occurred. Microarray analysis of the genes that were changed in response to deletion of Wnt ligands in the developing eye region show direct or indirect responses from the surface ectoderm to the developing RPE and optic cup curvature, creating an overal shape change phenotype in the bilayerd epithelium of the optic cup.

DESIGN
Mouse embryos at embryonic stage e10.5 were disected into pbs and eye regions were disected and removed for RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays.  We sought to identify the genes that were changed in response to deletion of Wls from the developing surface ectoderm of the eye region.  Genes changed could be the direct or indirect result from deleltion of Wls from the surface ectoderm using the LeCre recombinase gene as a tool for analysis.
