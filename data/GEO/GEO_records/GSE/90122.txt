TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in human primary hepatocytes (HPPs) in response to the treatment of hPXR antagonist (SPA70) and agonists (rifampicin, SR12813, and TO90137)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A common set of hPXR targeting genes has been identified by comparing the gene expression profiles of HPPs treated with SPA70 and different agonists in single or combinations.

DESIGN
Gene expression of HPPs treated with PA70 and different agonists in single or combinations have been compared in triplicate
