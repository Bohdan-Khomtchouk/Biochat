TITLE
Comparison of Apis mellifera workers and queens hind leg development at prepupal stages

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
In Apis mellifera, the female eggs can develop into workers or queen depending on the diet offered during early development. The outputs of the developed honeybee females are two morphs with particular morphological traits and related physiology. Among the specialized structures in workers the hind tibia forms the corbicula or the pollen basket, a smooth region surrounded by a row of a long scopal hairs, used for carrying pollen and other materials to the nest. This morphological trait and the respective behaviour are absent in queens. Herein we show details of the initial steps of hind legs morphogenesis in honeybee castes. Using results from the hybridization of whole genome-based oligonucleotide arrays with RNA samples from hind leg imaginal discs of pre-pupa honeybees of both castes we present a list of differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
Analysis used one dye-swap combination to compare workers and queens hind leg development at prepupal stages when juvenile hormone titers is much higher in queens
