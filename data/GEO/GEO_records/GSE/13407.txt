TITLE
Effect of T0901317, AM580 or T0901317+AM580 on monocyte gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of T0901317 LXR agonist on Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) family gene expression. T0901317 alone increase RARalpha gene expression in monocytes and the effects of the co treatment of the cells with T0901317 and a specific RARalpha agonist (AM580) were further studied. For this monocytes were treated for 24h with DMSO or T0901317 to induce RARalpha expression and in a second step cells were treated or not with AM580 for another 24h period. Gene expression was analysed for all the treatments (T0901317, AM580 or T0901317+AM580) and we focussed on genes which expression was synergitically induced by the co treatment as compared to the cells treated either by T0901317 or AM580.
