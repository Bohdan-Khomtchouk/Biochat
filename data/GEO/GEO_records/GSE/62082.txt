TITLE
DNA methylation profiling in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma reveals diagnostic and prognostic markers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A Cartes d'Identite des Tumeurs (CIT) project from the french Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer ( http://cit.ligue-cancer.net ):we explored DNA methylation patterns associated with PPGL malignancy using two large and well characterized cohorts of PPGL collected through a multi-institutional collaboration through the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (ENS@T).

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from fresh frozen paragangliomas and adrenal medulla samples were hybridized to Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
