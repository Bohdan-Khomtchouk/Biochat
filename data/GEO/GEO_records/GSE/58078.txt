TITLE
Microarray analysis of WT and Tfap4-KO CD8 T cells during early activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression of Tfap4–/– and WT CD8+ T cells were compared after activation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in vitro or with Listeria monocytogenes infection in vivo

DESIGN
For in vitro activation, naive CD8+ T cells were purified from WT and Tfap4–/– mice and activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for 72 hours. For in vivo activation, naive CD8+ T cells from Tfap4–/– OT-I or control WT OT-I TCR transgenice mice were adoptively transferred to congenic host mice that were subsequently infected with Listeria mnocytogenes expression ovalbumin. Activated OT-I cells were harvested 48 hours after infection.
