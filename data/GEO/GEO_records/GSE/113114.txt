TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of myosin IIa-deficient B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myosin IIa-deficient follicular B cells have a hyperactivated phenotype. To identify what pathways are regulated by myosin IIa, we performed RNA-seq of coding RNA on flow cytometry sorted follicular B cells from CD23Cre+Myh9fl/fl and CD23Cre+Myh9wt/fl mice.

DESIGN
B220+AA4.1-CD23+CD21lo follicular B cells were sorted from 3 CD23Cre+Myh9fl/fl and 3 CD23Cre+Myh9wt/fl mice and mRNA was isolated and  sequenced.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
