TITLE
MeHg-induced encephalopathy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this dose series pregnant CD-1 (outbred) dams were exposed to methylmercury (MeHg) as monomethylmercuric chloride injected intraperitoneally on 9 d.p.c. Test doses were 10.0 mg/kg and below. This regimen induces symptoms of Fetal Minimata Disease (FMD) in term fetuses. Risks with respect to FMD for the various test doses were 10.0 mg/kg (40% risk), 5.0 mg/kg (20% risk), 2.5 mg/kg (NOAEL), and 1.25 mg/kg (subNOAEL). All measurements were on RNA from the embryonic forebrain (prosencephalon and surrounding tissue) at 3.0h post-treatment.

DESIGN
Test doses were 10.0 mg/kg (40% risk), 5.0 mg/kg (20% risk), 2.5 mg/kg (NOAEL), and 1.25 mg/kg (subNOAEL).
