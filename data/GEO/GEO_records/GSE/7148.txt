TITLE
Differential gene expression in peripheral blood leukocytes from CHASRS particpants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out on peripheral blood leukocytes from 14 healthy older adults.  The primary research question is whether gene expression differs in individuals experiencing chronically high levels of social isolation (by UCLA Loneliness Scale) vs chronically low levels of social isolation. Keywords: Risk prediction
