TITLE
Gene expression profile of ADM, ductal and acinar cells in the setting of pancreatitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to compare the gene expression profile of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), ductal and acinar cells in the setting of pancreatitis, which were obtained by laser-capture microdissection (LMD) from frozen sections of wild type mice pancreata 2 days after caerulein administration, we performed microarray analysis. ADM has an intermediate property between ductal and acinar cells in the setting of pancreatitis, and Cxcr4 mRNA which is expressed in multipotent pancreatic progenitors, were up-regulated in ADM compared with ductal cells or acinar cells. Notably, in consistent with our immunostaining data, Dclk1 mRNA was highly expressed in ADM cells compared with ductal and acinar cells.

DESIGN
ADM, duct and acinar cells were collected from frozen pancreatic specimens of 3 WT mice two days after caerulein pancreatitis by the laser-microdissection method. Total RNA was extracted from each sample and gene expression profiles were compared.
