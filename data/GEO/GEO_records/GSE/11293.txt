TITLE
Investigation of gene expression signature induced by Alk5TD (active type I TGF-beta receptor)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BT474 cells stably expressing Alk5TD or vector (BT474-Alk5TD and BT474-pBMN, respectively) were compared for gene expression. Genes that were differentially expressed between the two cell lines were collected as the signature induced by Alk5TD expression. Keywords: Comparison of two cell types (BT474-Alk5TD and BT474-pBMN). BT474-pBMN was used as the reference line.
