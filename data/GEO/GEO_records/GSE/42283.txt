TITLE
Study of gene expression in Chromolaena odorata cuttings using a combination of RNA-seq and digital gene expression analysis

ORGANISM
Chromolaena odorata

SUMMARY
4,392 differentially expressed genes were generated by DGE analysis, and 3,074 had good comparability with known gene sequences in existing species. 1,152 differentially expressed sequences were mapped to the reference canonical pathways in the KEGG database, and were assigned to 110 KEGG pathways, 11 pathways less then with the transcriptome database. Differentially expressed genes were classed according to their function, which includes phytohormones, growth and developmental processes, defense, peroxidase and P450-related genes. Pathway analysis also revealed that the principal secondary metabolites in the C. odorata cuttings were phytohormones and flavonoids.
