TITLE
Advancing a Clinically Relevant Perspective of the Clonal Nature of Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used DNA content-based flow cytometry to distinguish and isolate nuclei from clonal populations in primary tissues from three disparate cancers with variable clinical histories. We then developed a methodology to adapt flow cytometrically purified nuclei samples for use with whole genome technologies including aCGH and next generation sequencing (NGS). Our results demonstrate that selected aberrations in the genomes of distinct clonal populations in each patient create clinically relevant contexts at least with respect to the cancer types profiled in this study.

DESIGN
We applied DNA content based flow sorting to isolate the nuclei of clonal populations from tumor biopsies. Genomic DNA from each sorted population was amplified with phi29 polymerase. A 1ug aliquot of each amplified sample was digested with DNAse 1 then labeled with Cy5 using a Klenow-based commercial kit (Invitrogen). Each sample was hybridized with a pooled normal (46,XX) reference (Promega) to Agilent 244k CGH arrays. The use of highly purified objectively defined flow sorted populations provides high definition genomic profiles of clonal populations from pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PA), adrenal cortical carcinomas (ACC), and prostate adenocarcinomas (PC).
