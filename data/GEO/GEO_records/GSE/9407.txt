TITLE
Recovery from 40 or 180 MPa 4C

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Piezophysiology of genome wide gene expression levels in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Hydrostatic pressure is one of the physical factors affecting cellular physiology. Hydrostatic pressure of a few hundred MPa decreases the viability of yeast cells, and pressure of a few tens MPa decreases the growth rate. To understand the effect of hydrostatic pressure, we employed yeast DNA microarrays and analyzed genome-wide gene-expression levels after the pressure treatment with 180 MPa (immediate) at 4 degrees C and recovery incubation for 1 h and 40 MPa (16 h) at 4 degrees C and recovery incubation for 1 h. The transcription of genes involved in energy metabolism, cell defense, and protein metabolism was significantly induced by the pressure treatment. Genome-wide expression profiles suggested that high pressure caused damage to cellular organelles, since the induced gene products were localized in the membrane structure and/or cellular organelles. Hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that the damage caused by the pressure was similar to that caused by detergents, oils, and freezing/thawing. We also estimated the contribution of induced genes to barotolerance using some strains that have the deletion in the corresponding genes. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
In the experiment that used 40 MPa, triplicate hybridization from independent biological samples were done, respectively. In the experiment that used 180 MPa, hybridization result was obtained from 5 independent biological samples, respectively. 5th data in 180 MPa have high and low power scanned data, on the other hand, others have single scanned data, respectively.
