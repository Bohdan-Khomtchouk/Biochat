TITLE
Identification of HIF1 and HIF2 target genes in human CB CD34+ cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although it has been shown that HIF1 and 2 fulfill essential roles within the hematopoietic system and in the regulation of HSC fate, little is currently known about the specific mechanisms that are involved. We identified transcriptome changes induced by hypoxia, constitutively active HIF1(P402/564) and HIF2(P405/531) in human cord blood CD34+ cells. Thus, we were able to identify common hypoxia-HIF1-HIF2 gene signatures, but we also identified specific target genes that were exclusively regulated by HIF1, HIF2 or hypoxia.

DESIGN
CB CD34+ cells were isolated by Miltenyi miniMACS column. Cells were prestimulated in HPGM with 100 ng/ml KITL, FLT3L and TPO for 48 hrs. Cells were transduced with control pRRL-IRS2-EGFP lentiviral vectors or vectors expressing HIF1α(P402A,P564A) or HIF2α(P405A,P531A) in one or two  rounds of 12 hrs each. 24 hrs later transduced cells were sorted after which RNA was isolated. 5 independent CB CD34+ batches were isolated, transduced and sorted, and isolated RNA was combined and used for Illumina beadhchip arrays HT12 v4
