TITLE
Transcriptome responses to combined biotic and abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Biotic and abiotic stresses limit agricultural yields, and plants are often simultaneously exposed to multiple stresses. Combinations of stresses such as heat and drought or cold and high light intensity, have profound effects on crop performance and yeilds To analyze such responses, we initially compared transcriptome changes in ten Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes using cold, heat, high light, salt and flagellin treatments as single stress factors or their double combinations.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana plants of ecotypes (Col, Ler, C24, Cvi, Kas1, An1, Sha, Kyo2, Eri and Kond) were subjected to the following stress treatments: Salt, Cold, Heat, High Light (HL), Salt+Heat, Salt+HL, Cold+HL, Heat+HL, as well as FLG (Flagellin, flg22 peptide), Cold+FLG, Heat+FLG
