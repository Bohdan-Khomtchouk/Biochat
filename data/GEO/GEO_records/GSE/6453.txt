TITLE
Expression microarray analysis of pubertal mouse mammary gland development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim was to carry out global analysis of gene expression changes occurring in the normal pubertal mouse mammary gland from the appearance to the regression of terminal end buds. Keywords: developmental time course

DESIGN
5 time points were chosen for analysis: 3wk, 4wk, 5wk, 6wk and 7wk. Each time point was analysed in triplicate with the exception of the 5wk time point which was analysed in duplicate. Total: 14 samples. Each sample was prepared from a pool of RNA from mammary glands of a minimum of three mice.
