TITLE
Association of replication restart proteins with sites of increased transcriptional activity in Bacillus subtilis

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis ; Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
Antibodies against DnaD and DnaB were used to immunoprecipitate genome bound complexes of these proteins in fast growing and slow growing cells as well as in two strains with a constitutively induced Pxis promoter or repressed Pxis promoter. CHIP-chip analysis was then carried out to determine their sites of interaction in vivo. CHI-chip analysis was carried out by Oxford Gene Technology (OGT) wwho also designed and prepared the arrays.

DESIGN
Antibodies against DnaD and DnaB were used to immunoprecipitate genome bound complexes of these proteins in fast growing and slow growing cells, as well as in two strains with a constitutively induced Pxis promoter or repressed Pxis promoter. CHIP-chip microarray analysis was carried out by OGT who obtained the raw data. Data were visualized in CHIP Browser provided by OGT.
