TITLE
SNP array analysis of lung cancer NCI-H1395, diluted to different tumor cell concentrations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In vitro mix of DNA from patient-matched lung cancer and blood cell lines, representing 30,50,70,100% tumor cell tissue, analyzed on Affymetrix 6.0 arrays.

DESIGN
Lung cancer cell line H-1395 and patient-matched blood cell line BL1395 were obtained from ATCC and cultured according to their recommendations. DNA extraction was performed using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA from patient-matched Lung cancer and Blood cell lines NCI-H1395 and NCI-BL1395 were mixed to simulate tumor tissue with 30,50,70,100% cancer cells. The DNA ratio was adjusted to compensate for NCI-H1395 being nearly triploid. DNA was analyzed on Affymetrix SNP6.0 microarrays according to the manufacturer's protocol.
