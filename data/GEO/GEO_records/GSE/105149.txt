TITLE
Gene Expression in the Human Lacrimal Gland

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Diagnosis of inflamed human lacrimal gland with standard clinical and histopathology evaluation data is imprecise. A large number of these patients are diagnosed with the catch-all classification of nonspecific orbital inflammation (NSOI). We utilized gene expression analysis of lacrimal gland biospy/surgical waste tissues to assist in the classification of sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), thyroid eye disease (TED), and subdivisions of NSOI. As part of this process, we are investigating correlations between gene expression levels and disease characteristics.

DESIGN
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lacrimal gland tissues were collected for RNA extraction and analysis with Affymetrix microarrays. Biopsy/surgical waste samples were obtained from subjects with inflammatory diseases such as NSOI, sarcoidosis, GPA, and TED as well as from normal controls. In some cases, more than one sample was obtained for a subject.
