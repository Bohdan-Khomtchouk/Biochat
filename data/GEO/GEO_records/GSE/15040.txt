TITLE
Expression data from human neonatal melanocytes and Notch transformed human neonatal melanocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Notch1 Activation Confers Transforming Properties to Primary Human Melanocytes and Promotes Human Melanoma Progression We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Human neonatal melanocytes and Notch transformed human neonatal melanocytes were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Illumina gene expression array chip. Expression intensities were calculated and normalized for each gene probed on the array for all hybridizations using illumina Beadstudio#3 software. Microarray analyses were subsequently performed in GeneSpring to aid in the identification of genes differentially-expressed between Notch-infected and control melanocytes that may be responsible for the phenotypic changes described in the NIC-infected cells.
