TITLE
In vivo gene expression analysis of  C elegans in response to rifampicin

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We have discovered rifampicin as a glycation inhibitor, which  increases life span in C elegans.  In order to understand the mechanism of rifampicin action, microarray analysis was performed to study the changes in gene expression brought about by the drug.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile of wild type N2 worms treated with rifampicin w.r.t to control (DMSO treated) worms.Total RNA was isolated from worms on  8th day of adulthoodin presence of FuDr. Two independent biological replicates for each treatment were analyzed.
