TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of yeast cells lacking either M-2 dsRNA or both L-A-lus and M-2 dsRNA viruses

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Here we determine the impact upon the loss of M-2 dsRNA alone and both L-A-lus along with M-2 on the host S. cerevisiae transcriptional changes. By performing profiling of the whole transcriptomes, we determined 486 genes differentially expressed after curing of yeast cells from M-2 dsRNA and 715 genes affected by the elimination of both M-2 and L-A-lus dsRNAs.

DESIGN
Examination of host gene expression in response to the loss of viral infection.
