TITLE
Ethephon- and AVG-induced transcriptional changes at the onset of sugarcane ripening

ORGANISM
Saccharum sp.

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of sugarcane leaf+1 and upper internode harvested at one and five days after chemical (ethephon and AVG) application (DAA) compared to control (mock) samples. Co-hybridization of chemical-treated samples with control samples as reference (one or five DAA chemical treated-samples against one DAA control sample; and five DAA chemical treated-sample against five DAA control sample) was performed to monitor gene expression changes in a two-color Agilent custom microarray, using a dye-swap design. Our goal was to determine the effect of ethylene on global gene expression of sugarcane plants at the maturation stage.

DESIGN
Twelve-condition experiment: control at one DAA (CTL1) vs. ethephon at one DAA (ET1), control at one DAA (CTL1) vs. AVG at one DAA (AVG1), control at one DAA (CTL1) vs. ethephon at five DAA (ET5), control at one DAA (CTL1) vs. AVG at five DAA (AVG5), control at five DAA (CTL5) vs. ethephon at five DAA (ET5), control at five DAA (CTL5) vs. AVG at five DAA (AVG5). Upper internode samples are identified by “c”. Technical replicates: 2 replicates.
