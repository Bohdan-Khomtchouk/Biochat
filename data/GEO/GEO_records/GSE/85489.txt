TITLE
Ethephon- and AVG-induced transcriptional changes at the onset of sugarcane ripening

ORGANISM
Saccharum officinarum

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of sugarcane leaf+1 and upper internode harvested at one and five days after chemical (ethephon and AVG) application (DAA) compared to control (mock) samples. Co-hybridization of chemical-treated samples with control samples as reference (one or five DAA chemical treated-samples against one DAA control sample; and five DAA chemical treated-sample against five DAA control sample) was performed to monitor gene expression changes in a two-color Agilent custom microarray, using a dye-swap design. Our goal was to determine the effect of ethylene on global gene expression of sugarcane plants at the maturation stage.
