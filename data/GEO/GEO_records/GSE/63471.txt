TITLE
Implementing whole genome array for clinical use in academic centers: A randomized trial comparing neoadjuvant standard chemotherapy to genomic-driven chemotherapy in operable breast cancer (REMAGUS04 trial)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
REMAUS04 is a phase III trial comparing DNA array-based chemotherapy (by DLD30 score and TOP2A expression) to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, in patients with HER2-negative breast carcinoma not eligible for conserving surgery. We evaluated whether whole genome array approach is feasible in daily practice, and if the use of a genomic score (DLD30/TOP2A) improves chemotherapy efficacy.

DESIGN
DNA arrays were performed within 15 days after tumor biopsy. Only samples with > 30% cancer cells, a RIN > 6 and good cDNA quality were eligible for hybridization on arrays U133Av2.
