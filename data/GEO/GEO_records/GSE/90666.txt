TITLE
Genetic analysis of Ikaros target genes and tumor suppressor function in BCR-ABL1+ pre-B ALL [ATAC-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using patient-derived Ph+ pre-B ALL cells that harbor deletions of the IKZF1 DNA binding domain (Ik6), we performed ATAC-sequencing in cells that inducibly express wild-type Ikaros (Ik1) or an empty vector control.

DESIGN
ATAC-Seq from human Ik6 BCR-ABL+ pre-B ALL cells following 24 h of DOX induction of IK1 or empty vector controls

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
