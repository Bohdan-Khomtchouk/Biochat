TITLE
Virus Mimicry in the Tumor Microenvironment Activates RIG-I Through Unshielding of Endogenous RNA in Exosomes [ppp5end RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to investigate if endogenous RNA in exosomes activates RIG-I through unshielding.

DESIGN
5' triphosphate end profiling of  exosomal RNA isolated from stroma/breast cancer cell co-culture (MRC5 and 1833).
