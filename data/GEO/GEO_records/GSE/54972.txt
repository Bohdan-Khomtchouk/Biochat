TITLE
Chromatin immunoprecipitation with next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of H3K27ac in primary human macrophages and foam cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the enhancer landscape in primary human macrophages and foam cells using ChIP-seq for the H3K27ac histone mark

DESIGN
CD14+ monocytes were isolated from the blood of 2 healthy male volunteers. Monocytes were differentiated into macrophages by culture for 7 days with 50ng/ml macrophage colony stimulating factor and then treated for 48 hours with either oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) to induce foam cell formation or with a control buffer that lacked oxLDL. The resulting 4 samples were then subjected to ChIP-seq for H3K27ac.
