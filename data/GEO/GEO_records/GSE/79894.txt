TITLE
Regular physical activity followed by detraining increases the sensitivity of global gene expression to acute exercise stress

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To determine the influence of a previous physcial activity period (e.g., exercise) on global gene expression, we compared differential expression in sedentary (SED) and detrained (DETR) rats relative to trained (TR) rats with regular access to physcial activity.

DESIGN
TR and DETR rats had voluntary access to caged running wheels for 8 and 4 weeks, respectively. DETR rats were moved to sedentary conditions (normal cage activity) for another 4 weeks. SED rats experienced 8 weeks of normal caged activity; n=8 per group. At the end of each group's respective 8 weeks, all rats underwent 1 hr of moderate of acute exercise stress (e.g., forced wheel running at a speed of 20 m/min). Soleus muscles were harvested 24h post-running.
