TITLE
Changes in pituitary gene expression between embryonic day 17 and post-hatch day 3.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
A major research focus in our laboratory is the development of the chicken pituitary gland.  As this tissue does not yield sufficient RNA  to analyze using cDNA microarrays, mRNA must be amplified by reverse transcription with an oligo-dT primer containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter site  followed by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase.  Therefore, this preliminary study investigating differential gene expression between embryonic  day 17, when all the major cell types in the chick anterior pituitary gland have differentiated, and post-hatch day 3 was conducted to verify that amplified  antisense RNA could be used in conjunction with our neuroendocrine microarrays containing 5,128 unique cDNAs to detect changes in gene expression.  Of the  662 cDNAs that were expressed at significantly different levels between the two ages (P < 0.05, n=3 samples/age), 159 exhibited substantial differences where  the higher mean was at least 1.6-fold greater than the lower mean.  The majority of the genes (117) increased between e17 and d3.  Several genes which may  play a role in neuroendocrine development were identified, including many transcription factors, signaling molecules, and morphogeneic factors. Keywords: time course during development (2 ages)
