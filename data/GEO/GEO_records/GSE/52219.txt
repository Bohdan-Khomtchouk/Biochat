TITLE
Tumors with neoadjuvant chemotherapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using whole genome mRNA expression profiling of primary human tumors and unsupervised hierarchical cluster analyses,  3 novel molecular subsets (basal, luminal and p53-like subsets) of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) were identified.  23 MVAC treated samples were used for the validation of three MIBC subsets

DESIGN
MVAC cohort consisted of 23 FFPE pretreatment tumors (TURs) from a Phase III clinical trial were used to validate 3 molecular subsets including basal, luminal and p53-like subsets We used Illumina cDNA-mediated Annealing, Selection, Extension, and Ligation (DASL) assay that is specifically designed for the gene expression of RNA that is extracted from FFPE.
