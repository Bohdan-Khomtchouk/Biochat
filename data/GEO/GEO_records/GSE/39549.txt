TITLE
Time-course microarrays reveal early activation of the immune transcriptome and adipokine dysregulation leads to fibrosis in visceral adipose depots during diet-induced obesity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Time-course analysis of adipocyte gene expression profiles response to high fat diet. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that in diet-induced obesity, early activation of TLR-mediated inflammatory signaling cascades by CD antigen genes, leads to increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, resulting in chronic low-grade inflammation. Early changes in collagen genes may trigger the accumulation of ECM components, promoting fibrosis in the later stages of diet-induced obesity. New therapeutic approaches targeting visceral adipose tissue genes altered early by HFD feeding may help ameliorate the deleterious effects of a diet-induced obesity.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated epididymal and mesenteric adipose tissue of C57BL/6J mice fed normal diet or high fat diet for 2, 4, 8, 20 and 24weeks

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
