TITLE
Chronic Cigarette Smoke Exposure Results in Coordinated Methylation and Gene Expression Changes in Human Alveolar Macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of emphysema in the United States. Alveolar macrophages play a critical role in the inflammation-mediated remodeling of the lung parenchyma in emphysema. However, the exact gene pathways and the role of DNA methylation in moderating this pathological transformation are not known. In order to more exactly understand this process, we compared genome-wide expression and methylation signatures of alveolar macrophages isolated from heavy smokers with those isolated from non-smoking controls. We found enrichment of differential methylation in genes from immune system and inflammatory pathways as determined by standard pathway analysis. Consistent with recent findings, significant methylation changes were particularly enriched in the areas flanking CpG islands (CpG shores). Analysis of matching gene expression data demonstrated a parallel enrichment for changes in immune system and inflammatory pathways. We conclude that alveolar macrophages from the lungs of smokers demonstrate coordinated changes in DNA methylation and gene expression that link to inflammation pathways. We suggest that further studies of DNA methylation in immune and inflammation-related gene expression are needed to understand the pathogenesis of emphysema and other smoking-related diseases.

DESIGN
Expression analysis of 13 smokers vs. 10 non-smokers on the Affymetrix Exon Array. This submission represents the expression component of the study.
