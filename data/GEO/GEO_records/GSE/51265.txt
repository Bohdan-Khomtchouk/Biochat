TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for oral squamous cell carcinoma and oral dysplasia samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a multistep process requiring the accumulation of genetic alterations. Oral carcinogenesis is a multifactorial process involving numerous genetic changes that affect the activity of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and other classes of disease-related genes.Therefore, to identify the responsive genes for progression of oral dysplasia or OSCC, we here performed CGH analysis to DNA from oral dysplasia and OSCC by microdissection

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix 250K SNP arrays was performed for 8 oral dysplasia samples, 8 oral squamous cell carcinoma samples, using microdissection
