TITLE
Molecular signatures of human iPSCs highlight sex differences and cancer genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared human female hiPSC lines (all derived from IMR-90 fibroblasts) that were XIST RNA-positive and XIST RNA-negative.  We also examined the gene expression patterns for 2 female hIPSCs (derived from different disease model fibroblasts) that were also negative for XIST RNA. hiPS 12D-1 is derived from Huntington's Disease patient and 6C-1 is derived from a Type I Diabetes Mellitus patient (Park et al Nature 2008).

DESIGN
hiPSCs (undifferentiated) were cultured to confluency then RNA was isolated using TriZOL (MEFs were removed using trypsin).  cDNA was converted using NuGEN then hybridized to Affymetrix 3' arrays.
