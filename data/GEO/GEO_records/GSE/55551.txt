TITLE
Vector and Brown fat lncRNA 1 (Blnc1) expressing differentiated brown adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Blnc1 is a novel nuclear lncRNA that promotes brown and beige adipocyte differentiation and function. Blnc1 forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with transcription factor EBF2 to stimulate the thermogenic gene program. Further, Blnc1 itself is a target of EBF2, thereby forming a feedforward regulatory loop to drive adipogenesis toward thermogenic phenotype. We used microarrays to elucidate the role of Blnc1 on brown adipocyte differentiation and the induction of the thermogenic gene program.

DESIGN
Brown adipocytes expressing vector or brown fat lncRNA 1 (blnc1) were differentiated for 6 days and harvested for RNA isolation and microarray using Affymetrix Mouse MG-430 PM Strip arrays. Two replicated samples were included in this study.
