TITLE
The different gene expression profile of knockdown LRP5/6 or knockdown β-catenin in hepG2 cell line through RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LRP5/6 receptor is an important receptor for the activation of β-catenin. Therefore, the downregulation of LRP5/6 can lead to the degradation of β-catenin. We sequenced mRNA from hepG2 cell after knocking down LRP5/6 or β-catenin separately by siRNA for 48hour. The different expression profile of mRNA was studied in two groups.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in hepG2 cell by knocking down LRP5/6 or β-catenin for 48hour using siRNA.
