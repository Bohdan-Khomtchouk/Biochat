TITLE
Regulation of KMT2D by PI(3)K/AKT signalling orchestrates oestrogen receptor mediated transcriptional activation in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aim to elucidate the mechanisms of how PI3K inhibition is promoting estrogen receptor (ER) activation and ER dependency in breast cancer.

DESIGN
Genome-wide analysis of KMT2D upon treatment with the PI3K inhibitor (BYL719).

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
