TITLE
Grain gene expression profile at early developmental stage

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of ovary at 1-10 days and embryo at 4-10 days after flowering (DAT) was performed to obtain an overall signature of the rice transcriptome during early grain development.

DESIGN
After the onset of pollination, ovary samples at 1-10 DAT and embryo samples at 4-10 DAT with two replicates were collected and used for microarray analysis. A total of 20 microarray data for ovary and 14 microarray data for embryo were obtained.
