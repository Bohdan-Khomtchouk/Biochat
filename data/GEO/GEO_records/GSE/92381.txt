TITLE
Expression data from mouse na誰ve (Naive), stem cell memory (TSCM), central memory (TCM) CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stem cell memory T cells can be defined as the memory T cell subsets with na誰ve T cell phenotypes and stem cell-like properties. We find that Notch signaling converts activated T cells into stem cell memory T (TSCM) cells by OP9-DL1 feeder cell coculture. Based on gene expression profile analysis, we provide evidence that these cells represent distinct characters with central memory T (TCM) cells and na誰ve T cells with effector molecules and transcription factors. TSCM cells induced by Notch cluster closer to TCM cells than na誰ve T cells, and display similar phenotypes to TCM phenotype in terms of effector molecules and transcription factors, but the gene expressions of TSCM cells are entirely lower than that of TCM cells.

DESIGN
For all samples, Total RNA was isolated using a ReliaPrep RNA Cell Miniprep System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Microarray analysis was performed using fragmented and labeled with a Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit, one-color and hybridized to SurePrint G3 Mouse Gene Expression 8x60K (Agilent), all according to the respective manufacturer's instructions.

PLATFORM
