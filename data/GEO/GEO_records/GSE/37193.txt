TITLE
Comparative analyses of resistance pathways of Arabidopsis thaliana and soybean (Glycine max) to Fusarium virguliforme and to deoxynivalenol of Gibberella zeae

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Microarray experiments allow the dissection genome wide patterns of mRNA abundances and improve understanding of the molecular basis of the plant defense responses. These global and simultaneous analyses of TA profiles enable variations in mRNA abundances under specific treatments to be compared. In order to compare the plant resistance mechanism to DON toxicity and infection of Fusarial pathogens, microarray data from Arabidopsis thaliana cells challenged with the mycotoxin DON was compared to the data from the plants responding to F. virguliforme infestations. The microarray chip contained over 10,000 different ESTs (AFGC) was employed in both analyses. The first objective of this approach was to identify genes that were transcriptionally regulated when plants were treated with the toxin. The second objective using the microarray data was to identify resistance pathways where these co-regulated genes were positioned. The parallel comparison on transcriptional activities among soybean and Arabidopsis after fungal pathogen Fsg pathogenesis and Arabidopsis with DON treatment was also performed. Infection: Using F. virguliforme spores Compound Based Treatment: Time seedlings were exposed to Deoxynivalenol
