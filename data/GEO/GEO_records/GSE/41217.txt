TITLE
Acute Stress Induced Increase in Histone H3 Lys 9 Trimetylation in Rat Hippocampus

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We utilized ChIP Seq to examine the the genomic localization of the increase in H3K9 trimethylation we had previously observed in the hippocampus as a consequence of acute restraint stress in rats (Hunter et. al PNAS 2009).

DESIGN
Rats were restrained for 30 minutes, allowed to recover for 1 hour and then sacrificed and their hippocampi extracted and processed for H3K9me3 ChIP using the Cell Signalling H3K9me3 antibody.
