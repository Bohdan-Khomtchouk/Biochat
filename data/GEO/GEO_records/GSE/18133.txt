TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in colon and brain during the suckling period.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression was analysed in the colon and brain of normal rat pups from late prenatal through early postnatal development. Tissue was isolated from pups one day prior to the anticipated date of birth and throughout the suckling period until the end of weaning.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from colon or brain of pups prior to birth (embryonic day 21) and on postnatal days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 22. 6 replicates per time point. 'Colon_Embryo_Day21_rep1' has been excluded from the analysis
