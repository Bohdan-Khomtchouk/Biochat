TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of C. elegans gonadal RNA

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To better understand the role of Notch signaling in germline biology, we analyzed GLP-1/Notch- and PRC2-dependent changes in gene expression in C. elegans.

DESIGN
We isolated RNA from dissected gonads and analysed the expression changes.
