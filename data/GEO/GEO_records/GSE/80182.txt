TITLE
A TGFbeta-PRMT5-MEP50 Axis Regulates Cancer Cell Invasion through Histone H3 and H4 Arginine Methylation Coupled Transcriptional Activation and Repression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from 3 biological replicates each of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines expressing shRNA against GFP (control), PRMT5, or MEP50. We then determined differential gene expression.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis of mRNA testing the role of PRMT5 and MEP50 by knockdown in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
