TITLE
The role of HIF-1 in beta-glucan induced response in myeloid cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
beta-glucan induced glycolysis in HIF-1 depedent manner. We reported that beta-glucan injection in mice led to upregulated glycolysis. HIF-1a plays a major role in this process.

DESIGN
Mice receives beta-glucan via ip for 4 days. Splenocytes were isolated for RNA sequencing.

PLATFORM
