TITLE
Gene expression data from somites of E9.5 mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify Pax3 targets during myogenesis in the mouse embryo

DESIGN
Mouse embryos were genotyped Pax3GFP/+ or Pax3PAX3-FKHR/GFP and dissected at E9.5 under a fluorescent binocular. Somites were dissected from the interlimb region and the more hypaxial domain separated from the neural tube and the epaxial extremity of the somites. GFP positive cells were then sorted by flow cytometry before RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We also sorted GFP negative cells.
