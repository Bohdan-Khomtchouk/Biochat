TITLE
H3K4me2 and gene expression profiling in control and KMT2D KD murine B220 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Define and compare H3K4me2 enrichment in murine B220 cells transduced with empty vector (ct) or KMT2D-shRNA. Compare gene expression by RNAseq in murine B220 cells transduced with empty vector (ct) or KMT2D-shRNA.

DESIGN
Using H3K4me1/2 ChIPseq and RNAseq we profiled murine B220 purified cells from tumors transduced with EV (n=3) or KMT2D-shRNA (n=3).
