TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of ovarian cancer spheroids reveals genes and related biological pathways associated with cisplatin resistance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characterization of differential gene expression due to cisplatin resistance in human ovarian cancer spheroids by microarray analysis. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer spheroids.  These data are used to obtain 1316 genes that are differentially expressed in response to cisplatin resistance.

DESIGN
8 total samples were analyzed.  For the pairwise comparison of cisplatin-sensitive to cisplatin-resistant spheroids, genes with a p-value < 0.01, a FDR < 0.05, and a fold-change â‰¥2 were selected.
