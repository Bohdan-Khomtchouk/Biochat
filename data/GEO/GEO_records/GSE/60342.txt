TITLE
Expression data from Eµ-Myc B-cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to understand gene expression changes in response to DNA crosslinking agent mafosfamide over a 48 hour period. We also created resistant cell lines (R100, R500, R1000, R2000, R4000) via dose escalation and used microarrays to probe expression changes between the parental and resistant cell lines.

DESIGN
Eµ-Myc B-cells were co-cultured in vitro with 750nM mafosfamide for 48 hours.  Samples were collected at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. Additionally, resistant lines were either treated or untreated with 750nM for 24 hours.
