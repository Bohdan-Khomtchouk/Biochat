TITLE
Identification of expression patterns after B2M restoration in deficient lung cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed microarray expression profiling to identify genes up- and down-regulated after the restitution of beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) gene in lung cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
H2009 and H2135 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines were infected with a plasmid carrying the B2M gene (wtB2M) or with the empty vector (mock).
