TITLE
Expression data from mouse dissected dendrites

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using microdissected dendrites from primary cultures of hippocampal neurons of two mouse strains (C57BL/6 and Balb/c) and one rat strain (Sprague-Dawley), we investigate via microarrays, subcellular localization of mRNAs in dendrites of neurons to assay the evolutionary differences in subcellular dendritic transcripts localization.

DESIGN
To assess neuronal dendrite expression divergence between mice and rats, we used the Affymetrix array platform to assay the transcriptomes of micro-dissected individual dendrites of hippocampal neurons in dispersed primary cell cultures from Sprague-Dawley rat (9 biological replicates), C57BL/6 mouse  (14 biological replicates), and Balb/c mouse (5 biological replicates)
