TITLE
Expression data from human iENP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The early neural population that differentiates from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) consists of various embryonic neural stem cells and progenitors (ENSCs/ENPs) with broad neural developmental propensity, and these cells are thus an excellent source for the development of novel clinical interventions. Here, we sought to directly convert human somatic cells into cells with ENP-like phenotypes through the use of hESC-derived NP-enriched neural transcription factors (hESC-NP-TFs). Microarray was used to examine global gene expression profiling of human iENP versus hESC-derived neural progenitors.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from control hESC-NP and iENP using QIAquick kit. We sought to understand the characteristics in iENP with hESC-NP as a control.
