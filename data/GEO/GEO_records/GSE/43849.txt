TITLE
Expression profiles of high differentiation-inducible murine erhthroleukemia cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells are differentiated by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), or trichostatin A (TSA) treatment. We analyzed expression profiles of high differentiation-inducible (HD) MEL cells during chemical induced differentiation.

DESIGN
HD MEL cells were cultured at 1, 6, 12, 24, or 36 hours with 1.5% DMSO, 5.0 mM HMBA, or 30 nM TSA. The RNA of HD-MEL cells before and after chemial treatment were compared. The expression ratio (After chemical treatment/Before chemical treatment) was calculated by average of technical quadruplicate microarray experiments includes two dye-swaps.
