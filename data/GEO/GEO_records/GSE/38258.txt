TITLE
CDK8 ChIP-seq from HCT116 cells in normoxia and hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To test if CDK8 acts directly at HIF1A target genes, we performed ChIP-seq experiments in HCT116 cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for CDK8 versus Input under normoxia and 24hrs hypoxia (1% O2).

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
