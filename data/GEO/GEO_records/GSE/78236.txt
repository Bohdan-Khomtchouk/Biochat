TITLE
Comparison of HCC cell lines and primary HCCs-RNAseq data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There are concerns about whether cancer cell lines could faithfully represent the matched primary cancer cells. Comparison of the HCC cell lines and primary HCCs demonstrated that, during long-term in vitro culture, cell lines retain the genetic landscape of the matched primary HCCs.

DESIGN
RNAseq and WGS comparison of of 9 matched primary HCCs, early-passage PDCs and late-passage cell lines.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
