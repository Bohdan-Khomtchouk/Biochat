TITLE
Alteration In Auxin Homeostasis By Overexpression Of PINOID Kinase Causes Leaf Growth Defects In Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We studied two growth phases- proliferation, and expansion in first pair of leaves in Arabidosis using two different overexpression lines of PID gene. Ectopic expression of PID lead to small rosette and leaf phenotype.

DESIGN
We used first pair of leaves from proliferation ( 9 DAS-days after stratification) and expansion (16 DAS) stage from wild type Col-0 ecotype, 35S::PID10, 35S::PID21. Three genotype, three biological replicates, two time points (=18 sample). Experiment repeated twice generating two reads in two lanes i.e. L001 & L002 for each sample. Results calculated after combining reads from both lanes (=18x2=36 raw files; 2 for each sample)
