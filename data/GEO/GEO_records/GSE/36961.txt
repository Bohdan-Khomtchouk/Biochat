TITLE
Transcriptome Profiling of Surgical Myectomy Tissue from Patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using a high-throughput gene expression profiling technology, we have been able to develop new hypotheses regarding the molecular pathogenic mechanisms of human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). It is hoped that these hypotheses, among others generated by this data, will fuel future research endeavors that will uncover novel biomarkers, prognostic indicators, and therapeutic targets to improve our ability to diagnose, counsel, and treat patients with this highly heterogeneous and potentially life-threatening condition.

DESIGN
Case-control study comparing the messenger RNA transcriptome of cardiac tissues from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to the transcriptome of control donor cardiac tissues.

PLATFORM
GPL15389 Illumina HumanHT-12 V3.0 expression beadchip
