TITLE
Genome-wide analyses reveal DNA methylation in the central nucleus of the amygdala is linked to anxious temperament in young primates

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
We used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to profiled 5-methylcytosine in the Ce of rhesus monkeys (N = 23) fully phenotyped for anxious temperament (AT) and identified 5,489 CpG sites (1,363 genes) with methylation levels predictive of individual differences in AT (FDR p-value < 0.05), including genes previously implicated in psychiatric-related disorders (e.g. GRIN1, GRM5, HTT, ADCYAP1, and SHANK3).

DESIGN
Used RRBS to profile the central nucleus of the amygdala of 23 monkeys and the resulting data analyzed using anxious temperament as a continuous trait using only age as a covariate.
