TITLE
miRNA Expression data from the uterus of ovariectomized young adult rats treated for three days with E2

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Examination of crosstalk between Aryl hydrocarbonreceptor (AHR) and Estrogen receptor (ER) in tha rat uterus on the level of miRNA transcriptome The study was designed to see the overall ncRNA-expression change in the uterus induced by E2

DESIGN
ovariectomized young adult rats were treated with vehicle control (DMSO)or 4µg/kg/d 17β-Estradiol (E2) for three consecutive days. Uteri were obtained 24 h after the last treatment. Biological samples from three rats were analyzed for each treatment group.
