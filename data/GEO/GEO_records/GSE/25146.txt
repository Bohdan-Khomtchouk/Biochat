TITLE
Changes in gene expression in AGS cells in response to Helicobacter pylori lipopolysaccharide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study set out to identify global changes in gene expression in AGS gastric epithelial cells following 8 hours stimulation with 10 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the gastric pathogen H. pylori. Microarray analysis was used to compare changes in gene expression between cells treated with 10 μg/ml H. pylori LPS and untreated cells at the same time point.

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from AGS cells following treatment with LPS for 8h or untreated cells at the same time-point. 2 independent experiments were carried out. RNA was labelled and hybridized to GeneChips to analyse changes in gene expression.
