TITLE
Gene expression signature and the prediction of lymph node metastases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples were taken from colorectal cancers in surgically resected specimens in 89 colorectal cancer patients. The expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Comparison between the sample groups allow to identify a set of discriminating genes that can be used for molecular markers for predicting lymph node metastases. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Eighty-nine colorectal cancer patients were studied. Samples from 89 patients were divided into a training set (69 samples) and a testing set (20 samples).
