TITLE
mRNA expression in CD4+ CD25+ GITR+ regulatory T cells from WT and Bach2 KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bach2 regulates homeostasis of foxp3+ regulatory T cells and protects against fatal lung disease in mice.

DESIGN
Cells from WT and Bach2 KO spleen were isolated. CD4+ CD25+ GITR+ (Treg) cells were sorted by FACS sorting. Total RNAs were extracted from sorted Treg cells using by Rneasy Kit (Qiagen).
