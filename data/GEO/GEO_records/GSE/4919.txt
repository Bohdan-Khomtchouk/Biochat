TITLE
Translation State Array Analysis of Thrombin Stimulated Human Endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Confluent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to Thrombin (2 U/mL) for 2 hours.  Ribosomal profiling via gradient centrifugation and fractionation was used to separate monosome, or under-translated, and polysome, or actively translated, mRNA species that were then used to probe cDNA arrays, a process known as Translation State Array Analysis (TSAA).  Four samples were obtained from these experiments, Control Monosome, Control Polysome, Thrombin Monosome, and Thrombin Polysome.  Using the normalized signal intensities from the GeneFilters, we calculated a translation index, or measure of movement of an mRNA molecule from the monosome to the polysome fraction upon stimulation.  This calculation was made as follows:  (thrombin polysome/thrombin monosome)/(control polysome/control monosome).  Translational indices greater than 2.5 (upregulated) or lower than 0.4 (downregulated) were chosen for further study.  TSAA data suggests that JunB is translationally regulated by thrombin stimulation.  Immunocytochemistry, western blotting and RT-PCR were used to verify the results of TSAA.
