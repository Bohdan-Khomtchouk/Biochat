TITLE
DNA methylation data from a separate set of human iPS cells and fibroblasts, and ES cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We used custom Nimblegen microarrays to determine the DNA methylation profiles of iPS cells, ES cells, and fibroblasts.

DESIGN
We isolated genomic DNA from iPS cells, ES cells, and fibroblasts and hybridized to custom-designed Nimblegen microarrays (CHARM arrays).
