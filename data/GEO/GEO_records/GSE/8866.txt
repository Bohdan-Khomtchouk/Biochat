SUMMARY
Genomic aberrations of Cyclin D1 (CCND1) and CDK4 in neuroblastoma indicate that dysregulation of the G1 entry checkpoint is an important cell cycle aberration in this pediatric tumor. Here we report that analysis of Affymetrix expression data of primary neuroblastic tumors shows an extensive over-expression of Cyclin D1 and CDK4 which correlates with histological subgroups and prognosis respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated an over-expression of Cyclin D1 in neuroblasts and a low Cyclin D1 expression in all cell types in ganglioneuroma. This suggests an involvement of G1 regulating genes in neuronal differentiation processes which we further evaluated using RNA interference against Cyclin D1 and its kinase partner CDK4 in several neuroblastoma cell lines. This resulted in pRb pathway inhibition as shown by an almost complete disappearance of CDK4 specific pRb phosphorylation; reduction of E2F transcriptional activity and a decrease of Cyclin A protein levels. The Cyclin D1 and CDK4  knock-down resulted in a significant reduction in cell proliferation, a G1 specific cell cycle arrest and moreover an extensive neuronal differentiation. Affymetrix microarray profiling of siRNA treated cells revealed a shift in expression profile towards a neuronal phenotype. Several new potential downstream players are identified. We conclude that neuroblastoma functionally depend on over-expression of G1 regulating genes to maintain their undifferentiated phenotype. Keywords: Neuroblastoma, CCND1, Cyclin D1, CDK4
