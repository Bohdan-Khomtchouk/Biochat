TITLE
Global peripheral blood gene expression study [HumanHT-12 V4.0]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples were collected from 'control participants' of the Heart and Vascular Health (HVH) study that constitutes a group of population based case control studies of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and atrial fibrillation (AF) conducted among 30-79 year old members of Group Health, a large integrated health care organization in Washington State.
