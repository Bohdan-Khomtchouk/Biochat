TITLE
Gene expression analysis of coronal pulp and apical pulp complexes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed this study to compare the gene expression pattern between coronal pulp and apical pulp complex There were no studies about gene expression of apical pulp complex tissue before. So We performed this study to confirm the gene expression of apical pulp complex tissues.

DESIGN
Coronal pulp tissues were collected from 11 healthy subjects. Gene expression profiles were conducted using cDNA microarray analysis. Apical pulp complex tissues were collected from 18 healthy subjects. Gene expression profiles were conducted using cDNA microarray analysis.
