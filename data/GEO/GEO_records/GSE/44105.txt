TITLE
Probing off-target effect of LMNA siRNA and pro-siRNA in HeLa-d1EGFP cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have develped a novel method of making siRNAs (named pro-siRNA for prokaryotic siRNA). To evaluate off-targeting of pro-siRNA, we compared mRNA expression profile of HeLa-d1EGFP cells transfected with 4 nM LMNA siRNAs and pro-siRNAs by microarray.

DESIGN
We used microarray to study off-target effect of siRNAs in HeLa-d1EGFP cell line. After transfection of siRNAs for 24 hrs, RNA were extracted using Trizol. RNA samples were sent to Microarray Core at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ( http://macf-web.dfci.harvard.edu/index.php?option=com_frontpage & =1 ) to be probed using Human Gene 1.0 ST (Affymetrix).
