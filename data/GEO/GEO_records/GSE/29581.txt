TITLE
Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) a new regulator of cell polarity required for metastatic dissemination of basal-like breast carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Basal-like breast carcinoma is characterized by the expression of basal/myoepithelial markers, undifferentiated phenotype, highly aggressive behaviour and a frequent triple negative status (ESR-, PR-, Her2neu-). We have previously shown that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs in basal-like breast tumours and identified Lysyl- Oxidase-Like 2 (LOXL2) as an EMT player and  a poor prognosis marker in squamous cell carcinomas.  We now show that LOXL2 mRNA is overexpressed in basal-like human breast carcinomas. Identification of new molecular markers in basal breast carcinomas

DESIGN
58 (IDC) infiltrative breast ductal carcinoma samples (Grade 3)
