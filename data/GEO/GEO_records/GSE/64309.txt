TITLE
Gene expression in liver of interleukin-18 knockout mice at 6 and 12 weeks of age

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Interleukin-18 knockout mice had metabolic syndromes after 24 weeks of age. We examined gene expression profiles in mice liver using genome-wide microarray technology, and compared gene expression profiles between wild-type and interleukin-18 knockout mice. To verify responsible molecules involved in metabolic syndromes such as obesity, we compared the gene expression levels at 6 and 12 weeks of age, and picked up them whose expression was more than 2-fold increase or less than 1/2-fold decrease.

DESIGN
The mouse whole livers derived from wild type and interleukin-18 knockout mice at 6 and 12 weeks of age were examined. Each strain was run in triplicate.
