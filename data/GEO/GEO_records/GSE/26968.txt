TITLE
B31 vs rrp1 mutant

ORGANISM
Borreliella burgdorferi

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of gene expression between parental strain B31 and rrp1 mutant. Cyclic-di-GMP is a bacterial second messenger that modulates many biological processes.  Although its role in bacterial pathogenesis during mammalian infection has been widely recognized, the role of c-di-GMP in pathogen's life cycle in vector hosts is less understood. The enzootic cycle of the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi involves both a mammalian host and an Ixodes tick vector.  The B. burgdorferi genome encodes a single copy of the diguanylate cyclase gene (rrp1), which is responsible for the production of c-di-GMP. To determine the role of c-di-GMP in the life cycle of B. burgdorferi, an Rrp1-deficient B. burgdorferi strain was generated. The rrp1 mutant remains infectious in the mammalian host, but could not survive in the tick vector. To identify the mechanisms of Rrp1 contributing to B. burgdorferi pathogenesis and gene regulation, microarray was employed to compare gene expression profiles between the parental strain B31 and the rrp1 mutant.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, B31 vs. rrp1 mutant. Biological replicates: 3 B31, 3 rrp1 mutant, independently grown and harvested. One replicate (dye-swap) per array.
