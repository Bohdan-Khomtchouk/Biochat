TITLE
Human ES cells reveal recurrent genomic instability at 20q11.21

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By analyzing five human embryonic stem (hES) cell lines over long-term culture, we detected a recurrent genomic instability in the human genome. An amplification of 2.5â€“4.6 Mb at 20q11.21, encompassing about 23 genes in common, appeared in four cell lines of different origins. This amplification, which has been associated with oncogenic transformation, may provide a selective advantage to hES cells in culture
