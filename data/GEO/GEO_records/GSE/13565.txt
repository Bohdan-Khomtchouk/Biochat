TITLE
Human ES cells reveal recurrent genomic instability at 20q11.21

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By analyzing five human embryonic stem (hES) cell lines over long-term culture, we detected a recurrent genomic instability in the human genome. An amplification of 2.5â€“4.6 Mb at 20q11.21, encompassing about 23 genes in common, appeared in four cell lines of different origins. This amplification, which has been associated with oncogenic transformation, may provide a selective advantage to hES cells in culture

DESIGN
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization, was performed on genomic DNA samples from different human embryonic stem cell lines, all cultured in our laboratory under the same conditions. VUB05-HD is an hES cell line carrying the Huntingtin mutant gene H1, H9, SA01, and VUB01 are various hES cell lines GSM341552 and GSM341553: SNP analysis GSM341589 to GSM341669: CGH analysis
