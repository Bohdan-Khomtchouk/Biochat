TITLE
Molecular signature of mineralocorticoid signalling in cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of hearts from double transgenic mice with conditional, cardiomyocyte-specific, overexpression of the mineralocorticoid (MR) or of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).

DESIGN
GR-mice vs controls, MR-mice vs controls. GR: 3 sample pools hybridized to 2 microarrays each. MR: 1 sample pool hybridized to 3 microarrays. Microarray contains triplicate spots.

PLATFORM
GPL10102 Mouse/human oligo array from MWG version FJ
