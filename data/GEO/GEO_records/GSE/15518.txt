TITLE
Transcription profile of K-ras activated murine menstruating uteri

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The expression of K-ras transgene is induced in  K-rasV12+/-/Cre+/+/ROSA26R-LacZ+/+ transgenic mice uteri, which were primed with hormone treatment. Decidualization was artificially induced in these uteri and hormone injection was withdrawn to induced menstruation-like endometrial degeneration. Microarray was then used to study the molecular changes in these menstruating uteri following the K-ras activation.
