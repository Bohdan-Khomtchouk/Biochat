TITLE
Burkholderia pseudomallei transcriptional adaptation in macrophage

ORGANISM
Burkholderia pseudomallei

SUMMARY
This study reports the expression profile of intracellular B. pseudomallei following infection of human macrophage-like U937 cells. The transcriptome of intracellular B. pseudomallei harvested from macrophage cells over an infection period of 6 hr (1, 2, 4 and 6 hr post-infection) were compared to in vitro grown bacteria to identify genes whose expression is altered in response to intracellular growth.

DESIGN
The experimental design of this study involved the total RNA from intracellular B. pseudomallei harvested from infected U937 cells at 4 selected time points with 3 biological replicates each. The microarray data from each time point was compared relative to in vitro grown bacteria in cell culture medium.
