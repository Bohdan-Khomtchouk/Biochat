TITLE
Burkholderia pseudomallei transcriptional adaptation in macrophage

ORGANISM
Burkholderia pseudomallei K96243

SUMMARY
This study reports the expression profile of intracellular B. pseudomallei following infection of human macrophage-like U937 cells. The transcriptome of intracellular B. pseudomallei harvested from macrophage cells over an infection period of 6 hr (1, 2, 4 and 6 hr post-infection) were compared to in vitro grown bacteria to identify genes whose expression is altered in response to intracellular growth.
