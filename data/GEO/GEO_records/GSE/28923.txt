TITLE
Gene expression in eosinophils from IL-5 transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dr. Paulson's group investigates the roles of carbohydrate-binding proteins involved in immune regulation and human disease, through their interaction with carbohydrate groups expressed on cell surface glycoconjugates. This laboratory is currently focused on how sialoside ligands modulate Siglec functions and on understanding the molecular basis of glycosylation changes following differentiation and activation of leukocytes.

DESIGN
Three RNA preparations from IL-5 transgenic C567/B1 adult mouse eosinophils were sent to Microarray Core (E). The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays. Data was analyzed to determine glycosyltransferase expression on mouse eosinophils, with specific interest in a cis-ligand of Siglec-F on eosinophils
