TITLE
Long-term androgen withdrawal and treatment (R1881) of LNCaP-FGC prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LNCaP cells were cultures in steroid depleted medium for 5 days before treatment with synthetic androgen (R1881, 10nM) for 16h. Transcriptomics analysis was performed to compare gene expression changes induced by androgen withdrawal or androgen treatment.

DESIGN
Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of LNCaP cells grown in steroid depleted medium, normal (steroid-containing) medium and R1881 treated cells was performed using the Agilent platform

PLATFORM
GPL14550 Agilent-028004 SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name Version)
