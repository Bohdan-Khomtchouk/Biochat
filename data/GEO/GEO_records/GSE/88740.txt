TITLE
Expression data of J3T-1 and J3T-2 glioma

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
We established two novel glioma subclones those showed different invasive and angiogenic phenotypes. J3T-1 demonstrates robust angiogenesis and perivascular invasion. J3T-2 demonstrates diffuse invasion along white matter tracts. We used microarrays to show the difference of gene expression that contribute to the difference of phenotype.

DESIGN
J3T-1 and J3T-2 were derived from the same parental canine glioma cell. These cell lines have similar genetic backgrounds but have different phenotypes of invasion and angiogenesis. We investigated each one of them.
