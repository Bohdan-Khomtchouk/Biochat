TITLE
Regulatory interplay of Cockayne syndrome B ATPase and stress-response gene ATF3 following genotoxic stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile in CS1AN deficient and CSBwt restored cell lines after 24 hours of UV or alphe-amanitin treatment (only for restored). The comaprison of expression profile between 0 and 24 hours revealed continouse suppresion of transcription upon UV treatment in CS1AN cell line and alpha-amanitin treated CS1AN CSBwt restored cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were obtained in duplicates for un-treated (assigned as 0h time point) and treated (assigned as 24h time point) cells.
