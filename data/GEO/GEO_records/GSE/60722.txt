TITLE
Regulation of casodex-dependent AR activity by NCOR1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Proliferation of prostate cancer cells, LNCaP, is suppressed by casodex. This suppression requires expression of AR coregulator, NCOR1.

DESIGN
We employed DNA microarrays to determine changes in casodex regulated gene expression with and without NCOR1
