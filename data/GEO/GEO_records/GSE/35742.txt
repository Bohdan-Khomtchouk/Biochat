TITLE
Gene expression variation in horse placental tissue, and resting and stimulated horse lymphocytes [Agilent-021322]

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
We undertook gene expression microarray experiments to identify genes that are differentially expressed in invasive (Chorionic Girdle) and non-invasive (Chorion) placental tissue, and resting and Pokeweed Mitogen (PWM) stimulated horse lymphocytes.  Conceptus tissues were dissected to obtain chorionic girdle, and chorion.  Freshly isolated horse peripheral blood lymphocytes were split and harvested immediately, or stimulated with PWM and harvested over a five day period. These experiments utilized a commercially available Agilent horse array that featured > 43,000 probes on a 4x44k array format.

DESIGN
Three day 33-35 chorionic girdle RNAs were compared to matching chorion RNAs. Gene expression in resting lymphocytes was compared to gene expression in PWM treated lymphocytes.
