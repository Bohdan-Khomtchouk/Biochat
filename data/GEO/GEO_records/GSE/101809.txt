TITLE
Expression data of lncRNA from MCF7 cells treated or not treated with TGF-β

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGF-β is a major inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during cancer progression, mainly by activating a set of pleiotropic transcription factors and other classes of genes We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying TGF-β-induced EMT and identified distinct classes of TGF-β-regulated lncRNAs during this process.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were treated with TGF-β continuously for 4 days for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain lncRNAs that are differentially regulated by TGF-β. To that end, MCF7 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of recombinant TGF-β1 for 4 days. TGF-β1 was replenished every 2 days with a fresh medium change.
