TITLE
Genomic polymorphism is genotyped to determine the association between genotypes and treatment outcomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina GoldenGate Genotyping Assay is a flexible, pre-optimized assay that uses a discriminatory DNA polymerase and ligase to interrogate 96 SNP loci simultaneously. This Assay utilizes the BeadArray Reader. Using this assay, we examined the distribution of the patients` genotypes to determine which genotype tends to have a better outcomes for cancer treatment.

DESIGN
To investigate genomic polymorphism, we collected whole blood samples from breast cancer patients before the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Genomic DNA was isolated from mononuclear cells and specific polymorphisms were analyzed by the GoldenGate assay was consisted of 96 custom selected SNPs within 34 genes. The labeled DNA were amplified and immobilized onto paramagnetic particles, and hybridized. BeadArray Reader was used to detect the data.
