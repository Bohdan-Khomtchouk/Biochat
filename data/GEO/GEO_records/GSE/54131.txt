TITLE
Temporal patterns of gene expression in developing maize endosperm identified through transcriptome sequencing

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Endosperm is a filial structure resulting from a second fertilization event in angiosperms. As an absorptive storage organ, endosperm plays an essential role in support of embryo development or seedling germination. The accumulation of carbohydrate and protein storage products in cereal endosperm provides humanity with a major portion of its food, feed and renewal resources. However, little is known regarding the regulatory gene networks controlling endosperm proliferation and differentiation. As a first step towards understanding these processes, we have profiled all mRNAs in kernel and endosperm of maize at eight successive stages during the first 12 days after pollination. Analysis of these gene sets has identified temporal programs of gene expression including hundreds of transcription-factor genes. We also show a close correlation of these sequentially expressed gene sets with distinct spatial programs of expression in distinct compartments of the developing endosperm. The results constitute a preliminary atlas of spatiotemproal patterns of endosperm gene expression in support of future efforts for understanding the underlying mechanisms that control seed yield and quality.

DESIGN
The unpollinated kernels (0 DAP), the kernels of 2, 3, 4, 6 DAP and hand dissected endosperms of 8, 10, 12 DAP from the B73 were used to perform high-throughput sequencing using the SOLiD platform

PLATFORM
