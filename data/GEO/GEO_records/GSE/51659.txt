TITLE
Positive and negative CD4+ T-cell immunoselection: effects on miRNA profile

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human CD4+ T-cell miRNAs were profiled by OpenArray after either positive or negative cytoselection

DESIGN
CD4+ T-cells were obtained from blood of three human donors by positive and negative immunoselection methods. The miRNA complement of positively and negatively selected cells was determined by OpenArray.
