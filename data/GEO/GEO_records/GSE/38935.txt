TITLE
Active DNA demethylation in plant companion cells reinforces transposon methylation in gametes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis thaliana central cell, the companion cell of the egg, undergoes DNA demethylation prior to fertilization, but the targeting preferences and biological significance of this process remain unclear. Here, we show that active DNA demethylation mediated by the DEMETER DNA glycosylase accounts for all of the demethylation in the central cell, and preferentially targets small, AT-rich and nucleosome-depleted transposable elements. The vegetative cell, the companion cell of sperm, also undergoes DEMETER-dependent demethylation of similar sequences, and lack of DEMETER in vegetative cells causes reduced small RNA-directed DNA methylation of transposons in sperm. Our results demonstrate that demethylation in companion cells reinforces transposon methylation in plant gametes, thereby assuring stable silencing of transposable elements across generations
