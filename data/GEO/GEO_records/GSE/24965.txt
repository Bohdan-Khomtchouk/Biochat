TITLE
Examining the transcriptome of growth arrested keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples of RNA from subconfluent, proliferative keratinocytes, TGF Î²1 treated keratinocytes and 7 days post confluent keratinocytes were hybridised to an RNA microarray to identify genes differentially expressed upon reversible (TGF B1) and irreversible (Confluence induced) growth arrest.

DESIGN
Quadruplicate total RNA isolated from proliferative, subconfluent keratinocytes, 15ng/mL TGF B1 treated keratinocytes and 7 days post confluent keratinocytes were hybridised to an RNA microarray to identify genes differentially expressed upon growth arrest.
