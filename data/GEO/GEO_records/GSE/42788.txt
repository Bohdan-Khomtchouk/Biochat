TITLE
Response of quiescent human fibroblasts to miR-22 overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Quiescent human fibroblasts (2091) were transfected with 100nM mature miR-22 RNA duplexes.  Cells were collected 24 hours after miR-22 transfection.

DESIGN
4 biological replicates were run, one for each of the 4 dual channel arrays.  Each biological replicate included a miR-22 transfection sample and a control transfection sample
