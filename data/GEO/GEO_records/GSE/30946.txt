TITLE
Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Activation in Infantile Fibrosarcoma/Congenital Mesoblastic Nephroma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify downstream pathways, diagnostic markers, and potential therapeutic targets for IFS/CMN.

DESIGN
Global gene expression of 14 cellular mesoblastic nephromas/infantile fibrosarcoma was compared with 10 RT, 16 clear cell sarcomas of the kidney, and 15 Wilms tumors using  Affymetrix U133A arrays to identify genetic pathways that clarify the pathogenesis of Rhabdoid Tumors and to discover new therapeutic targets for these tumors
