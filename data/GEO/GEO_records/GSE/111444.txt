TITLE
MiRNAs expression in supernatant after ultraviolet irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the mechanism of radiation induced bystander effect, we explored miRNAs expression in supernatant of human skin fibroblasts after culturing for 24h post UV irradiation. Primary human skin fibroblasts were obtained from healthy volunteers by means of a foreskin circumcision. Human skin fibroblasts was irradiated with 20J/cm2 UVA or 60mJ/cm2 UVB. Expression of miRNAs were tested by microarray between radiation and control samples.

DESIGN
Radiation-induced miRNA expression in supernatant of human skin fibroblasts was measured at 24 hours after exposure to doses of 20J/cm2 UVA or 60mJ/cm2 UVB.
