TITLE
The spatio-temporal program of DNA replication is driven by specific epigenetic signatures in human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of DNA replication origins in K562 mammalian cells. We have optimized a specific method of peak detection adapted to the signal produced by the sequencing of short nascent strands (SNS) that are specific of replication initiation, with the aim to have both a good sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrated the existence of the spatiao-temporal program of DNA replication driven by a specific epigenetic signature.

DESIGN
K562 human cells; five samples subjected to SNS-Seq.

PLATFORM
GPL9052 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Homo sapiens)
