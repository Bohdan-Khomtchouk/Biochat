TITLE
HP1 wa191.D.mel 3rd Instar Larvae Nuclei piwi2 mutant

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_5061 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Gary Karpen. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: We aim to determine the locations of the major histone modifications across the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The modifications under study are involved in basic chromosomal functions such as DNA replication, gene expression, gene silencing, and inheritance. We will perform Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) using genomic tiling arrays. We will initially assay localizations using chromatin from three cell lines and two embryonic stages, and will then extend the analysis of a subset of proteins to four additional animal tissues/stages. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
EXPERIMENT TYPE: CHIP-chip. BIOLOGICAL SOURCE: Strain: PIWI2 mutant(official name : piwi2 genotype : piwi2/piwi2 outcross : n/a transgene : P{ry11} tags : Transposon tag : GFP description : The stock is maintained over a CyO-GFP balancer description : and homozygous larvae are selected based on the absence of GFP.
