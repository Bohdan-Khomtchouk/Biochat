TITLE
Differentially expressed miRNAs between HepG2.2.15 and HepG2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MiRNAs are important posttranscriptional regulators in various physiological processes and their dysregulations have been found in diseases such as infection, imflammation and cancer. Here we compared the miRNA profilings between HBV-producing HepG2.2.15 and its non-HBV maternal HepG2 cell to find potential miRNAs involving in HBV expression. The result indicated that some of the deregulated miRNAs in HepG2.2.15 have been implicated in viral infection and the processes of the immune regulation.
