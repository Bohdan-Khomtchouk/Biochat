TITLE
Effects of UV and temperature on gene expression in the snakelocks sea anemone

ORGANISM
Anemonia viridis

SUMMARY
We monitored gene expression response of the symbiotic sea anemone Anemonia viridis subjected to a thermal and/or UV stress. A symbiosis-dedicated oligonucleotide microarray (2000 selected features) was generated, representing to date the only available oligonucleotide array used for symbiotic cnidarians (GPL10546). We are describing here the expression evolution during the first phase (5 days) of the stress.

DESIGN
Sea anemones were subjected to thermal stress (+10Â°C) and/or UV stress (+1.25 mW.cm-2), and compared to control. For each stress condition, kinetic sampling of whole tentacles from 3 specimens (biological replicates) was performed over a 5 days period: T0, T24h, T48h and T120h. For each sample, dye-swap hybridizations compared T0 and later time points. Statistical analysis combines the 3 biological replicates of each condition.
