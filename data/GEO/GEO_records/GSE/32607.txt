TITLE
Human lymphocyte activation during the G0 to G1 transition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Regulating the transition of T lymphocytes from quiescence into an activated, proliferating state involves initiation of programmes that result in cell cycle entry (proliferation) and the growth cycle (blastogenesis). This study analyses the expression of mRNA regulsted during the transition from quiescence into the cell cycle. We used micro-arrays to monitor the dynamical behaviour of expression of genes expressed in primary human T cells stimulated with CD3/CD28

DESIGN
T cells were collected for RNA extraction in quiescence (G0), and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 24 & 48 hours post-activation with CD3/CD28 beads. Differential expression was computed between 0 and 4 hours, 4 and 8 hours, and 8 and 24 hours. In particular, in our study we have made use of data for mRNA which change in expression between 0 and 24h post CD3/CD28 stimulation.
