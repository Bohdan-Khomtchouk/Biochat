TITLE
GLOBAL ANALYSIS OF CIRCULATING AND PLACENTAL MICRORNA SIGNATURES AND PREECLAMPSIA DEVELOPMENT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We perform placental microRNA expression profiling to identify potential microRNAs involved in the development and pathogenesis of preeclampsia. microRNA expression profiling for serum was quantified by qPCR and evaluated at 12, 16, and 20 gestational weeks and at the time of preeclampsia diagnosis. Two groups were evaluated using TaqMan Low Density Array plates: a control group with 18 normotensive pregnant women and a preeclampsia group with 16 patients who developed preeclampsia during the follow-up period. The placental microRNA profile was assayed at delivery (7 cases and 7 controls) using the Illumina GAIIx sequencing platform.

DESIGN
The placental microRNA profile was assayed at delivery (7 cases and 7 controls) using the Illumina GAIIx sequencing platform.

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
