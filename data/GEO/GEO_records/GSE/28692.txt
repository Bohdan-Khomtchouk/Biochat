TITLE
Transgenic overexpression of Tcfap2c/AP-2gamma results in liver steatosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We established a mouse model, in which transcription factor Tcfap2c can be activated in an inducible and reversible manner in somatic tissues, taking advantage of the tetracycline-dependent regulatory system. Induction of the transgene led to robust expression in all tissues (except brain and testis) and lead to rapid mortality within 3-7 days. In the liver, accumulation of microvesicular lipid droplets and breakdown of major hepatic metabolism pathways resulted in steatosis.

DESIGN
Transgenic and control mice were treated with doxycycline (1mg/d i.p.) three times (0, 24 and 48h) and liver samples were collected after 52h. In addition, primary hepatocytes isolated from transgenic and control animals were cultured with doxycycline for 3 days (1Âµg/ml).
