Active and repressive chromatin in the mammalian genome intersperse without spreading in imprinted gene clusters

SUMMARY
The Igf2r imprinted cluster is an epigenetic model of cis-acting silencing in which expression of a ncRNA silences multiple genes. Here, we map chromatin profiles on the maternal and paternal chromosome in a 250 kb region. We show that histone modifications associated with expressed and silent genes are mutually exclusive and localize to discrete regions. Expressed genes are modified in two ways; at promoter regions by H3K4me3+H3K4me2+H3K9Ac and on putative regulatory elements by H3K4me2+H3K9Ac. Repressed genes displayed two types of non-overlapping profiles. Type 1 localized to short regions and contained H3K9me3+H4K20me3 and sometimes HP1. Type 2 spanned a large domain containing multiple tissue-specific silent genes and contained H3K27me3 alone. These data identify different forms of repressive chromatin on chromosome arms that resemble constitutive and facultative heterochromatin but are restricted to short regions and interspersed with euchromatin.
