TITLE
Gene expression profiles from livers of ethinylestradiol- and chlorpromazine-treated C57BL6/mice after 25 days

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Toxicogenomics is used as a tool to identify mechanisms and markers of cholestasis in C57BL/6 mice treated by oral gavage using ethinylestradiol(EE2) and chlorpromazine (CPZ). A 25 day dose range finding study was performed, which resulted in no changes in clinical chemistry (serum cholesterol, total bile acids, and total bilirubin) or histopathology (hepatocyte vacuolization). Whole genome expression profiling of the liver was assessed after 25 days of repeated exposure with 10 mg/kg bw for CPZ and 3.70 mg/kg bw for EE2.

DESIGN
10 samples were analyzed per compound; 5 for the time-matched vehicle and 5 for the treatment. There are 20 samples in total. EE2 and CPZ were dissolved in sunflower oil and PBS, respectively.

PLATFORM
