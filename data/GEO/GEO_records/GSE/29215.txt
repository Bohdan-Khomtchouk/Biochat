TITLE
Transcriptome analysis and molecular marker discovery in red pepper, Capsicum annuum L. TF68

ORGANISM
Capsicum annuum

SUMMARY
Transcriptome from high throughput sequencing-by-synthesis is a good resource of molecular markers. In this study, we present utility of massively parallel sequencing by synthesis for profiling the transcriptome of red pepper (Capsicum annuum L. TF68) by 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing. Through the generation of approximately 30.63 megabases (Mb) of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) data with the average length of 375 base pairs (bp), 9,818 contigs and 23,712 singletons were obtained by assembly. Using BLAST alignment against NCBI non-redundant and a UniProt protein database, 30% of the tentative consensus sequences were assigned to specific function annotation, while 24% returned alignments of unknown function, leaving up to 46% with no alignment. Functional classification using FunCat revealed that sequences with putative known function were distributed cross 18 categories. Furthermore, over 200 high quality single nucleotide discrepancies were discovered using the Bukang cDNA collection as a reference database. Moreover, 758 simple sequence repeat (SSR) motif loci were mined from over 600 contigs, from which 572 primer sets were designed. The SSR motifs corresponded to di- and tri- nucleotide motifs (27.03 and 61.92%, respectively). These molecular markers may be of great value for application in linkage mapping and association mapping research.
