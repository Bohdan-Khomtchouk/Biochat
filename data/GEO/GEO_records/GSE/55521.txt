TITLE
Methylome of a low-grade invasive GIST

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A low-grade invasive gastro-intestinal stromal tumour (GIST) was subjected to whole-genome sequencing as well as methylation profiling using Illumina 450K BeadChip array, in order to determine the minimal set of genomic and epigenomic alterations necessary to trigger the formation of invasive GIST.

DESIGN
single-sample study, DNA extracted from fresh frozen tissue.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
