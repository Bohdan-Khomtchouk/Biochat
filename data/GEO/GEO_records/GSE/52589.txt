TITLE
Early SIV infection and effects of pathogenic and commensal enteric bacteria on expression in ileum tissue

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
We used the ileal loop model to assess the effects of enteric bacteria organisms on host gene expression in intestinal tissue independent of and following early SIV infection. SIV infection in the gut causes rapid and severe immune dysfunction and damage to the intestinal structure, this may alter the intimate interaction with lumenal organisms. This study was performed to determine whether early SIV infection, prior to the depletion of CD4+ T cells, can alter interaction of the host with pathogenic Salmonella serovar Typhimurium (ST) or commensal Lactobacillus plantarum (LP), and to further understand the earliest changes to the intestinal mucosa following SIV infection. We used microarray analysis to detail the global program of gene expression underlying changes in the ileum following early SIV infection, and if these changes in any way alter the host interaction/ response to pathogenic and commensal enteric bacteria.

DESIGN
A subset of animals were infected with SIVmac251 for 2.5 days, following which they underwent a loop surgery where the ileum was sectioned off with surgical ties and bacteria (ST or LP) or their respective media controls (LB or MRS) were injected intralumenally. Following 5 hours of incubation the loops were excised and frozen. Tissue sections were cut and RNA extracted for gene expression analysis. Rhesus Macaques infected with SIVmac251 for 2.5 days compared to uninfected controls. Comparisons are of ileum loop sections injected with Salmonella serovar Typhimurium, Lactobacillus Plantarum or respective media controls LB or MRS.
