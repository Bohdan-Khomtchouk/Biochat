TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling on Stably Expressing Full Length (FL) JM-a CYT-1 or CYT-2 ERBB4 isoforms in  MCF10A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Convergent and divergent effects of two FL ERBB4 isoforms on gene expression in normal-like MCF10A mammary epithelial cells lacking endogeneous ERBB4 expression.

DESIGN
Control vector (VEC) and ERBB4 expression MCF10A cells(CYT1 or CYT2) were serum starved for 48 hours and incubated with or without ERBB4 ligand NRG1 for 2h.  RNA samples were collected and analyzed.
