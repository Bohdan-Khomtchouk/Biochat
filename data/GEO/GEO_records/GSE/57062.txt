TITLE
Improved tagmentation-based whole genome bisulfite sequencing for input DNA from less than 100 cells

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We improved the tagmentation-based whole genome bisulfite sequencing technology, enabling stable library construction with complexity from minimally 0.5ng of initial genomic DNA, which equals less than 100 cells. This new approach is highly attractive for the complete methylome analysis of very limited cell numbers, e.g., pre-implantation embryos, or tiny biopsy specimens.

DESIGN
Applying this newly modified T-WGBS, we sequenced the methylome of a rice strain using libraries constructed from 10 ng, 1 ng and 0.5 ng of input genomic DNA. Two libraries were independently constructed and sequenced for each aliquot of input genomic DNA

PLATFORM
