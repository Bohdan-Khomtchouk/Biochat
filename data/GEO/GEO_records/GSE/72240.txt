Expression data from fetal sheep immunocytes

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
study investigating the initiation of systemic inflammatory signaling in fetuses exposed to TLR-4 agonist lipopolysaccharides from E.coli microarray was used to determine the inflammatory transcriptome in circulating fetal immunocytes

DESIGN
fetal sheep at 92d GA were catheterised prior to intraamniotic exposure fo saline or lipopolysaccharides for 48h prior to euthanasia
