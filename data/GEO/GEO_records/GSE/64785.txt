TITLE
Genome wide nucleosome specifity and function of chromatin remodellers in embryonic stem cells [Chd9]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
How various ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers bind to nucleosomes to regulate  transcription is not well defined in mammalian cells. Here, we present genome-wide  remodeller-interacting nucleosome profiles for Chd1, Chd2, Chd4, Chd6, Chd8, Chd9, Brg1  and Ep400 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. These remodellers bind to nucleosomes at  specific positions, either at one or both nucleosomes that flank each side of nucleosome-free  promoter regions (NFRs), at enhancer elements, or within gene bodies. At promoters,  bidirectional transcription commonly initiates on either side of remodeller-bound  nucleosomes. Transcriptome analysis upon remodeller depletion reveals reciprocal  mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by remodellers. At active genes, certain remodellers  are positive regulators of transcription, whereas others act as repressors. At bivalent genes,  which are bound by repressive Polycomb complexes, the same remodellers act in the opposite  way. Together, these findings reveal how remodellers integrate promoter nucleosomal  architecture to regulate ES cell transcription programs.
