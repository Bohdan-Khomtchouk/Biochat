TITLE
SNP data from 82 lung carcinomas and 2 cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SNP profiles from 82 lung carcinomas and 2 cell lines were analyzed to detect potential tumor suppressors in lung cancer. Homozygous deletions revealed two interesting candidates with ARID domains, which were further characterized by sequencing in the whole series.

DESIGN
82 lung carcinomas and 2 cell lines were analyzed with Illumina HumanCNV370-Duo v1.0 chips.

PLATFORM
GPL6986 Illumina HumanCNV370-Duov1 DNA Analysis BeadChip (HumanCNV370v1)
