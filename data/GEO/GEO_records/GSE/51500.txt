TITLE
TIA-proteins suppress cell and tumor growth via promoting  select p53 gene targets-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The knock down of T-cell intracellular antigen (TIA) proteins enhances the acquisition of aberrant cellular phenotypes promoting uncontrolled cell and tumor growth. Hereby, we report that inducible expression of either TIA1 or TIAR in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells represses cell proliferation. Mechanistically, the sustained expression of either TIA1 or TIAR protein abolishes endogenous TIA1/TIAR protein expression via regulating splicing of their own pre-mRNAs. This event is concomitant with cell cycle arrest and cell death by apoptosis. Based on genome-wide analysis of the transcript expression patterns in HuR-, TIA1- or TIAR-expressing HEK293 cells, we found regulatory links among the up-regulation on a select subset of p53 pathway genes involved in G1/S cell-cycle and apoptosis control. Finally, nude mice injected with TIA1- or TIAR-expressing HEK293 cells decrease, and even abolishing, the growth of tumor xenografts relative to control cells. Collectively, these observations show that TIA proteins can function as tumor suppressor genes.

DESIGN
