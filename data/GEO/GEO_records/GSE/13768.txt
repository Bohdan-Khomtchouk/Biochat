TITLE
Maize grown under normal field conditions vs under 60% shade or under 2X density

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
These experiments were to investigate changes in gene expression associated with maize competition for light when grown at double normal population density or under 60% shaded conditions as opposed to when maize is grown under normal field conditions.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates (collected from separate field plots) comprised of pooled samples of 4 plants from each treatment were hybridized in a rolling circle dye swap hybridization screen.

PLATFORM
GPL4521 Maize SAM1.2 Array
