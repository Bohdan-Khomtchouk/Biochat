TITLE
Genes regulated by vitamin D in bronchial smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Studied gene regulation in bronchial smooth muscle cells following vitamin D stimulation. Keywords: comparison

DESIGN
Human primary bronchial smooth muscle cells were from the same patient in all hybridization. Cells were treated for 24 hours with 100 nM of 1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 or with the same concentration of vehicle (ethanol at 0.05%). The experiment was done in triplicates (a total of 6 samples were analyzed).
