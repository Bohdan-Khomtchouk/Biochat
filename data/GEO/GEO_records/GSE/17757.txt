TITLE
Gene expression data from primate postnatal brain in prefrontal cortex: time course

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta ; Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes determine functional differentiation during development and are associated with functional decline during aging. While developmental changes are tightly regulated, regulation of aging changes is not well established. To assess the regulatory basis of age-related changes and investigate the mechanism of regulatory transition between development and aging, we measured mRNA and microRNA expression patterns in brains (superior frontal gyrus) of humans and rhesus macaques over the entire species’ lifespan. We find that in both species, developmental and aging changes overlap in the course of lifetime with many changes found at the late age initiating in early childhood.

DESIGN
Human post-mortem brain samples from the superior frontal gyrus region of the prefrontal cortex were collected. The age ranges of the indibiual in human covered its whole life span fom newborn to death. RNA extracted from the dissected tissue was hybridized to Affymetrix® Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. Rhesus macaque post-mortem brain samples from the superior frontal gyrus region of the prefrontal cortex were collected. The age ranges of the indibiual in rhesus macaque covered the  whole life span fom newborn to death. RNA extracted from the dissected tissue was hybridized to Affymetrix® Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
