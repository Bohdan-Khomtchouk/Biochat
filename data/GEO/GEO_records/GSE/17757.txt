TITLE
Gene expression data from primate postnatal brain in prefrontal cortex: time course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes determine functional differentiation during development and are associated with functional decline during aging. While developmental changes are tightly regulated, regulation of aging changes is not well established. To assess the regulatory basis of age-related changes and investigate the mechanism of regulatory transition between development and aging, we measured mRNA and microRNA expression patterns in brains (superior frontal gyrus) of humans and rhesus macaques over the entire speciesâ€™ lifespan. We find that in both species, developmental and aging changes overlap in the course of lifetime with many changes found at the late age initiating in early childhood.
