TITLE
Infection of MK2 cells with monkeypox virus

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Orthopox viruses, including monkeypox, multiply intracellularly and induce numerous changes in host genes expression.  The virus target mainly humoral host response, and simultaneously, exploits other genes and functions to reproduce effectively.  The goal of this experiment is to identify those host genes and functions that are essential for monkeypox virus replication.

DESIGN
Mock infected control cells were treated and incubated identically to time point arms, except for virus exposure.  Two time points of cells infected with monkeypox virus were harvested at 3, 7 hours post infection, and gene expression was assessed using microarray in all arms.  The experiment was done in triplicate.
