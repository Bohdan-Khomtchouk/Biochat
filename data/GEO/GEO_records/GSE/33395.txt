TITLE
Developing seeds of M955 low phytic acid barley 7 days after anthesis

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Effect of the low phytic acid mutation on gene expression of developing seeds of M955, a low phytic acid barley genotype with > 90% reduction in phytic acid in mature seeds. Expression analysis using the Barley1 GeneChip was performed on total RNA from developing seeds (7DAA) of M955 lpa and wt sib-selections.  Sib-selections were from BC2 populations of M955 with Harrington as the recurrent parent. Material was grown in field trials in two years 2003 and 2004. In 2003 expression analysis was done from 2 lpa and 3 wt sib-selections, and in 2004 analysis was done from 2 lpa and 2 wt sib-selections.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  David Bowen.
