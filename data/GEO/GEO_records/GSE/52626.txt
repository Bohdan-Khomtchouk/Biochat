TITLE
Expression data from longissimus dorsi of backcross Iberian x Landrace individuals

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The integration of the results of QTL fine-mapping with microarray expression data offers a promising tool for understanding the genetic mechanisms influencing complex traits as fatty acid composition in pigs. The expression level of each probe may be treated as a quantitative trait and the marker genotypes used to map loci with regulatory effect on the gene expression level (eQTL) According to our previous linkage results, we carry out an eQTL scan focused on chromosomal regions showing tissue-consistent effects on fatty acids with Longissimus dorsi gene expression data in order to detect potentional candidate genes underlying the QTL previously detected.

DESIGN
102 IberianxLandrace backcross pigs were selected for RNA extraction and  hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. An eQTL scan was carried out with the data of 470 probes of the microarray taking into account they were related with fatty acid metabolism
