TITLE
Comparison of Hox6 mutant and control E12.5 mouse pancreas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hox genes are critical developmental transcription factor. We found that in mice with disrupted expression of Hoxa6, Hoxb6 and Hoxc6 there is significantly disrupted endocrine pancreas development. We used microarray analysis to probe for possible molecular mechanisms involed in Hox6 signaling in pancreas development.

DESIGN
We dissected pancreata from E12.5 control and Hox6 null embryos and extracted total RNA.
