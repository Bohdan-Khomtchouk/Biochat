TITLE
KLF15 Establishes the Landscape of Circadian Expression in the Heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the heart, KLF15 directs a biphasic circadian rhythm, while preventing extraneous oscillation at the transcriptomic level.

DESIGN
We compared the cardiac circadian transcriptome of KLF15 KO (cK15) and control (Î±-MHC cre) mice using RNA sequencing analysis (RNAseq)
