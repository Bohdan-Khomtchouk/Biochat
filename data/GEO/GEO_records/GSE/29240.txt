TITLE
Yersinia pestis uses AHL-based quorum sensing to regulate metabolic functions likely to be important for flea colonization

ORGANISM
Yersinia pestis

SUMMARY
The etiologic agent of bubonic plague, Yersinia pestis, senses cell density-dependent chemical signals to synchronize transcription between cells of the population in a process named quorum sensing. Though the closely related enteric pathogen Y. pseudotuberculosis uses quorum sensing system to regulate motility, the role of quorum sensing in Y. pestis has been unclear. In this study we performed transcriptional profiling experiments to identify Y. pestis quorum sensing regulated functions. Our analysis revealed that acyl-homoserine lactone based quorum sensing controls the expression of several metabolic functions. Maltose fermentation and the glyoxylate bypass are induced by acyl-homoserine lactone signaling. This effect was seen to be temperature conditional. Metabolism is unresponsive to quorum sensing regulation at mammalian body temperature, indicating a potential role for quorum sensing regulation of metabolism specifically during colonization of the flea vector. It is proposed that utilization of alternative carbon sources may enhance growth and/or survival during prolonged flea colonization, contributing to maintenance of plague in nature.

DESIGN
Six independent RNA samples from Y. pestis CO92 R114 AHL deficient cultures were paired with six independent RNA samples from control Y. pestis CO92 R88 cultures for hybridization to six two-color microarrays. For three arrays, the control RNA sample was labeled with Alexa 555 dye and the experimental RNA sample was labeled with Alexa 647 dye; the dyes were reversed for the other three arrays to account for any dye bias.

PLATFORM
GPL9009 JCVI PFGRC Yersinia pestis 18K v5 array designed primarily based on strain CO92
