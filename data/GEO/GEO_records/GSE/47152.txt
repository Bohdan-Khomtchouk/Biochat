TITLE
Shear Stress and NOTCH1 Regulate Calcification Related Genes in Human Aortic Valve Endothelium (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We are interested in the role of NOTCH1 and Shear Stress in Aortic Valve Endothelium.

DESIGN
Primary aortic valve endothelial cells were infected with NOTCH1 intracellular domain fused with a myc tag in order to perform ChIP-seq.
