TITLE
Expression data from egy wildtype and mutant embryo comparison

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
U4/U6 di-snRNPs were disrupted and singular U4 and U6 snRNPs accumulated in egy mutant embryos, establishing the recycling function of p110 in vivo. Based on microarray analyses, a subset of spliceosome components and splicing-related factors was coordinately upregulated in the egy mutant. This revealed an extensive network of coregulated components of the spliceosome cycle, compensating – albeit inefficiently – for the recycling defect. In contrast, another set of genes, many of them eye- and pancreas-specific, was downregulated in the egy mutant embryos. Keywords: mut / wt comparison
