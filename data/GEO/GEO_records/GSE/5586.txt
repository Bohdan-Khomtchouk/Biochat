TITLE
Expression data from egy wildtype and mutant embryo comparison

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
U4/U6 di-snRNPs were disrupted and singular U4 and U6 snRNPs accumulated in egy mutant embryos, establishing the recycling function of p110 in vivo. Based on microarray analyses, a subset of spliceosome components and splicing-related factors was coordinately upregulated in the egy mutant. This revealed an extensive network of coregulated components of the spliceosome cycle, compensating – albeit inefficiently – for the recycling defect. In contrast, another set of genes, many of them eye- and pancreas-specific, was downregulated in the egy mutant embryos. Keywords: mut / wt comparison

DESIGN
Zebrafish earl grey (egy) mutant embryos carry an autosomal recessive defect in the p110-orthologous gene which leads to microcephaly, microphthalmia, underdevelopment of the pharyngeal arches, and thymus hypoplasia by day 8 of development. To characterize the defect on the transcriptional level, egy whole embryos (n > 100) were collected and morphologically separated into pools of mutant (mut) and wildtype (wt) sibling embryos. Pools of embryos were collected at 2 time points (3 and 4 days post fertilization) with 2 and 3 biological replicates, resp.. After RNA extraction, labelled cRNA was hybridized onto Affymetrix microarrays.
