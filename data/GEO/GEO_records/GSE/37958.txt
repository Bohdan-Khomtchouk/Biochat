TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by addition of serum from L/MDR irradiated mice at 10 and 20 days.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The expression changes were detected by addition of serum form L/MDR irradiated mice at 10 and 20 days in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

DESIGN
(Expression of MEFs by addition of serum from nonirradiated mice) vs (Expression of MEFs by addition from L/MDR irradiated mice)
