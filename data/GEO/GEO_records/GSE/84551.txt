TITLE
Lymphatic endothelial cells comparison gene array data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GeneChip® Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array for C57BL/6 mouse skin dermal primary lymphatic endothelial cells (Ms LEC) and mouse lymphatic endothelial cell line SVEC4-10 GeneChip® Human Gene 2.0 ST Array for human primary lymphatic endothelial cells (Hu LEC) Total RNA from lymphatic cell line SVEC4-10 were used for GeneChip® Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array.

DESIGN
SVEC4-10 samples, human and mouse LEC samples.
