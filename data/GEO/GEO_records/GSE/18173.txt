TITLE
Expression data in HeLa S3 cells transfected with control-, UAP56- or URH49-siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nuclear export of mRNA is an essential process for eukaryotic gene expression. TREX complex couples the gene expression from transcription and splicing to mRNA export. Sub2, a core component of TREX complex in yeast is diversified to two closely related RNA helicases, UAP56 and URH49 in human.UAP56 and URH49 are required for bulk poly (A)+ RNA export but their target genes are quite different. In conclusion, UAP56 and URH49 have a different function in vivo despite the highly similarity.

DESIGN
Cytoplasmic RNA was prepared in HeLa cells transfected with control-, UAP56- and URH49-siRNA and analyzed by gene expression array.
