TITLE
Differential genes in adipocytes induced from polycystic ovary syndrome-derived and non- polycystic ovary syndrome-derived human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular mechanisms of obesity and insulin resistance in the patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) at the level of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).Three PCOS-derived and one non-PCOS-derived hESC lines were induced into adipocytes, and then total mRNA was extracted from these adipocytes. The differential genes between PCOS-derived and non-PCOS-derived adipocytes were identified with GeneChip, and then were validated with real-time PCR.There were 153 differential genes. Of the 153 genes, 91 genes were up-regulated and 62 down-regulated. Nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2 (NR0B2) was an up-regulated gene, and GeneChip software system indicated that it was associated with obesity and diabetes.

DESIGN
Three PCOS-derived and one non-PCOS-derived hESC lines were induced into adipocytes, and then total mRNA was extracted from these adipocytes. The differential genes between PCOS-derived and non-PCOS-derived adipocytes were identified with GeneChip, and then were validated with real-time PCR.
