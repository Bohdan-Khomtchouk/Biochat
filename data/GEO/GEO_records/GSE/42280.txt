TITLE
BSO-treated blastocysts vs CTL-treated blastocysts

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In order to understand how in vitro culture affects embryonic quality, we analyzed survival and global gene expression in bovine blastocysts after exposure to increased oxidative stress conditions of IVC. A pro-oxidant agents that act intra-cellularly by inhibiting GSH synthesis (0.4 mM buthionine sulfoximine [BSO]) was added from days 3 to 7, and transcriptomic analysis was then performed in resulting blastocysts. Precisely, after in vitro maturation and fertilization, bovine zygotes were culture in vitro in normal condition, then at day 3, embryos were allocated into culture in control or supplemented with BSO (0.4 mM) until day 7. At this time, blastocysts were harvested and analyzed. Our hypothesis was that BSO treatment will affect blastocyst survival and gene expression associated with low embryo quality

DESIGN
4 replicates of 10 blast/rep was produced for BSO and control treatment. According to a dye swap design with 2 colors, 4 arrays were used to compare BSO (green) against CTL (red) and 4 arrays were used to compared BSO (red) againt CTL (green).
