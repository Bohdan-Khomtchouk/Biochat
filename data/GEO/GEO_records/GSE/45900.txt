TITLE
Characterizing gene expression changes that accompany succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) RNA editing in monocyte-enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify global changes in gene expression that accompany induction of site-specific RNA editing that targets the SDHB gene in monocyte-enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures. The results provide important information to understand the function of this programmed SDHB RNA mutation within the context of global gene expression changes that occur in cultured immune cells when the editing is induced. The study also specifically tests whether expression changes occur in SDH subunit genes, cytidine deaminase family of genes and hypoxia-inducible pathways.

DESIGN
Overall design includes pairwise comparison of total gene expression profiles from uncultured cold-aggregated PBMCs (day 0), low-editing (culture day 3) and high-editing (culture days 5-8) samples, each from 4 donors. Submitted manuscript reported summary results from comparison of cultured low- and high-editing samples.
