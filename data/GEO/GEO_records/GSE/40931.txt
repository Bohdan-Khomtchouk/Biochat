TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mRNA expression alterations of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (Malt1) -/- or Wild Type (WT) Naïve T cells induced to differentiate into (T helper) Th1 or Th17 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to examine gene expression changes at two time points following the induction of differentiation of Malt1 deficient Naive T cells into Th1 or Th17 cells.  The present study aims to find the effect that Malt1 deficiency has on lineage specific T cell differentiation.  Malt1 is a NF kappa B regulator and plays a key role in peripheral T cell activation and proliferation, but its role in T cell differentiation is not clear. Aspects of the latter are what the current data set investigates.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from naïve T cells at two time points following induction to lineage specific T helper cells.
