TITLE
Gold induction of C. metallidurans CH34

ORGANISM
Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34

SUMMARY
Whole-genome expression microarray experiments were conducted to assess the response of C. metallidurans CH34 to aqueous Au(III)-chloride and identify possible biochemical pathways for Au detoxification. Four microarray experiments were conducted to assess gold response at low, medium and high Au(III)-chloride concentrations (i.e., 10, 50 and 100 µM Au(III)-chloride) and different induction times (10 and 30 minutes with 50 µM Au(III)-chloride). Based on these arrays, the differentially expressed genes upon gold-exposure can be identified.

DESIGN
The four microarray experiments (10, 50 and 100 µM Au(III)-chloride at 10 minutes and 50 µM Au(III)-chloride at 30 minutes) were all performed in biological triplicate and containing three (in-slide) technical repeats. For all conditions, the metal-induced sample (Cy5) was compared with the non-induced sample (Cy5) to identify those genes that were differentially expressed upon gold exposure.
