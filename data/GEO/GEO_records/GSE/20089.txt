TITLE
Pseudopod Experiment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell body and pseudopod RNA are differentially regulated during the migration of the metastatic cancer cells.We wanted to identify the RNA which are upregulated in the pseudopodial (PS) fraction as compared to cell body fraction (CB). We used microarray to see which are the RNAs upregulated in the PS fraction as compared to CB fraction

DESIGN
PS and CB fractions were isolated from six different metatstatic cell lines
