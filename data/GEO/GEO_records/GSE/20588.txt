TITLE
Effect of rosiglitazone on adipose gene expression in HSL knockout mice with different diet treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To test whether HSL is required for the supply of intrinsic ligands for PPARg for normal adipose differentiation, HSL-/- and wild type (WT) littermates were fed normal chow (NC) and high fat (HF) diets supplemented with or without rosiglitazone (200 mg/kg) for 16 weeks. The expression of diabetes related genes in the WAT of the animals was analyzed using Oligo GEArray Mouse Diabetes Microarrays (OMM-023, SABiosciences, Frederick, MD). Together with other biochemical and physiological data, our results suggest that one of the mechanisms by which HSL modulates adipose metabolism is by providing intrinsic ligands for PPARg.

DESIGN
To examine the changes in gene expression in WAT of WT and HSL-/- mice with rosiglitazone and diet treatment, RNA isolated from 4 animals of each group were used for studies of gene expression profiles using Oligo GEArray Mouse Diabetes Microarrays (OMM-023, SABiosciences, Frederick, MD). Data were analyzed using GEArray Expression Analysis Suite (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD) and SAM programs to comprehensively evaluate the differential gene expression of the various samples.
