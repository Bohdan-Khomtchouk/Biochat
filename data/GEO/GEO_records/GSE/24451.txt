TITLE
Knockout of the Acyl CoA binding protein (ACBP) in mice - expression profile from the liver of 21 days old ACBP-/- and +/+ mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ACBP knockout were created by targeted disruption of the gene in mice. The expression profiling was performed on liver tissue from ACBP-/- (KO) and +/+ (WT) mice at the age of 21 days, which in our study is the time immediately before weaning. The mice used for this experiment were taken directly away from their mother. Thus, having free access to chow and breast milk until sacrificed at 8-11am

DESIGN
15 ACBP-/- and 15 +/+ control mice divided into 6 groups (KO1, KO2, KO3, WT1, WT2 and WT3) with 5 individuals in each group were used for this study.
