TITLE
Menin Enhances c-Myc-mediated Transcriptional Activity To Promote Cancer Progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MYC is a master regulator of transcription in growing cells. Menin is an enigmatic protein that displays unique ability to either suppress or promote tumorigenesis in a context dependent manner. It's interesting to ask is there any relationship between MYC and menin.Here, we used RNA-seq to study global transcriptomic expression of MYC or MEN1 knockdown HT1080 cells to investigate whether there are any correlations between MYC- and menin- regulated gene expression. Besides, , we performed ChIP-seq assays for MYC and Menin binding sequences to address whether Menin and MYC share some common binding sites on chromatin.

DESIGN
Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells were transfected with MYC shRNAs, MEN1 shRNAs or non-targeting control shRNA followed by RNA extraction and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens). And also we performed MYC ChIP-seq and Menin ChIP-seq to address whether Menin and MYC share some common binding sites on chromatin.RNA Pol II ChIP-seq for NTC and shMEN1 HT1080 cell samples were used to study the effect of Menin on RNA Pol II-mediated elongation.
