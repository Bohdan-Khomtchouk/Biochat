TITLE
Rat esophagus: Control vs. NMBA vs. Tocopherols

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of rat esophageal epithelium comparing control animals, NMBA treated animals, with tocopherols intervention animals. Goal was to determine the effects of tocopherols on gene expression underlying the chemoprevention of NMBA-induced esophageal carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
Five experimental groups: Control, NMBA, NMBA supplemented with Alpha-, Delta, and Gamma-enriched Tocopherol. Biological replicates: 5 replicates each group.
