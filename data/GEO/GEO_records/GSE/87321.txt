TITLE
Complete atrio-ventricular canal defects in mouse hearts lacking G-protein receptor kinases

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Combined ablation of all 3 cardiac-expressed GRKs in the developing mouse heart impaired Hedgehog/Smoothened and GATA signaling, recapitulating heart abnormalities of human Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect.

DESIGN
Cardiac transcriptomes from mouse E13.5 hearts (8 wt, 8 haploinsufficient  GRK2+/-GRK5-/-GRK6-/- and 7 GRK-triple knockout GRK2-/-GRK5-/-GRK6-/-) were generated via Illumina RiboZeroGold rRNA depletion and subsequent single-end 50 nt sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2500

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
