TITLE
Global gene expression profile of small intestine from wild-type and NHE3-knockout mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify changes in gene expression levels between wild-type and NHE3-knockout small intestine. Keywords: gene expression comparison

DESIGN
Six wild-type and six NHE3-knockout small intestinal RNA samples were compared.  To facilitate statistical analysis and reduce affects of Cy3 and Cy5 labeling, three sets were done with reciprocal dye flips.
