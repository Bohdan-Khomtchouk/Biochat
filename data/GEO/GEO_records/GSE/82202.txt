TITLE
Identification of cell cycle regulated, DHT induced AR binding events

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The androgen receptor (AR) is required throughout all stages of disease progression.  Despite this, little is known about the function of AR in the mitotic cell cycle.  Here, we report novel AR binding as a result of examining the AR cistrome in actively cycling cells.

DESIGN
AR binding was assessed in LNCaP prostate cancer cells arrested in various cell cycle phases and stimulated with DHT in order to identify novel, cell cycle regulated binding.
