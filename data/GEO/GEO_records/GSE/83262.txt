TITLE
Dual role of LESION SIMULATING DISEASE 1 as a condition-dependent scaffold protein and transcription regulator in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Since its discovery over two decades ago as an important cell death regulator in Arabidopsis thaliana, the role of LESION SIMULATING DISEASE 1 (LSD1) has been studied intensively within both biotic and abiotic stress responses as well as with respect to plant fitness regulation. However, its molecular mode of action remains enigmatic. Here we demonstrate that nucleo-cytoplasmic LSD1 interacts with a broad range of other proteins that are engaged in various molecular pathways such as ubiquitination, methylation, cell cycle control, gametogenesis, embryo development and cell wall formation. The interaction of LSD1 with these partners is dependent on redox status, as oxidative stress significantly changes the quantity and types of LSD1-formed complexes. Furthermore, we show that LSD1 regulates the number and size of leaf mesophyll cells and affects plant vegetative growth. Importantly, we also reveal that in addition to its function as a scaffold protein, LSD1 acts as a transcriptional regulator. Taken together, our results demonstrate that LSD1 plays a dual role within the cell by acting as a condition-dependent scaffold protein and as a transcription regulator.
