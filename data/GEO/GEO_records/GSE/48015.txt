TITLE
Expression data from Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli SCI-07 ; Escherichia coli O08

SUMMARY
Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) are a group of extra-intestinal E. coli that infect poultry, and are able to cause a variety of diseases, systemic or localized, collectively designated as colibacillosis. Colibacillosis is the most common bacterial illness in poultry production, resulting in significant economic losses world-wide. Despite of its importance, pathogenicity mechanisms of APEC strains remain not completelly elucidated and available vaccines are not fully effectives. In order to better understand which genes could be related to pathogenicity in different APEC isolated, a microarray analyses of two APEC strains representing: Swollen Head Syndrome and Omphalitis was carried out.

DESIGN
We used the microarray methodology to evaluate the expression profile of two different APEC strains
