Defense signaling in potato

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Potato cultivar Russet Norkotah was grown in a growth chamber at 16 hour light/8 hour dark at 22°C fertilized with Osmocote.  Plants were from tissue culture, transplanted to soil and used approximately 4 weeks after transplanting.  RNA was extracted from leaves using Trizol.  Plants were sprayed with one of four treatments, either 1mM salicylic acid, 100 µM methyl jasmonate, 1 mg/ml arachidonic acid or 100 µM methyl jasmonate plus 1 mM salicylic acid together.   Samples were harvested at 3, 24 and 72 hours after spraying.  Each salicylic acid or arachidonic acid treatment has 3 biological replicates done in parallel, using leaves pooled from 2 plants.  The control for SA or AA treated plants were water sprayed plants, from which leaves of 3 different plants were pooled at each timepoint, done side-by-side with the treated samples. Methyl jasmonate or MJ+SA treatments had 2 biological replicates each, using leaves pooled from 2 plants. A separate set of water sprayed plants (from the SA and AA control treatments) were used as controls, and pooled leaves from 3 plants were used at each time-point, and done in parallel with the treated samples. Keywords: Direct comparison
