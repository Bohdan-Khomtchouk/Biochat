TITLE
Isw2 ChIP in S cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Study to detect to genome wide localization of the ATP dependent chromatin remodelling factor Isw2 using ChIP. Keywords: ChIP chip

DESIGN
Isw2 binding was determined using a catalytically inactive mutant (K215R) that gives specific binding across the genome. Binding of the K215R mutant was compared to that of the WT protein (that binds nonspecifically) and also to that of control " input " DNA samples.
