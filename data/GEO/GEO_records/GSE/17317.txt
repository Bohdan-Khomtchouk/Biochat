TITLE
miRNA expression in LNCaP, PC3, Du-145 and RWPE-1 cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of specific mRNA targets mainly by translational repression, mRNA deadenylation or cleavage. This series is meant to identify miRNAs deregulated in prostate cancer (PCa) by comparing the PCa cell lines LNCaP, PC3 and Du-145 to the normal prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1.

DESIGN
We analyzed three arrays each for LNCaP, PC3, Du-145 and RWPE-1 cell lines
