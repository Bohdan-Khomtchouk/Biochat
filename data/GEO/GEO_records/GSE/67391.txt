TITLE
Expression data from testis of two-month-old WT and Ccnyl1 KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ccnyl1 is a newly identified genes, but the founction of which remained unclear, here we used the Ccnyl1 knockout mice to finding clues for its functional roles We used microarrays to screen the expression differences of genes in testis of WT and Ccnyl1 KO mice

DESIGN
We used testis tissues from two month old mice, which were of adult age, and two mice per group
