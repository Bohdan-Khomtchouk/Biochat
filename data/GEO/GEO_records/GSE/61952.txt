TITLE
Expression data from rice lesion mimic mutant spotted leaf 5 (spl5)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The rice lesion mimic, spotted leaf 5 (spl5), created by Î³-ray radiation, has spontaneous HR-like lesions on its leaves and shows enhanced resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight pathogens. Some genes were differentially expressed in this mutant compared with its WT control ZF802, and these genes were also associated with some important signaling pathways, such as defense response, oxidation-reduction process and stress response. We analyzed the transcriptional profiling of spl5 mutant and WT using the microarray, in order to reveal the signal pathway of SPL5 gene in regulation of disease resistance.

DESIGN
Rice leaves were selected at lesion stages of spl5 mutant for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The lesions in rice leaves were belong to HR phenotype, which was one of the important reasons for rice disease resistance. In order to realize which genes were associated with the degree of lesions and mediated the disease resistance, we put the leaves of spl5 mutant into two categories, based on the degree of lesion formation: few lesions (FL), leaf area with 10-20% lesions and many lesions (ML), leaf area with 70-80% lesions.
