TITLE
250K SNP array data for 40 high-grade myogenic cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Many common human mesenchymal tumors, including gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), and leiomyosarcoma (LMS), feature myogenic differentiation. Here we report that intragenic deletion of the dystrophin-encoding and muscular dystrophy-associated DMD gene is a frequent mechanism by which myogenic tumors progress to high-grade, lethal sarcomas. Dystrophin is expressed in nonneoplastic and benign counterparts for GIST, RMS and LMS, and the DMD deletions inactivate larger dystrophin isoforms, including 427kDa dystrophin, while preserving expression of an essential 71kDa isoform. Dystrophin inhibits myogenic sarcoma cell migration, invasion, anchorage independence, and invadopodia formation, and dystrophin inactivation was found in 96%, 100%, and 62% of metastatic GIST, embryonal RMS, and LMS, respectively. These findings validate dystrophin as a tumor suppressor and likely anti-metastatic factor, suggesting that therapies in development for muscular dystrophies may also have relevance in treatment of cancer.

DESIGN
High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from 40 high-grade myogenic cancers (including 7 normal tissue/tumor pairs and 33 additional tumors) using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and analyzed by Affymetrix 250K SNP array.
