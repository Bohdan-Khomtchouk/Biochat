TITLE
Identification of Lhx5 binding sites

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lhx5 mutant mouse embryos show loss of a neuronal nucleus of the brain, called the mammillary body and essential for memory. We found out that this is caused by a loss of appropriate specification of mammillary neurons and we identified in a microarray study downstream targets responsible for the observed phenotype. Here we wanted to find out which of our identified targets are under direct control of Lhx5.

DESIGN
In order to identify the direct targets of Lhx5 we decided to use a ChIP-Seq approach. For this approach we generated a stably transfected Neuro2a cell line that expresses a FLAG-tagged version of Lhx5 under the control of the Tet-ON system. As a control we transfected Neuro2a cells with a construct that only expresses the FLAG-tag.
