TITLE
bulk cell RNA-seq of Lgr5+ ISCs with in vivo Rspo GOF and LOF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
sorted Lgr5-eGFP+ cells under conditions of in vivo Rspo manipulation in reporter mice,

DESIGN
Ad Fc (control) vs Ad LGR5 ECD (LOF) vs Ad Rspo1 (GOF) treatment.  Two biological replicates were used for Ad Fc and three biological replicates were used for LOF and GOF conditions
