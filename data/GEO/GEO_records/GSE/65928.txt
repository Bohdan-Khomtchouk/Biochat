TITLE
Malaria-associated atypical memory B cells exhibit markedly reduced B cell receptor signaling and effector function

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a deadly infectious disease for which we have no licensed vaccine. Antibodies confer protection against malaria and individuals exposed to P. falciparum acquire protective antibodies, but only after years of repeated infections. We recently showed that malaria exposure is associated with a large expansion of a population of atypical memory B cells (MBCs) that phenotypically resemble B cell populations expanded in chronic viral infections, including HIV. At present the relationship of atypical MBCs to classical MBCs and their function are not known. We provide evidence that the expressed VH gene repertoires and somatic hypermutation rates of atypical and classical MBCs are indistinguishable, indicating the two populations are closely related developmentally. Atypical MBCs can be distinguished by their expression of multiple inhibitory receptors, including Fc receptor-like-5. B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is stunted in atypical MBCs, resulting in impaired Ca2+ mobilization, proliferation and cytokine production. Atypical MBCs do not spontaneously secrete antibodies and cannot be stimulated to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells in vitro. These results suggest that in individuals chronically exposed to malaria, atypical MBCs differentiate from classical MBCs and assume a phenotype refractory to BCR-mediated activation, potentially contributing to the inefficient acquisition of immunity to malaria.
