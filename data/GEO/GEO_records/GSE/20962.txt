TITLE
Transcriptional Response to Iron Limitation in Pelagibacter ubique

ORGANISM
Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1002

SUMMARY
We investigated the gene expression responses of Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique cultures to iron limitation. Differential expression was observed for genes in iron acquisition and incorporation operons. SfuC in particular was 16 times higher in iron-limited cultures and encodes a periplasmic iron-binding protein.
