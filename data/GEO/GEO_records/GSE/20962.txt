TITLE
Transcriptional Response to Iron Limitation in Pelagibacter ubique

ORGANISM
Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062

SUMMARY
We investigated the gene expression responses of Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique cultures to iron limitation. Differential expression was observed for genes in iron acquisition and incorporation operons. SfuC in particular was 16 times higher in iron-limited cultures and encodes a periplasmic iron-binding protein.

DESIGN
Six natural seawater cultures were amended with minimal nutrients and inoculated with P. ubique. Close to maximum cell density, all carboys were supplemented with 100 nM ferrichrome (an iron-chelating siderophore) and three carboys were additionally supplemented with 1 ÂµM FeCl3. Each of the six carboys was sampled for microarray analyses one, two, and eleven days after the ferrichrome addition.
