TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of different response of hepatocytes and oval cells to hepatitis B virus expression during HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of genetic changes of hepatocytes and oval cells induced by HBV. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that hepatic progenitor cells (oval cells) are the founder cells of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Results provide important information of the different responses of hepatocytes and oval cells to HBV expression during HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis, such as up- or down-regulated oncogenes,tumor suppressor genes and signaling pathways.Results also provide new insights into the biology of human HCC.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from primary cultured hepatocytes and oval cells isolated from the healthy and HBV transgenic mice.

PLATFORM
