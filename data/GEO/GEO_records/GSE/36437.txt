TITLE
Expression data from caudal artery of Notch3WT and Notch3KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Notch3 is a transmembrane receptor which is critically important for the structure and myogenic response of distal arteries, particularly cerebral arteries. After activation of the receptor, the intracellular domain translocates in the nucleus to activate target genes transcription. In order to identify Notch3 target genes, we used microarrays to compare gene expression from caudal arteries (Notch3+/+ vs Notch3-/-) and selected down-regulated genes in Notch3-/- arteries.

DESIGN
Caudal arteries were dissected from 1 month old Notch3+/+ and Notch3-/- mice. RNA was prepared with arteries pooled from three (AJ_N3WT_3, AJ_N3WT_4) or four (AJ_N3WT_1, AJ_N3KO_1, AJ_N3KO_2, AJ_N3KO_4) mice and hybridized on Mouse MOE430.2 Affymetrix chips. For each group (Notch3+/+ and Notch3-/-), three biological replicates were performed.
