SUMMARY
Genome-wide chromatin state maps of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells, ES-derived neural progenitor cells and whole brain tissue. The data were generated to examine the correlation between histone and DNA methylation during lineage-commitment. Keywords: High-throughput ChIP-sequencing, Illumina, cell type comparison
