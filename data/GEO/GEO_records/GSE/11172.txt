TITLE
Genome-wide chromatin state maps of ES cells, ES-derived neural progenitor cells and brain tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide chromatin state maps of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells, ES-derived neural progenitor cells and whole brain tissue. The data were generated to examine the correlation between histone and DNA methylation during lineage-commitment. Keywords: High-throughput ChIP-sequencing, Illumina, cell type comparison

DESIGN
H3K4me3, H3K4me2 and/or H3K4me1 ChIP-Seq in singlicate from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, ES-derived neural progenitor cells and whole brain tissue suspensions Raw sequence data files for this study are available for download from the SRA FTP site at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/Studies/SRP000/SRP000230

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
