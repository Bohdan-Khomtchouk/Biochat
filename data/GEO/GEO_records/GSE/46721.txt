TITLE
Transcriptomic effects of miR-30d transient over-expression in human endometrial epithelial cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNAs are essential regulators of gene expression. This work explores the transcriptomic effects of has-miR-30d in endometrial epithelial cells which was reported to be up-regulated during human endometrial receptivity.

DESIGN
primary endometrial epithelial cells derived from four different endometrial biopsies taken on LH+0 were transiently transfected with miRNAs for 72 hours under two conditions (four scramble, four miR-30d mimic) and were evaluated for mRNA expression with Agilentâ€™s gene expression microarray. A set of differentially expressed mRNAs were validated by qPCR.
