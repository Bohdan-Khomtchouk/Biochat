TITLE
Characterizition of a fast-growing Lactococcus lactis mutant on maltose

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363

SUMMARY
Trade-offs often occurs during experimental evolution. For example, the degeneration of growth in glucose was found in a galactose adapted yeast. Here, we isolated one Lactococcus lactis mutant using experimental on maltose. The mutant grows normally on glucose, but faster than the wild-type on maltose and galactose. DNA microarray analysis and whole genome re-sequencing were applied to disclose the crucial points that determine the phenotype.

DESIGN
MG1363 versus CS3155 on glucose, maltose and galactose

PLATFORM
GPL13249 Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris MG1363 15K 60-mer array, Version 1
