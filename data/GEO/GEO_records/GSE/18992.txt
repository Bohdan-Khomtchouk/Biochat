TITLE
Overexpression of Hoxc8 transcription factor alters transcriptional profiles in mouse chondrocytes at E18.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Homeobox genes of the Hox class are required for proper patterning of skeletal elements and play a role in cartilage differentiation. In transgenic mice with overexpression of Hoxc8 during cartilage development, we observed severe defects, namely physical instability of cartilage, accumulation of immature chondrocytes, and decreased maturation to hypertrophy. To define the molecular basis underlying these defects, we performed gene expression profiling using the Affymetrix microarray platform.

DESIGN
Embryos were dissected from four different mouse litters at E18.5. Embryos from each litter were grouped according their genotype: TA=control; TR=transgenic.
