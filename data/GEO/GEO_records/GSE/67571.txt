TITLE
Diverse Targets of β-catenin during the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Define Cancer Stem Cells and Predict Disease Relapse

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Wnt signaling contributes to the reprogramming and maintenance of cancer stem cell (CSC) states that is activated by the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. However, the mechanistic relationship between the EMT and Wnt pathway in CSCs remains unclear. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) indicated that EMT induces a switch from the β-catenin/E-cadherin/Sox15 complex to the β-catenin/Twist1/TCF4 complex, which then binds to CSC-related gene promoters. In tandem co-IP and re-ChIP experiments using epithelial-type cells, Sox15 associated with the β-catenin/E-cadherin complex and then bound to the proximal promoter region of CASP3, consequently resulting in Twist1 cleavage and negatively regulating the β-catenin–elicited promotion of the CSC phenotype. During the EMT, Twist1 in complex with β-catenin enhanced β-catenin/TCF4 transcriptional activity, which includes binding to the proximal promoter region of ABCG2, a marker of CSCs. For clinical application, the five-gene signature nuclear β-cateninHigh/nuclear Twist1High/E-cadherinLow/Sox15Low/CD133High may be a valuable prognostic marker in patients with human lung cancer.

DESIGN
Total cellular RNA was extracted from LM and HM20 cells after treatment with or without Wnt3a for 24hours. Human lung cancer A549 cell–derived spheres were transferred back to adhesive tissue culture plates (LM cells). To establish an EMT/metastasis cell model, LM cells were seeded onto Matrigel-coated Boyden chamber membranes. HM20 cells were serially selected for Matrigel invasion 20 times.
