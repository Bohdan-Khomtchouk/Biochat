TITLE
Role of microRNAs in Neural Stem Cell-supported Endothelial Morphogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We checked whether the inhibition of the FGF, VEGF, and TGF signaling pathways would influence the miRNA profile in ECs, co-cultured with NSPCs.

DESIGN
EC/NSPC co-cultures were incubated with FGF/VEGF receptor inhibitor PD 173074 (1μM in DMSO), and the TGF-β receptor inhibitor SB431542 (10μM in DMSO, Millipore)

PLATFORM
GPL14613 [miRNA-2] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-2 Array
