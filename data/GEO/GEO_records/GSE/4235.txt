TITLE
Whole genome gene expression profiles of migratory cells in the Drosophila ovary

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Cell migration contributes to normal development and homeostasis as well as to pathological processes such as inflammation and tumor metastasis.  Previous genetic screens have revealed a few major signaling pathways that govern follicle cell migrations in the Drosophila ovary, several of which elicit transcriptional responses.  However few downstream targets of the critical transcriptional regulators, such as the C/EBP homolog SLBO, have been identified.  To characterize the gene expression profile of two migratory cell populations and identify SLBO targets, we employed a magnetic bead based cell separation approach to purify border cells and centripetal cells expressing the mouse CD8 antigen, and carried out whole genome microarray analysis. Keywords: cell type comparison, genetic modification
