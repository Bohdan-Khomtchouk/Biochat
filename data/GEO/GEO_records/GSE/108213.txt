TITLE
Hormone Therapy Use and Breast Tissue DNA Methylation: Analysis of Epigenome Wide Data from the Normal Breast Study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of fresh frozen, histologically normal-appearing breast tissue from the Normal Breast Study (NBS). The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles for 90 samples, including “current”, “former” and never users of HRT.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 85 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
