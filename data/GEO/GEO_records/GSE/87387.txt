TITLE
RNA-seq of primary murine lung adenocarcinoma cells from KP and JKP mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun is required for Ras-driven tumorigenesis in many tissues. Surprisingly, we found that inactivation of c-Jun increased tumor burden in a model of K-RasG12D-induced lung adenocarcinoma.

DESIGN
mRNA-seq of KP vs. JKP isolated adenocarcinoma cell lines, in triplicate

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
