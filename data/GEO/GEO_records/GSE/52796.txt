TITLE
Cardiac gene expression after transgenic overexpression or deletion of MeCP2 in cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify potentially regulated target genes of MeCP2 we used celltype-specific models for transgenic overexpression and ablation of MeCP2. Gene expression was analyzed in cardiac biopsies of adult male mice. The study contains three different treatment groups: 1. healthy mice (Sham), 2. mice suffering from 4-6 weeks of cardiac pressure overload (TAC) and 3. with a reversible induction of TAC (TAC followed by 2 weeks without TAC)

DESIGN
In all experiments we added the corresponding WT for the muted strains. The three different disease conditions were performed individually and thus the results are not directly comparable.
