TITLE
Targets of HNF1b mutants in INS-1

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
A rat insulinoma cell line (INS-1) was generated that contains a FRT site for FLP recombinase mediated site specific integration of specific genes. In addition, the line contains the tetracycline repressor allowing tetracycline (tet) induction of the introduced gene. By comparing the gene expression profiles of uninduced and tet-induced cells, target genes of introduced transcription factors HNF1b and HNF1b mutants were identified. Two different clones containing the same transcription factor were analyzed in the non-induced and tet-induced (24 h) state. Keywords: ordered
