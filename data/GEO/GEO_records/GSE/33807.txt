TITLE
Eosinophil specific transcriptome in homeostatic intestine and lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Objective: To study the physiological role of eosinophils in the GI tract and lung under homeostatic conditions, Method: we analyzed tissue-specific eosinophil gene expression patterns by genome-wide expression microarray analysis using RNA isolated from FACS-sorted eosinophils from the small intestine or lung of naive BALB/cmice (Live eosinophils were identified as DAPI-CCR3+Siglec-F+CD45+CD4-CD8a-CD19-B220-SSChigh cells). Result: There are 513 genes that are differentially expressed by intestinal eosinophils and Lung eosinophils. Conclusion: Eosinophils from different tissues have unique gene expression patterns for distinct functions.
