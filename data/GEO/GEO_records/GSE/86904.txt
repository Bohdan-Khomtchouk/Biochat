TITLE
Expression data from fractionated prostate epithelial cells (fetal and adult)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Subset of adult prostate basal cells and fetal prostate epithelial cells have enhanced tubule-initiating capability in vivo.  Features associated with this process may be co-opted in cancer cells We used microarrays to contrast gene expression profiles of fetal and adult tubule-initiating cells compared to basal and luminal epithelial cells that can be isolated from bening prostate tissue specimens.

DESIGN
FACS sorting of dissociated fetal and adult tissue specimens was performed with Epcam, CD44, and CD49f antibodies. The following populations were isolated for Gene expression analysis:  Epcam+CD44- (fetal prostate epithelial cells/tubule-initiating cells), Epcam+CD44-CD49fHi (adult tubule-initiating cells), Epcam+CD44+CD49fHi (adult basal cells), Epcam+CD44-CD49fLo (adult luminal cells)
