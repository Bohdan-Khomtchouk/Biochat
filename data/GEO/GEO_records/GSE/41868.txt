TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mRNA levels in response to a Pin1 knock-down

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pin1 is a prolyl isomerase that plays an important role in cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and asthma. To understand how Pin1 levels affect mRNA abundance on a genome-wide scale, we knocked down Pin1 by siRNA and used microarray-based gene expression profiling to identify candidate genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated by Pin1 siRNA. The data provide important information on Pin1-responsive genes. We find that genes that are inherently unstable and have short half-lives are targeted by Pin1.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from HeLa cells treated with either control siRNA or an siRNA towards Pin1. There were three replicates each for the control and the siRNA-treated cells. The average signal for the three replicates is reported.
