TITLE
Embryonic day 15 and Postnatal day 1 whole mouse brain AGTR2 knockout versus control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The gene expression profiles of control vs AGTR2 knockout mouse whole brains at developmental stage E15 and postnatal day 1 were examined. Keywords: genetic modification, brain development, AGTR2

DESIGN
Embryonic day 15: six biological control replicates and eight biological AGTR2 knockout replicates, one control and knockout replicate to an array with a dye-swap, except for 2 without a dye-swap Postnatal day 1: four biological control replicates and four biological AGTR2 knockout replicates, one control and knockout replicate to an array with a dye-swap

PLATFORM
GPL2872 Agilent-012694 Whole Mouse Genome G4122A (Feature Number version)
