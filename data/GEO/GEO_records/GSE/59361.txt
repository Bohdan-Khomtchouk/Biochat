TITLE
Gene expression of SUM159-mir100 ALDH+ and ALDH- cells from CTRL or mir100-overexpressing group

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Emerging evidence suggest that miRNAs play an essential role in self-renewal and differentiation of normal and malignant stem cells by regulating the expression of key stem cell regulatory genes. Here we demonstrate that mir-100 expression is related to cellular differentiation state with lowest expression in cells displaying stem cell markers. Utilizing a tetracycline inducible lentivirus driving mir-100 expression, we found that mir-100 overexpression decreased breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) and inhibited cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in mouse xenografts by targeting SMARCA5, SMARCD1 and BMPR2.

DESIGN
In order to determine the cellular targets of mir-100 in BCSCs and non-BCSCs, ALDH-positive and -negative populations of pTRIPZ-SUM159-mir-100 cells were separated and cultured in suspension for ten hours in the presence or absence of DOX. Gene expression profiles of the four populations were determined utilizing Affymetrix microarrays
