TITLE
Auxin stimulates brassinosteroid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis roots

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We found that auxin stimulates gene expression of DWF4, which encodes a rate-dertermining step in brassinosteroid biosynthesis pathways. This increased gene expressioin subsequently led to elevation of the biosynthetic flux in Arabidopsis roots. To determine the list of genes that are regulated by auxin-synthesizing brassinosteroids, we challenged Arabidopsis seedlings with either auxin only or auxin plus brassinosteroid biosynthetic inhibitor brassinazole.
