TITLE
Auxin stimulates brassinosteroid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis roots

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We found that auxin stimulates gene expression of DWF4, which encodes a rate-dertermining step in brassinosteroid biosynthesis pathways. This increased gene expressioin subsequently led to elevation of the biosynthetic flux in Arabidopsis roots. To determine the list of genes that are regulated by auxin-synthesizing brassinosteroids, we challenged Arabidopsis seedlings with either auxin only or auxin plus brassinosteroid biosynthetic inhibitor brassinazole. Keywords: Hormone treatment

DESIGN
Arabidopsis seedlings (Columbia ecotype) were grown for 10 d on 1× MS agar-solidified media under long-day conditions (16:8, white light and dark cycle). The seedlings were then transferred to 2 different liquid media containing either 10–7 M 2,4-D or 10–7 M 2,4-D plus 10–6 M brassinazole. After 8 h of treatment, the seedlings were blotted with paper towels to remove excess media and subject to total RNA isolation. Total RNAs isolated from each batch were prepared from 3 replicate seedlings using an RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Germany).
