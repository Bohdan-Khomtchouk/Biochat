TITLE
Splenic CD4 T cells in naïve C57BL/6 mice or during Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection in C57BL/6 and B6.GzmB-/- mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Infection of C57BL/6 mice with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) is a well-established experimental model of cerebral malaria (ECM). ECM is characterised by high levels of parasite sequestration and recruitment of pathogenic CD8+ T cells to the brain. The role of CD4+ T cells in this model has not yet been fully elucidated, although our laboratory has recently shown that CD4+ T cell depletion prior to infection results in significantly lower parasite burdens and protection from ECM. These data highlight a pathogenic role for CD4+ T cells in ECM. Our unpublished observations indicate that mice lacking the CD8+ T cell cytolytic effector molecule, Granzyme B, (GzmB), are resistant to ECM, showing markedly reduced parasite burdens. Late depletion of CD4+ T cells from PbA-infected GzmB-deficient mice results in enhanced parasite burdens, indicating that these cells may play an anti-parasitic role. In the present study, we have analysed splenic CD4+ T cell gene expression profiles in naïve C57BL/6 mice, and PbA-infected wild-type and GzmB-deficent mice to further our understanding of the CD4+ T cell response in ECM.

DESIGN
Splenic CD4 T cells isolated by cell sorting from either uninfected C57BL/6 or PbA-infected C57BL/6 or B6.GzmB-/- mice at day 4 post-infection. Total RNA obtained from four mice per group.
