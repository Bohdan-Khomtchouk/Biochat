TITLE
The global gene expression pattern by KDX1 over-expression

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We did transcription profiling on the effect of KDX1 over-expression.

DESIGN
Analysis was performed with wild type and KDX1 over-expressed cells ( pRS426-KDX1). Yeast cells were grown on SD-ura medium. Yeast cells were grown overnight at 30°C . The culture was refreshed to 0.2 O.D and grown at 30°C  for 5h 30min. Cells were collected and processed for RNA extraction.
