TITLE
Expression data from rice organs at the reproductive stage

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Plant hormones interact with each other and regulate gene expression to control plant growth and development. To understand the complex network, accumulation of comprehensive and integrative data of gene expression and hormone concentration is important. Using microarray, global gene expression profile was analyzed to compare with plant hormone concentration in 14 parts of rice at reproductive stage. The microarray data are used to construct public rice hormonome-transcriptome database UniVIO ( ).

DESIGN
We analyzed flower, panicle branch,internode I, node I and II, and some leaves of rice plant at the heading satage. Total 35 samples were analyzed in this experiment.
