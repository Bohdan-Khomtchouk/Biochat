TITLE
Transcriptional profile of pmt1 pmt4 mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We did transcription profiling on the effect of pmt1 pmt4 deletion, genes involved in the O-glycosylation process. These mutants cells show inhibition of mating, filamentation and induction of cell wall compensatory mechanism.

DESIGN
Two biological samples were analyzed for each condition, and a microarray experiment were carried out for each sample 1. wild type cells SEY6210 2. pmt1 pmt2 cells from SEY6210 background

PLATFORM
GPL90 [YG_S98] Affymetrix Yeast Genome S98 Array
