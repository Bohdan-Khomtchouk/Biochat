TITLE
Transcriptional profile of pmt1 pmt4 mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We did transcription profiling on the effect of pmt1 pmt4 deletion, genes involved in the O-glycosylation process. These mutants cells show inhibition of mating, filamentation and induction of cell wall compensatory mechanism.
