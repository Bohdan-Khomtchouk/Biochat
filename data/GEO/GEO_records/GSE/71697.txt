TITLE
Alterations in serum microRNA in humans with alcohol use disorders impact cell proliferation and cell death pathways and predict structural and functional changes in brain [rat miRNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We performed a global analysis of extracellular miRNAs in the serum of human subjects diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) to identify robust biomarkers of early brain damage or dysfunction. This was performed in a set of 20 AUD subjects and 10 age-matched controls. They were subjected to comprehensive medical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging tests, followed by comparison of miRNA levels found in peripheral blood serum. The levels of miRNAs were quantified using two independent high-throughput methods: Affymetrix microarray and Illumina next-generation RNA-sequencing. Cross-species validation was performed using rat drinking models and mouse neural stem cell culture models, with tissue specificity of the serum miRNAs examined using additional RNA-sequencing of serum and body tissues in untreated rats. This data series includes the rat brain and body tissue miRNA data obtained from RNA-sequencing only and is part of a larger SuperSeries (GSE71579) now being curated at GEO

DESIGN
A total of 20 RNA-sequencing libraries were run on small RNA obtained from untreated (control) postnatal day 35 male Long Evans Hooded rats. These libraries were derived from 16 different tissues including an entire brain hemisphere, hindlimb muscle, lung, heart, kidney, thymus, pancreas, subcutaneous abdominal fat, stomach, testes, liver, skin, spleen, large intestine and small intestine.  Tissues were dissected and stored in RNAlater (Sigma), and subsequently homogenized prior to miRNA purification. The miRNAs from 3 different rats were pooled together to generate a specific miRNA profile for each tissue, except for the brain hemispheres and serum samples which were run individually.
