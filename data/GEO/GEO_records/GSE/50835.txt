TITLE
DNA methylation analysis of PBMC from HIV and HIV/TB co-infected patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of PBMC from South African patients either infected with HIV only or coinfected with HIV and tuberculosis (TB). The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles from PBMC samples. Samples included 19 HIV patients and 20 HIV/TB co-infected patients.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
