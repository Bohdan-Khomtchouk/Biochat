TITLE
Genomic rearrangements in C3 glomerulopathies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number variations and genomic rearrangements in the CFH-CFHRs region were assessed with a custom-designed high-density 8x15k oligonucleotide CGH arrays spanning the RCA gene cluster region in human chromosome 1q32 (median resolution of 110 bp) (AMADID 040193, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). A healthy male donor sample, fully genotyped for that region, was used  as hybridization control. Microarray data were extracted and visualized using the Feature Extraction Software v10.7 and Genomic Workbench Standard Edition 7.0 (Agilent Corp, Santa Clara, CA). Copy number altered regions were detected using ADM-2 (set as 5) statistic provided by DNA Analytics, with a minimum number of 5 consecutive probes. Genomic build hg19 was used for the experiment.

DESIGN
Only a Sample was analyzed
