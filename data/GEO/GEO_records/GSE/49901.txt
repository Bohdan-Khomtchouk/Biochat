TITLE
Molecular analysis of a case of renal cell carcinoma with t(6;11) (p21;q12) reveals a link to a lysosome-like structure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TFEB has been recently reported to be a key molecule for lysosomal regulation. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with t(6;11) (p21;q12) is known to be the only tumor in which TFEB is upregulated. Transcriptome analysis using a whole-genome expression array and pathway analysis using upregulated genes in tumor tissue revealed that the lysosome-associated pathways were significantly deregulated.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from non-tumor and tumor in patient of renal cell carcinoma with t(6;11) (p21;q12) and subjected to gene expression microarray analysis.
