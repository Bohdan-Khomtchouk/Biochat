TITLE
Subcutaneous adipose tissue and visceral adipose tissue gene expression profiles in Mexican patients with obesity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using RNA isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) samples obtained from control and class I, II and III obese patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, we compared the gene expression profiles between SAT and VAT using microarrays and validated the findings by real-time quantitative PCR.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, SAT vs. VAT tissue. Biological replicates: 8 SAT replicates, 8 VAT replicates.
