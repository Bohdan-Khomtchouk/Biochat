TITLE
Genome wide transcriptome profiling of a murine acute melioidosis model reveals new insights into how Burkholderia pseudomallei overcome host innate immunity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to develop a comprehensive picture of the host transcriptional response during the acute stage of melioidosis. To adress this, we compared the transcriptome of infected liver and spleen with uninfected tissues over an infection period of 42 hr (16 hpi, 24 hpi and 42 hpi, respectively) to identify genes whose expression is altered in response to an acute infection.

DESIGN
The microarray experimental design included 3 biological replicates for each time point and both liver and spleen were harvested for RNA extraction (except the liver 0 hpi only has 2 biological replicates). The microarray data from each time point was compared relative to uninfected mice.
