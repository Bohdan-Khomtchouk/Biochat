TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human endometrial stromal cells transduced with BMP2- and WNT4-adenovirus.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our previous studies have shown that bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), a morphogen belonging to the TGFÎ² superfamily, is markedly induced in human primary endometrial stromal cells (HESC) as they undergo differentiation in response to steroid hormones and cAMP. WNT4 is a downstream target of BMP2 regulation in these cells. To identify the common downstream targets of BMP2 and WNT4 in human endometrial stromal cells, we performed gene expression profling of human ensometrial stromal cell transduced with BMP2 or WNT4 adenovirus. Gene expression profiling revealed that FOXO1, a forkhead family transcription factor and a known regulator of HESC differentiation, is a common downstream mediator of both BMP2 and WNT4 signaling. These studies uncovered a linear pathway involving BMP2, WNT4, and FOXO1 that operates in human endometrium to critically control decidualization.

DESIGN
Human endometrial stromal cells were transduced with recombinant adenovirus expressing BMP2, WNT4, or a negative control GFP at MOI 50:1 in 2 ml of culture medium. After transduction for 24 h, the viral particles were removed and the cells were treated with E+P for 3 days to induce decidualization (n=3 for each treatment), pooled total RNA from these cells was then hybridized to high density affymetrix microarrays according to the Affymetrix protocol (Human Genome HG-U133 A2.0 Array) .
