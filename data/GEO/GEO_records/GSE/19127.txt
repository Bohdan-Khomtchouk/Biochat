TITLE
Profiling uterine fibroid specimens with an in-house array representing all 90 human tyrosine kinases and their ligands

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to compare the expression patterns of tyrosine kinases and their ligand activators between matched myometrium and leiomyoma tissues. For this, total RNA samples extracted from 42 pairs of matched fibroid and adjacent myometrial tissues were hybridized to a set of 840 customized oligonucleotide microarrays to compare the expression profiles of 244 selected human genes including all 90 tyrosine kinases and 103 ligands. Among the 244 genes surveyed, 38 were found to be differentially expressed between pairs of myometrium and fibroid tissues. Clustering analysis of the expression ratios of these 38 genes from 42 pairs of samples has led to the subdivision of fibroid samples into three groups, based on the expression ratios of two peptide ligands, CYR61 and EFNA4. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR measurements of additional 32 pairs of samples further confirmed the existence of these three groups of fibroid samples. In conclusion, peptide ligand activators of protein tyrosine kinases are differentially expressed between myometrium and fibroid tissues. This finding supports the notion that tyrosine kinases may be exploited as medical targets to treat symptomatic fibroids without surgical intervention.  

DESIGN
This study has been accomplished with 42 patients fibroid specimen and their matched myometrium, each pair of specimen has been repeated at least 3 times.
