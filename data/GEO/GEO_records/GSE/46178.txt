TITLE
Overexpression of spliced XBP1 in cultured Adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We overexpressed the spliced form of transcription factor XBP1 in mature F442A adipocytes by adenoviral infection.  Control virus expressed GFP alone.

DESIGN
mouse sXBP1 overexpressed in mouse F442A adipocytes compared to control (GFP alone). Four replicates of each treatment were analyzed.
