TITLE
C9/ALS Human Embryonic Stem Cells  and C9/ALS Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established two HESC lines with a C9 mutation (SZ-ALS1, SZ-ALS3) from embryos, which were obtained through preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and donated for cell line derivation by a family in which the mother was an expansion carrier (originally diagnosed as a carrier of an expansion with > 40 repeats in blood by a repeat primed PCR). In addition, we generated halo-identical and unrelated C9/ALS iPSCs from a skin biopsies of the C9 carrier mother (patient H, 30 years-old), and from an unrelated C9/ALS patient, 2 years following disease-onset (patient M, 65 years-old).

DESIGN
We established two HESC lines with a GGGGCC expansion in the C9orf72 gene (C9), and compared them with haplo-identical and unrelated C9 iPSCs.
