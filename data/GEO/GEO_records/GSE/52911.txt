TITLE
Comparative transcript profiling of a male sterile cybrid pummelo and its fertile type revealed altered gene expression related to flower development

ORGANISM
Citrus maxima

SUMMARY
To gain new insight into the underlying mechanism, we compared, by RNA-Seq analysis, the nuclear gene expression profiles of floral buds of the cybrid with that of fertile pummelo. Gene expression profiles which identified a large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two lines were captured at both petal primordia and stamen primordia distinguishable stages. For example, nuclear genes involved in nucleic acid binding and response to hormone synthesis and metabolism, genes required for floral bud identification and expressed in particular floral whorls.

DESIGN
Total four sample pools (petal primordia and stamen primordia development stages of G1+HBP and HBP)

PLATFORM
GPL18025 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Citrus maxima)
