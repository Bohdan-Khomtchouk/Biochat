TITLE
50uM Casodex treatment of LNCaP Prostate Cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide expression changes following 50uM Casodex treatment were investigated to determine regulatory targets commonly overlooked in gene function specific microarrays and for comparison of the effects of the mutant androgen receptor (AR) LNCaP cell line against the wild-type AR expressing PC-346C cells. Keywords: Expression response to treatment, will be used with another array dataset for cell type comparison.

DESIGN
LNCaP Prostate Cancer cells were treated for a period of 48h with or without 50uM Casodex following a 24h seeding period. At the selected time point, total RNA was harvested from the cells for hybridization and analysis by Nimblgen Systems Inc using the homo sapiens gene expression array.
