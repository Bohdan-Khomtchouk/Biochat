TITLE
Expression data from Helicobacter pylori isolates infecting a gastric epithelial progenitor cell line

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori

SUMMARY
Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates can establish themselves in gastric epithelial stem cells and this interaction may have implications for gastric tumorigenesis. Mouse gastric epithelial progenitor cells (mGEPs) were infected for 24hrs with Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates Kx1 and Kx2. Kx1 and Kx2 were also grown in cell media in the absence of cells. Kx1 was isolated from a patient with chronic atrophic gastritis (ChAG) and Kx2 from the same patient 4 years later, when he progressed to gastric adenocarcinoma. Keywords: RNA Expression Array

DESIGN
H. pylori strains Kx1 or Kx2 that had been grown to log phase were used to infect mGEP cells.. After 24h, media and non-attached bacteria were washed off and the cells harvested by trypsinization. RNA was prepared from bacteria infecting mGEP cells or bacterial cultures of Kx1 and Kx2 grown in cell media for 24h in the absence of mGEP cells.
