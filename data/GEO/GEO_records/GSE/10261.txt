TITLE
Expression data from Helicobacter pylori isolates infecting a gastric epithelial progenitor cell line

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori

SUMMARY
Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates can establish themselves in gastric epithelial stem cells and this interaction may have implications for gastric tumorigenesis. Mouse gastric epithelial progenitor cells (mGEPs) were infected for 24hrs with Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates Kx1 and Kx2. Kx1 and Kx2 were also grown in cell media in the absence of cells. Kx1 was isolated from a patient with chronic atrophic gastritis (ChAG) and Kx2 from the same patient 4 years later, when he progressed to gastric adenocarcinoma. Keywords: RNA Expression Array
