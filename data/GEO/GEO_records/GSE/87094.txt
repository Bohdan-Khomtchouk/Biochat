TITLE
Identification of microRNA expression profiles in the gill, intestine and hepatic caecum of amphioxus

ORGANISM
Branchiostoma belcheri

SUMMARY
The amphioxus, as a simple basal chordate model, plays an important and unique role on providing insights into the evolution of tissues and organs of the vertebrates. To understand the unique features of the amphioxus during evolution, itâ€™s important to identify the gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of amphioxus tissues or organs. However, the systematic examination of these expression profiles is not conducted. Here, we focused on characterizing the miRNA expression patterns of three amphioxus digestive organs (the gill, intestine and hepatic caecum) that are believed to be the first line of immune defense.

DESIGN
three samples from three organs of B. belcheri
