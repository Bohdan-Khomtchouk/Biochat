TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of wild-type and Yap-deficient embryonic lungs by RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We extracted total RNA from wild-type and Yap-f/f;Shh-Cre/+ embryonic lung 12.5 dpc, and perform RNA-Seq.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of embrynic lungs from wild type and Yap mutant littermates at 12.5 dpc were generated by deep sequencing in triplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL21103 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)
