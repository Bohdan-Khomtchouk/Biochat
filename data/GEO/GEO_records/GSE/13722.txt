TITLE
Transcriptional response of Candida parapsilosis in low oxygen (hypoxic) conditions in SD media

ORGANISM
Candida parapsilosis

SUMMARY
Whole genome microarray was used to compare the transcriptional profile of C. parapsilosis growing in normoxic (21% oxygen) and hypoxic (1% oxygen) conditions.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from cells grown in SD media at 37Â°C for 3 h in atmosphere oxygen of 1% oxygen, and labeled with Cy5 or Cy3. Six independent biological replicates were compared. 4 out of 6 hypoxic samples were labeled with Cy5, and 2 were labeled with Cy3.
