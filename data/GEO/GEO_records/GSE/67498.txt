ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These data include the genome wide occupancy of H2AUbq by ChIP sequencing in Cdkn2a-/- Lin- HSC cells non-transduced or transduced with MLL-AF9, HOXA9 and PML-RARa.

DESIGN
Immuno-precipitation of formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin prepared from Cdkn2a-/- Lin- HSC cells non-transduced or transduced with MLL-AF9, HOXA9 and PML-RARa using H2AK119Ubq antibody.
