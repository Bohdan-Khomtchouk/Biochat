TITLE
DNA methylation patterns of lupus patient PBMCs, subdivided based on protein expression of ARID3a

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methyl-seq data was obtained from total peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who were characterized as having > 2 standard deviations more ARID3a-expressing B lymphocytes than healthy controls. Similarly, methyl-seq data was also obtained from two SLE patient samples with normal (low) numbers of ARID3-expressing B lymphocytes. Our previous studies showed that increased ARID3a expression in B lymphocytes was associated increased disease activity. Data were generated on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 with paired-end 100bp reads and quality control metrics were assessed with Picard tools.

DESIGN
Methylation profiles of genomic DNA from four SLE patient PBMC samples, two with high numbers of ARID3a expressing B cells (ARID3aH) versus two with normal numbers of ARID3a+ B cells (ARID3aN), were generated on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 with paired-end 100bp reads.
