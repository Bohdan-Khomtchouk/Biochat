TITLE
Resistance of primary ovarian cancer cells to oncolytic adenoviruses part2 of 2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanisms of primary ovarian cancer cells for resistance to viral oncolysis were investigated using Ad5/35.IR.E1A/TRAIL on clonal cultures derived from ovc316m cells. Part 2 of 2, 26 clonal ovc316m cultures additionally to Resistance of primary ovarian cancer cells to oncolytic adenoviruses part1 of 2

DESIGN
Cells were infected for 8 days and cell survival determined by MTT assay. Uninfected control cells of each clonal culture were utilized for DNA expression arrays. SKOV3-ip1 cells were used for reference RNA in all samples. The reference RNA from SKOV3-ip1 cells for part 2 of 2 had to be re-amplified.
