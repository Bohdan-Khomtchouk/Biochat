TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of E14.5 control and Tbr2 fl/fl;Foxg1::Cre cortices

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The abscence of TBR2 gene in human leads to microcephaly. This condition is mimicked by the specific ablation of the murine gene in developing cerebral cortex. Herein we compared gene expression in control and Tbr2 cKO in E14.5 cerebral cortices. This approach represents a useful tool to identify the molecular mechanisms at the basis of the phenotype.

DESIGN
6 samples, 3x Tbr2 +/+;Foxg1::Cre (control) and 3x Tbr2 fl/fl;Foxg1::Cre

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
