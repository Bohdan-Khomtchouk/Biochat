TITLE
Partially degraded RNA from bladder washing is a suitable sample for studying gene expression profiles of bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aims of this study were to determine the impact of different levels of RNA degradation as well as to ascertain if the gene expression profiles obtained from bladder washing correlates to that obtained from the related bladder tumor. Keywords: RNA degradation, bladder washing, bladder tumor, bladder cancer

DESIGN
We obtained tissue tumor and bladder washing tumor samples from the same individual. We degraded each intact RNA to 3 different degradation states with dye swap (2x4x2 arrays). All tumor RNAs were compared against a pool of 4 healthy control samples with intact RNA (named as C0).
