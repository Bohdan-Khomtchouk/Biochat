TITLE
Several genes expression patterns in Desulfovibrio hydrothermalis sp. nov. AM13T in response to hydrostatic pressure

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio hydrothermalis AM13 = DSM 14728

SUMMARY
We have identified differentially expressed genes according to hydrostatic pressure growth conditions in Desulfovibrio hydrothermalis. The transcriptomic datasets report the molecular mechanisms which could be involved in such adaptation and give information for the piezophile sulfate-reducing bacteria research communities. The data obtained pointed out a gradual response of D. hydrothermalis to an increase of hydrostatic pressure, with a threshold above 10 MPa and the involvement of a quite limited number of genes and/or pathways involved in the adaptation to hydrostatic pressure.

DESIGN
Transcriptome data of Desulfovibrio hydrothermalis AM13T have been generated with culture at 0.1 MPa (atmospheric pressure, low hydrostatic pressure), 26 or 10 MPa (high hydrostatic pressures). All these cultures have been processed in duplicate.
