TITLE
Differentially expressed genes analysis between Eupolyphaga sinensis Walker (ESW) and Taspine derivate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insights into the mechanisms of Eupolyphaga sinensis Walker (ESW) and taspine derivate on inhibition to HCC, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify different genes between ESW-treated sample and control. At the same time, the differences were investigated between taspine derivate and the same control. SMMC-7721 cells were cultivated in the absence or presence of 0.1mg/mL ESWE and  Taspine derivate of 2.5x10-5mol/L for 48 h, followed by the Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray. The PLG, PKCÎ² and IL3RA genes confirmation of Microarray analysis was confirmed by Real-time PCR.
