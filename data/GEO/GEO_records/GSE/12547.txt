TITLE
Zebrafish Zili- and Ziwi-interacting small RNAs

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Small RNAs exert an effect through diverse RNA interference pathways to transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally silence their targets. The Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) represent a germline-specific small RNA pathway where Piwi proteins themselves are thought to mediate piRNA biosynthesis. Here, we provide strong evidence for a piRNA amplification loop in zebrafish, in which Ziwi and Zili bind piRNAs of opposite polarity. Furthermore, we describe a function for Zili in transposon defense and germ cell differentiation, as well as a crucial function in meiosis, significantly extending the function of Piwi proteins beyond the control of transposable elements in vertebrates.

DESIGN
small RNA from total gonads or Argonaute IPs were cloned and sequenced using 454 GS FLX system.
