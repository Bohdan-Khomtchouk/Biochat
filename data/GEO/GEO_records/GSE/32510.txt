TITLE
Gene expression profile of mouse liver cancer (Sav1 and Mst1/2 Knockout models)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hippo pathway is evolutionarily well conserved. All core components of the pathway identified to date have one or more mammalian orthologs, including MST1/2 (Hippo), SAV1 (Salvador, also known as WW45), LATS1/2 (Warts), MOB1 (Mats), YAP1 and its paralog WWTR1 (also known as TAZ) (Yorkie), and TEAD1/2/3/4 (Scalloped). Ectopic over-expression of YAP1 in mouse liver led to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is the third most common cause of cancer-related death in the world, and accounts for an estimated 600,000 deaths annually. Lack of molecular classification and clinical heterogeneity of this malignant disease hampered the development of standardized treatment. To investigate roles of Hippo pathway in liver carcinogenesis, we generated liver-specific Mst1/2 -/- and Sav1 -/- mouse models and collected gene expression data from them. Our study provided new understanding on molecular characteristics of HCC.

DESIGN
Sav1 and Mst1/2 Knockout models
