TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of Rpb1 from 12hr conjugating Oxytricha trifallax cells

ORGANISM
Oxytricha trifallax

SUMMARY
To study the biogenesis of long non-coding RNAs transcribed during genome rearrangements in Oxytricha development, genome-wide localization pattern of Rpb1 (RNA Pol-II largest subunit) was studied from Oxytricha cells undergoing conjugation.

DESIGN
Chromatin from 12hr conjugating O.trifallax cells was subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by sequencing of Input and ChIP samples via Illumina paired-end sequencing.
