TITLE
Safety and Immunogenicity of the Recombinant BCG Vaccine AERAS-422 in Healthy BCG-naïve Adults: A Randomized, Active-controlled, First-in-human Phase 1 Trial

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a first-in-human trial evaluating safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant BCG, AERAS-422, over-expressing TB antigens Ag85A, Ag85B, and Rv3407 and expressing mutant perfringolysin. Interpretation: The unexpected development of VZV in two of eight healthy adult vaccine recipients resulted in discontinuation of AERAS-422 vaccine development. Immunological and transcriptomal data identified correlations with the development of TB immunity and VZV that require further investigation.

DESIGN
This was a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation trial in HIV-negative, healthy adult, BCG-naïve volunteers, negative for prior exposure to Mtb, at one US clinical site. Volunteers were randomized 2:1 at each dose level to receive a single intradermal dose of AERAS-422 ( > 105– <  10e6 CFU = low dose, ≥106–  <  10e7 CFU = high dose) or non-recombinant Tice BCG (1–8 × 10e5 CFU). Randomization used an independently prepared randomly generated sequence of treatment assignments. The primary and secondary outcomes were safety and immunogenicity, respectively, assessed in all participants through 182 days post-vaccination. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01340820
