TITLE
DNA methylation profiles of isolated embryonic and adult cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, tissue and stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the DNA methylation profiles of matured differentiated cardiomyocytes, DNA methylation profiles were obtained by HELP tagging assay using the isolated cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts from different developmental stages, tissues and cultured stem cells.

DESIGN
DNA methylation in mouse tissues and cells
