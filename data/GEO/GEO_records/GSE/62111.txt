TITLE
Epigenome analysis of the effects of JQ1 on DNA methylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of four female lymphoblastoid cell lines treated with DMSO control for 250 nM JQ1. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 8 samples, which were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
