TITLE
Expression data from cold treated wheat cultivars

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Different wheat cultivars may be classified as either winter or spring varieties depending on whether they require exposure to an extended period of cold in order to become competent to flower.  Using a growth regime that mimics the conditions that occur during a typical winter in Britain, we wished to survey the genes that are involved in phase transition as well as those involved in cold-acclimation. Keywords: Time course
