TITLE
Expression data from cold treated wheat cultivars

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Different wheat cultivars may be classified as either winter or spring varieties depending on whether they require exposure to an extended period of cold in order to become competent to flower.  Using a growth regime that mimics the conditions that occur during a typical winter in Britain, we wished to survey the genes that are involved in phase transition as well as those involved in cold-acclimation. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
We wished to study the profiles of expression of genes involved in both phase transition (vegetative to reproductive growth transition) and cold-acclimation.  To that end we we exposed plants to a gradual, stepped decline in both temperature and light.  We sampled plants at three time points (3 weeks post-germination, 5 weeks post germination and 9 weeks post germination).  We took samples from two separate tissues (crown and leaf) to se whether responses were different.  We used two biological reps for each time point and tissue.  Control plants were exposed to a delined in day-length and light intensity, but not in temperature.
