TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Skeletonema marinoi Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Skeletonema marinoi

SUMMARY
Purpose:Using Illumina high-throughout sequencing technology, the transcriptome and expression profiles of S. marinoi were sequenced and analyzed. Comprehensive and systematic study of transcriptomic characteristics, analysis of characteristics of Digital Gene Expression Profiling during different growth phase and deep exploration of molecular mechanism for response to the temperature and low silicate stress environment will provide a comprehensive insight into gene expression profiles and provides an important gene resource for future genetic and molecular studies of S. marinoi and other Skeletonema family diatom.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates for each treatment: exponential phase (2 replicates, control), declining phase, Stationary phase, low temperature, high temperature (1 replicate), low silicate

PLATFORM
GPL21394 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Skeletonema marinoi)
