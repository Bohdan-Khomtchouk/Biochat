TITLE
Gene expression profile of human dental follicle cells (hDFCs) induced by conditioned medium derived from human dental pulp cells (hDPCs-CM)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of hDPCs-CM on osteogenic differentiation of hDFCs and to compare gene expression in hDFCs in the presence or absence of hDPCs-CM

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from hDFCs in osteogenic medium for 7 days with or without hDPCs-CM.
