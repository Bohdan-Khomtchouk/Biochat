TITLE
Evaluation and comparison of the glyco-gene expression profile of endothelial cells stimulated with VEGF, bFGF and galectin-3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dr. Panjwani's laboratory is focusing on the mechanism by which galectins-3 and 7 mediate corneal epithelial cell migration. Recently published studies, that we have confirmed and expended on in our laboratory, clearly demonstrate that galectin-3 mediates angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.  More interestingly we have found that bFGF- and VEGF-mediated angiogenesis can be inhibited by galectin-3 inhibitors, which suggests an important role of carbohydrate recognition systems in the process of angiogenesis.  In an effort to characterize the role of carbohydrate recognition system in angiogenesis, we are interested to evaluate and compare the glyco-gene expression profile of endothelial cells stimulated with VEGF, bFGF and galectin-3 at time and concentration at which, the compounds stimulate angiogenesis in vitro.

DESIGN
RNA preparations of Galectin-3, VEGF, bFGF, Media Control biological replicates were sent to Microarray Core (E).  The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to GLYCO_v3 microarrays.
