TITLE
Transcriptome-wide RNA 5-methylcytosine methylation in shoots of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Here we use bisulfite conversion of rRNA depleted RNA combined with high-throughput Illumina sequencing (RBS-seq) to identify single-nucleotide resolution of m5C sites transcriptome-wide in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. m5C sites were also analyzed in Arabidopsis trm4b-1 and trdmt1 T-DNA KO mutants for the RNA methyltransferases TRM4B and TRDMT1.

DESIGN
RNA bisulfite sequencing was used to identify candidate m5C sites transcriptome-wide in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, using rRNA depleted RNA. Illumina sequencing was performed on a HiSeq platform. The genotypes used are wild type trm4b-1 and trdmt1. All genotypes have two biological replicates with two technical replicates for each biological replicate.

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
