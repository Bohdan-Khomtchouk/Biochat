TITLE
Activation of a NCAM1 expressing progenitor cell population in adult human kidney epithelia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NCAM1+ subpopulation of adult human kidney epithelial cells (hKEpC) can be specifically activated in vitro to stem-like cells that de-differentiate and recapitulate embryogenesis.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in the NCAM1+ sub-population in comparison to NCAM1-.
