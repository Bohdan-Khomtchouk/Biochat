TITLE
Mx-Cre mediated deletion of SRF in murine hematopoietic LSK (Lin-Sca1+c-Kit+) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hematopoietic LSK(Lin-Sca1+c-Kit+) cells lacking the Serum response factor (SRF) gene. Results provide insight into the role of SRF in regulating genetic programs important for hematopoietic stem cell development

DESIGN
Comparison of the gene expression profile between murine Lin-Sca1+c-Kit+ cells from Mx-Cre C57BL/6 Srf WT (3) and C57BL/6 Srf KO (3). Cells were sorted by flow cytometry and RNA was harvested and hybridized to Affymetrix MOE430A.
