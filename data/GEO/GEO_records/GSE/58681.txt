TITLE
Populus 717 wildtype versus 35S::EVE1

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
RNA was extracted from xylem tissue of the first 5cm of the lower stem of four replicates of three overexpression lines and wild-type. Samples were collected from 3-month-old Populus from growth-chamber experiments at 25oC and 35oC.

DESIGN
2 treatments (growth at 25C and 35C temperature), 4 genotypes (wildtype and 3 35S::EVE1 independent lines) and 4 biological reps per genotype

PLATFORM
GPL18845 Agilent-037366 NextGenPoplar
