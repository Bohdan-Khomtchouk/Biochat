TITLE
Platelets direct monocytes differentiation into multinucleated giant foam cells with suppressive response to mycobacterial stimulus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Co-culture of platelets with monocytes induces the forming of multinucleated giant foam cells (MP-Mac or MP-MNGCs). Compared with normal monocyte differentiated macrophages (M-Mac), the MP-MNGCs can engulf more mycobacteria with suppressed inflammatory responses (releasing more IL-10 with less TNF-gamma). Microarray analysis demonstrated that the MP-MNGCs greatly up-regulated CXCL5, PPBP, NT5E, PDPN, CXCL3 and other M2 related genes, such as ARG1, CXCL1, CD163, etc. GO analysis revealed higher cluster of genes in response to wounding and nuclear division. Immunohistochemistry studies indicated similar high expression of IL-10, CXCL5, CXCL3, PDPN and ARG1 expression in MNGCs of TB granuloma, which indicated that phagocytosis of activated platelets by monocytes might be involved in pathogenesis of TB granuloma.

DESIGN
Microarray experiments were performed as dual-color hybridizations. To compensate for dye-specific effects, a dye-reversal color-swap was applied. Quality control and quantification of total RNA amount was assessed using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Kisker).
