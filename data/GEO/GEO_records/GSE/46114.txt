TITLE
Mapping of Notch1 binding sites in a mouse immature T cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used an immature mouse T cell line engineered to express a biotinylated form of the cleaved form of Notch1 (ICN1). ICN1-bound sites were precipitated with streptavidin-coated beads and subjected to ChIP-sequencing.

DESIGN
Beko cells correspond to a spontaneous T lymphoma immature cell line derived from a TCRb deficient mouse. These cells were engineered to express a biotin-tagged-ICN1 and the bacterial biotin ligase BirA (Bio-ICN1) or just BirA as a control (Bio). Chromatin from both cell lines was subjected to strepatavidin-mediated precipitation and subjected to sequencing with the Illumina GAII sequencer as single end 36 base pair reads.
