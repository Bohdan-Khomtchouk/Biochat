TITLE
MATT mapping of Transposon insertions sites of strain G27 GPS-cat library

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori

SUMMARY
Genomic DNA from pools of H. pylori strain G27 Clones as indicated (pools of 300 (300p) or insertions in specific mapped genes) were amplifed using the MATT method to label DNA adjacent to the site of transposon insertion with the primer pairs indicated. The left side of the transposon was labeled in the Cy3 channel (Primer S) and the right side of the transposon was labeled in the Cy5 channel (Primer N). Keywords: reference_design
