TITLE
Genome-Wide STAT5 binding sites in Kit225 leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to systematically map STAT5 genomic binding sites and IL-2 mediated gene expression changes we mapped STAT5 binding sites using chip-on-ChIP in IL-2 dependent Kit225 cells that were either left un-stimulated or stimulated with IL-2 for 30 minutes. Using MAT analysis we identified 1581 STAT5 binding sites.

DESIGN
IL2-stimulated Kit225 cells ChIPed with STAT5 antibodies vs. Input

PLATFORM
