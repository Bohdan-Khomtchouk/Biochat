TITLE
Age-associated DNA methylation increases in mouse pancreatic islets suggest an epigenetic drift toward the exocrine pancreas epigenome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Early postnatal overnutrition causes persistent dysregulation of endocrine pancreas function. We used genome-scale DNA methylation profiling in the suckling-period small litter (SL) mouse model to test whether this occurs via persistent epigenetic changes in pancreatic islets. Although SL islets showed DNA methylation changes directly after weaning and in adulthood, few of these were present at both ages, contrary to our hypothesis. Most interestingly, we discovered that genomic regions that are hypermethylated in exocrine relative to endocrine pancreas tend to gain methylation in islets during aging. Focusing on a subset of genes relevant to Î² cell function, we showed that these methylation differences are strongly correlated with expression. Together, our results provide the novel insight that DNA methylation changes that occur as islets age indicate an overall epigenetic drift toward the exocrine pancreas epigenome. These concerted shifts in the islet methylome could contribute to the age-associated decline in endocrine pancreas function.

DESIGN
Pancreatic islets were isolated from P21/P180 SL or C mice. To ensure purity of islets, 3 rounds of manual picking were performed in each samples. Whole pancreas samples, ~98% of which is exocrine pancreas, were used as exocrine pancreas. There are 5 mice per group.
