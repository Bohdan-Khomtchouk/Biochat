TITLE
Leukemia dynamics and heterogeneity traced by barcoding in a pre-clinical Cbx7 mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of different leukemia types after overexpression of Cbx7 in mice hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells followed by transplantation. Mice developed three different types of leukemia, 1) erythroid, 2) T-cell, 3) undifferentiated, as shown in K.Klauke et al. Nat Cell Biol 2013

DESIGN
