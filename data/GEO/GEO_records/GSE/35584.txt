SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Florencia Pauli ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track is produced as part of the ENCODE Project. RNA-seq is a method for mapping and quantifying the transcriptome of any organism that has a genomic DNA sequence assembly (Mortazavi et al., 2008). Biological replicates of ENCODE cell lines were grown on separate culture plates, total RNA was purified and polyA selected two times. mRNA was then fragmented by magnesium-catalyzed hydrolysis, reverse transcribed to cDNA by random priming and amplified. The cDNA was sequenced on an Illumina Genome Analyzer (GAI or GAIIx). The DNA sequences were aligned to the NCBI Build37 (hg19) version of the human genome using the sequence alignment programs ELAND (Illumina) or Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009). The first 10 residues of sequencing have a weak characteristic nucleotide bias of unknown origin. This RNA-seq protocol does not specify the coding strand. As a result, there will be ambiguity at loci where both strands are transcribed. This is the first NCBI Build37 (hg19) release of this track (Jan 2012). This release includes the 3 datasets (Jurkat, A549/DEX100nm, and A549/EtOH2pct) previously released on NCBI Build36 (hg18) and adds data for several more cell types and growth conditions in replicate. Four types of download files are available for each replicate including the Raw Data (fastq), Transcripts GencodeV7 (gtf), Raw Signal (bigwig), and Alignments (bam).
