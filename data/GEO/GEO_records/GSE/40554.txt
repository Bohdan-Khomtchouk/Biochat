TITLE
Identifying chromatin associations with promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies using immunoTRAP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Studies using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have attempted to determine whether specific gene loci associate with promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs).  Two drawbacks accompany this approach; the lack of spatial resolution inherent with the technique, and the a priori basis for selecting which genes to probe.  To overcome these limitations, we developed a technique, which we call immunoTRAP, which purifies the DNA contacting PML NBs at molecular dimensions.  When we combined the immunoTRAP technique with immunoFISH and microarray analysis, not only did we verify a TP53-PML NB association, but were able also to identify novel locus associations such as PML, ABCA7, and TFF1.  In addition, we observed that these associations are cell type specific, and induction of significantly higher levels of PML gene expression, as well as other physiological changes brought about by interferon treatment, can lead to a physical association of the PML gene with PML NBs in normal human fibroblasts. Thus, immunoTRAP is a technique capable of identifying the chromatin associations around nuclear subcompartments and is amenable for further downstream applications such as microarray analysis or deep sequencing.
