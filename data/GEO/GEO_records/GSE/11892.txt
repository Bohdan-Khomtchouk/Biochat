TITLE
A Global View of Gene Activity and Alternative Splicing by Deep Sequencing of the Human Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome of HEK and B cells were analyzed by microarray and RNA-Seq parallely. Both platforms were then compared in terms of sensitivity. To assess whether values were a reliable indicator of gene activity, we correlated these values with hypophosphorylated RNA polymerase II (PolIIa) occupancy, used as a landmark of transcription initiation. For HEK, we identified PolIIa islands by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-Seq).
