TITLE
Creb overexpression induces leukemia in zebrafish by blocking myeloid differentiation process

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To examine the role of CREB overexpression in hematopoiesis, we created a model of leukemia in zebrafish by overexpressing the human CREB in the myeloid hematopoietic lineage. Whole transcriptome analysis of kidney-marrow revealed 171 genes differently expressed between CREB- and control-zebrafish (five per group). Interestingly, the integration of this signature with human deposited data revealed that this tumor resembled a human AML at transcriptome level.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of kidney marrow from CREB-zebrafish and zebrafish controls (five animals per group).
