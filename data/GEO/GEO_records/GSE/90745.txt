TITLE
LncRNAs and mRNAs changes in border zone of myocardial infarction in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Comparison of both LncRNAs and mRNAs expression in the border zone of the myocardial infarction rats and the sham operation rats Border zone (BZ) of the myocardial infarction is critical to patients. Current treatments of myocardial infarction are primarily aimed to save the dying myocardial cell in the border zone. During myocardial infarction, certain changes in BZ, e.g, apoptosis, fibrosis, inflammation, etc, played an important role in deciding the survival. Impairment and recovery of BZ has been linked to gene expression changes. The aim of our study was to obtain a global expression profile of lncRNAs and mRNAs of the border zone in Wistar rats myocardial infarction, and identify the changes during myocardial infarction.

DESIGN
3 male rats were used to set up myocardial infarction model by ligation of LAD, and 3 rats were sham-operated. Border zone tissue of myocardial infarction was determined by TTC & EB double stain, then was send to further microarry analysis.
