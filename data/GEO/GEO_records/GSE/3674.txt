TITLE
Expression profile of erythrocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human erythrocytes lack a nucleus and are considered to be incapable of protein synthesis. Nevertheless these anucleated cells regulate a number of gene expressions as well as posttranscriptional and postranslational modifications of proteins. We evaluated which genes are transcribed in mature erythrocytes. Keywords: expression profile

DESIGN
Seven independent samples from healthy human donors were analyzed. Genes that had a detection call " present " in all seven array experiments were selected for further analysis.
