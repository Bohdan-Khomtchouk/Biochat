TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of chicken DCs response to infectious bursal disease virus

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Background: Avian infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a major poultry disease which leads to significant losses of poultry industry. Dendritic cells (DCs), the only bridge communicated the innate and acquired immunity, have the most important antigen presenting ability and can significantly influence the pathogenicity of viruses. To understand the interaction between IBDV and DCs, microarray was used to analyze the response of DCs infected by IBDV. Results: Results showed that IBDV infection induced 479 up-regulated and 466 down-regulated mRNAs in chicken DCs. GO terms analysis suggested that transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter and RNA biosynthetic process were mainly enriched, whilst pathway analyses suggested that oxidative phosphorylation, T cell receptor and IL-17 signaling pathway might activated by IBDV infection. Moreover, we detected the microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) alterations in IBDV-infected chicken DCs. Results identified 18 significant up- or down- regulated miRNAs and 441 significant up- or down-regulated lncRNAs in IBDV-stimulated DCs. Furthermore, we constructed 42 TF (transcription factors)-miRNA-mRNA interactions involving 1 TF, 3 miRNAs and 42 mRNAs in IBDV-stimulated DCs. Finally, we predicted the target genes of different expressed lncRNAs and constructed lncRNA-mRNA regulatory networks. Conclusions: Altogether, our research suggested a mechanism to explain how IBDV infection triggered an effective immune response in chicken DCs.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, cultured chicken bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were randomly divided into control group and IBDV-stimulated group. Each group consisted of three wells of BMDCs from three chickens.
