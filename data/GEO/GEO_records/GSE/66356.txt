TITLE
Expression profiling of LB-22 immortalized mouse embryonic kidney cells in control and WT1 siRNA knockdown conditions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LB-22 is an immortalized mesenchymal cell line derived from embryonic kidneys of 'immortomice'. Immortomice ubiquitously express an interferon-inducible, temperature-sensitive SV-40 large T antigen. LB-22 cells were selected for endogenous abundant expression of the mouse Wilms' tumor suppressor homolog WT1, an important transcription factor in kidney development. Here, we assessed changes in gene expression in response to siRNA mediated WT1 knockdown.

DESIGN
LB-22 cells were transfected either with WT1 siRNA or scramble Control siRNA. Total RNA was extracted 48 hours after transfection and Affymetrix Mouse 430.2 expression arrays were hybridized according to standard protocols. CEL files not available for this dataset.
