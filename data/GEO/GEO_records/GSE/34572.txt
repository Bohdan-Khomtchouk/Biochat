SUMMARY
Background: Clear guidelines for therapy of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) are missing due to the lack of randomized double-blind controlled clinical trials. Moderate yet similar clinical benefit has been demonstrated for IFN-a monotherapy and high-dose ascorbic acid (AA) monotherapy in open clinical trials. However, there is no clear evidence to support the value of one of these specific treatment approaches, due to the lack of in vivo and in vitro studies exploring and comparing the effects of high-dose AA and IFN-a treatment in the context of HAM/TSP. Principal Findings: Based on flow cytometry and thymidine incorporation, we demonstrated for the first time that high-dose AA displays superior antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects over IFN-a in HAM/TSP PBMCs ex vivo. In addition, high-dose AA induces cell death in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines in vitro. Microarray combined with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed AA-induced modulation of genes associated with cell death and cell cycle. Conclusions: In comparison with IFN-a, high-dose AA is preferred as anti-HTLV-1 treatment in vitro, due to its superior cell death-inducing, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects. Considering the lack of treatment options, the mild in vivo side effects and the low cost price, high-dose AA should be further explored for its therapeutic potential in HAM/TSP treatment.

DESIGN
In total, 15 samples were analyzed. One microarray experiment was performed, including triplicate samples for each treatment condition (untreated, IFN-a, 10 µg/ml ascorbic acid, 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid, 100 µg/ml ascorbic acid). Triplicate samples were obtained from three separate RNA experiments.
