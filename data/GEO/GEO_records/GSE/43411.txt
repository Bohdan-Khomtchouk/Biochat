TITLE
NanoString miRNA profiling of THP1-differentiated macrophages treated with LPS derived from A. aggregatibacter, P. gingivalis and Pg LPS treated with cigrate smoke extract (Pg CSE)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the early (4h) miRNAs responses of differentiated macrophages to LPS challenge, we performed global miRNA profiling using the Nanostring nCounter technology, a multiplexed, color-coded probe assay. Of the 653 probes present on the assay, we detected expression of ~200 (30%) miRNAs across all samples.

DESIGN
THP-1 differentiated cells were treated in duplicates with Aa, Pg and Pg (CSE) LPS for 4h and the cells were harvested after washing twice with PBS. Total RNA was isolated using miRNeasy kit (Qiagen). Samples were then processed for Nanostring profiling.
