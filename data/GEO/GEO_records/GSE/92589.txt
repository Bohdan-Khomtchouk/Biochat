TITLE
Tsc2 KO cells have a transcriptional signature found in bladder tumors with TSC1/2 deficiency and that is corrected by sirolimus and includes Lgals3 overexpression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Use RNA-seq to obtain transcriptional signature of Tsc2 KO neonatal mouse dermal fibroblasts +/- sirolimus.  The resulting mTORC1 transcriptional signature is tested in the TCGA database of bladder cancers with non-silent mutations in TSC1/2.

DESIGN
n = 3 WT vehicle, n = 3 KO vehicle, n = 3 WT sirolimus, n = 3 KO sirolimus
