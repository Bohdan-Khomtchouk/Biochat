TITLE
Search for a gene-expression signature of breast cancer local recurrence in young women

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kreike et al, have constructed a gene-expression (GE) profile predictive for local recurrence (LR) after breast-conserving treatment (BCT) from a series of 165 patients . This study aimed to test this signature both internally (cross-platform) and externally on a independent series and to further explore the search for a GE signature of breast cancer LR in young women.

DESIGN
The transcriptome of 343 primary breast cancer carcinoma were analyzed using Illumina HumanWG-6_v3 Arrays.
