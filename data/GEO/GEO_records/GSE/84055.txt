TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling Using Huntington Disease Cell Culture Model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify genes affected by mutant huntington protein, we performed mRNA-seq experiments with Striatal STHdh Q7/Q7, Q7Q111, and Q111/Q111 cells. We also tested the effect of Sp1 overexpression on rescuing gene expression in Q111/Q111 cells.

DESIGN
Striatal STHdh Q7/Q7, Q7/Q111 and Q111/Q111 cells were used for the mRNA-seq in replicates. After Sp1 transient overexpression in Q111/Q111 cells, cells were collected for mRNA-seq analysis.

PLATFORM
