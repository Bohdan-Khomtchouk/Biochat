TITLE
Genome-wide binding map of FoxO1 and Pax5 in pre-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of FoxO1 and Pax5 binding in pre-B cells following attenuation of IL-7 signaling. Transcription factor FoxO1 has been shown to be an essential factor for Ig light chain rearrangement. Results demonstrate that FoxO1 and Pax5 co-target genes that are activated during pre-B cell differentiation.

DESIGN
Examination of FoxO1 and/or Pax5 binding under withdrawal of IL-7R signaling.

PLATFORM
