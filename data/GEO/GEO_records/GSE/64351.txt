TITLE
Downstream genes regulated by TSHZ2 in MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify downstream genes regulated by TSHZ2, MCF-7 cells were lentivirally transduced by TSHZ2 and its control LacZ and served their RNA samples for gene expression analysis using AGILENT human 8x60K cDNA microarray.

DESIGN
Array analysis of MCF-7 cells expressing either TSHZ2 or LacZ. 1 color method was employed.
