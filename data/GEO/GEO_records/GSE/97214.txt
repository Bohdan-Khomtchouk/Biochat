TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing identify a recurrent CRYL1-IFT88 chimeric transcript in hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed transcriptome sequencing for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adjacent non-tumorous tissues to investigate the molecular basis of HCC. Nine HCC patients were recruited and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Candidate fusion transcripts were also identified. Further RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing experiments were performed to validate potential recurrent fusion transcripts in other 54 pairs of tumor and adjacent non-tumor samples. A total of 1943 DEGs were detected, including 690 up-regulated and 1253 down-regulated genes, and enriched in ten pathways, especially cell cycle, DNA replication, p53 and complement and coagulation cascades. Seven candidate fusion genes were detected and CRYL1-IFT88 was successfully validated in the discovery sequencing sample and another 5 tumor samples with the recurrent rate of about 9.52% (6/63). The full length of CRYL1-IFT88 was obtained by 3' and 5' RACE. The function of the fusion transcript is closed to CRYL1 because it contained most of domain of CRYL1. According to the bioinformatics analysis, IFT88, reported as a tumor suppressor, might be seriously depressed in the tumor cell with this fusion because the transcript structure of IFT88 was totally changed. The function depression of IFT88 caused by gene fusion CRYL1-IFT88 might be associated with tumorigenesis or development of HCC.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq for tumor and adjacent non-tumorous tissues from nine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.
