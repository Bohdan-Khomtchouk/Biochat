TITLE
Chlamydomonas diurnal transcriptome

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
We combined a highly synchronous photobioreactor culture system with frequent temporal sampling to characterize genome-wide periodic gene expression in Chlamydomonas.

DESIGN
Synchronous phototrophic cultures of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were prepared in controlled diurnal bioreactor growth conditions and sampled in two 24-hour replicate time courses at 1-hour and 0.5-hour intervals for Illumina paired-end RNA-Seq. More than ~3 million paired end reads were obtained for each sample.
