TITLE
Expression during deetioaltion under Rc in wt and phy mutant seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Etiolated seedling response to one hour of continuous red light. Four-day-old dark-grown wild-type RLD and phyA101, phyB1  and phyAphyB  mutant seedlings were transferred to Rc (680 nm, 8  mol m-2 s-1) for 1 h or retained in darkness as controls. Three different biological replicates of each treatment were grown separately and extracted, processed, and analyzed independently.RNA was extracted and subjected to expression analysis by using the Affymetrix ATH1 microarray containing approximately 22,000 Arabidopsis genes .

DESIGN
3 dark and 3 1hr Rc samples ( biological replicates) were analyzed for each genotype
