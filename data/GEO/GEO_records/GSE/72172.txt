TITLE
Transcriptome analysis upon overexpression of SIN3 187HA  in Drosophila cultured cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
SIN3 is a master transcriptional scaffold protein. SIN3 interacts with RPD3 and other accessory proteins to form a histone modifying complex. A single Sin3A gene encodes multiple isoforms of SIN3, of which SIN3 187 and SIN3 220 are the predominant isoforms. Previous studies demonstrated that SIN3 isoforms play non-redundant roles during fly development. In the current study, we sought to investigate the genes regulated by SIN3 187.

DESIGN
S2 cells and cells carrying a stable transgene of SIN3 187HA (SIN3 187HA cells) were treated with 0.07 ÂµM CuSO4. CuSO4 treatment led to ectopic expression of SIN3 187HA. S2 cells were used as a control. Following induction, total mRNA was extracted. mRNA profiling of these samples were performed by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq2500. Three biological replicates were performed.
