TITLE
Gene expression profiles in CDX2P-G19Cre;Apcflox/flox;Tgfbr2flox/flox and CDX2P-G19Cre;Apcflox/flox mouse tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mutations in TGFBR2, a component of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling pathway, occur in high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H) colorectal cancer (CRC). In mouse models, Tgfbr2 inactivation in the intestinal epithelium accelerates the development of malignant intestinal tumors in combination with disruption of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway. However, no studies have further identified the genes influenced by TGFBR2 inactivation following disruption of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway. We previously described CDX2P-G19Cre;Apcflox/flox mice, which is stochastically null for Apc in the colon epithelium. In this study, we generated CDX2P-G19Cre;Apcflox/flox;Tgfbr2flox/flox mice, with simultaneous loss of Apc and Tgfbr2. These mice developed tumors, including adenocarcinoma in the proximal colon. We compared gene expression profiles between tumors of the two types of mice using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Tumors in two genetically engineered mice at 3 weeks of age.  CDX2P-G19Cre;Apcflox/flox;Tgfbr2flox/flox mice’ and CDX2P-G19Cre;Apcflox/flox mice’ were selected by LMD6500 laser capture microdissection device for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
