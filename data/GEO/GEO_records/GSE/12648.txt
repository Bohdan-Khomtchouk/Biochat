TITLE
Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy (HIBM)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIBM is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by adult-onset, slowly progressive distal and proximal muscle weakness. Here, gene expression was measured in muscle specimens from 10 HIBM patients carrying the M712T Persian Jewish founder mutation in GNE and presenting with mild histological changes, and from 10 healthy matched control individuals. Keywords: Muscle specimen

DESIGN
Samples were taken from muscle specimens (deltoid, biceps, quadriceps, tibialis), from 10 HIBM patients carrying the M712T Persian Jewish founder mutation in GNE and presenting with mild histological changes. Ages of patients range between 20 to 59. Additional 10 matched samples were taken from healthy control individuals (deltoid, biceps, quadriceps, gluteus, paraspinally and triceps muscles), with age range 18 to 74.
