TITLE
Continuous gene expression profile of leaf throughout the entire growth of rice in 2010

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
A continuous gene expression profiling of leaves at regular interval from transplanting until harvesting was performed to understand the changes of transcriptional program and physiological state throughout entire growth of the rice plant in 2010.

DESIGN
For continuous gene expression profile of leaf, the uppermost fully-expanded leaf in the main stem was sampled at 12:00 PM at regular intervals of 7 days encompassing 17 different growth stages with three replicates during a normal rice growing season in 2010.
