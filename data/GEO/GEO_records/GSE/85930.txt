TITLE
LncRNA and mRNA Expression in aortic smooth muscle cells with Srf knockout or Myocd over-expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in aortic smooth muscle cells with Srf knockout or Myocd over-expression were analyzed by Arraystar Mouse LncRNA Microarray V3.0.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples were extracted from aortic smooth muscle cells with Srf knockout or Myocd over-expression. The LncRNA and mRNA expression profiling was performed using Arraystar Mouse LncRNA microarrays V3.0.

PLATFORM
