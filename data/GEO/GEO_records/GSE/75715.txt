TITLE
TAp73 is a master regulator of airway multiciliogenesis [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparative RNA seq analysis of WT and global p73KO Mouse Tracheal Epithelial Cell  (MTECs) during the course of their differentiation (Air-Liquid Interface ALI D0, D4, D7, D14) aimed to determine the role of p73 in motile multiciliogenesis.

DESIGN
Three independent biological replicates of murine primary airway epithelial cell cultures (MTECs) from wild type and global p73KO mice were differentiated under air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions and harvested  at Day 0, Day 4 , Day 7 and Day 14  post ALI.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
