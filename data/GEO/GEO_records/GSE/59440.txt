SUMMARY
Expression profiling of a total of 656 proteins in 3 high grade non-muslce invasive bladder cancer cases/normal urothelial mucosa pairs

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a consecutively operated, well-defined 3 HG NMIBC cases was used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 656 unique proteins, leading to the successful construction of supervised
