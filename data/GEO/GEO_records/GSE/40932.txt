TITLE
Activation of plant defence in Brassica napus L. cv. Westar and transgenic MINELESS plants after attack by Mamestra brassicae (cabbage moth)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plants within the Brassicaceae family have a unique defence mechanism known as the “glucosinolate-myrosinase” system. Upon tissue disruption by insect herbivores, glucosinolates are hydrolysed by the enzyme myrosinase (EC 3.2.1.147) into a variety of degradation products, which can deter insect herbivory. This process has been termed as “The Mustard Oil Bomb”. Seeds of Brassica napus have been genetically modified to remove myrosinase containing myrosin cells. The modified plants have been named MINELESS due to a lack of toxic mines in seeds. This study aimed to get insights into defence responses of B. napus wild-type and MINELESS seedlings, after being challenged by larvae of the generalist herbivore Mamestra brassicae. The microarray analysis showed 494 and 159 genes to be differentially regulated after M. brassicae feeding on wild-type and MINELESS seedlings, respectively. Many of the observed transcriptional responses i B. napus and the MINELESS mutant are related to those found in Arabidopsis thaliana plants when they are exposed to insects.
