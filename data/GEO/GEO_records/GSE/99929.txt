TITLE
Single-cell mass cytometry reveals the impact of graphene nanomaterials with human primary immune cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The genome-wide transcriptome analysis highlight the increased biocompatibility on immune cells of graphene functionalized with amino groups (NH2) compared with graphene oxide (GO); reducing the cell metabolism disfunction. Moreover, GONH2 was found to polarizes T-cell and monocyte activation toward a T helper-1/M1 immune response.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated T cells (Jurkat) and Monocytes (THP1) cell lines incubated with graphenes (conc 50Âµg/mL) for 24 hours compared to untreated control cells.
