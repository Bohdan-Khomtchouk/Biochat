TITLE
comparisons wt-mutants 1 et 3-Gene profiling upon biotic stress treatment. Gene profiling in microRNA mutants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs06-06_mirna - comparisons wt-mutants 1 et 3 - Time course : What are the genes (incuding microRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated upon flg22 treatment? miRNA : What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of microRNA mutants? siRNA : What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of siRNA mutants? - Col-0, dcl2-1, dcl3-1 and rdr2-1 were grown for 12-day on MS solid medium ,seedlings were then transferred in MS liquid medium and harvested 2 days after. Keywords: gene knock out

DESIGN
3 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
