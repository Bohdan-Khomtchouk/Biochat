TITLE
The effects of knockdown of PML by different individual siRNAs in HUVEC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the potential target genes regulated by PML in endothelial cells, we carried out siRNA-mediated knockdown of PML in HUVEC cells. To eliminate the off-target effects of siRNAs, we utilized two different siRNAs. Only the genes changed in the same pattern following both siRNAs transfection are considered as potential PML-knockdown responsive genes.

DESIGN
The experiment is one-factor (siRNA) with three ranks (siCtrl, siPML-1, siPML-2). We included technical duplicates for each sample. To minimize systemic errors assoicated with technique, we distributed the duplicates on two different microarray chips.
