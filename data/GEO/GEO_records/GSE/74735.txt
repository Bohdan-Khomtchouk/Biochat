TITLE
Gene expression analysis in Plaa+/+ and PlaaG23V/G23V cerebellum/caudal brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice homozygous for p. Gly23Val substitution in Phospholipase A2 Activating Protein (PLAA: PlaaG23V/G23V) display muscle weakness, cerebellar atazia and tremor.  To investigate the molecular mechanism for these phenotypes we dissected the caudal region of the brain including the cerebellum and hind brain from three wild type (Plaa+/+) and three mutant (PlaaG23V/G23V) mice, extracted RNA and performed gene-level microarray analysis

DESIGN
We analysed RNA extracted from the caudal brain of three wild type (Plaa+/+) and three mutant (PlaaG23V/G23V) mice
