TITLE
Glycan analysis of promary human lymphatic endothlial cells (LEX) in their resting and activated states, in normal and tumor tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Trafficking of leukocytes (dendritic cells, memory T cells, neutrophils) and tumor cells through the lymphatic network is a key process in inflammation and immunity and an important mechanism in metastatic spread of human cancers (1-3). Such trafficking involves both communication with and passage across lymphatic endothelium, the distinct endothelium that lines lymphatic vessels within the peripheral tissues and forms the lymphatic sinuses within lymph nodes. However, in comparison with blood vascular endothelium, there is only a rudimentary understanding of the molecular phenotype of lymphatic endothelium, and only a basic knowledge of the glycoconjugates that regulate leukocyte-endothelial and tumor cell-endothelial interactions in the lymphatic compartment.

DESIGN
We would anticipate that changes in glycosylation of LEC cell surface proteins following activation might affect important functions associated withy LEC including eg. interactions with leukocytes and/or sequestration of GAG-binding chemokines. We already have shown that ligand binding to the lymphatic endothelial hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 is reversibly masked by terminal sialation in LEC and that functional regulation of LYVE-1 is likely to be important in inflammation. An advantage of our proposal is that we can routinely isolate primary LEC in relatively large numbers, and have the necessary ethical approval to do so from human tissue.
