TITLE
Global Transcriptional Analysis of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae Following Exposure to Norepinephrine

ORGANISM
Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of the transcriptional responses of M. hyopneumoniae under norepinephrine stress. Six independent RNA samples from norepinephrine-exposed cultures were paired with six independent RNA samples from control cultures for hybridization to six two-color microarrays. For three arrays, the control RNA sample was labeled with Cy3 dye and the experimental RNA sample was labeled with Cy5 dye, the dyes were reversed for the other three arrays to overcome dye bias. Keywords: stress response
