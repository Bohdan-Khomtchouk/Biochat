TITLE
Patient-derived organoid cultures model human primary liver cancer in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study of human liver cancer has been hampered by the lack of reliable models that faithfully recapitulate the physiopathology of the patientâ€™s original tumour ex vivo. Here, we describe the first culture system to allow the establishment and long-term expansion of human primary liver cancer (PLC) organoids (called tumoroids) from the three most common PLC subtypes: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and mixed HCC/CC tumours (CHC). We evaluated whether tumoroid lines maintain the expression profile and the genomic landscape of the original tumor they derived from by performing genome-wide (RNAseq/WES) analyses before and after culture. These analyses reveal that the cultures closely recapitulate the gene expression and the mutational landscape of the original tumor, allowing discrimination between different tumor subtypes (HCC, CHC, CC).

DESIGN
We generated RNAseq and WES data from healthy donor and 7 tumoral human PLC tissues and their derived organoid cultures maintained in our defined medium.
