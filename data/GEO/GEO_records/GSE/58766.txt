TITLE
Expression profiling of DT40 chicken B cell line by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
A single replicate of exponentially growing DT40 CL18 chicken B lymphoma cells were harvested and extracted RNA was subjected to Illumina GAIIx paired-end sequencing to determine global gene expression.

DESIGN
Single replicate RNA-seq expression analysis of DT40 cells.

PLATFORM
