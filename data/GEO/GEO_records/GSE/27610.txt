TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Aspergillus fumigatus in response to RBL-2H3 mast cells

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus Af293

SUMMARY
In patients with chronic pulmonary disease colonization with the mold Aspergillus fumigatus is associated with declining pulmonary function and obstructive airway disease.  One potential effector of this inflammatory response is the pulmonary mast cell.  In vitro studies have demonstrated that A. fumigatus contact induces IgE-independent mast cell degranulation. Conversely, the Aspergillus secondary metabolite gliotoxin has been shown to suppress mast cell activation. These contradictory results emphasize the need for a better understanding of the interactions between A. fumigatus and mast cells. Thus, the objective of this work was to identify A. fumigatus genes that are differentially regulated upon exposure to mast cells. Transcriptional profiling experiments indicated that, in addition to genes encoding for iron acquisition systems, allergens and putative virulence factors, genes from the gliotoxin biosynthesis cluster were significantly down-regulated upon exposure to mast cells. Globally, the results from this study provide insight into the A. fumigatus response to mast cells and suggest that one mechanism by which the host may circumvent the effects of gliotoxin is via the suppression of fungal gliotoxin synthesis by mast cells.
