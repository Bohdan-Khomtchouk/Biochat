TITLE
Complete embryonic E11.5 metanephric kidney analysis of wild type and Hoxa11, Hoxd11 null targeted mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E11.5 metanephric mesenchyme and ureteric bud were dissected from the E11.5 kidney rudiment using fine manual microdissection (ureteric bud only) or both fine manual microdissection and laser capture microdissection (metanephric mesenchyme) to define the gene expression profiles of these structures.  Additionally, HoxA11, HoxD11 compound null E11.5 metanephric mesenchyme was obtained through laser capture microdissection allowing analysis of possible Hox targets in kidney development.  Targets from multiple biological replicates of each were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix MOE430_v2 arrays. Keywords: embryonic metanephric kidney, kidney development, Hoxa11, Hoxd11, compound null targeted mice
