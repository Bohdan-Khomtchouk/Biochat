TITLE
A Link between the N363S Glucocorticoid Receptor Polymorphism and Altered Gene Expression Related to Human Disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR), N363S, has been the focus of several clinical studies, and some epidemiological data link this SNP to increased glucocorticoid sensitivity, coronary artery disease and increased body mass index (BMI).  However, molecular studies in vitro using reporter gene expression systems have failed to define a link between this polymorphism and altered glucocorticoid receptor function.  To address the biological relevancy of N363S in glucocorticoid receptor mechanisms and function, we established stable U-2 OS (human osteosarcoma) cell lines expressing wild type hGR or N363S using a tetracycline-regulated expression system.  Functional assays with reporter gene systems revealed only minor differences between the wild type hGR and N363S receptors under a variety of conditions that probe for GR function.  However, examination of this polymorphism by human gene microarray analysis showed, for the first time, that there are significant differences between wild type hGR and the N363S SNP in their ability to selectively regulate gene expression.  Several of these genes may define the link between the N363S SNP and human disease. Keywords: human glucocorticoid receptor, N363S single nucleotide polymorphism, microarray gene analysis
