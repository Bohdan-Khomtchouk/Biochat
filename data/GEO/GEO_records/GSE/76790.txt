TITLE
Cellular reactions to long-term volatile organic compound (VOC) exposures.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A549 cells were grown at air liquid interphase (ALI) and exposed to airborne formaldehyde for three days. An exposure platform was developed for this purpose, which provided the volatile analyte in a humidified atmosphere. The platform was composed of a reference and an exposure chamber. Treatments/ Sample code: (A) 0 ppm  (not = no treatment) in the exposure chamber and control cells in the reference chamber (co); (B) 0.1 ppm (01 FA)  in the exposure chamber and control cells in the reference chamber (co); and (C) 0.5 ppm (05FA) in the exposure chamber and control cells in the reference chamber (co)

DESIGN
Each experiment was performed for three times. Chronological order of experiments was randomized. Formaldehyde concentrations could be changed in the atmosphere of the exposure chamber, no formaldehyde was present in the reference chamber (=control).
