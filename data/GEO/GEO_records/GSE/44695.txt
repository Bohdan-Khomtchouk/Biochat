TITLE
GR and Klf15 regulate gene expression dynamics and integrate signals through feed forward circuitry

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates adaptive transcriptional programs that alter metabolism in response to stress. Network properties that allow GR to tune gene expression to match specific physiologic demands are poorly understood. We analyzed the transcriptional consequences of GR activation in murine lungs deficient for Klf15, a transcriptional regulator of amino acid metabolism that is induced by glucocorticoids and fasting

DESIGN
Wild type and Klf15 KO mice were treated with dexamethsone or saline control for 4 and 8 hours.
