TITLE
Genome-wide Tinman binding sites in early and late Drosophila embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The Drosophila transcription factor Tinman (Tin) is involved in embryonic heart development. We have analyzed genomic binding sites for Tin using a ChIP-chip strategy, making use of our high-quality antibody and Affymetrix Drosophila Tiling Arrays. We sampled to time points (early: 3-5.5h AEL and late: 5-8h AEL) that see distinct Tin expression in the embryo. Our data analysis yielded 2548 binding events in early and 988 binding events in late embryos. Our results are described in Jin et al. " Genome-wide screens for in vivo Tinman binding sites identify cardiac enhancers with diverse functional architectures " ; submitted to PLoS Genetics

DESIGN
Drosophila whole embryos, ChIPed with anti-Tin antibody or IgG control, hybridised to Affymetrix Drosophila tiling arrays, data analysed using MAT

PLATFORM
GPL5919 [Dm35b_MR] Affymetrix Drosophila Tiling 1.0R Array
