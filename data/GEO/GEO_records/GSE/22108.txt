TITLE
CGH analysis of Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patient genomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify susceptibility genes concerning copy number variations (CNVs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a case-control genome-wide CNV analyses was carried out by Roche Nimblegen array-based CGH. In this study, 15 RA patients and 1 control (Non-RA) were included.

DESIGN
Comparative genomic hybrydiztion of 15 Rheumatoid arthritis patients and 1 control (non Rheumatoid arthritis) with Sample LX (non Rheumatoid arthritis)as reference.
