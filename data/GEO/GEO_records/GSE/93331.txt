TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Krt15- and Krt15+ basal cells in mouse esophageal epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report different transcriptional profiles of Krt15+ and Krt15- basal cells in the mouse eosphageal epithelium.

DESIGN
Isolation of Krt15- (CD29highGFP-) and Krt15+(CD29highGFP+) basal cells through FACS using Krt15-CrePR1;R26mTomato/mGFP mice

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
