TITLE
Transcriptional changes in the aging mouse hippocampus (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from three age groups (3months (3M), 24 months (24M) and 29 months (29M)) from the full hippocampus

DESIGN
There were two independent experiments: 3M vs 24M (n=5 to 6, single-end sequencing) and 3M vs 29M (n=3, paired-end sequencing))
