TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of J774A.1 macrophages undergoing amino acid deprivation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Phagocytosis represents a mechanism used by macrophages to remove pathogens and cellular debris. Recent evidence suggested that amino acid or glucose deprivation may cause an increase in phagocytosis of heat-inactivated Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus by macrophages, but not the uptake of platelets, apoptotic cells or beads. Increased phagocytosis of bacteria could be blocked by phagocytosis inhibitors and depended on p38 MAP kinase activity. To examine potentially important downstream pathways linked to EBSS-induced starvation and p38 MAP kinase activation, a full genome microarray representing over 41,000 mouse genes or transcripts was probed with cDNA isolated from J774A.1 macrophages that were treated with EBSS, EBSS supplemented with the p38 inhibitor SB202190 or control medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Keywords: autophagy, heterophagy, p38 MAP kinase, scavenger receptor A, starvation

DESIGN
Prior to RNA isolation, J774A.1 macrophages were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with (i) 10% fetal bovine serum, (ii) Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS) or (iii) EBSS supplemented with 10 µM SB202190 for 6 hours.
