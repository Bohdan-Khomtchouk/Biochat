TITLE
hsa-miR-503, hsa-miR-103, and hsa-miR-494 genome wide target profiles [RNA-Seq and RIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We constructed a genome wide target profile of hsa-miR-503, hsa-miR-103, and hsa-miR-494 by sequencing RNA isolated from Ago2 immunoprecipitations and total RNA samples following transfection of the respective miRNA in mature duplex form

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in HeLa cells and Ago2 immunoprecipitations from HeLa cells following miR-503, miR-103, or miR-494 mature duplex or control siRNA transfection

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
