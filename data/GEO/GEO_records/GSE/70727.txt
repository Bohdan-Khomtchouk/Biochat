TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of Hif-1α binding sites in zebrafish [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Analysis of the binding sites of Hif-1α in both wild-type and von Hippel Lindau mutant zebrafish lines at 4dpf by ChIP linked next generation sequencing. The von Hippel Lindau mutant displays a systemic hypoxic response under normoxic conditions. Results show the extent of Hif-1α binding to the genome, and provide a basis for analysis of the transcriptional response to genetically induced hypoxia in zebrafish.

DESIGN
Analysis of the DNA binding sites of Hif-1α in both wild-type and von Hippel Lindau mutant zebrafish lines at 4dpf. The von Hippel Lindau mutant displays a systemic hypoxic response under normoxic conditions. Results show the extent of Hif-1α binding to the genome, and provide a basis for analysis of the dependency of the transcriptional response on Hif-1α in conditions of  genetically induced hypoxia in zebrafish.
