human peripheral blood derived monocytes, LPS stimulation time-series

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate gene expression in human peripheral blood derived monocytes over the course of an LPS stimulation time-series. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Blood samples from three individuals, each sample split into separate culture for each timepoint (0, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours). RNA prepared from all, and analyzed with Bioanalyzer. Two best RNA samples from each timepoint analyzed by hybridization to a chip.
