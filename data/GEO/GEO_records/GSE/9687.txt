TITLE
Expression patterns in time and space during P.sojae infection of soybean cultivars differing in quantitative resistance

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Four selected soybean genotypes with varying degrees of quantitative resistance that were well-characterized were selected for this study. These included two resistant genotypes (V71-370, Conrad), and two susceptible genotypes (Sloan, and VP-RIL9). A P. sojae isolate, PT2004C2.S1 , which is virulent to the soybean genotypes carrying Rps1a, Rps1b, Rps1k, Rps2, Rps3a, Rps3c, Rps4, Rps5, Rps6, or Rps7, was used in this study. Keywords: Genotypic variation on quantitative resistance

DESIGN
The experiment was repeated four times. Factors assayed included: Genotype: 4 genotypes (V71-370, Conrad, Sloan, and VP-RIL9) Treatment: pathogen-inoculated vs. mock-inoculated Sampling time: 1, 2, 3 and 5dpi Sampling sites: Upper section and Lower section (for 3dpi and 5dpi pathogen-inoculated samples only) vs whole section (for all the mock-inoculated samples at all time points, and the inoculated samples at 1and 2dpi).
