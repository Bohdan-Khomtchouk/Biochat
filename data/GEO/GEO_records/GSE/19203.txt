TITLE
PML-RARa binding sites and their correlation with the gene expression in ATRA treated NB4 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PML-RARa contributes to the development of APL through repression of genes important in myeloid development. Through a global approach, we have identified 2,979 high quality PML-RARa binding sites in ZnSO4 induced PR9 cells. By integration the gene expression data, we found that PML/RARa target genes are transcriptionally suppressed in primary APL cells and re-activated in ATRA treated NB4 cells. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
