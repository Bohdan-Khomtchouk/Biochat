TITLE
Expression data from MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with Plumbagin (PL) and its derivative Acetyl Plumbagin (AP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study aimed at finding the molecular mechanism of action of PL and AP in breast cancer cells. The dataset shows the comparison of gene expression in Plumbagin/Acetyl Plymbagin treated MCF-7 cells when compared with untreated samples.

DESIGN
11 samples were analyzed. MCF-7 cells treated with 10 uM PL or AP for 6 hours. Please note that three samples were done in triplicates and one sample MCF-7 treated with 10uM PL was done in duplicates as one of the replicate RNA didn't show up a good RIN number, SAMPLE1 & 2 are replicates, SAMPLE 3,4 & 5 are triplicates, SAMPLE 6,7 & 8 are triplicates and SAMPLE 9,10 & 11 are triplicates (SAMPLE numbers are indicated in the description field).
