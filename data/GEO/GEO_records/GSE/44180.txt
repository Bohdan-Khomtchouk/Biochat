TITLE
Transcriptional adaptation of Eurotium rubrum to hypersalinity

ORGANISM
Aspergillus ruber

SUMMARY
Long-term transcriptional adaptation was investigated by comparative transcriptome analysis of E. rubrum grown at different salt concentrations.

DESIGN
E. rubrum mycelia were grown at low, medium and high salt media. Salt concentrations are expressed in percentage of Dead Sea Water (DSW) salt content. Comparative data analysis was performed using transcription profiles at medium salt concentrations as the reference.
