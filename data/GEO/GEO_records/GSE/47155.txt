TITLE
Hepatic transcriptome of mice with a deletion of the miR-379/miR-410 cluster obtained 4h following a caesarean at embryonic day E19.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In placental mammals, adaptation to extra-uterine life requires complex metabolic adjustments linked to the abrupt transition from the transplacental transfer of glucose toward the use of fat originating from the motherâ€™s milk as a major energy source. The study of a novel knock-out mouse model led us to identify the biological roles of the miR-379/miR-410 cluster at the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 region during this metabolic transition. The miR-379/miR-410 cluster is the largest mammalian-specific miRNA cluster composed of 39 pre-miRNA and expressed from the maternally-inherited allele. We unexpectedly found that ~ 35% of heterozygous neonates with a maternal - but not paternal - deletion of the entire 40kb-long miRNA cluster die shortly after birth due to defects in the maintenance of energy homeostasis, as evidenced by impaired hepatic glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis. This maladaptive metabolic response is accompanied by profound changes in the neonatal hepatic gene expression program, notably a decrease in the activation of a large set of metabolic genes linked to lipid metabolism. Our study unveils essential roles for the miR-379/miR-410 cluster at the transition from fetal to postnatal life, revealing new layers of RNA-mediated gene regulation at the Dlk1-Dio3 domain that impose parent-of-origin effects on postnatal metabolic functions.

DESIGN
Liver gene expression was measured in mice with a maternally-inherited deletion of the miR-379/miR-410 cluster and in wild-type littermates at embryonic day E19.5, 4h following the caesarean delivery (n=4 biological replicates per genotype)
