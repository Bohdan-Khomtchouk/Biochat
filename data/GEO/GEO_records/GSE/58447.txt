TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of threespine sticklebacks acclimated in different salinities

ORGANISM
Gasterosteus aculeatus

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing was used to measure global gene expression in wild caught threespine sticklebacks. Native freshwater and marine fish were acclimated in water of different salinities before the gene expression in kidney was measured. The comparative transcriptomic analysis allowed the identification of salt-responsive genes.

DESIGN
We acclimated native freshwater (FW) and saltwater (SW) threespine sticklebacks to fresh (salinity: 0 g/L), brackish (salinity: 11 g/L), and sea water (salinity: 33 g/L) for 30 days, and then measured the global gene expression in fish kidneys.
