TITLE
Gene expression profiles of the lung of CD2-T-bet transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To uncover potential mechanisms underlying the observed Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis-like phenotype, we performed a microarray analysis using lung mRNAs from T-bet transgenic mice.

DESIGN
Gene expression signatures associated with pulmonary alveolar  proteinosis induced by T-bet overexpression in T cells were measured.
