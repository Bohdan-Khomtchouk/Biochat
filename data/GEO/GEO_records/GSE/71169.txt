TITLE
Gene expression profiling of splenic XCR1+ dendritic cells from untreated or day 1.5 MCMV-infected mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to use global gene expression profiling to assess the global genetic reprogramming of spleen XCR1+ DC early after MCMV infection in vivo, using on Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array.

DESIGN
Comparison of the gene expression programs of XCR1+ dendritic cells isolated from the spleen of untreated versus d1.5 MCMV-infected wild-type C57BL/6 mice.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
