TITLE
NRSF mediated epigenetic mechanisms of ion channel dysfunction in experimental temporal lobe epilepsy [Control vs. Kainate, scrambled ODNs]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Oligodeoxynucleotides used to prevent NRSF binding to NRSE containing genes were utilized to prevent many kainate induced status epilepticus changes in gene expression.

DESIGN
Total RNA recovered from CA1 of hippocampus of rats receiving scrambled, and saline(controls) or kainate injections (induced status epilepticus)
