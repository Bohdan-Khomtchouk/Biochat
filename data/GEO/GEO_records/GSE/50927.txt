TITLE
RNAseq on lungs from WT vs claudin 4 KO mice that underwent ventilator-induced lung injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
WT mice and claudin 4 KO mice were exposed to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) for 2 hours. We found that in some Cldn4 KO mice, injury was similar to WT, while in others, injury was higher, as assessed by amount of protein leak into broncho-alveolar lavage fluid. We performed RNAseq to find which genes were responsible for higher injury in Cldn4 KO mice.

DESIGN
WT mice and claudin 4 KO mice were exposed to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) for 2 hours. RNA were extracted from whole lungs and RNA sequencing was performed. The samples are (all in duplicates): WT no VILI, Cldn4 KO no VILI, WT VILI, Cldn4 KO VILI with similar injury to WT (Cldn4 KOlow), and Cldn4 KO VILI with higher injury than WT (Cldn4 KOhigh)
