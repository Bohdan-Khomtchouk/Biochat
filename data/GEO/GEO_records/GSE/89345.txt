TITLE
A single miR390 targeting event is sufficient for triggering TAS3-tasiRNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In plants, tasiRNAs form a class of endogenous secondary siRNAs produced through the action of RNA-DEPENDENT-RNA-POLYMERASE-6 (RDR6) upon microRNA-mediated cleavage of non-coding TAS RNAs. In Arabidopsis thaliana, TAS1, TAS2 and TAS4 tasiRNA production proceeds via a single cleavage event mediated by 22nt-long or/and asymmetric miRNAs in an ARGONAUTE-1 (AGO1)-dependent manner. By contrast, tasiRNA production from TAS3 seems to follow the so-called ‘two-hit’ process, where dual targeting of TAS3, specifically mediated by the 21nt-long, symmetric miR390, initiates AGO7-dependent tasiRNA production. Interestingly, features for TAS3 tasiRNA production differ in other plant species and we show here that such features also enable TAS3 tasiRNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis, and that a single miR390 targeting event is, in fact, sufficient for this process, suggesting that the ‘one-hit’ model underpins all the necessary rudiments of secondary siRNA biogenesis from plant TAS transcripts. Further results suggest that the two-hit configuration likely enhances the fidelity of tasiRNA production and, hence, the accuracy of downstream gene regulation. Finally, we show that a ‘non-cleavable one-hit’ process allows tasiRNA production from both TAS1 and TAS3 transcripts, indicating that RDR6 recruitment does not require miRNA cleavage, nor does the recruitment, as we further show, of SUPRRESSOR-OF-GENE-SILENCING-3, indispensable for tasiRNA generation.

DESIGN
We have analysed the sRNA populations from 5 different reporter lines designed to test the biogenesis of tasiRNAs from TAS3. These lines were generated using artificial tasiRNA constructs carrying mutations in either one or both of the miR390 target sites.
