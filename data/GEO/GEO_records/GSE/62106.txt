TITLE
Expression analysis of Cellvibrio japonicus grown in either glucose or cellulose

ORGANISM
Cellvibrio japonicus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Cellvibrio japonicus wild-type, comparing glucose vs cellulose. Study was purposed with determining changes in polysaccharide degradation pathways during utilization of insoluble cellulose.
