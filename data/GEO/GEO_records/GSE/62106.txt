TITLE
Expression analysis of Cellvibrio japonicus grown in either glucose or cellulose

ORGANISM
Cellvibrio japonicus Ueda107

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Cellvibrio japonicus wild-type, comparing glucose vs cellulose. Study was purposed with determining changes in polysaccharide degradation pathways during utilization of insoluble cellulose.

DESIGN
A NimbleGen microarray study using total RNA recovered from two separate wild-type cultures of Cellvibrio japonicus (per growth condition) with 3710 24-mer probes with three-fold technical redundancy.
