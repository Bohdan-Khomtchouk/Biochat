TITLE
Expression data from C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BMP3 stimulates mesenchymal stem cell proliferation, but the down-stream molecular targets of BMP3 are unknown We used microarrays to identify genes that are differentially regulated by BMP3

DESIGN
C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells were treated with and without BMP3 for 6 hours, at the end of which total RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays
