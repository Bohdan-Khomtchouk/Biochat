TITLE
Identification of the vascular lineage specific transcriptome using two platforms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis have important roles in cancer progression and inflammatory diseases, but it has been a challenge to evaluate theses processes quantitatively. Using two different microarray platforms, we first identified the comprehensive lineage specific transcriptomes of human lymphatic (LEC) and blood vascular (BVEC) endothelial cells. We identified 226 lymphatic signature genes and 342 signature genes for blood vascular endothelium. In silico analyses of the biologic pathways associated with these genes revealed lineage specific functions for each cell type. Using a selection of 85 identified lineage specific genes, we developed a TaqMan RT PCR based, microfluidic card formatted low density microvascular differentiation array (LD MDA) that can be used to reliably identify and quantify endothelial cells based on their lineage specific differentiation. Furthermore, using LD MDA, we were able to quantify levels of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in tissue samples from patients with chronic inflammatory skin disease, indicating that this assay might be developed as a novel tool for the rapid and quantitative evaluation of pathological (lymph)angiogenesis in clinical and pre clinical studies. Keywords: cross-platform study
