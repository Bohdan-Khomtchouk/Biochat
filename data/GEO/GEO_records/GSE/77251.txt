TITLE
Analysis of Human Airway epithelial cells transcriptome after transfection of small RNAs from miR-34/449 family

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Since the seed sequence is shifted between canonical and isomer variant of hsa-miR-34b-5p and hsa-miR-449c-5p, we examine whether the transfection of the different forms of these miRNAs results in distinct targetomes

DESIGN
Transfection of proliferating Human Airway Epithelial Cells with all the miR-34/449  5-p members and isomirs (mirbase reference for hsa-miR-34b-5p and hsa-miR-449c-5p) at a final concentration of 10nM
