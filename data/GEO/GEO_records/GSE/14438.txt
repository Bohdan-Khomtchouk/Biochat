TITLE
The effect of TIM-3 stimulation on the gene expression profile of IgE/antigen-activated mouse mast cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TIM-3 is known to be expressed on dendritic cells, monocytes, melanoma cells, mast cells and on activated Th1 cells. In activated Th1 cells, stimulating TIM-3 by one of its ligands, galectin-9, leads to apoptosis and thus it plays a central role in terminating Th1-type immune responses. Interestingly, in IgE/antigen-activated mast cells TIM-3 enhances the production of IL-13 and IL-4. To get a more complete picture about the gene expression changes induced by TIM-3 in mast cells, in vitro differentiated mouse immature mast cells were stimulated by an agonist anti-TIM-3 antibody and IgE-sensitized mouse immature mast cells were activated by antigen and an agonist anti-TIM-3 antibody for 2 or 16 hours (overnight).
