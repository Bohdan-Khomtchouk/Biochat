SUMMARY
The Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays measure gene expression by quantifying intensity of fluorescently labeled gene fragments that bind to sets of 25-mer oligonucleotide probes on the chip with specific sequences tailored to be complementary to the target genes. Each gene is associated with a " probe set " containing several pairs (usually 11) of " perfect match " (perfectly complementary to target sequence) and " mismatch " (different base at position 13 of 25) probes. The raw measurements of each probe set consist of a set of intensities from the probes, which require in silico preprocessing by (1) correcting for background variability, (2) normalizing intensities across samples, and (3) summarizing intensities across the probe set into a single expression value. The output of the summarization step corresponds to the background-adjusted value for the mRNA of interest. We preprocess using GCRMA, which corrects for background variability by accounting for optical noise, probe affinity, and mismatch probe adjustment; normalizes intensities by quantile normalization; and summarizes intensities using a median polish method. To minimize preprocessing batch effects, it is desirable to preprocess all samples in the dataset together. However, preprocessing across multple platforms requires  a consolidation of probes with identical sequences, precluding global preprocessing on datasets with multiple platforms using the standard preprocessing pipelines. To address this problem, we have developed and applied a custom preprocessing pipeline to combine the raw .CEL files from multiple platforms that share the same probe sets.

DESIGN
We preprocessed as a single dataset gene expression data collected from 26 publicly available GEO and ArrayExpress studies by applying a custom preprocessing pipeline based on GCRMA. The assembled dataset contains 1489 microarray samples of human tissue that measure gene expression of normal lung (NORM) and 5 different lung diseases (lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), large cell lung carcinoma (LCLC), asthma (AST), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) in preparation for subsequent disease classification analysis. The studies included are: GSE994, GSE10072, GSE10245, GSE10445, GSE10799, GSE12345, GSE12667, GSE14814, GSE1643, GSE1650, GSE17475, GSE18842, GSE18965, GSE19188, GSE2109, GSE3141, GSE4302, GSE5058, GSE6253, GSE7368, GSE7670, GSE8545, GSE8581, E-TABM-15, E-MEXP-231, and E-MTAB-47.

surgical resection GPL570 We preprocess using the MATLAB implementation of GCRMA. To minimize preprocessing batch effects, it is desirable to preprocess all samples in the entire dataset together. Preprocessing requires microarray platform-specific chip specifications indicating the locations of each probe on the chip, precluding global preprocessing on meta-analyses that use multiple platforms. To address this problem, we developed and applied a preprocessing pipeline to combine the raw .CEL files from multiple platforms that share the same probe sets. Importantly, our pipeline maps the locations of probes containing identical sequences from the different platforms to enable grouping of these probes and subsequent processing. These " consensus datasets " are then preprocessed normally by applying the GCRMA algorithm. The output of this consensus preprocessing contains only the 22,227 probes that exist on both microarray platforms that we use; probes that only appear on one of the platforms are excluded from preprocessing. We also include " presence/marginal/absence " calls based on the MAS5 protocol, in which the measured values on the " perfect match " (perfectly complementary to target) probes are compared to the values on the " mismatch " (basepair mismatch at position 13 of 25) probes with Wilcoxon signed rank test. " Present " calls are made when the p-value of difference is less than 0.04; " marginal " calls are made when the p-value lies between 0.04 and 0.06, and " absent " calls are made when the p-value is greater than 0.06.
