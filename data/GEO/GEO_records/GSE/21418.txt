TITLE
Leishmania RNA Virus controls the severity of muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of the transcriptome of bone marrow derived macrophages infected with either metastasizing (M+, Lg13) or non-metastasizing (M-, Lg17) parasites after 24 hours of infection.

DESIGN
3 experimental conditions; M+ infected BMMf vs. uninfected BMMf, M- infected BMMf vs. uninfected BMMf, M+ infected BMMf vs. M- infected BMMf, BMMf from 3 biologically independant infection experiments were used where BMMf were infected for 24hrs at a ratio of 1 BMMf to 10 parasites. Total RNA was extracted reverse transcribed into cDNA with either a Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent tag and hybridized on to mouse 17k chip. Slides were scanned and differential BMMf gene expression was determined above 1.5 fold change and p less than 0.05. 6 slides per biological independant experiment were used including the dye swap, with 18 slides used in total.
