TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of CCR7lo effector memory human T cell subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify differentially-expressed genes in CCR4hi/CXCR3- and CCR4lo CXCR3+ CCR6+ human Th17 cell subsets

DESIGN
Human CD45RO+ memory T cells isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy adult donors were sorted into 4 predominant CCR7lo CD25- effector memory subsets: (1) Th1 - CCR6- CCR4lo CXCR3+; (2) Th2 - CCR6- CCR4hi CXCR3+; (3) Th17 - CCR6+ CCR4hi CXCR3-; (4) Th17.1 - CCR6+ CCR4lo CXCR3-. Sorted cells were cultured in media and activated via anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads for 36 hours. All subsets were then harvested and used for RNA extraction and microarray experiments. Th1 vs Th2; Th1 vs Th17; Th1 vs Th17.1; Th2 vs Th17; Th2 vs Th17.1; Th17 vs Th17.1
