TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains carrying the spt16-11 or the pob3-7 allele

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The conserved FACT (FAcilitates Chromatin Transcription) complex is a chromatin-reorganizing complex that promotes RNAPII transcription through chromatin templates by interacting with histones. It facilitates promoter activation by nucleosome eviction, and transcription elongation by nucleosome disruption and reassembly ahead and behind the RNAP. It also has a role in replication not fully understood yet. Genome-wide microarray analyses in spt16-11 and pob3-7 strains revealed a set of genes whose mRNA levels were altered with respect to the WT levels. These include 48 up-regulated and 80 down-regulated genes that are common to both strains. The up-regulated genes were longer and expressed at lower levels than the genome average whereas the down-regulated genes were more similar to the average of the genome.

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae strains were grown in YEPD  liquid culture 4 h after a 26-to-30ÂºC temperature shift, total RNA was isolated and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
