TITLE
Human lncRNA NRAV regulates antiviral response by modulating ISGs expression during influenza A virus infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human lncRNA NRAV-overexpression in A549 cells was found to increase the influenza virus WSN replication. To discover the mechanism underlying this promotion by NRAV, genome-wide mRNA expression was measured by using microarray. Thousands of genes were differentially expressed and some ISGs were down-regulated.

DESIGN
Human lncRNA NRAV-overexpressioning A549 cells (Test) and empty vector control cells were infected with influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) for 16 hours at a MOI of 3. Six total RNA samples from three independent experiments were extracted and used for mRNA microarray.
