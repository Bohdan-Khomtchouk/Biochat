TITLE
Gene expression profiles of rat enamel organs (secretory--stage and maturation stage)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We conducted the genome-wide mRNA expression profiling in parallel with miRNA expression profiling using RNA samples extracted from rat incisor enamel organs, so as to refine the number of predicted gene targets for miRNA regulators.

DESIGN
RNA samples were obtained from the incisor enamel organs of four rats (both secretory- and maturation-stage RNA samples). Gene expression profiling was done separately for each of the four pairs of RNA samples.
