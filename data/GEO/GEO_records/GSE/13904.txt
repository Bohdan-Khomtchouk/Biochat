TITLE
Expression profiling across the pediatric systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock spectrum

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal children, children with SIRS, children with sepsis, and children with septic shock. Objectives: To advance our biological understanding of pediatric septic shock, we measured the genome-level expression profiles of critically ill children representing the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, and septic shock spectrum. Keywords: Normal vs diseased
