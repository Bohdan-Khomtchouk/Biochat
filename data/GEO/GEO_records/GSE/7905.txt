TITLE
Whole genome survey of 32 Human Tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Applied Biosystems Tissue Gene Expression Database, known as the Human Body Map, is a collection of gene expression profiles from 31 normal tissues and a Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene). The Human BodyMap was created using the Applied Biosystems Expression Array System. There were three replicates per tissue for a total of 96 microarrays. Keywords: Human tissue whole genome survey

DESIGN
31 human tissues from Clontech and 1 from Stratagene (UHR) were used to create the Applied Biosystems Human BodyMap (a.k.a.Tissue Gene Expression Database ). Digoxigenin-UTP-labeled cRNA was generated and linearly amplified from 1 Âµg of total RNA with three replicates per tissue, using the Applied Biosystems Chemiluminescent RT-IVT Labeling Kit v 2.0 and kit protocol. Microarray hybridization, chemiluminescence detection, image acquisition, and analysis were performed on the on the Applied Biosystems 1700 Chemiluminescent Microarray Analyzer using the Applied Biosystems Chemiluminescence Detection Kit and kit protocol.
