TITLE
mRNA immunoprecipitated with CUGBP1 in C2C12

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dramatic changes in gene expression occur in response to extracellular stimuli and during differentiation.  Although transcriptional effects are important, alterations in mRNA decay also play a major role in achieving rapid and massive changes in mRNA abundance.  Moreover, just as transcription factor activity varies between different cell types, the factors influencing mRNA decay are also cell-type specific.GREs are recognized by CUGBP1, an RNA-binding protein and instability factor whose function is affected in several neuromuscular diseases. To dectect the mRNA associated with CUGBP1, we utilized RNA immunoprecipitation followed by microarray (RIP-Chip) to identify CUGBP1-associated transcripts.

DESIGN
To identify the mRNA associated with CUGBP1, we performed the immunoprecipitation followed by microarray (RIP-Chip)
