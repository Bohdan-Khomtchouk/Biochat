TITLE
Y. pestis exposed to various concentrations of ciprofloxacin for various time points (treated/nontreated analysis in each array).

ORGANISM
Yersinia pestis

SUMMARY
Cultures of Y. pestis Kimberley53 virulent strain were exposed to different concentrations of ciprofloxacin (including 0.016 µg/ml representing the strains' MIC value) for various time periods. Total RNA samples were extructed and used for cRNA synthesis and labelling (using Cy3-CTP for the treated samples and Cy5-CTP for the non-treated sample  in one biological experiment and  dye swap for the 2nd replicate of independent biological experiment). 8 Labeled cRNA samples were hybridized to custom made Agilent 8x15K slide (each slide represent 1 time point). Goal: Identifing alterations in gene expression profile which correlates with the ciprofloxacin induced growth inhibition. Those altered mRNA transcrips will be used as a markers for the development of rapid molecular Antibiotic Susceptibility Test.

DESIGN
Y. perstis  exposed to 0.001, 0.016, 0.5 and 4 µg/ml ciprofloxacin, compared to growth control (non treated) sample, for 3 time periods (45, 90 and 120 min.). Two independent biological replicates were performed. Extracted total RNA were used for cRNA synthesis and labeling with Cy3/Cy5-CTP, hybridized to Agilent custom-made 8x15K slide format.
