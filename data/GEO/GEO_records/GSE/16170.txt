SUMMARY
Analysis of miRNA-targeted cellular NMD substrates in HeLa cell. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that endogenous NMD substrates containing long 3' untranslated region may targeted for miRNA. Results provide important information expanding the roles of miRISC in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression: a new cross-talk between miRNA-mediated gene silencing and NMD. ABSTRACT: Imperfect base-pairing between microRNA (miRNA) and the 3’-untranslated region (3’UTR) of target mRNA triggers translational repression of the target mRNA. Here, we provide evidence that human Argonaute 2 (Ago2) targets cap-binding protein (CBP)80/20- and exon junction complex (EJC)-bound mRNAs and inhibits nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which is tightly restricted to CBP80/20-bound mRNAs. Furthermore, microarray analyses reveal that a subset of cellular transcripts, which are expected to be targeted for NMD, is stabilized by miRNA-mediated gene silencing. The regulation of NMD by miRNAs will shed light on a new post-transcriptional regulation mechanism of gene expression in mammalian cells

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HeLa cells with downregulation of Ago2 or Ago2/UPF1 by siRNA. The up- or down-regulated transcripts were compared to control siRNA treated HeLa cell RNA extract. Significant transcripts were confirmed by replication.
