TITLE
Micro RNA array analysis in OLETF, a type 2 diabetic rats, and LETO, a non-diabetic control rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
AMP deaminase (AMPD) plays a crucial role in adenine nucleotide metabolism, and its upregulated activity contributes to diastolic dysfunction of the heart caused by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) via reduction of the adenine nucleotide pool. Here we examined the mechanism of AMPD upregulation by T2DM. The protein level of 90-kDa full-length AMPD3 was increased in whole myocardial lysates and in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) fraction by 55% and 123%, respectively, in OLETF, a rat model of T2DM, compared to those in LETO, a non-diabetic control, though AMPD mRNA level was unchanged in OLETF. MicroRNA array analysis revealed downregulation ( > 50%) of 57 microRNAs in OLETF compared to those in LETO, among which miR-301b was predicted to interact with the 3’UTR of AMPD3 mRNA. The 90-kDa AMPD3 level was significantly increased by miR-301b inhibitor, but decreased by a miR-301b mimetic in H9c2 cells. A luciferase reporter assay indicated binding of miR-301b to the 3’UTR of AMPD3 mRNA.  The results indicate that translational regulation by miR-301b mediates AMPD3 upregulation in the diabetic heart.  Since ATP generated by SR-associated glycolytic enzymes contributes to Ca2+ uptake by SERCA2a, upregulated AMPD3 in the vicinity of the SR may be a therapeutic target for diabetic cardiomyopathy.

DESIGN
Rats were anesthetized and ventilated as in in vivo hemodynamic experiments. Hearts of the rats were excised, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until further use. The expression of a set of 595 miRNAs in rat heart samples was examined using a Taqman® Rodent MiRNA Array v2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
