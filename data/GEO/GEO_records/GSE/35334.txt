TITLE
The histone chaperone Spt6 is required for AID target determination through H3K4me3 regulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
H3K4me3 plays a critical role in the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-induced DNA cleavage of switch (S) regions in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus during class-switch recombination (CSR). The histone chaperone complex facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) is responsible for forming H3K4me3 at AID target loci. Histone chaperone suppressor of Ty6 (Spt6) also participates in regulating H3K4me3 for CSR and for somatic hypermutation (SHM) in AID target loci. H3K4me3 loss was correlated with defects in AID-induced DNA breakage and reduced mutation frequencies in IgH loci, in both S and variable regions, and in non-IgH loci, such as metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) and small nucleolar RNA host gene 3 (SNHG3). Global gene expression analysis revealed that Spt6 can act as both a positive and negative transcriptional regulator in B cells, affecting approximately 5% of the genes that includes suppressor of Ty4 (Spt4) and AID. Interestingly, Spt6 regulates CSR and AID expression through two distinct histone modification pathways, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, respectively. Spt6 is a unique histone chaperone, capable of regulating the histone epigenetic state of both AID targets and the AID locus.

DESIGN
CH12F3-2A cells were transfected with control and Spt6 siRNAs; 24h later, cells were stimulated with CIT to induce CSR. Total RNA was extracted from control and Spt6 siRNA treated cells for mRNA expression profiling.
