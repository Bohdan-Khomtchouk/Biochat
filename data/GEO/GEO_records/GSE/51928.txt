TITLE
Dual roles of RNF2 in melanoma progression [expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epigenetic regulators have emerged as critical factors governing the biology of cancer. Here, in the context of melanoma, we show that RNF2 is prognostic, exhibiting progression-correlated expression in human melanocytic neoplasms. Through a series of gain of function and loss of function studies, we establish that RNF2 is oncogenic and pro-metastatic. Mechanistically, RNF2-mediated invasive behavior is dependent on its ability to mono-ubiquitinate H2AK119 at the promoter of LTBP2, resulting in silencing of this negative regulator of TGFÎ² signaling. In contrast, RNF2's oncogenic activity did not require its catalytic activity nor derives from its canonical gene repression function, rather RNF2 drives proliferation through direct transcriptional up-regulation of the cell cycle regulator CCND2. In summary, RNF2 regulates distinct biological processes in the genesis and progression of melanoma via distinct molecular mechanisms, underscoring the complex and multi-faceted actions of epigenetic regulators in cancer.

DESIGN
RNF2 is overexpressed in immortalized human melanocytes HMEL-BRAFV600E to address impact of RNF2 overexpression in melanoma. GFP was overexpressed in HMEL-BRAFV600E cells as a control cell line. Expression profiling using microarray was performed and compared between RNF2 overexpressing versus GFP overexpressing HMEL-BRAFV600E cells.
