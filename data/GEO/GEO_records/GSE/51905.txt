TITLE
Expression data from differentiated 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) is the rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing the conversion of saturated fatty acids palmitate and stearate to monounsaturated fatty acids palmitoleate and oleate. During adipocyte differentiation, SCD expression increases concomitantly with several transcription factors and lipogenic genes. We used microarrays to examine gene expression in differentiated pre-adipocytes treated with and without an SCD inhibitor.

DESIGN
On day 7 of adipocyte differentiation, total RNA was extracted from adipocytes. Two conditions were selected for comparison: total RNA extracted from adipocytes treated with DMSO (control) and or a SCD inhibitor.
