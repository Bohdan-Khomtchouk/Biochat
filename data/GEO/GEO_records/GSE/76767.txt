TITLE
Expression data from thalamic nuclei in control and bilateral enucleated mice at P0 and P4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Elimination of peripheral retinal axons leads to changes in gene expression in both visual and somatosensory thalamic neurons. We used microarrays to determine the global programme of gene expression underlying peripheral input deprivation and identify candidate thalamic genes involved in cross-modal plasticity.

DESIGN
Mouse thalamic tissue from identified nuclei was selected at two postnatal stages P0 and P4 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We used two conditions: controls (non-enucleated) and embryonically bilateral enucleated (embBE) mice. Each sample is composed by pooling the thalamic nuclei tissue from pups from the same litter and same condition.
