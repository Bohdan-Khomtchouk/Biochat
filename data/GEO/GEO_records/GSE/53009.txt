TITLE
DamID profiling of proneural transcription factor binding in Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal discs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Genome-wide identification of the binding sites of the Drosophila transcription factors Achaete, Asense, E(spl)m3-HLH and Senseless in wing imaginal cells using DamID profiling.

DESIGN
Each Dam-fusion-derived sample is compared to a control Dam-only sample. Two biological replicates were performed for sca-Asense, neur-Asense, sca-Achaete, neur-Achaete, neur-Sens and sca-E(spl)m3-HLH.

PLATFORM
GPL18027 NimbleGen Drosophila Tiling 388k Array [2007-02-15_Dros_300bp_60mer]
