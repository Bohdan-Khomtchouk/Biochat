TITLE
Role of Hfq in Iron Dependent and Independent Gene Regulation in Neisseria meningitidis

ORGANISM
Neisseria meningitidis MC58

SUMMARY
In Neisseria meningitidis iron responsive gene regulation is mediated primarily by the Ferric Uptake Regulator (Fur) protein.  When complexed with iron, Fur represses gene expression by preventing transcription initiation. Fur can also indirectly activate gene expression via the repression of regulatory small RNAs (sRNA).  One such Fur-and iron-regulated sRNA, NrrF, was previously identified in N. meningitidis and shown to repress expression of the sdhA and sdhC genes encoding subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase complex. In the majority of Gram-negative bacteria sRNA-mediated regulation requires a cofactor RNA-binding protein (Hfq) for proper gene regulation and stabilization.   In this study we examined the role of Hfq in NrrF-mediated regulation of the succinate dehydrogenase genes in N. meningitidis and the effect of an hfq- mutation on iron-responsive gene regulation more broadly.  We first demonstrated that the stability of Nrrf as well as the regulation of sdhC and sdhA in vivo was unaltered in the hfq- mutant.   Secondly, we established that iron responsive gene regulation of the Fur-regulated sodB gene was dependent on Hfq.  Finally, we demonstrate that in N. meningitidis Hfq functions to control expression of both ORFs and intergenic regions via iron independent mechanisms.  Collectively these studies demonstrate that in N. meningitidis iron and NrrF mediated regulation of sdhC and sdhA can occur independently of Hfq, although Hfq functions more globally to control regulation of other N. meningitidis genes primarily by iron-independent mechanisms.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from wild-type MC58 Neisseria meningitidis, from an hfq- mutant, and from a complemented hfq-  mutant under both iron-replete and iron-deplete conditions.  Three biological replicates were analyzed for each strain and condition were analyzed.
