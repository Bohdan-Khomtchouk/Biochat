TITLE
The Nuclear Receptor Rev-erb alpha Regulates Adipose Tissue-Specific FGF21 Signaling (GRO-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Based upon integrated analysis of transcriptomes and cistromes in Rev-erb alpha knock-out mice, we found that beta-Klotho (KLB) mRNA and protein are markedly induced in white adipose tissue but not in brown adipose tissue or liver of mice lacking Rev-erb alpha. In order to address the mechanism of the tissue-specific regulation of Klb transcription by Rev-erb apha, we performed global run-on followed by high-throughput sequencing (GRO-seq) to measure nascent transcription in different tissues in wildtype mice and Rev-erb alpha knock-out mice.

DESIGN
Nascent RNA transcripts in mouse adipose tissue depots (brown adipose tissue, epididymal white adipose tissue, and inguinal white adipose tissue) were profiled in wildtype mice and Rev-erb alpha knockout mice.
