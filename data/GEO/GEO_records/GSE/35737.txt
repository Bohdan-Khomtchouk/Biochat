TITLE
Zebrafish ectonucleoside triphosphate/diphosphohydrolase 5 (entpd5) mutants compared to siblings at 7 dpf

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
This microarray was performed in attempt to find genes that are related to the presence of entpd5 during embryonic development

DESIGN
Embryos were raised in standard E3 medium at 28 degrees Celcius. At 6 dpf  mutant were separated from siblings by an in vivo skeletal staining (incubating embryos 5 minutes in 0.05% alizarin red in E3 medium where after they are extensively washed with E3 medium) as mutants fail to mineralize their skeleton. At 7 dpf, total RNA from (n=30) entpd5 mutants versus sibling embryos was isolated using the Rnaesy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufactures protocol.
