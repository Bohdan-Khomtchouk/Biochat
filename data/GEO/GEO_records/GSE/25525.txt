TITLE
Expression data from 4T1 cells cultured with 3mM glucose and 20mM lactic acid

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Via aerobic glycolysis-Warnburg effect, cancer cells can convert 85-90% of glucose they acquire to lactic acid, which is thus ubiquitously abundant in solid tumor environment. We also observed that lactic acid effectively rescues cancer cells from glucose staration. In order to understand the biological function of lacitc acid, we did the microarrays.

DESIGN
murine breast cancer 4T1 cells were incubated in RPMI-1640 containing 3mM glucose and 20mM lactic acid for 1 day, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 7 days, 9 days and 11 days. 4T1 cells were incubated in RPMI-1640 containing 3mM glucose as control. We extracted the RNA and hybridized on the microarrays. We sought to obtain temporal genes that prolonged the cell life with lactic acid during the glucose starvation.
