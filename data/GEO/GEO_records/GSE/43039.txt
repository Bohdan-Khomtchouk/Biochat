TITLE
microRNA expression profiling of human nasopharyngeal Carcinoma tissues and Chronic Nasopharyngitis specimens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been etiologically linked to human malignancies including Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC). Although EBV-encoded miRNAs have been shown to contribute to viral latency, host cell survival and immune evasion, their direct impact on cancer progression in their human host remains unclear. In the current study, based on a miRNA expression profiling analysis of a larger number of clinical specimens using a miRNA array platform containing human, EBV  and other species miRNA probes., we found that some EBV-miR-BARTs were highly expressed in NPC. Accordingly, further exploration of the potential roles and regulatory mechanisms of some important EBV-miR-BARTs in NPC progression was carried out. We applied a miRNA expression profiling analysis in 20 poor or undifferentiated NPC (Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma) matched with 20 benign chronic nasopharyngitis (CNP) specimens using a miRNA array platform containing human, EBV and other species miRNA probes.

DESIGN
Two-group experiment, NPC vs CNP. Biological repelicates: 20 NPCs, 20 CNPs. One replicate per array.
