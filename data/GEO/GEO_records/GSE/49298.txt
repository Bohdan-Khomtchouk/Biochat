TITLE
Identification of microRNAs differentially expressed in prostatic secretions of patients with prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we aimed to identify a miRNA expression signature that could be used to distinguish PCa from BPH. We have shown for the first time in the literature the presence of miRNAs in the PSS. We suggest PSS as a powerful non-invasive source for evaluation of prognosis in PCa, since prostate massages can be easily applied during routine examination. Our results showed that certain differentially expressed miRNAs in PSS could be used as diagnostics markers.

DESIGN
Prostate secretion samples (PSS) from 23 PCa and 25 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients were obtained from Urology Department of Bagcilar Educational and Research Hospital (Istanbul). MicroRNA (miRNA) profiling of eight PSS (four from BPH, four from PCa patients) were performed using microarray. Four of significantly deregulated miRNAs were further confirmed using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Statistical analysis was performed using Studentâ€™s t-test. ROC curves were plotted with SPSS-15.0.
