TITLE
Representational Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis (ROMA) array for Copy Number Variation Detection.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The identification of genetic and epigenetic alterations from primary tumor cells has become a common method to identify genes critical to the development and progression of cancer. We provide a bioinformatic analysis of copy number variation and DNA methylation covering the genetic landscape of ovarian cancer tumor cells. We individually examined the copy number variation and DNA methylation for 44 primary ovarian cancer samples and 7 ovarian normal samples using our MOMA-ROMA technology and Affymetrix expression data as well as 379 tumor samples analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas. We have identified 346 genes with significant deletions or amplifications among the tumor samples. Utilizing associated gene expression data we predict 156 genes with significantly altered copy number and correlated changes in expression. We identify changes in DNA methylation and expression for all amplified and deleted genes. We predicted 615 potential oncogenes and tumor suppressors candidates by integrating these multiple genomic and epigenetic data types. This ROMA experiment was performed on Ovarian Tumor samples using the same platform as previously reported by Navin, N. et. al. Genome Res. 2010 Jan;20(1):68-80 (PMID: 19903760). Analysis of the array data was performed as previously reported in Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. (PMID: 18836286 ).

DESIGN
The genomic DNA from each tumor was labeled with Cy5 and hybridized to an 85K Bgl2 ROMA Microarray. A normal reference male fibroblast was labeled with Cy3 as a control. The value data repesents a log ratio. (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).
