TITLE
AURKA Expression in allogeneic HCT-recipients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is the most common complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). However, our understanding of the molecular pathways that cause this disease remains incomplete, leading to inadequate treatment strategies. To address this, we measured the gene expression profile of non-human primate (NHP) T cells during acute GVHD (GSE73723).  Within these profiles we discovered potentially druggable targets not previously implicated in GVHD, prominently including aurora kinase A (AURKA).  In this study, we performed a planned comparison of AURKA gene expression in HCT-recipients with clinical GVHD and compared it to expression in HCT-recipients without clinical GVHD.

DESIGN
Samples were obtained from patients enrolled in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) clinical trials performed at Emory University and the University of Minnesota, with and without GVHD.  Patients from Emory University were enrolled on two contemporaneous IRB-approved clinical trials: (1) The Bone Marrow Immune Monitoring Protocol and (2) The Abatacept Feasibility Study.  The patients from the University of Minnesota were enrolled on an immune monitoring protocol approved by the University of Minnesota IRB. Samples from patients with acute GVHD were identified and then control samples were selected that were matched for sample collection day, preparative regimen intensity, disease, stem cell source, and GVHD prophylaxis.
