TITLE
MiRNA expression analysis of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and normal fibroblasts (NFs) in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify miRNA differentially expressed in CAFs vs matched NFs and analyze the heterogeneity of miRNA expression profiles in the two kinds of cells, we established primary cultures of CAFs and paired NFs from six resected breast tumor tissue without any radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment.

DESIGN
Paired CAFs and NFs from six primary human breast carcinoma specimens were cultured,the third passage of primary cells was used in the experiments.
