TITLE
Comparative transcriptional profiling of two contrasting rice genotypes in response to rice stripe virus infection

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
During the pathogenesis of virus disease, lots of changes occur in plant hosts including the altered gene expression profiles. Rice stripe virus (RSV) is the type member of Tenuivirus, transmitted by Laodelphax striatellus in a circulative propagative man To investigate the molecular differences in two japonica rice genotypes WuYun3 and KT95-418 in response to RSV infection, Affymetrix rice genome array were used to analyze and compare their transcriptional profiles. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Nine-day old 20 rice seedlings were exposed to approximately 100 viruliferous small brown planthoppers (Laodelphax striatellus Fall) for two days to be innoculated by RSV. Then they were transplanted in insect-free greenhouse at 25Â±3C with a daily photope
