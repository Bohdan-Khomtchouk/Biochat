TITLE
Comparative transcriptional profiling of two contrasting rice genotypes in response to rice stripe virus infection

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
During the pathogenesis of virus disease, lots of changes occur in plant hosts including the altered gene expression profiles. Rice stripe virus (RSV) is the type member of Tenuivirus, transmitted by Laodelphax striatellus in a circulative propagative man To investigate the molecular differences in two japonica rice genotypes WuYun3 and KT95-418 in response to RSV infection, Affymetrix rice genome array were used to analyze and compare their transcriptional profiles. Keywords: disease state analysis
