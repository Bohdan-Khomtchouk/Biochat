TITLE
Comparison of copy number variations between wildtype and BCL6 knockout BCR-ABL1-driven acute lymphoblastic leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) study investigated the effect of BCL6 on clonal evolution in BCR-ABL1-driven acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The frequencies of copy number alterations in BCR-ABL1-transformed BCL6+/+ and BCL6-/- leukemias were determined.
