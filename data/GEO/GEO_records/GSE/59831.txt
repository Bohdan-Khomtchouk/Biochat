TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of isolated stormal cells and tumor epithelial cells in mouse lung cancer by RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from individual stormal cells (Macrophages, Monocytes, and Neutrophils) and tumor epithelial cells from KrasG12dD; p53-/- murine lung cancer model and WT control mouse to compare gene expressio profiles of lung cancer stroma and tumor cells to their counterparts of WT lugns. The tumor was generated by injecting HKP1 lung cancer cell line, which was driven by KrasG12D activation and loss of p53, via tail vein. The cells were sorted by their specific surface markers at day 20-25 after orthortopic lung cancer formation.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in individual stormal cells and tumor cells from tumor lungs compared to their counterparts from WT lungs
