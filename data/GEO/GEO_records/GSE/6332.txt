TITLE
Molecular Signatures of Trauma Hemorrhagic Shock-Induced Lung Injury: Hemorrhage- and Injury-Associated Genes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The etiology of trauma-hemorrhage shock-induced acute lung injury has been difficult to elucidate due, at least in part, to the inability of in vivo studies to separate the non-injurious pulmonary effects of trauma-hemorrhage from the tissue injurious ones.  To circumvent this in vivo limitation, we utilized a model of trauma-hemorrhagic shock (T/HS) in which T/HS-lung injury was abrogated by dividing the mesenteric lymph duct.  In this way, it was possible to separate the pulmonary injurious response from the non-injurious systemic response to T/HS by comparing the pulmonary molecular response of rats subjected to T/HS which did and did not develop lung injury as well as to non-shocked rats.  Utilizing high-density oligonucleotide arrays and treatment group comparisons of whole lung tissue collected at 3 hours after the end of the shock or sham-shock period, 139 of the 8,799 assessed genes were differentially expressed.
