TITLE
The effect of FOXO3 knockdown and PDHA1 knockdown on PDAC cell line Panc-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about the role of  FOXO3 and PDHA1 in PDAC. We performed microarrays to revealed the transcriptional change of a human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDCA) cell line (Panc -1) to scr-siRNA, FOXO3-siRNA and PDHA1-siRNA in order to provide insight into the role of PDHA1 and FOXO3 in Panc-1 cells.

DESIGN
Panc-1 Human PDCA cells were treated with scr-siRNA, FOXO3-siRNA and PDHA1-siRNA for 48 h and total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol Reagent. The microarray analysis was conducted on the Panc-1 cells expressing by using Agilent Microarray.
