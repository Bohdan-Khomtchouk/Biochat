TITLE
Global heart transcript data from fasted male BXD strains on chow or high fat diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcript data from heart tissue from fasted-state male BXD strains on chow or high fat diet We used microarrays to compare the heart expression differences across the BXD strain family and across two diverse diets

DESIGN
29-week-old male mice were fasted overnight (6pm-9am), anesthetized under isoflurane, and perfused, then hearts were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction and RNEasy cleanup. Each dietary and strain cohort consisted of ~5 animals which were prepared independently then pooled evenly by Âµg RNA before the Affymetrix arrays were run.

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
