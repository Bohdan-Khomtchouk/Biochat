TITLE
Identification of genes involved in nutritional regulation of root architecture

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
AIM: 1. To identify genes that respond to N-deficiency and N-resupply and 2. To identify the subset of these genes that are under the (direct or indirect) regulatory influence of the ANR1 MADS-box gene and which may therefore participate in the nutritional regulation of root architecture. BACKGROUND: The Arabidopsis ANR1 gene is a key regulator of root architecture (Zhang and Forde, 1998): When ANR1 expression is suppressed (by antisense or co-suppression) the resulting lines are no longer able to proliferate their lateral roots in response to localised supplies of NO3- (Zhang and Forde, 1998). ANR1 encodes a root-specific member of the MADS box family of transcription factors and is thought to be a component of a signalling pathway that links an external NO3- signal to increase meristematic activity in the lateral root meristem (Zhang et al., 1999). ANR1 expression is modulated by changes in the NO3- supply (Zhang and Forde, 1998; Y.Gan and B.G. Forde, unpublished observations). In this experiment we will study the global changes in gene expression that occur when Arabidopsis plants are exposed to three different N regimes that are known to modulate ANR1 expression.  The treatments will be done on wild-type plants and on an ANR1 knockout mutant as a means of identifying the (direct and indirect) downstream targets of ANR1. This experiment is complementary to another microarray experiment (BBSRC grant no. 89/P13011) which is using a DEX-inducible ANR1 transgene to identify genes that are immediately downstream of ANR1 in the signal transduction cascade Experimental: Plants of the two genotypes will be grown in hydroponic culture in a growth cabinet for 4-5 weeks before subjecting them to the different N treatments: 1) Continuous nitrate supply; 2) N deprivation for 2.5 days; and 3) N deprivation followed by 3 h nitrate induction. All harvesting will be done simultaneously to avoid diurnal effects. Roots from 12 seedlings will be harvested and pooled with roots from 12 seedlings whose treatment has been staggered by 24 h. We propose to replicate the experiment three times. References: Zhang, H. and Forde, B.G. (1998) Science 279, 407-409. Zhang, H. et al. (1999) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 96, 6529-6534.
