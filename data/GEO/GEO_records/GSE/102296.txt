TITLE
Transcriptional response to type I IFN in bat P. alecto cells

ORGANISM
Pteropus alecto

SUMMARY
Bats are reservoirs of a number of highly pathogenic human viruses, yet they remain relatively asymptomatic during infection. Whether this viral resistance is due to a unique immune system is unknown. An evolutionarily conserved feature of vertebrate antiviral immunity is the interferon (IFN) response, which triggers cellular defenses through interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. While bats encode an intact IFN system, global ISG expression patterns in bat cells are not well characterized.  Here, we used RNA-Seq to assess the transcriptional response to IFNÎ± in cells derived from the bat Pteropus alecto (black flying fox). We show induction of more than 100 transcripts, most of which are canonical ISGs observed in other species. Kinetic gene profiling revealed that P. alecto ISGs fall into two unique temporal subclusters with similar early induction kinetics but distinct late-phase declines.  In contrast to bat ISGs, human ISGs generally remained elevated for longer periods following IFN treatment, suggesting host-based differences in gene regulatory mechanisms. Notably, we also identified a small group of non-canonical bat ISGs, including an enzymatically active RNASEL. These studies provide insight into the innate immune response of an important viral reservoir and lay a foundation for studies into the immunological features that may underlie a unique virus-host relationship in bats.
