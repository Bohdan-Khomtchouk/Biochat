TITLE
Comparative effect of DON and plant or microbial biotransformation of DON on gene expression of piglets jejunal explants

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa domesticus

SUMMARY
Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a frequent mycotoxin in grains, produced by Fusarium fungi, which demonstre multiple side effects such as modulation of immune responses, reduced feed intake and weight gain or impairment of the intestinal barrier function. Among animal species, pigs are the best model for humans and are very sensitive to DON. In wheat, DON can be conjugated to glucose to form DON-3-β-D-glucoside (D3G). Some bacteria isolated from digestive tracts or soil, are also able to de-epoxydize or epimerize DON to metabolites such as deepoxy-deoxynivalenol (DOM-1) or 3-epi-deoxynivalenol (epi-DON). The toxicity of these DON metabolites is poorly documented. By the way of ingestion, the intestine is the first organ exposed to these molecules and so constitute a relevant model. The aim of this study was to compare the intestinal toxicity of three DON metabolites (D3G, DOM-1 and epi-DON) with the one of DON. Intestinal explants from 6 pigs were treated with 10mM DON, D3G, DOM-1 or epi-DON for 4 hours and transcriptomic analysis was performed using an “Agilent Porcinet 60K”.

DESIGN
Jejunal explants from 4 piglets aged of 5 weeks were sampled and exposed in vitro to differents molecules (DON, D3G, DOM-1 & 3-epi-DON) at 10µM during 4h. Then RNA was extracted.
