TITLE
Expression data from rice after brown planthopper attack

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to analyze potential brown planthopper (BPH) resistant genes in Rathu Heenati (RHT) by Affymetrix whole rice genome array,BPH susceptible and resistant rice varieties of TN1（Taichung Native 1）as control. All the resistant related genes derived from RHT will be analyzed according to the SSR markers interval flanked on the chromosome 3, 4, 6 and 10. It will be benefit to the gene clone and marker assistant breeding for Bph3 gene in the near future. We used microarrays to detail the global differential gene expression before and after brown planthopper attack in two different varieties, and identified distinct classes of high enriched genes induced by BPH or constituent in RHT

DESIGN
The 2nd to 3rd instar nymphs of BPH were transferred to tillering stage seedings (10 BPH nymphs per plant) in a box covered with nylon-mesh. Stems of the rice plant infected by BPH were collected at 0h (T0), 8h (T8), 24h (T24) after BPH attack, total RNA were extracted for the microarray hybirdlization.
