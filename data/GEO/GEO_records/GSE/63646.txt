TITLE
Expression and Prognostic impact of LncRNAs in Acute Myeloid Leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides located within the intergenic stretches or overlapping antisense transcripts of protein coding genes. LncRNAs are involved in numerous biological roles including imprinting, epigenetic regulation, apoptosis and cell-cycle. To determine whether lncRNAs are associated with clinical features and recurrent mutations in older patients (aged â‰¥60 years) with cytogenetically normal (CN) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we evaluated lncRNA expression in 148 untreated older CN-AML cases using a custom microarray platform.

DESIGN
In this study, we analyzed a large set of older CN-AML patients using custom lncRNA microarrays to investigate whether lncRNA expression is associated with clinical features, molecular abnormalities and outcome and to build a prognostic lncRNA signature that was subsequently validated using RNA sequencing. This submission represents RNA-Seq component of study.
