TITLE
Gene expression profiles from the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular functions targeted by these miRNAs, we classified genes differentially expressed in clinical HCC samples into six functional clusters based on their functional similarity.

DESIGN
3-paired HCC tissue samples and adjacent normal liver tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgery and were frozen immediately after surgical resection.
