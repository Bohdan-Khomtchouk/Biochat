TITLE
Microarray analysis of med14, med16, npr1, and wild type (Col-0) infected with the avirulent bacterial pathogen Pst DC3000/avrRpt2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of the microarray experiment was to identify genes that are differentially expressed among the Arabidopsis mutant med14, med16, npr1, and wild type in response to infection of the avirulent bacterial pathogen Pst DC3000/avrRpt2.  Results indicated that the induction of a large group of defense genes was suppressed in the med14 mutant compared with both med16 and the wild type.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates with leaves from 8 plants per sample were collected at 0 and 4 hours after inoculation with the avirulent bacterial pathogen Pst DC3000/avrRpt2.  After extraction, RNA concentration was determined on a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and sample quality was assessed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).  Each replicate was used as one sample for microarray analysis.
