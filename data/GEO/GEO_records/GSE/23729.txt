TITLE
The effect of aneuploidy on gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the gene expression changes observed in aneuploid b1 integrin YYFF MEFs generated as a result of repeated cytokinesis failure compared to tetraploid wild-type MEFs or tetraploid b1YYFF integrin MEFs. The results reveal aneuploidy-specific gene expression changes, both up-and downregulated genes uniquely detected in the aneuploid MEFs.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from b1 integrin YYFF and B1 wildtype mouse embryonic fibroblasts that had been passaged on laminin 0, 4 or 8 times (L0, L4 or L8)
