TITLE
Expression data from adult male and female Drosophila melanogaster antenna, proboscis, and front leg

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Sex-specific gene expression in sensory organs may play an important role in mating and foraging behavior.  We used long-oligonucleotide microarrays to compare gene expression profiles of males and females in three adult appendages that carry large numbers of chemosensory organs â€“ antenna, proboscis, and front leg. Keywords: tissue-specific expression profiles

DESIGN
Drosophila isogenic line WI89 was used.  Adult male and female antennae (a3+arista), front legs (from distal tibia down), and proboscises were dissected at 1-2 hours after eclosion.  Total RNA was extracted and the mRNA fraction was amplified by reverse transcription followed by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase.
