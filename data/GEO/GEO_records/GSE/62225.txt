TITLE
Laccaria-Poplar: A Timecourse of Mycorrhizal Root Tip Development

ORGANISM
Laccaria bicolor S238N-H82

SUMMARY
This study characterizes the transcriptomic alterations of Laccaria bicolor S238N during interaction with P. trichocarpa. Four time-points were analyzed, two weeks, four weeks , six weeks and twelve weeks after inoculation and compared to the transcriptome of free-living mycelium from Laccaria bicolor S238N
