TITLE
Laccaria-Poplar: A Timecourse of Mycorrhizal Root Tip Development

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa ; Laccaria bicolor ; Laccaria bicolor S238N-H82

SUMMARY
This study characterizes the transcriptomic alterations of Laccaria bicolor S238N during interaction with P. trichocarpa. Four time-points were analyzed, two weeks, four weeks , six weeks and twelve weeks after inoculation and compared to the transcriptome of free-living mycelium from Laccaria bicolor S238N

DESIGN
We performed 16 hybridizations (NimbleGen) with samples derived from P.trichocarpa/L.bicolor mycorrhizal root tips. Samples were taken after 2,4,6 and 12 weeks of interaction (four biological replicates).  These samples were compared to free-living mycelium from Laccaria bicolor S238N (three biological replicates). All samples were labeled with Cy3.

PLATFORM
