TITLE
PRDM1 inhibits proliferation of human colon cancer organoids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We reports the transcript landscape of PR Domain Containing 1, with ZNF domain (PRDM1)  in RKO colon cancer cells. We show that PRDM1 alpha and PRDM1 beta transcript isoforms repress and activate a largely overlapping suite of genes, many of which belong to the embryonic stem cell core transcript program.

DESIGN
To evaluate the roles of PRDM1 in colon cancer cells,  we generated PRDM1 knock out derivatives in RKO colon cancer cells by employing CRISPR/Cas9 technology and PRDM1α and PRDM1β overexpressing derivatives of RKO colon cancer cells. mRNA profile of these RKO derivatives were generated by deep sequencing, in replicate, using Illumina NextSeq 500
