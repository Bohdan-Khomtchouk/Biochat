TITLE
Gene expression signatures in Tif1b-deficient hematopoietic stem cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analyses of Tif1b-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Tif1b loss leads to  rapid depletion of HSCs. Expression analyses provide insight into the role of Tif1b in the maitenance of HSC.

DESIGN
HSCs (c-Kit+ Sca1+ Lineage- )  are sorted from fetal liver or adult bone marrow and are subjected into microarray analyses.
