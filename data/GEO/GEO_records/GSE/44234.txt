TITLE
Pdm1/nub repression of innate immunity

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Innate immune responses rely on expression of potent effector molecules, such as antimicrobial peptides, which have the capability to kill invading microorganisms. The presence and recognition of microbial components triggers several signaling pathways, such as the Toll and IMD pathways, which in turn activate NF-kB/Rel transcription factors to induce transcription of a large number of immune system genes. Not much is known how these genes are kept silent in healthy flies in the presence of commensal microorganisms, and how the expression of immune defense genes is turned off. We found that several immune defense genes are constitutively active in nub[1] mutants, indicating that the POU domain transcription factor Pdm1/Nubbin may act as a repressor of immune gene expression. We used microarrays to analyze the global changes in gene expression in nub[1] mutants compared to wild type. To analyze changes in gene expression in the gut distinctly from other immune-responsive tissues, such as fat body and hemocytes, flies were dissected and the gut was analyzed separately from the rest of the fly (carcass). A large number of genes were differentially expressed in nub[1] mutants compared to wild type. The differentially expressed transcripts are dominated by genes involved in Immune system processes and in Metabolism/Catabolism processes. The gut samples were dominated by genes involved in biological processes linked to Metabolism/Catabolism, but also here, genes involved in Response processes were enriched among the differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
The following Drosophila melanogaster strains were used: OregonR was used as wild type control and nub[1] b[1] pr[1] was used as the nub[1] mutant. Flies were dissected so that gut tissue was analyzed separately (gut) from the rest of the fly, minus head and gut (carcass). In total, 12 samples consisting of four different sample types:  wt gut, wt carcass, nub[1] gut and nub[1] carcass, and three samples of each type.
