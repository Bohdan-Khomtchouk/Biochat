TITLE
An integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis reveals potential targets associated with cell proliferation in uterine leiomyomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of uterine leiomyoma tumor samples for integrative analysis with copy number alterations data. Goal was to identify up- and/or down-expressed genes associated with genomic gains and/or losses, respectively. After, it was applied to GSEA and CONEXIC algorithm to integrate the data. Protein-protein interactions also was building and the data were validated using qRT-PCR and IHC techniques.

DESIGN
Experiment condition, 51 uterine leiomyoma samples from patients at the secretory or proliferative menstrual cycle phases were labeled with Cy3 and adjacent normal myometrium reference samples were labeled with Cy5. Each uterine leiomyoma and adjacent normal myometrium sample were obtained from the same patient and were mixed and hybridized on a glass slide Agilent 4x44 platform.

PLATFORM
