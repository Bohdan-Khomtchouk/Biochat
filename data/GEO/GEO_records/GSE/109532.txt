TITLE
TFAM binding analysis at mitochondrial genome between Wild Type (Wt) and Actb-/- (KNO) Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using Chromatin-immunoprecipitation and NGS, we investigated the binding of TFAM protein at mitochondrial genome between Actb+/+ Wild Type (WT) and Actb-/- (KO) Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast

DESIGN
Examination of TFAM binding at mitochondrial genome between Actb+/+Wild Type (WT) and Actb-/- (KNO) Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
