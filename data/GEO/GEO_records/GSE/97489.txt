TITLE
The role of Ng2/Cspg4 in soft tissues sarcoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NG2/CSPG4 is expressed in soft tissue sarcomas, however, its function in this tumor type, and its capacity to serve as a therapeutic target are unknown. Here, we used genetically engineered mice and cells from human tumors to determine the function of Ng2/Cspg4 in soft tissue sarcoma initiation and growth.  We also investigated the potential for NG2/CSPG4 mAb immunotherapy to target human sarcomas established as xenografts in mice. Inhibiting Ng2/Cspg4 expression in established soft tissue sarcomas is associated with a smaller tumor volume and a reduction in cell proliferation. Intriguingly, deleting Ng2/Cspg4 at the time of tumor initiation has the opposite effect. Gene profiling found that Igfbp3/5 are substantially downregulated when Ng2/Cspg4 is depleted at the time of tumor initiation, but upregulated or only minimally downregulated when Ng2/Cspg4 is depleted after tumor initiation. Furthermore, the normal regulation of Igfbp is blunted when Ng2/Cspg4 is deleted at the time of tumor initiation. Our data show a difference in NG2/CSPG4 function in tumor initiation and maintenance, and provides pre-clinical evidence supporting NG2/CSPG4 as a therapeutic approach in soft tissue sarcoma.

DESIGN
RNA samples isolated from 2 tumors derived from KrasG12D/+; p53f/f; Ng2/Cspg4f+/+ mice and 3 tumors derived from KrasG12D/+; p53f/f; Ng2/Cspg4f/f mice were used for RNA-seq analysis

PLATFORM
GPL21103 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)
