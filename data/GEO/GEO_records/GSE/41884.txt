TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings with altered enzymes activity of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The CHLD and CHLM genes encode proteins involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. It was proposed that intermediates like magnesium protoporphyrin might play a role in retrograde plastid-to-nucleus signaling. In the present work we provide evidence that altered enzymes activity of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway are causing changes in gene expression of over 200 nuclear genes.

DESIGN
The expression of the CHLD gene was diminished after inducing the RNAi system by spraying dexamethasone. The expression of the CHLM gene was increased after inducing the overexpressor system by spraying ÃŸ-estradiol.
