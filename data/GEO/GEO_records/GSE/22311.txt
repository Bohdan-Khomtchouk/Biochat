TITLE
Expression data from pig mesenteric lymph nodes

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The mesenteric lymph nodes  represent the immune response to eggs in schistosome infections,and the analysis of gene expression profiles of the mesenteric lymph nodes from the Vac-Cha (vaccinated with UV attenuated cercariae and challenged with normal cercariae)and Inf-Con (infected with normal cercariae) groups. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
The mesenteric lymph nodes surrounding the cecum from the Vac-Cha and Inf-Con groups were collected at week 8 post challenge and used to analyze the gene profile with Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the different genes expression profiles between the Vac-Cha group and Inf-Con group.The Vac-Cha group is three pigs vaccinated with UV attenuated Schistosoma japonicum cercariae and challenged with normal Schistosoma japonicum cercariae, and the Inf-Con group is three pigs infected with normal cercariae.  Samples pooled per group. A list of differentially-regulated genes can be found in the supplementary file below.
