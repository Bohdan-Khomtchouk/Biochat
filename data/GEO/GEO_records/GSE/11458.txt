TITLE
Lactate modulates gene expression in human mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Wound healing is associated with high rates of cell replication and lactate accumulation even under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. Lactate accounts for various effects in tissue regeneration, such as collagen synthesis, angiogenesis, modulation of cytokine patterns and as recently shown for stem cell homing. Its influence on genes involved in cell replication has not been shown yet. Therefore, the effect of lactate considering genes involved in different cellular processes was investigated. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured and incubated with lactate for different periods of time. Gene expression analysis was performed using custom-designed oligonucleotide microarrays. Keywords: Human gene expression study

DESIGN
Reference design with Cy3 labeled uniRNA and Cy5 labeled sample RNA.

PLATFORM
GPL6865 Homo sapiens 2.3K oncogene and clock gene oligo array
