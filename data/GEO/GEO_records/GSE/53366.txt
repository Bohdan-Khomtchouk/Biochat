TITLE
Automated high-throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The submitted files contain ChIP-seq data for the p300 transcriptional coactivator in GM12878 cells and for the NRSF transcription factor in GM12878 and Jurkat cells generated using a fully automated robotic chromatin immunoprecipitation protocol. Cells were fixed using 1% formaldehyde (NRSF samples) or 1% formaldehyde at 37C (p300 samples).

DESIGN
Characterization of monoclonal anti-p300 antibodies and of NRSF binding in GM12878 and Jurkat cells using automated high-throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation
