TITLE
Arabidopsis FORGETTER1 sustains stress-induced transcription through nucleosome remodeling

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plants as sessile organisms can adapt to environmental stress to mitigate its adverse effects. As part of such adaptation they maintain an active memory of heat stress for several days that mediates a more efficient response to recurring stress. We identified a mutant that is specifically affected in this heat stress memory. The forgetter1 (frg1) mutant is defective in the Arabidopsis orthologue of Strawberry notch and displays reduced maintenance of heat-induced gene expression. FRG1 globally associates with the promoter region of actively expressed genes in a heat-dependent fashion. FRG1 interacts with chromatin remodelers of the SWI/SNF and ISWI families, which also display reduced heat stress memory. Accordingly, nucleosome dynamics at loci with altered maintenance of heat-induced expression are affected in frg1. Thus, FRG1 is required to sustain a transcription-competent chromatin environment by nucleosome positioning. Our findings suggest a mechanism for the highly conserved Strawberry notch proteins in development and pathologies.

DESIGN
Chromatin binding of FRG1.
