TITLE
Gene expression-based investigation of a new role for the glyoxylate shunt in contributing to tolerance to oxidative stress.

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling in Pseudomonas aeruginosa MPAO1 and its glyoxylate shunt gens transposon insertion mutants (aceA and glcB) was perfomed using microarray analysis with or without 1mM PQ treatment. Based on the gene expression, we investigated role of glyoxylate shunt in P. aeruginosa and found out pathway related with glyoxylate shunt under oxidative stress.

DESIGN
We performed a transcriptome anaylsis of WT and glyoxylate shunt knockout mutants(aceA and glcB) with or without 1mM PQ treatment. Two independent microarray analysis were done.
