TITLE
rdi1∆ vs WT during macrophage co-culture

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans

SUMMARY
Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitors (RDI) are repressors of Rho-type monomeric GTPases that allow for precise control of their target processes, e.g. cytoskeletal arrangement, vesicle trafficking, and polarized growth.  In the human pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, maintenance of normal cell morphology is vital for pathogenicity.  We identified and deleted the gene encoding an RDI homolog in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans and investigated its impact on pathogenicity in animal models of cryptococcosis.  Rdi1 deletion resulted in altered vacuole size in tissue culture medium, with corresponding alterations in expression of vesicle trafficking related genes.  The rdi1∆ mutant strain showed reduced intracellular survival in macrophages, and severe attenuation of virulence in murine models of cryptococcosis. This reduction in virulence of the rdi1 mutant occurs in the absence of major defects in growth, morphology, or classical virulence-associated phenotypes.
