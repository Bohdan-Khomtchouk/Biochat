TITLE
Expression analysis of mock- or RAD21-transduced Kasumi1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We recently identified recurrent mutations of cohesin complex in myeloid neoplasms through whole-exome sequencing analysis. RAD21 is one of the main components of the cohesin complex. In this study, to investigate the biological impact of wild-type RAD21 on Kasumi1 cells harboring RAD21 mutation, Kasumi1 cells were retrovirally transduced with either mock or wild-type RAD21, and expression array was performed.

DESIGN
Expression analysis was performed for mock- or wild-type RAD21-transduced Kasumi-1 cells in triplicate. The experiment was performed twice independently.
