TITLE
Whole Genome Expression Array in Human T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Childhood T-ALL samples were compared with thymocyte subsets we compared key molecules of wnt signaling pathway in our cohort

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from the bone marrow samples of childhood T-ALL patients at the time of diagnosis with a blast count over 90% and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip HU-133 Plus.2 .Thymic subsets were sorted by FACS and labeled as DN(CD3,CD4,CD8 neg), DP3poz tot(CD3,CD4,CD8poz), DP3neg(CD3neg,CD4,CD8poz), ISP(Immature single positive), SP4(Single positive CD4), SP8 (Single positive CD8).
