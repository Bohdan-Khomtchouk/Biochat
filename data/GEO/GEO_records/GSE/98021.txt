TITLE
Establishment of a tumour progression model in chordoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA profiling of three novel chordoma cell lines out of the same patient. The gene expression profiles of the primary tumour derived cell line U-CH17P was compared to the gene expression profiles of the metastases derived cell lines  U-CH17S and U-CH17M in order to spot differently expressed genes, that are involved in the formation of metastases in chordoma.

DESIGN
Comparative analysis
