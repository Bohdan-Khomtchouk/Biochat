TITLE
Transcriptome profile of GEN2.2 cell line after CpG stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of expression profile of human GEN2.2 cell line cultured in the presence of CpG for 2 h. RNA expression profile of the human pDC cell line GEN2.2  after CpG stimulation

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from GEN2.2 cells growing at log phase with High Pure RNA isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), according with the manufacturer´s instructions in triplicate. GEN2.2 cells were stimulated with 1 µM ODN2006 (Life Technologies) for 2h. A total of 300 ng of total RNA was processed using Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit. Hybridization of human samples was performed on Illumina Human-HT12 Version 4.

PLATFORM
