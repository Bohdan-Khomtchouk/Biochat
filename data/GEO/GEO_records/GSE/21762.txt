TITLE
Microarray analysis of cross-talks between Jasmonate acid and ethylene signaling in Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis

SUMMARY
Jasmonate and ethylene are two important plant hormones contributing plant resistance to biotic stresses synergistically. Our experimental results showed that two ethylene activated transcription factors (EIN3/EIL1) integrated both jasmonate and ethylene signaling in multiple developmental and defense events. To understand the importance of EIN3/EIL1 in jasmonate signaling, we utilized microarray analysis to identify how much the jasmonate regulated genes are governed by EIN3/EIL1. Our results indicated that EIN3/EIL1 act sequentially in a cascade of transcriptional regulation initiated by jasmonate.

DESIGN
Compare the JA regulated genes in Col-0, coi1-2 and ein3 eil1 to identify how much transcripts are dependent on COI1 or EIN3/EIL1
