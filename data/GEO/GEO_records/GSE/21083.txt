TITLE
Benefits of a 6 week supplementation of sebacic acid on a mouse model of type 2 diabetes (db/db mice)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed at investigating the impact of chronic ingestion of sebacic acid (SA), a 10 carbons medium-chain dicarboxylic acid, on glycemic control in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes (db/db mice). Three groups of 15 mice were fed for 6 weeks either a chow diet (Ctrl), or a chow diet supplemented with 1.5% or 15% (SA1.5% and SA15% resp.) energy from SA. Fasting glycemia was measured once a week and HbA1c before and after supplementation. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at the end of the supplementation. Gene expression was determined by transcriptomic analysis on the liver of the Ctrl and SA15% groups. Results-After 42 days of supplementation, fasting glycemia and HbA1c were ~70% and ~25% lower in the SA15% group compared to other groups showing a beneficial effect of SA on hyperglycemia. During OGTT, blood glucose area under the curve (AUC) was reduced after SA15% compared to other groups. This effect was associated with a tendency for an improved insulin response. In the liver, Pck1 and FBP mRNA were statistically decreased in the SA15% compared to Ctrl suggesting a reduced hepatic glucose output induced by SA.   Conclusions-Dietary supplementation of SA largely improves glycemic control in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. This beneficial effect may be due (1) to a reduced hepatic glucose output resulting from transcriptional down regulation of key gluconeogenesis genes and (2) to an improved glucose induced-insulin secretion.
