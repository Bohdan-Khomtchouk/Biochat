TITLE
Expression data of germinating ahg1, ahg3 and WT seedling in the presence of ABA

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The effect of ahg1 and ahg3 on the gene expression profiles is similar but some genes are differentially affected. Keywords: Strain Comparison

DESIGN
To investigate the effect of ahg1 and ahg3 mutations, the genome wide gene expression profiles of germinating seedlings were examined. These mutations occurred in close but distinct PP2C genes. Stratified seeds were transferred to plates containing 0.5 uM ABA and allowed germinate at 23 Â°C under 16hr light 8hr dark conditions. After two days samples were collected for RNA extraction.
