TITLE
Expression data from root tips of  Wildtype and Osaim1 mutant rice treated with or without salicylic acid (SA)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To determine the possible role of SA in root meristem activity, we compared the gene expression profiles of the root tip of Osaim1 and WT under control condition and SA treatment. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying control condition and SA treatment between WT and Osaim1 mutant.

DESIGN
Root tips of four days old plants treated with SA(500ÂµM) or without SA from 2 biological repeats were sampled for Affymetrix microarray analysis.
