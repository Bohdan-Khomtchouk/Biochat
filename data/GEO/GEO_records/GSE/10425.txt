TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana grown under arsenate stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We examined the changes in gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana grown under arsenate stress.  The transcriptional profiling reveals antioxidant activity and repression of the phosphate starvation response. Keywords: dual label, stress response

DESIGN
This experiment included a comparison of three biological replicate controls against three biological arsenate-stressed replicates with a dye-swap technical replicate for a total of six microarray slide hybridizations.
