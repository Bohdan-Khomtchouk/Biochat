TITLE
Different isoforms of Maxwell´s Demon, a conserved cell membrane protein, mediate lose/win decisions during cell competition

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Cell competition promotes the elimination of weaker cells from a growing population. Here we investigate how cells of Drosophila wing imaginal discs distinguish “winners” from “losers” during cell competition. Using genomic and functional assays we have identified Maxwell`s Demon (Mwd), a cell membrane protein conserved in multicellular animals. Our results suggest that the membrane protein Mwd is a dedicated component of the cell competition response that is required and sufficient to label cells as “winners” or “losers”. In Drosophila, the mwd locus produces three isoforms, mwdubi, mwdLose-A and mwdLose-B. Basal levels of mwdubi are constantly produced. During competition the mwdLose isoforms are upregulated in prospective loser cells. Cell-cell comparison of relative mwdLose and mwdubi levels ultimately determine which cell undergoes apoptosis. This “extracellular code” may constitute an ancient mechanism to terminate competitive conflicts among cells.

DESIGN
Two samples have been analysed: tub > dmyc > Gal4 transgene cells (competitor) and tub > cd2 > Gal4 control cells (non competitor) at different time points (0, 12, 24 and 48 hours). Each experiment was replicated 6 times, three of them by dye swap.
