TITLE
Molecular characterization of CD8+ T cell with suppressive capacities

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the VILLIN-HA/CL4-TCR transgenic mouse model a population of CD8 T cells with suppressive capacities was indentified. For the molecular characterisation of CD8 regulatory T cells gene comparative expression profiles of naive, activated and regulatory CD8 T cells were performed.

DESIGN
Three population of CD8 T cells are included in the analysis. 1. CD8 T cells 2. in vivo activated CD8 T cells 3. in vivo generated CD8 regulatory T cells

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
