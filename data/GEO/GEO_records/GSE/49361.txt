TITLE
Expression data from SET knockdown R1 embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify the gene expression changes after SET knockdown in ESCs and 4 day RA differentiated ESCs

DESIGN
Actively growing ESCs and 4d RA differentiated ESCs were harvested and RNA was extracted immediately.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
