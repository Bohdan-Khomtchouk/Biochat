TITLE
Fetal and neonatal hematopoietic progenitors are functionally and transcriptionally resistant to Flt3-ITD mutations.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in control and Flt3-ITD, Stat5 and Runx1 mutant HSCs and HPCs from different developmental stages.

DESIGN
HSCs and HPCs were isolated from wild type and FLT3-ITD/+ mice at the indicated ages, or from wild type, Flt3-ITD and Stat5a/b mutant progenitors, or from wild type, Flt3-ITD and Runx1 mutant progenitors.
