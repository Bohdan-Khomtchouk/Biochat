TITLE
Expression data from fibroblasts BjhTERT-RhoA-KO and PC3 tumor cells after cocultivation and before

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of BJhTERT RhoA-KO and PC3 mRFP was performed before and after six days confrontation in co-cultivation. Analyses of original and control fibroblasts was also performed. To identify molecules that may mediate the tumor promoting effect of RhoA knock out fibroblasts, we performed gene expression analysis of BJhTERT RhoA-KO and PC3 mRFP cells before the confrontation and then after six days after it, using  Affymetrix Whole Transcript Assay platform.

DESIGN
Four days old fibroblast monolayer was confronted with PC3 mRFP tumor cells, plated in ratio 1:30 to number of plated fibroblasts. After six days of confrontation cells were sorted by FACS (Fluorescence-activated cell sorting). Total RNA was isolated from each confronted and non-confronted cells with kit. Then 150 ng of total RNA were used for transcriptomic analysis.for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
