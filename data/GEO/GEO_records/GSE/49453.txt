TITLE
miRQC study, Agilent Platform data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This data is a subset of the miRQC study, submitted for publication in summer of 2013.  The purpose of the study was to compare various aspects of miRNA profiling platform performance (reproducibility, sensitivity, accuracy, etc) using a standardized set of samples. The data included in this submission is a subset of the study data generated on the Agilent miRNA profiling system.  The array used was designed to measure all of the human and human viral miRNAs in miRBase 16.0 and the is annotated based on miRBase 18.  Analysis for the miRQC study was based only on the human sequences present in miRBase 18 (8 sequences were deleted between 16.0 and 18.0)
