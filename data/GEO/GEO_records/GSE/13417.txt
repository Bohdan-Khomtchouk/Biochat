TITLE
Transcript profiling in Arabidopsis gollum mutant: Role of the Gollum gene in the plant development

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs07-08_gollum - trancript profiling in arabidopsis gollum mutant. Elucidate the role of Gollum gene in the plant development by a RNAi approach. Seeds of WT and RNAi lines were sowed on soil and conserved 2 days at 4°C. The pots were transferred to the greenhouse under long-day conditions (16h light, 22°C). The leaves of one-month old plants were harvested and total RNA were extracted. Keywords: wt vs mutant comparison

DESIGN
3 dye-swap - wt vs mutant comparison

PLATFORM
GPL4346 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.2
