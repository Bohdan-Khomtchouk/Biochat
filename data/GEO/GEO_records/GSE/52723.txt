TITLE
Naa10p's effect on gene expression profiles in MCF7 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
N-α-acetyltransferase 10 protein (Naa10p, also called ARD1), the catalytic subunit of N-acetyltransferase A, is a critical regulator of cell death and proliferation. Naa10p is also shown to regulate cancer metastasis by inhibiting cell motility, however its role in cancer metastasis is not fully understood. In this study, we found that high expression of Naa10p is positively correlated with the survival of patients with breast cancer, while negatively correlated with lymph node metastasisr. Naa10p inhibits breast cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and decreases the xenograft growth and metastasis in nude mice. Microarray screening revealed that Naa10p down-regulates expression of several pro-invasive genes, which was validated by qRT-PCR analysis.

DESIGN
To gain an insight into Naa10p’s inhibitory effect on cancer metastasis, we performed microarray analysis with RNA samples extracted from Naa10p-silenced MCF-7 (MCF-7SA) and control cells (MCF-7NC).
