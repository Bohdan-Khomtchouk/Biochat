TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of annotated coding genes and sORF at 74 accessions of A. thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We applied previously designed array  in order to widely cover all types of genes of 74 A. thaliana accessions.

DESIGN
The 18-days-old seedlings of 74 accessions were growing on 1% agar plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS). Aerial parts of seedling were processed in two biological duplicates in each accession.
