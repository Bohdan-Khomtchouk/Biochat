TITLE
ChIP-Seq of TOBF1 (A830080D01Rik) in mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the chromatin binding of a novel protein TOBF1 (encoded by A830080D01Rik) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.

DESIGN
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation was done using Formaldehyde-DSG cross-linking in mouse ES cells. DNA obtained after ChIP was sequenced.
