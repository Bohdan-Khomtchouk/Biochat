TITLE
Tumor T20 Sectors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The following CGH experiments were conducted on four sectors (S1-S4) from a single primary ductal carcinoma tumor (T20) using the Sector-Ploidy-Profiling (SPP) Approach.  SPP involves macro-dissecting the tumor, flow-sorting nuclei by differences in total genomic DNA content and profiling the genome of the tumor subpopulations.

DESIGN
The genomic DNA from each tumor subpopulation was labeled with Cy5 and hybridized to an 390K Rubble-Rep ROMA Microarray.  A normal reference male fibroblast was labeled with Cy3 as a control.  Samples were cohybridize to the same single microarray.
