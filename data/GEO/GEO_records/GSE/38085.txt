TITLE
Gene expression profiles of EpiSCs under epiblastic and neural plate developmental conditions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) were placed in the epiblastic cell maintenance condition (EpiSC) or in a neural plate developmental condition (Iwafuchi-Doi et al. Dev Biol 352, 354-366, 2011) for one (NPC1) or two (NPC2) days, and expression profiles of total mRNAs were compared.

DESIGN
Duplicate EpiSC cultures (A and B) originating from the same seed culture and made in the above conditions were processed for total RNA extraction using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), and analyzed

PLATFORM
