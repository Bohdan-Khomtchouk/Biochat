TITLE
Transcriptome profile in INT cells following Cryptosporidium parvum infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cryptosporidium parvum is an important opportunistic parasite pathogen for immunocompromised individuals and a common cause of diarrhea in young children in developing countries. Certain parasite molecules can be delivered into host epithelial cells and may act as effector molecules for parasite intracellular development.  This study aims to measure the impact of transfection of a parasite low-protein coding potential RNA transcript, Cdg7_FLc_0990, on the transcriptome profile in intestinal epithelial cells. Human intestinal epithelial INT (FHs 74 Int) cells were grown to 80% confluence and transfected with the Cdg7_FLc_0990 full-length or the empty vector for 48h. Total RNA was collected for the genome-wide analysis. RNA from INT cells following C. parvum infection for 48h and from cell of the non-infected control was also collected for the analysis. The Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression Microarray (G4851B) was used for the genome-wide analysis, which provides full coverage of genes and transcripts with the most up-to-date content, including mRNAs and lincRNAs ( http://www.chem.agilent.com/store/en_US/Prod-G4851B/G4851B )

DESIGN
The FHs 74 Int  were grown to 80% confluence for four groups:  control (Group 00-C), C. parvum infection (Group 00-D, cells treated with C. parvum), pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector (Group CP-A, cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector), and pcDNA3.1(+)_Cdg7_FLc_0990 full-length (Group CP-D, cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)_Cdg7_FLc_0990 full-length ). 48h later, total RNAs were prepared with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instruction.
