TITLE
The tissue-specific lncRNA Fendrr is an essential regulator of heart and body wall development in the mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The histone modifying complexes PRC2 and TrxG/MLL play pivotal roles in determining the activation state of genes controlling pluripotency, lineage commitment, and cell differentiation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can bind to either complex, and some have been shown to act as modulators of PRC2 or TrxG/MLL activity. Here we show that the lateral mesoderm-specific lncRNA Fendrr is essential for proper heart and body wall development in the mouse. Embryos lacking Fendrr displayed upregulation of several transcription factors controlling lateral plate or cardiac mesoderm differentiation, accompanied by a drastic reduction in PRC2 occupancy along with decreased H3K27 trimethylation and/or an increase in H3K4 trimethylation at their promoters. Fendrr binds to both the PRC2 and TrxG/MLL complexes, suggesting that it acts as modulator of chromatin signatures that define gene activity. Thus, our work identifies a lncRNA that plays an essential role in fine-tuning the regulatory networks which control the fate of lateral mesoderm derivatives.

DESIGN
The transcriptomes of ventricles isolated from wildtype (WT) and Fendrr knock-out (KO) E12.5 embryos, obtained from tratraploid complementations of embryonic stem cells, were analyzed by strand-specific RNA-Seq of ribosomal RNA-depleted, total RNA.
