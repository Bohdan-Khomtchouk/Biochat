TITLE
miRNA and mRNA profiling of tumor-educated macrophages (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled miRNA and mRNA expression of in vitro tumor-educated macrophages (TEM) by indirectly co-culturing with estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of untreated and co-cultured macrophages, parallel analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
