TITLE
The arf10/16 double mutant has a differential transcriptional program in response to Al stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To reveal how ARF10 and ARF16 regulate Al-induced root-growth inhibition, a transcriptome analysis was carried out by comparing without and with Al-exposed arf10/16 double mutant line and WT through RNA sequencing. The present transcriptomic analysis has revealed that many of the differentially transcribed genes associated with cell wall modification were regulated by transcription factors ARF10 and ARF16. The implication is that the auxin-regulated Al-induced inhibition of root growth arises from auxin signalling-regulated cell wall structure or component modification.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from control (non-treated roots) and Al-exposed roots. Six day old plants were treated with and without Al treatment for 24 h, then total RNA was isolated using the RNeasyÂ® Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN), and then Illumina sequencing was performed.

PLATFORM
