TITLE
Expression profiling across mouse epithelial tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize genes, pathways, and transcriptional regulators enriched in the mouse cornea, we compared the expression profiles of whole mouse cornea, bladder, esophagus, lung, proximal small intestine, skin, stomach, and trachea.

DESIGN
Total RNA was purified from esophagus, lung, proximal small intestine, skin, stomach, and trachea. Data from previous studies in the lab (cornea, GSE43155; bladder, GSE15770; and E18.5 skin, GSE15772) were utilized in the comparison.
