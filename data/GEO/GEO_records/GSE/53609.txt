TITLE
Dual transcriptomic analysis of the interaction between the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor S238N and soil bacterium Collimonas fungivorans Ter331

ORGANISM
Laccaria bicolor

SUMMARY
In order to get insights into the ability of ectomycorrhizal fungi to perceive their biotic environment as well as into the mechanisms of the interactions between ectomycorrhizal fungi and soil bacteria, we analysed the transcriptomic response of the ectomycorrhizal fungus L. bicolor and one detrimental bacterial strain during their interactions in vitro.

DESIGN
We performed six hybridizations (macroarray) with samples derived from Laccaria bicolor cultivated alone (3 biological replicates and with C. fungivorans Ter331 (3 biological replicates)

PLATFORM
GPL9465 Laccaria bicolor 4.9K ADNc macroarray
