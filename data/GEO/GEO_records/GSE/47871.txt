TITLE
Antitumoral activity of acadesine and rituximab in MCL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acadesine is a nucleoside analogue with known antileukemic effects in different neoplasms. We investigated the activity of acadesine ne exerts a cytotoxic effect in MCL and synergizes with rituximab supporting clinical examination of this strategy for MCL patients We used microarrays to detail the gene expression changes in acadesine-, rituximab- and combination-treated tumors.

DESIGN
Global RNA expression in tumors treated with  acadesine, rituximab and the combination in a xenograft model of MCL (Jeko-1). Tumors were collected 18 days after the initiation of the treatments.
