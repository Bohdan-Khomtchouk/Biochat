TITLE
miniChIP-chip of murine hematopoietic stem cells and progeny with H3K4me3, H3K79me2, H3K9/14ac, H3K27me3, H3K9me3, PolII

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study describes the changes in epigenetic chromatin modifications during murine hematopoietic stem cell differentiation in vivo using a modified miniChIP-chip technology. We have addressed issues including bivalent (H3K4me3/H3K27me3) modifications, lineage priming hypothesis, and stem cell chromatin properties in our study described in Weishaupt et al., 2009 (Blood)

DESIGN
Comparison of 4 murine hematopoietic stem, progenitor and mature cell types directly isolated from primary tissues using FACS. HSCs are phenotypically identified in bone marrow as lineage-, cKit+, Sca1+, CD150+, Flk2/Flt3- (LSKCD150+ cells). MPPs are phenotypically identified in bone marrow as lineage-, cKit+, Sca1+, CD150-, Flk2/Flt3+ (LSKCD150- cells). PreMegEs are phenotypically identified in bone marrow as lineage-, cKit+, Sca1-, CD150+, CD105-, FcgRI/IIlo and CD41- cells as described in Pronk et al., 2007. Splenic-derived CD4+ T cells are phentypically identified as CD4+, CD8-, B220-, Nk1.1- cells as described in Rolf et al., 2008.
