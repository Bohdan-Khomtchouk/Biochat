TITLE
The zinc transporter ZIP10 regulates epidermal morphogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed an mRNA-sequencing experiment using ZIP10 positive and negative cells isolated from the ventral skins of WT mice and analyzed gene expression profiles of those cells to identify the functional differences between the two cell types.

DESIGN
ZIP10 positive and negative cells from the ventral skins of one-week-old WT mice were sorted by flow cytometry. From those cells, we isolated mRNAs and analyzed gene expression profiles by mRNA sequencing.
