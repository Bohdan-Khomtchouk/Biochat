TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with cholesterol synthesis inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The hypothesis tested in this experiment was that a statin caused a larger shift in genes associated with pluripotency when compared with a Î”-24 oxidoreductase. It was theorized that the effect of the statin would be greater since the enzyme inhibition takes place proximal to the pathway branch involved in signal isoprenylation, whereas the oxidoreductase inhibits distal to this branch.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from MDA-MB-231 cells following 24 hour exposure to Pravastatin or Proadifen hydrochloride
