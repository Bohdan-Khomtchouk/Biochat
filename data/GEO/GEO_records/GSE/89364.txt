TITLE
The effects of Mycobacterium avium infection on hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the changes in global transcriptome expression of HSCs following infection, we performed high-throughput sequencing of Poly A+ RNA (RNA-Seq) from purified HSCs (SP KSL CD150+) isolated from naive or Mycobacterium avium infected mice

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from hematopoietic stem cells isolated from na√Øve or Mycobacterium avium infected mice was subjected to deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2000

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
