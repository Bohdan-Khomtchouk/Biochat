TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana in response to combined stress treatment under altered GSH conditions.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis seeds of Col-0 and pad2.1 were grown for three weeks and were further placed in filter paper for 5 min at 4°C and then transferred to 1/2MS media with 30% PEG at 4°C for an additional 6 hours; the leaves were collected for RNA isolation. Trancriptomic profiling of the combined stress treated Col-0 and pad2.1 indicated downregulation of various abiotic and oxidative stress responsive genes in pad2.1 in response to combined stress treatment.
