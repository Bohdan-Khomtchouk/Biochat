TITLE
Comparative microRNAome analysis of the leaves in doubled haploid and autotetraploid Chinese cabbages

ORGANISM
Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis

SUMMARY
We performed microRNA profiling of doubled haploids and autotetraploids that generated from a Chinese cabbage doubled haploid line ‘FT’ using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform and analyzed differentially expressed miRNAs.

DESIGN
microRNA levels were examinated in doubled haploid and autotetraploid leaves of Chinese cabbage.

PLATFORM
GPL24709 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis)
