TITLE
P18 mouse non-deprived vs. deprived visual cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild-type (C57Bl6) mice underwent monocular enucleation at P14 and were sacrificed 4 days later at P18. Bilateral (non-deprived and deprived) visual cortex was dissected from 1-mm thick coronal sections, and total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using Trizol (Gibco-BRL). Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
Gene expression in pooled samples from 5 non-deprived (ipsilateral to monocular enucleation) and 5 deprived (contralateral to monocular enucleation) visual hemispheres was compared.
