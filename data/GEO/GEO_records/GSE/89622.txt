TITLE
Transcriptomes of mouse N-Myc drived B-Acute-Lymphoblastic-Leukemia (B-ALL) leukemia cells treated with fasting

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We reported that fasting completely inhibits the development of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in mouse models, by inducing a rapid differentiation and clearance of ALL cells. To determine the underlying mechanisms, we transplanted N-Myc expressed lineage negative  (Lin-) fetal live cells with a GFP reporter into mice to initiate B-ALL development. At the middle stage of B-ALL development when GFP+% in PB reached about 60%, the B-ALL mice were fasted 1-day or 2-days. GFP+B220+ B-ALL cells from 1-day, 2-day fasted mice and control mice were collected by flow cytometry for RNA-seq analysis.

DESIGN
3 samples, including B-ALL leukemia cells from the bone marrow of 1-day fasted, 2-day fasted and control B-ALL mice, were collected for RNA-seq with duplication.
