TITLE
Expression data of substantia nigra from postmortem human brain of Parkinson's disease patients (PD)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying Parkinson's disease Keywords: normal versus diseased

DESIGN
Substantia nigra tissue from postmortem brain of normal and Parkinson disease patients were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays: 9 replicates for the controls and 16 replicates for the Parkinson's disease patients were used. Both cohorts included males and females.
