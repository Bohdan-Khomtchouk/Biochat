TITLE
Polycomb Ezh2 controls the fate of GABAergic neurons in the embryonic cerebellum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genetic ablation of Ezh2 in Pax7-Cre driven lineages resulted in developmental defects in E13.5 cerebellum. The transcriptional change and H3K27me3 mark change were investigated by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq on H3K27me3.

DESIGN
The Ezh2 gene was genetically ablated by crossing Ezh2 flox allele line and Pax7-Cre line mice, which resulted in Ezh2 gene deletion in embryonic cerebellum. To aid the precise dissection of embryonic cerebellum. A Rosa-YFP allele was also breeded along with the Ezh2 flox allele. E13.5 cerebella were dissected, then immediatedly dropped into RNAlater for mRNA abstraction and RNA-seq, or fixed with 1%PFA for H3K27me3 ChIP-seq assay.
