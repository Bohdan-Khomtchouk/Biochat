TITLE
Differential expression of microRNAs in bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) transformed equine cells

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
The experiment investigates the effect of BPV-1 on microRNA profile in control cell line and BPV-1 in vitro transformed cell line A subset of microRNAs have been found differentially expressed in cells containing the BPV-1 genomes compared to control cells

DESIGN
Two experimental conditions (control -EqPalF- and control with BPV-1 genomes -S6-2 cells-) with three replicates per condition.

PLATFORM
GPL21017 miRCURY LNAâ„¢ microRNA Array 7th Gen [catalog# 208100; miRBase 19.0.43]
