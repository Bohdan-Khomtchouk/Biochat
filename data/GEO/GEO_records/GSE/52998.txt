TITLE
Adenovirus promotes host cell anabolic glucose metabolism via MYC activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adenovirus infection leads to increased glycolytic metabolism in host cells. Expression of a single gene product encoded within the E4 early transcription region, E4ORF1, is sufficient to promote increased glycolytic flux in cultured epithelial cells. E4ORF1 reprograms cellular glucose metabolism by augmenting MYC-dependent transcription of metabolic genes.

DESIGN
To gain insight into the mechanism by which E4ORF1 promotes increased glycolytic flux, we conducted a global microarray analysis of changes in RNA expression in MCF10A cells induced to accutely express ORF1 versus an empty vector.
