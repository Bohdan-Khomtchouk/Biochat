TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression patterns in human kidney cancer [patients with metastasis]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the mechanisms of kidney tumor progression and metastasis, we performed expression profiling of human kidney cancer and benign tissues.

DESIGN
mRNA microarray expression analysis was performed by using  26 matched malignant and non-malignant kidney tissue samples from 13 ccRCC patients with diagnosed metastasis.
