TITLE
The gene expression analysis of the spinal cord and skeletal muscle of SBMA (Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy) model mice with or without pioglitazone (PG) treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the gene expression changes by administering PG to SBMA model mice, we prepared total RNA samples from the spinal cords and skeletal muscles of transgenic mice carrying a full-length human AR with 97 CAGs (AR-97Q) that were treated with or without PG. We used AR-97Q (Line #7-8) male mice because they show progressive muscular atrophy and weakness as well as SBMA-like pathology such as the accumulation of the pathogenic androgen receptor in the nucleus of motor neurons. Using microarray analysis, we identified the genes with significantly altered expression of AR-97Q mice by PG treatment.

DESIGN
For non-treated and PG-treated groups, we examined the male mice at 13 weeks of age. RNA from the total spinal cord and skeletal muscle was isolated from three mice of each group.
