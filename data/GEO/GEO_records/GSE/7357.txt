TITLE
Expression data from Hfe-deficient liver and duodenum in mouse strains with differing susceptibilities to iron loading

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hfe disruption in the mouse leads to experimental hemochromatosis by a mechanism which remains elusive. Evidence for at least five modifier genes has been obtained. These account for the higher iron load of Hfe-deficient D2 mice compared to B6 mice. Gene expression profling was used to clarify the mechanism of Hfe action and to identify potential modifier genes. Keywords: response to genetic modification
