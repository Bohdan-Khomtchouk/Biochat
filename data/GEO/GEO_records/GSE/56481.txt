TITLE
CD4+CD+8 double positive T-cell mRNA expression profiles from patients with granulomatotis with polyangiitis (GPA) compared to healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expansion of circulating CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) T-cells in a disease context is poorly understood. The study aims to identify mechanisms which may drive expansion of CD4+CD8+ double positive t-cells in GPA.

DESIGN
PBMCs from 3 GPA patients and 3 healthy controls were used to generate mRNA profiles from CCD4+CD8+ double positive T-cells in a disease context

PLATFORM
GPL16686 [HuGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
