TITLE
Whole-genome expression analysis of Rnaseh2b(E202X/E202X) embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of E9.5 embryos lacking functional RNase H2 (Rnaseh2bE202X/E202X) was compared to age-matched wild type controls to investigate the molecular basis of growth arrest in Rnaseh2-/- mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from three E9.5 embryos of Rnaseh2+/+ and Rnaseh2E202X/E202X were compared
