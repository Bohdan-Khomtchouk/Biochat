TITLE
Expression of C. albicans genes during GI tract colonization and influence of efg1, efh1 and cph1 mutations

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
The goals of this study were to identify the Efg1p-regulon during GI tract colonization and to compare C. albicans gene expression during colonization of different organs of the GI tract. Our results identified significant differences in gene expression between cells colonizing the cecum and ileum.  In addition, during laboratory growth, efg1- null mutant cells grew to a higher density than WT cells.  The efg1- null mutant grew in depleted medium, while WT cells could only grow if the depleted medium was supplemented with carnitine, a compound that promotes the metabolism of fatty acids.  During colonization, efg1- null mutant cells expressed higher levels of genes involved in lipid catabolism, carnitine biosynthesis and carnitine utilization in comparison to colonizing WT cells.  This altered gene expression supports the ability of efg1- cells to hypercolonize na√Øve mice.

DESIGN
C. albicans cells (WT, efg1-, efg1- efh1- or efg1- cph1-) were inoculated into antibiotic-treated BALB/c mice by oral gavage.  Contents of the cecum and ileum were collected and frozen in RNALater.  Reference cells (WT C. albicans) were grown in YPD medium at 37oC to exponential phase. Total RNA was extracted from both all samples.  Sample of C. albicans isolated from GI tract organs was compared to reference on microarray.  Between 4 and 7 microarray hybridizations, with dye swaps, were performed for each sample.
