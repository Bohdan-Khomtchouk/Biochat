TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Clostridium acetobutylicum biofilm cells adsorbed onto fibrous matrix in biobutanol production [I]

ORGANISM
Clostridium acetobutylicum

SUMMARY
Immobilization of Clostridium acetobutylicum B3 onto fibrous matrix  by surface-adsorption was developed and applied to biobutanol production. The immobilized C. acetobutylicum B3 cells formed biofilm and showed dramatically improved butanol tolerance and production rate. DNA array-based transcriptional analysis of C.acetobutylicum B3 biofilm cells was conducted to elucidate the gene expression profile of the biofilm cells. Results showed that about 16% of the whole genome was differentially expressed. The most apparently differentially expressed genes were involved in amino acid transport and metabolism, inorganic ion transport and metabolism, energy production and conversion, and coenzyme transport and metabolism.
