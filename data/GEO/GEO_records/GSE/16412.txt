TITLE
Gene expression analysis of 3 MCL and 3 CLL cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray-based gene expression analysis identified genes differentially expressed in 3 MCL and 3 CLL cell lines compared to the lymphoblastoid non-tumor cell line LCL_WEI.

DESIGN
In this study, a set of 3 CLL and 3 MCL cell lines was used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 16 441 transcripts, leading to the identification of differentially expressed genes compared to the a non-tumor B-cell line LCL-WEI by Significance Analysis of Microarray data.
