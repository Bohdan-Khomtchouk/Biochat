TITLE
Metabolic engineering of Corynebacterium glutamicum for L-arginine production

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032

SUMMARY
Metabolically engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum strains were constructed for the enhanced production of L-arginine, and their gene expression profiles were investigated

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of two C. glutamicum strains AR2 and AR6 were examined for the 3043 genes twice.
