TITLE
Integrated functional analysis of engineered carbon limitation in the CO2/HCO3-uptake deficient ∆ndhD3/ndhD4/cmpA/sbtA mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
Functional analysis of engineered carbon limitation in the ∆ndhD3/ndhD4/cmpA/sbtA (= ∆4) Synechocystis mutant reveals a global phenocopy of wild type acclimation to low CO2 and multi-layered Ci-regulation.

DESIGN
We analyzed gene expression in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 WT as well as a ∆ndhD3/ndhD4/cmpA/sbtA mutant (= ∆4) at HC (5% CO2) as well as 3h and 24h after shift to LC (air). For each strain and each sampling point, 2 biological replicates were analyzed.
