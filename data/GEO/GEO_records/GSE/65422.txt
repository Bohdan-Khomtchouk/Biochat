TITLE
Gene expression profiling and mutation analysis of B cell lymphomas arising in mice expressing NIK and BCL6 transgenes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, by RNA sequencing we generated the gene expression profile (GEP) of each mouse lymphoma. By comparing the GEP of a lymphoma to that of normal B cells at physiological differentiation stages, we classified the lymphomas to either ABC- or GCB-type of DLBCL. Analysis of RNA sequencing data also led to identification of various mutations in these lymphomas.

DESIGN
In this experiment, 12 lymphoma samples, 6 reference samples (two resting B cell controls, two activated B cell controls (ABC) and two germinal center B cell controls (GCB))

PLATFORM
