TITLE
Chemostat expression data of amylase producing yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
In this study we focus on two Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CEN. PK series) strains producing either insulin precursor or amylase and we compare the transcriptional regulation at different dilution rates, in particular with the objective to identify the relationship between cell metabolism and recombinant protein production. We found that anaerobic conditions showed high amount of amylase productions when comparing to aerobic conditions and the genome-scale transcriptional analysis suggested that genes related to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lipid synthesis and stress responses were generally up-regulated at anaerobic conditions. Moreover, we proposed a model for the electron transfer from ER to the final electron acceptor, fumarate under anaerobic conditions.
