TITLE
Long non-coding RNAs in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression of lncRNAs in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) were determined with a commercially available microarray (Arraystar Inc.,Rockville, Maryland USA). The Arraystar human lncRNA Microarray V3.0 containing 30,586 LncRNAs and 26,109 coding transcripts (mRNAs)

DESIGN
A total of three patients with cSCC were biopsied. A total of three control (non-lesional skin) were biopsied.
