TITLE
miRNA expression data in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an untreatable fibrotic lung disease characterized by fibroblast proliferation and epithelial mesenchymal transition. The expression and role of microRNAs (miRNA) has not been studied in IPF. Using miRNA expression microarrays we identified 46 differentially expressed miRNA in IPF lungs which included let-7d and the miR-30 family. Keywords: miRNA expression

DESIGN
Lung tissue samples for microarray analysis were obtained through the University of Pittsburgh Health Sciences Tissue Bank. Ten samples were obtained from surgical remnants of biopsies or lungs explanted from patients with IPF who underwent pulmonary transplant, and ten control normal lung tissues obtained from the disease free margins with normal histology of lung cancer resection specimens. The morphologic diagnosis of IPF was based on typical microscopic findings consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia. Total RNA was labeled with Cy3 and hybridized on Agilent 8X15K microRNA array (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). After 20 hours hybridization, arrays were washed and scanned according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol.
