TITLE
The miRNA profiling in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-231/E1A and knockdown of Dicer in MDA-MB-231/E1A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dicer, RNase III endonuclease, is an essential enzyme in miRNA biogenesis that regulates target gene expression, and it has been reported that aberrant expressions of Dicer associate with the clinical outcomes of patients in various cancers. To explore the miRNA differencial expression regulated by Dicer in MDA-MB-231/E1A cells, the microarray profiling analysis was employed to conduct differentially expressed miRNAs in stable MDA-MB-231/vector, MDA-MB-231/E1A, and MDA-MB-231/E1A/shDicer cells.

DESIGN
The four groups including vector control, E1A-expressing and Dicer knockdown in E1A-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested and RNA were isolated. Two independent experiments were performed for each group.
