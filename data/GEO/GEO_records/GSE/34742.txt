TITLE
MicroRNAome comparison between intramuscular and subcutaneous vascular stem cell adipogenesis

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We report the application of the Solexa deep sequencing method for high-throughput profiling files of small RNA in primary porcine vascular stem cell adipogenesis.The sequences and relative expression levels of 208 (98.6% in miRbase 16.0) known and 288 potential porcine miRNAs were identified.  50 miRNAs changed in similar pattern between IVSC and SVSC differentiation, such as miR-210, miR-10b and miR-99a.  On the contrast, 8 miRNAs changed reversely between IVSC and SVSC differentiation, 16 changed only in IVSC differentiation while 48 only in SVSC differentiation.  And 34 miRNAs showed fat-depot specific expression pattern (30 in cells of intramuscular origin and 4 in cells of subcutaneous origin).  Unexpectedly but reasonably, these adipogenesis-related miRNAs mainly functioned by targeting similar pathways in adipogenesis, obesity and syndrome.
