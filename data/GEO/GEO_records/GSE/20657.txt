TITLE
Effect of THPS on growth physiology and gene expression of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio vulgaris str. Hildenborough

SUMMARY
The effect of tetrakis (hydroxymethyl) phosphonium sulfate (THPS) stress on Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH) gene expression was determined by comparing the gene expression profiles of DvH with THPS added at mid-log phase against DvH grown without THPS. Low concentration THPS had little influence over instantaneous growth rate constant and final cell density of the culture. Changes in gene expression caused by exposure to THPS were determined using full-genome DvH microarrays. In comparison to Glutaraldehyde and BAC microarray results, not lot of gene expressions were altered by THPS. Keywords: THPS Stress

DESIGN
For each condition 2 unique biological samples were hybridized to 4 arrays that each contained duplicate spots. Genomic DNA was used as universal reference.
