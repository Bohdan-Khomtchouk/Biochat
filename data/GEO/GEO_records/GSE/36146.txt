Successful and failed human liver regeneration are characterized by the coordinated expression of distinct microRNAs

SUMMARY
The liverâ€™s remarkable capacity to regenerate allows it to carry out vital life-supporting functions despite unrelenting pathogen and toxin-induced injury. Unchecked, this capability also leads to cirrhosis, a burgeoning global disease burden. Existing animal models only partially recapitulate human liver regeneration, which hitherto has not been systematically studied. We investigated human liver regeneration in a unique model of liver transplantation. Here we show coordinated changes in expression of microRNA (miRNA) during regeneration that drive proliferation, innate immunity and angiogenesis. Failed regeneration is associated with distinct miRNAs enforcing cell cycle inhibition and DNA methylation. The miRNA expression associated with successful or failed regeneration when recapitulated in vitro, triggered expression of cardinal regeneration-linked genes promoting cell cycle entry or inhibition, respectively. Furthermore, inhibition of three miRNAs whose downregulation is associated with successful regeneration, induced proliferation in vitro. Our data indicate that human liver regeneration is orchestrated by distinct miRNAs determining cell cycle fate. Their manipulation may obviate the need for transplantation by enforcing successful regeneration in the liver and other solid organs.
