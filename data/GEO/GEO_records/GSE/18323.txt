TITLE
Expression data from a malaria vaccine trial (HG-U133A2.0 and U133 Plus 2.0)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Volunteers were assessed at study entry, the day of the third vaccination and 24, 72 hours, two weeks after vaccination, and 5 days after challenge. 13/39 vaccinees were protected and 26/39 were not protected. Eleven vaccinees exhibited delayed onset of parasitemia. All infectivity controls developed parasitemia. Prediction Analysis of Microarrays (PAM-R) identified genes corresponding with protection. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified sets of genes associated with protection after the third immunization, before challenge. After the third immunization, prior to challenge, differential expression of genes in the immunoproteasome pathway distinguished protected and non protected persons

DESIGN
Samples were collected at study entry, the day of third vaccination, 24 and 72 hours post the third vaccination and two weeks post the third vaccination as well as 5 days post challenge. Both longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis were carried out to investigate expression profiles associated with vaccine effects and vaccine efficacy. This dataset contains 215 samples from HG-U133 A 2.0 platform and 39 samples from HG Plus2.0 platform.
