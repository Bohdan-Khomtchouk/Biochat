TITLE
Schistosoma japonicum differentially expressed gene at different development stage

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentially expressed gene of different parasite stage helps to determine which genes are likely to be the key players in transition through a developmental stage, thus help to further understand schistosome biology and host-parasite relationship, facilitate the discovery of novel gene products than could represent targets for the development of new drugs and vaccines to control schitosomiasis.Samples were analyzed at cercariae, egg and adult worm stage. Keywords = Schistosoma japonicum Keywords = different development stage Keywords = differentially expressed gene Keywords: time-course
