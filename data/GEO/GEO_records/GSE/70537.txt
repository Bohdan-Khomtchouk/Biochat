TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed mRNAs in HCSC cell lines compared with HCC cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hep3B and Huh7 are two types of human hepatoma cell lines (HCC). In our laboratory, we cultured their stem-like cancer cells (HCSCs), Hep3B-C and Huh7-C. And we have demonstrated that these cells had enhanced stem cell properties, drug resistance, properties of EMT, and stronger tumor-initiating capabilities. To explore functionally crucial mRNAs in HCSCs, 2 samples of HCSCs and 2 samples of HCCs were sequenced by the Illumina Genome Analyzer II. Through differential expression analysis, we finally identified 115 up- and 402 down-regulated miRNAs which were consistently up- and down-regulated in two stem cells compared to the cancer cells.

DESIGN
Expression analysis using total RNAs extracted from 2 HCSC cell lines (Hep3B-C and Huh7-C), and 2 HCC cell lines (Hep3B and Huh7).
