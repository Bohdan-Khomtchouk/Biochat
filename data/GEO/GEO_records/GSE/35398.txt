TITLE
Expression data from MDSCs at different time points during tumor progression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are increased by tumor-derived factors and suppress anti-tumor immunity. MDSCs obtained at a late time point after tumor injection had stronger suppressive activity than MDSCs obtained at an early time point, as measured by T cell proliferation assays. To find factors in MDSCs that change during tumor growth, we analyzed gene expression profiles from MDSCs at different time points after tumor injection.  We found that immune response-related genes were down-regulated, but pro-tumor function-related genes were up-regulated in both Mo-MDSCs and PMN-MDSCs at the late time point. Among differentially expressed genes, FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51), which is a member of the immunophilin protein family and plays a role in immunoregulation, was increased in the Mo- and PMN-MDSCs isolated from the late time points. Experiments using siRNA and a chemical inhibitor of FKBP51 revealed that FKBP51 contributes to the regulation of the suppressive function of MDSCs by increasing iNOS, ARG1, and ROS levels and enhancing NF-kappaB activity. Collectively, our data suggest that FKBP51 is a novel molecule that can be targeted to regulate the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs.

DESIGN
To identify the factors that licensed MDSCs to be more suppressive as tumors grow, we analyzed gene expression profiles in the two subsets of MDSCs at different time points (3wks, 6wks) during tumor progression. CD11b+Ly-6C(high)Ly-6G(low) Mo-MDSCs and CD11b+Ly-6C(low)Ly-6G(high) PMN-MDSCs were sorted from pooled spleens of naïve mice and Her-2/CT26 tumor-bearing mice.  Total RNA was purified and gene expression was analyzed by the Affymetrix GeneChip® Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array.
