TITLE
Gene expression in response to exposure to nitric oxide

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To analyze gene expression pattern in response to nitric oxde in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we performed microarray analysis using yeast cells treated with a nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP). S. cerevisiae S288c strain was cultured in synthetic dextrose (SD) minimal medium up to log phase (OD600 = 1), and then treated with 100 micro molar of SNAP for 10, 30, or 60 min. After treatment with SNAP, cells were disrupted adn total RNA was extracted. We commissioned following experiments to BIO MATRIX RESEARCH Inc.

DESIGN
Nitric oxide-induced gene expression in S. cerevisiae was measured at 10, 30, or 60 minutes after exposure to 100 micro molar of nitric oxide donor SNAP.
