SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to identify the Lsd1 genome binding profile in brown adipocytes. Purpose: The aim of this study is to identify the Lsd1 genome binding profile in brown adipocytes. Methods: Libraries were prepared from Lsd1-immunoprecipitated DNA according to standard methods. ChIP-seq libraries were sequenced using a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) and mapped to the mm10 reference genome using bowtie 2 (Langmead et al., 2009). Data were further analysed using the peak finding algorithm MACS 1.41 (Zhang et al., 2008) using input as control. All peaks with FDR greater than 0.3 % were excluded from further analysis. The uniquely mapped reads were used to generate the genome-wide intensity profiles, which were visualized using the IGV genome browser (Thorvaldsdottir et al., 2012). Results: HOMER (Heinz et al., 2010) was used to annotate peaks, to calculate overlaps between different peak files, and for motif searches. The genomic features (promoter, exon, intron, 3â€™ UTR, and intergenic regions) were defined and calculated using Refseq and HOMER. Genes annotated by HOMER were further used for a pathway analysis in WebGestalt (Heinz et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013). ChIP-seq analysis revealed that Lsd1 was located at the promoter of 11735 genes.

DESIGN
Lsd1 binding profile in brown adipocytes; Primary brown adipocytes were differentiated for 10 days in adipogenic medium. Cells were fixed for 5 min at room temperature according to Arrigoni et al. 2015
