TITLE
Gene microarray screening to identify glycosylation genes that are regulated during the formation of osteoclast cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone remodeling is a tightly regulated process that engages degradation and biogenesis of the bone matrix. The process is controlled by two major cell types, bone forming cells-osteoblasts and bone-degrading cells-osteoclasts. We are interested in the bone-resorption mechanism mediated by osteoclasts and wish to identify glycosylation genes that are regulated during the formation of osteoclast cells and determine the function of glycosylation and glycan-binding proteins in the osteoclastogenesis.

DESIGN
We propose to examine the gene expression patterns that are altered during the osteoclastogenesis using mouse glyco-chips and RNA samples isolated from osteoclast precursors and mature osteoclasts prepared from mouse bone marrows. 6 chips are requested for the analysis. RNA preparations from mouse bone marrow MG2, MG4, MG6 (mature osteoclasts) and MG1, MG3, MG5 osteoclasts precursors (control) were sent to the Microarray Core (E). The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays.
