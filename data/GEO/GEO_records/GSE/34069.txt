TITLE
Novel players in myogenesis identified by target validation for muscle specific microRNAs in C2C12 myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Search of novel miR-206 target genes in C2C12 cells, based on differential expression of transcripts containing putative miR-206 binding sites. miR-206 candidate target genes were hpothesized to be upregulated in AM206 vs Day2 sample and downregulated in siRNA vs Day 1 sample.

DESIGN
total RNA extracted from various differentiation stages of C2C12 cells, as well as cells treated with miR-206 mimic or miR-206 inhibitor

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
