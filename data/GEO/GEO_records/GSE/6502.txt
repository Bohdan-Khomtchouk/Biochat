TITLE
B.thetaiotaomicron wt versus KO2923, 10% tryptone

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

SUMMARY
Genome wide transcriptional comparison of B. thetaiotaomicron wild type vs. an isogenic mutant (BT2923::pGERM). Wt or BT2923::pGERM grown in 10% tryptone medium were profiled in duplicate at mid-log and stationary time points. Keywords: wild type versus knockout, in vitro timepoints

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from bacteria harvested from growths in 10% tryptone medium and hybridized to B. thetaiotaomicron GeneChips.
