TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of human neural crest cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression profiles of five human trunk level neural crest cell lines were determined on Affymetrix chips HG U133 Plus 2.0.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from a confluent 10 cm dish of hNCC (lines N1-N5) from five human embryos at 26-32 dpf (Carnegie stages 12 & 13).
