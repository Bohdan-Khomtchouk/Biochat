TITLE
Transcriptomic signatures in whole blood of patients who suffer a Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) as a result of exposure to the marine toxin ciguatoxin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study compares the transcriptional profiles of 11 patients with ciguatera induced Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome to 11 normal controls using whole blood perserved in PAXgene blood collection tubes and Agilent whole genome microarrays. In our analysis, we found nearly 200 genes significantly, differentially expressed in patients compared to controls.

DESIGN
Gene expression of normal controls was compared to ciguatera fish poisoning patients using whole genome microarrays with technical replicates for each sample.
