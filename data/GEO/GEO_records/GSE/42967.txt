TITLE
Wild-type Zebrafish subjected to swim-training

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Genome-wide microarray analysis of the effects of swim-training on zebrafish larval development. Zebrafish were subjected to swim-training from 5 days post fertilization (dpf) until 10  dpf. Subsequently, we performed a genome-wide microarray analysis of trained and control fish at 10 dpf. The goal of the project was to investigate the effects of swim-training on the gene expression level during zebrafish larval development

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: control vs trained fish. RNA was isolated from 10 control fish and from 10 trained fish. Subsequently, each sample was labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 in order to correct for dye bias. Control-Cy3 and Trained-Cy5 were hybridized on array 1 and Trained-Cy5 and Control-Cy3 were hybridized on array 2.
