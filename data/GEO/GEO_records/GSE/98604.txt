TITLE
Effects of dominant-negative G784E Smarca4 mutation on enhancer marks and factors in mouse embryonic stem cells [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the chromatin effects of a Smarca4 ATPase mutant observed in primary tumors and cancer cell lines. Compared to cells expressing only wild-type Smarca4, heterozygous expression of G784E Smarca4 mutant led to reduction of H3K27ac and RNAP at a set of enhancer sites.

DESIGN
Examination of genomic H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and RNAP2 occupancy using ChIP-seq in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing heterozygous mutations of the BAF subunit Smarca4. Cells express wild-type Smarca4-GFP and either wild-type or mutants of Smarca4-V5. Filenames and descriptions of Smarca4 in this dataset refer to the status of the Smarca4-V5 fusion in these cells.
