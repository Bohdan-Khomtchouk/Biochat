TITLE
Prolonged halting of gene expression in early G1 arrest by inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 reprograms myeloma cells for cytotoxic killing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By selective and reversible inhibition of CDK4/CDK6, we have developed a strategy to both inhibit proliferation and enhance cytotoxic killing of cancer cells.  Induction of prolonged early-G1 arrest (pG1) by CDK4/CDK6 inhibition halts gene expression in early-G1 and prevents expression of genes programmed for other cell cycle phases.  S-phase synchronization upon removal of the early-G1 block (pG1-S) fails to completely restore scheduled gene expression.  Consequently, coordinate loss of IRF4 and gain of Bim and Noxa expression sensitize myeloma tumor cells to bortezomib-induced apoptosis in pG1 and more profoundly in pG1-S in vitro.  Induction of pG1 and pG1-S by CDK4/CDK6 inhibition augments tumor-specific bortezomib killing in myeloma xenografts.  Inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 in combination therapy thus represents a novel mechanism-based cancer therapy.

DESIGN
PD 0332991 (PD) is the only known specific and reversible CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor. Gene expression was measured in myeloma MM1.S cells treated with PD (0.25 uM) in triplicate for 12, 24 or 36 h, or in cells released from G1, induced by 24hPD, for 4 or 18 h.
