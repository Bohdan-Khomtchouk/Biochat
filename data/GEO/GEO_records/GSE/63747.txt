TITLE
Role of Tet1 and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in cocaine action (5hmC-Seq and ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we show that Tet1 is down-regulated in mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward structure, by repeated cocaine administration which enhances behavioral responses to cocaine. Through genome-wide 5hmC profiling, we identified 5hmC changes selectively clustered in both enhancer and coding regions of genes with several annotated neural functions. By coupling with mRNA sequencing, we found cocaine-induced alterations in 5hmC correlate positively with alternative splicing. We also demonstrated that 5hmC alteration at certain genes lasts up to a month after cocaine exposure.

DESIGN
DNA Nac samples were collected at various time points after 7 daily cocaoine ip administration for 5hmC and transcriptome analysis
