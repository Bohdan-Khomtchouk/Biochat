TITLE
miRNA expression in the spleen of C57BL mice, p53-knockout C57BL mice, and NO2-knockout C57BL mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of the study is to assess whether inflammation-induced oxidative and nitrosative stress modulates miRNA expression in mouse model deficient in either p53 or NOS2

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from the spleen of C57BL mice (WT, NOS2 knockout, and p53 knockout) that were C. Parvum treated or saline control treated. 4 or 5 mice were utilized for each grouping.

PLATFORM
