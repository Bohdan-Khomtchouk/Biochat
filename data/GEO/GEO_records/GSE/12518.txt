TITLE
Differential expression profile between MNV-1 infected and mock-infected RAW 264.7 cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Noroviruses have been widely recognized for their importance as causative agents of non-bacterial gastroenteritis. Mouse norovirus is the only representative of the norovirus genus, family Caliciviridae, able to grow in cell culture. The aim of this study is to describe the differences in the expression profiles of MNV-1 and mock-infected macrophages (RAW 264.7 cells), in order to better understand the response of the host cell to norovirus infection.

DESIGN
This study compares two type of samples (MNV-infected and mock-infected RAW cells) in biological triplicates respectively. The MNV stock used for infection was obtained in the same cell line, and purified with a sucrose cushion in order to account for expression changes caused by virus infection only.
