TITLE
Small RNAs from sweet potato upon wounding

ORGANISM
Ipomoea batatas

SUMMARY
Small RNAs (sRNAs) play important roles in plants encountering stress environments. However, limited research has been conducted on the sRNAs involved in plant wound responses. To identify potential roles for the wounding-related sRNAs, sRNA deep sequencing was used. After leaves were wounded for 0.5 hour, total RNAs from unwounded and wounded leaves were isolated for sRNA library construction. The Illumina platform was used to sequence sRNA libraries. About 12 million sequence reads were obtained for each sample.

DESIGN
Examination of sweet potato leaves with either unwound or wound treatment

PLATFORM
GPL17085 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Ipomoea batatas)
