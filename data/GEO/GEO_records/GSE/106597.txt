TITLE
ChIP-chip analyses of PR- related pathway in human oncocytic thyroid tumor cell line XTC.UC1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-chip analyses of five transcription factors (ERR1, GABP, NRF1, CREB and YY1)  PRC coactivator and RNA polymerase II in XTC.UC1 cells compared to non specific IP (IgG or input) seven factors studied: ERR1, GABP, NRF1, CREB, YY1, PRC, RNAPolII

DESIGN
10% of Serum induction for XTC.UC1 cells during 24h and 48h before ChIP chip analysis using  antibodies against transcription factors , PRC transcriptionnal coactivator and RNApolymerase II

PLATFORM
GPL8167 Agilent Human Promoter ChIP-on-Chip Set 244K, combined Microarray (slides 1 and 2) HG17 build
