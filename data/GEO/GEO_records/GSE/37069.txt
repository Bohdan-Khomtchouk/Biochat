TITLE
Gene response to major burn injuries

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Blood was sampled from severe burns patients over time as well as healthy subjects. Genome-wide expression analyses were conducted using the Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 GeneChip™. The Inflammation and the Host Response to Injury Large-Scale Collaborative Research Program

DESIGN
Blood was sampled from 244 severe burns patients over time as well as 35 healthy subjects who consented to blood sampling. Study subjects were treated under standard operating procedures to minimize treatment variations. Patients had burns covering > 20% of the total body surface area and were admitted within 96 hours of injury.  Genome-wide expression analyses were conducted using the Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 GeneChip™.
