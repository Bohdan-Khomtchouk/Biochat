TITLE
Staphylococcus epidermidis: wild type vs lytSR mutant

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus epidermidis

SUMMARY
The custom-made S. epidermidis GeneChips(Shanghai Biochip Co., Ltd) included qualifiers representing open reading frame (ORF) sequences identified in the genomes of the S. epidermidis strain RP62A, as well as unique ORFs in S. epidermidis strain 12228. The GeneChips were composed of cDNA array containing PCR products of 2316 genes and oligonucleotide array containing 252 genes.Two-component regulatory systems (TCSs) play a pivotal role in bacterial adaptation, survival, and virulence by sensing changes in the external environment and modulating gene expression in response to a variety of stimuli.To investigate the regulatory role of LytSR, one of the TCSs identified in the genomes of S. epidermidis, we used the GeneChips to perform a transcriptional profile analysis of the wild strain and lytSR mutant.

DESIGN
Wild type untreated in triplicate is compared to lytSR mutant in triplicate for cDNA array and four replicates on the oligo array.
