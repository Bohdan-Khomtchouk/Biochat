TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of condensin II knockdown cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Condensin complexes are highly conserved for chromosome compaction to ensure their faithful segregation in mitosis. Condensin II is present in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle, including interphase. The aim of these experiments is to investigate the changes of gene expression in knockdown of NCAPH2, a condensin II subunit, in mouse embryonic stem cells compared to their control cells.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression of controls and NCAPH2 knockdown cells by RNA-seq
