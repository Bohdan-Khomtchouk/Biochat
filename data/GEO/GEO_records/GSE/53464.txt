TITLE
Gene expression profiles of ovarian cancer cells by inhibiting Hh signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of  gene expression levels in response to inhibition of Hh signaling in ovarian cancer cells using a cDNA microarray technique. Results suggest that  208 genes (50.5%) were up-regulated and 204 gene (49.5%) were down-regulated after GANT61 treatment.The focal adhesion and ECM-receptor interaction cross-talk in SKOV3 cells after treatment with GANT61, and the expression change of “focal adhesion” related genes play an important role in the processes of response to GANT61-treatment.

DESIGN
SKOV3 cells were treated with GANT61 (20 μM for 60 hr) and control vehicle DMSO, respectively.
