TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the Salmonella enterica OmpR regulon

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 wild type and ompR mutant grown to mil-exponential phase in LB. The goal was to define the ompR-regulated genes.

DESIGN
Two strains (wild type, ompR mutant), 4 biological replicates of each. Each sample was hybridised in a two-channel hybridization against Salmonella genomic DNA as the comparator/reference, which also acted as a control for spot quality.
