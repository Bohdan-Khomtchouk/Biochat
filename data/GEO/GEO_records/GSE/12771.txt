TITLE
Lung cancer prediction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated a blood-derived transcriptional signature that discriminates patients with lung cancer from non-affected smokers. When applied to blood samples from one of the largest prospective population-based cancer studies (the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition), this signature accurately predicted the occurrence of lung cancer in smokers within two years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Such a blood test could be used as a screening tool to enable early diagnosis of lung cancer at a curable stage.
