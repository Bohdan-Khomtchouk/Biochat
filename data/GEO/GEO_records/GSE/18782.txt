TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling in adult mouse liver following benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) treatment [Exiqon miRNA array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lack of change in microRNA expression in adult mouse liver following treatment with benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), as detected using Exiqon miRNA arrays. Adult male mice were exposed to 150 mg/kg benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) or solvent for 3 days and sampled 4 hours after the last dose. MicroRNA expression levels in adult mouse liver were measured using Exiqon miRNA arrays. Our results indicate a distinct lack of effect of BaP of miRNA expression, despite widespread changes in mRNA levels (measured using Agilent arrays). Lack of miRNA changes was confirmed with Agilent miRNA arrays. Keywords: Toxicology, miRNA

DESIGN
Adult male B6C3F1 mice were exposed to a daily dose of corn oil (vehicle control group) or 150 mg/kg BaP (treatment group) for 3 d (n=6 per group). Mice were sacrificed at 4 h or 24 h following the last dose and liver lobes were extracted and flash frozen. Exiqon miRNA arrays were used to examine changes in miRNA transcript levels in random liver lobe sections.
