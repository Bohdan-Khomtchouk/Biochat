TITLE
Regulation of gene expression in serotype M1 group A Strep (GAS, aka S. pyogenes) by RocA

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
We used RNA-Seq to assess whether the rocA gene regulates gene expression in M1 GAS

DESIGN
Parental M1 isolate MGAS2221, rocA mutant derivative 2221ΔrocA, and the chromosomally complemented derivative 2221ΔrocAComp were compared following THY growth by RNA-Seq

PLATFORM
GPL20656 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Streptococcus pyogenes)
