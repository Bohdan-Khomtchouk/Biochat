TITLE
Expression data from Human Tax transfected HeLa cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax is potent activator of viral and cellular gene expression that interacts with a number of cellular proteins. In this study, a large-scale host cell signaling events related to cellular proliferation were used to identify genes involved in Tax-mediated cell signaling events related to cellular proliferation and apoptosis.

DESIGN
HeLa cell transiently transfected with with pCAGGS vector for control sample was compared with HeLa cell transiently transfected with with pCAGGS-Tax-FLAG vector. These cells were incubated for 30h after transfection and were used for total RNA isolation.
