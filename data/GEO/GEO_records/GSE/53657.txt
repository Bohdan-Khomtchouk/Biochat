TITLE
Bovine nose tissues: Yellow nose vs. Black nose

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The coat color of mammals is determined by the melanogenesis pathway, which is responsible for maintaining the balance between black-brown eumelanin and yellow-reddish phaeomelanin. It is also believed that the color of the bovine nose is regulated in a similar manner; however, the molecular mechanism underlying pigment deposition in the black nose has yet to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to identify melanogenesis-associated genes that are differentially expressed in the black vs. yellow nose of native Korean cows.
