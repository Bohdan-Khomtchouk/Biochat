TITLE
Expression data from Human CD40L+ Tcells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess the nature of CD8+CD40L+ memory Tcells, we compared the gene expression to CD8+CD40L- and CD4+ counterparts, and found similarities in expression of genes encoding cytokines

DESIGN
PBMCs were isolated from five healthy donors. The cells were stimulated with PMA/Ionomycin for 6 h, and subsequently sorted into the CD4+CD45RA-CD40L+, CD8+CD45RA-CD40L-, CD8+CD45RA-CD40L+ populations by FACS-sort
