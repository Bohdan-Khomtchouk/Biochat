TITLE
Ablation of the epithelial-specific splicing factor Esrp1 results in ureteric branching defects and reduced nephron number

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Evaluation of splicing in ureteric epithelium in Esrp1;Esrp2 double knockout mice compared to Esrp1+/+;Esrp2-/- control mice.

DESIGN
Ureteric epithelial cells were isolated from E18.5 embryos using FITC-DBA lectin and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)

PLATFORM
