Melphalan-treated human retinal endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Super-selective intra-ophthalmic artery chemotherapy (SSIOAC) is an organ-specific drug-delivery strategy to treat retinoblastoma, the most common primary ocular malignancy in children. Unfortunately, recent clinical reports associate adverse vascular toxicities with SSIOAC using melphalan, the most commonly used chemotherapeutic. To explore the reason for the unexpected vascular toxicities, we have developed in vitro studies with human retinal endothelial cells to test the effects of the chemotherapeutics and a non-human primate model to monitor the SSIOAC treatment in real-time and post-treatment. Melphalan and carboplatin (another chemotherapeutic used to treat retinoblastoma via SSIOAC) triggered migration, proliferation, and apoptosis when used to treat human retinal endothelial cells. Melphalan was associated with increased adhesion of leukocytes to human retinal endothelial cells, and tended to increase with increased cell expression of adhesion proteins (ICAM-1) and soluble chemotactic factors (IL-8). Histopathology post-SSIOAC indicated vessel wall sloughing, leukostasis, and vessel occlusion. We have established an in vitro human cell culture model and a non-human primate model to evaluate strategies designed to obviate vascular side effects, and optimize the efficacy of SSIAOC and the drug preparations used in SSIOAC.

DESIGN
4 non-treated (MNT) vs. 4 melphalan-treated primary human retinal endothelial cells (RECs).
