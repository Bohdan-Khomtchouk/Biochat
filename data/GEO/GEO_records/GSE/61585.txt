TITLE
Retinoids induce rapid dynamic changes in the non-coding RNAs and epigenetic profiles of murine Hox clusters (tiling)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Physiologically relevant concentrations of retinoic acid are added to Mouse ES cells and a time course (0-72 hours) is examined with expression tiling arrays to characterize the early dynamics of expression of coding and non-coding RNAs in and around the Hox clusters.

DESIGN
Gene expression is examined at various timepoints (0-72 hrs) after retinoic acid induced neuronal differentiation
