TITLE
Global transcriptomic profiling of permanent focal ischemia in an in vivo rat model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Focal ischemia is triggered by the sudden significant reduction of blood supply to the brain, as a result of either the rupture or occlusion by thrombus/embolism of a blood vessel in the brain. Permanent focal ischemia occurred when blood supply to a specific part of the brain is impeded without reperfusion. Despite major steps achieved in the elucidation of the patho-physiology of cerebral ischemia, the available therapeutic avenues for acute ischemic stroke remain scarce. Cell cycle re-activation has been revealed as a novel signaling pathway during permanent focal ischemia. As such, non-specific aurora kinase inhibitor ZM447439, has been injected intracranial-ventricularly30min post-ischemia induction to determine its efficacy in reduction of neuronal damage in terms of infarct volume.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed on Illumina Rat Ref12V1 beadchips. Right cortex RNA samples were collected at two time-points (8h and 24h ) respectively for all three experimental conditions: Sham (n=4), vehicle (i.e. ischemic injury with i.c.v. injection 80% DMSO; n=4) and treatment (injury plusi.c.v.injection of 30mM ZM447439 in 80% DMSO; n=4).
