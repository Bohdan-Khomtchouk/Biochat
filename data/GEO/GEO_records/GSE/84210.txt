TITLE
BET inhibitors suppress BZLF1 expression [MutuI DNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Human gammaherpesvirus 4

SUMMARY
Lytic infection by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) poses numerous health risks, such as infectious mononucleosis and lymphoproliferative disorder. We demonstrate that JQ1 and other BET inhibitors block two different steps in the sequential cascade of the EBV life cycle: expression of the immediate-early gene BZLF1 and lytic genome replication. This represents a novel mode of action for antiviral drugs that may increase efficacy and decrease emergence of resistance. The sequenced total DNA data in this series show that JQ1 causes a decrease in EBV genome replication upon antibody induction.

DESIGN
Total DNA-seq from MutuI pretreated with JQ1 or vehicle, treated with antibody or vehicle, experiment performed in triplicate

PLATFORM
GPL22131 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens; Human herpesvirus 4)
