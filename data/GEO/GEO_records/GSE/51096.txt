TITLE
RNA sequencing of Kineococcus radiotolerans transcriptome in response to ionizing radiation

ORGANISM
Kineococcus radiotolerans

SUMMARY
In this study, approximately 36 and 29 million raw reads of two samples, namely radiation treated strain and its untreated control, are acquired from the sequencing platform. And 143 genes are screened out with the differential expression (DE) analysis.

DESIGN
Investigation of the differential expression between the radiation reduced sample and the wild-type sample in control.

PLATFORM
GPL17751 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Kineococcus radiotolerans)
