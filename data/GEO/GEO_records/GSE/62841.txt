TITLE
Evolution of phenotypic plasticity and transgenerational effects of heat stress in the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis remanei

SUMMARY
Analysis of evolved changes in transcriptional plasticity and parental effects on plasticity induced by mild heat stress in the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei. Results of this study highlight the importance of the broad environmental context of an organism and its influence on phenotypic plasticity, parental effects, and evolutionary responses.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of ancestral and two experimentally evolved populations of C. remanei. Parents of the sampled worms were raised at either 20°C or 30°C, then the resulting embryos were divided and reared at either 20°C or 30°C prior to collection (as L1 larvae). 6 replicates/larval temperature for each population if the parents were raised at 20°C, and 2 replicates/larval temperature for each population if the parents were raised at 30°C.
