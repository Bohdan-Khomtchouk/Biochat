TITLE
A family of double-homeodomain transcription factors promotes zygotic genome activation in placental mammals [ChIP-seq_d1]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In metazoans, the fertilized embryo is transcriptionally mostly silent for a few cell divisions, until release of a first major wave of embryonic transcripts by so-called zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Maternally provided ZGA-triggering factors have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster and Danio rerio but their mammalian homologues are still undefined. Here, we reveal that DUX family transcription factors are key to this process in human and mouse. First, human Dux4 and murine Dux are expressed prior to ZGA in both species. Second, both orthologues bind to and activate the promoters of ZGA genes. Third, Dux knockdown hinders the progression of mouse embryos beyond the 2-cell stage. Fourth, it prevents the cycling of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells through a 2-cell-like state whereas, conversely, Dux overexpression induces the accumulation of these ZGA genes-expressing ES cells. We conclude that DUX proteins are master regulators of mammalian ZGA.

DESIGN
ChIP-sequencing analysis of DUX4 ectopically expressed in human embryonic stem cells
