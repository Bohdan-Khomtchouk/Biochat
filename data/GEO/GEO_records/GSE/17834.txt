TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Geobacter sulfurreducens grown with different nitrogen sources

ORGANISM
Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA

SUMMARY
Investigation of comprehensive information about the expression level of RNA transcripts across the entire G.sulfurreducens genome with different nitrogen sources, including NH3, Gln, Asp and N2.

DESIGN
A twelve chip study using total RNA recovered from four separate culture conditions of G.Sulfurreducens.  G.Sulfurreducens PCA were harvested at mid-exponential phase. The high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays used were consisted of 381,174 oligonucleotide probes spaced 20 bp apart (30-bp overlap between two probes) across the G.sulfurreducens genome (NimbleGen). Experiments were conducted as three bioliogical replicates (different cultures)
