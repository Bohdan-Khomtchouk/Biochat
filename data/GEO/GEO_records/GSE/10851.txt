TITLE
Gene differential expression between attachment and detachment of zebra mussel

ORGANISM
Dreissena polymorpha

SUMMARY
A zebra mussel byssus cDNA microarray was used to identify the differentially expressed genes between attachment and detachment. Keywords: Gene differential expression

DESIGN
The zebra mussels were divided in to two groups: AT and DT. In group AT all the zebra mussels were kept in the water attached for 48 hours while in group DT, the individuals were kept detached underwater for 48 hours. The feet of the zebra mussels were taken from each group. Four replicates, including four individual feet each replicate, were taken from each group for total RNA extraction. Four microarray hybridization performed between AT and DE. In each group, two cDNA replicates were labeled with Alexa 555 while the other two were labeled with Alexa 647. Every hybridization happened between two cDNA samples from different group with different labels.
