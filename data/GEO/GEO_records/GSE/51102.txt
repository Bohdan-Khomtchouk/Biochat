TITLE
Autoimmune antigen and serum factor antigen reactivity in a cohort of patients with mycobacterium infection shown previously to be positive and negative for IgG autoantibodies to IFN-gamma.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to test wether our microarray platform is capable of detecting previously described IgG autoantibodies to IFN-gamma. We diluted patient sera 1:250 and incubated dilutions on a nitrocellulose-platform array printed with whole protein antigens.

DESIGN
In this study, serum from 10 individuals (subsetted into two groups: individuals positive or negative for previously described IFN-gamma-targeted autoantibodies) was profiled for IgG autoantibody reactivity to whole protein autoimmune and serum factor antigens. We found that IFN-gamma-targeted IgG autoantibodies were recognized in the IFNg-pos samples and also identified other array targets significantly associated with anti-IFNg positive individials using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) algorithm.
