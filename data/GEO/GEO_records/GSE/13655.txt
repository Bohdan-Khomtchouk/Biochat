TITLE
Ocean acidification alters skeleton formation in larvae of the sea urchin Lytechinus pictus

ORGANISM
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus

SUMMARY
Using standard morphometric methods and gene expression profiling with a DNA microarray, we explored the impacts of high CO2 conditions on development of the sea urchin, Lytechinus pictus, a pelagic larvae that forms a calcium carbonate endoskeleton. Larvae were raised from fertilization to pluteus stage in seawater with elevated CO2 conditions based upon IPCC emissions scenarios B1 (540ppm CO2) and A1FI (970ppm CO2).
