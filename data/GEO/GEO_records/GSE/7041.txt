TITLE
Expression data from Rat lungs

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We sought to confirm the genetic influence in the development of Ventilation-Associated Lung Injury (VALI) and, in the process, identify potential candidate genes involved in the disease by integrating differential gene expression profiling on rat lungs to a traditional strain survey analysis of the parental rat strains, VALI-sensitive Brown Norway rats versus VALI-resistant Dahl Salt Sensitive rats, comparing control (under room air ventilation) versus under high tidal volume (HTV) ventilation. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying VALI susceptibility and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: strain-condition analysis

DESIGN
Rat lungs (Right lungs) from both sets of parents under the two conditions (control vs. HTV ventilation) were isolated for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
