TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) under drought stress in leaf tissue.

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis in cotton under drought stress. To study the molecular response of drought stress in cotton under field condition global gene expression analysis was carried out in leaf tissue. Gossypium hirsutum cv. Bikaneri Nerma was used for the gene expression analysis. Cotton plants were subjected to drought stress at peak flowering stage. Leaf samples were collected when the soil moisture content was 19.5% which is 50% of the normal control plots. Gene expression profiles in drought induced and their respective control samples were analyzed using Affymertix cotton Genechip Genome arrays to study the global changes in the expression of genome.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from leaf tissue. Samples were collected from both drought induced and control plants. Biotin labeled cRNA was hybridized on Affymertix cotton Genechip Genome array following the Affymetrix protocols. Three biological replicates were maintained.
