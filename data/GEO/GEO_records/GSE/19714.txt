TITLE
Chromosomal aberrations of human bladder cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify putative targets in human bladder cancer (BC) cell lines, a survey of parallel chromosomal alterations and gene expression studies in 5 BC cell lines were performed using array-CGH and microarray techniques. Predominantly gained loci were observed at 1q21.3, 8q24.2, 8q24.3, 11q13.3, and 20q13.33 in four or more of the cell lines. The focus was on the typical gain locus of 8q24.3, which has not been studied in detail for BC.

DESIGN
Genomic DNAs from 5 cell lines and normal diploid cells were subjected to array CGH analysis to identify genomic alterations in the each cell lines. These DNAs were labeled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively.
