TITLE
Gene expression profiling of 151 pediatric low-grade gliomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression profiling on 151 paraffin-embedded PLGGs from different locations, ages, histological subtypes as well as BRAF genetic status We also compared molecular differences to normal pediatric brain expression profiles to observe whether those patterns were mirrored in normal brain expression.

DESIGN
We analyzed the expression of 6,100 genes among 151 FFPE pediatric and 15 FFPE adult low-grade gliomas and analyzed how the expression patterns changes with location, age, histology and BRAF genomic status and how those differences were mirrored in normal brain expression. The values in the sample 'characteristics' columns represent; Location; SUP= Supratentorial, INF= Infratentorial Histology; PA= pilocytic astrocytoma, GG= ganglioglioma, DNT= dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, OD= oligodendroglial tumors, NOS= not otherwise specified tumors BRAF status; DUP= BRAF duplication, MUT= BRAF V600E mutation, WT= wild type, ND= not determined Primary or recurrent tumor; P=primary, R=recurrent Primary tumor that further progressed; 1=yes, 0=no, _=recurrent tumors only
