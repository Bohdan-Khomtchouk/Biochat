TITLE
N-acetylgalactosamine Mediated Regulation of the aga Operon by AgaR in Streptococcus pneumoniae

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae D39

SUMMARY
Three Microarray comparisons have been preformed in this study. 1-  Transcriptome comparison of the Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 wild type grown in M17 medium + 0.5 % (w/v) NAGa (NAGaM17) to  M17 medium + 0.5 % (w/v) glucose (GM17) (GSM2372597 and GSM2372598). 2- Transcriptome comparison of the Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 ΔagaR to D39 wild type grown in M17 medium + 0.5 % (w/v) glucose (GM17) (GSM2372599 and GSM2372600). 3- Transcriptome comparison of the Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 ΔccpA to D39 wild type grown in M17 medium + 0.5 % (w/v) NAGa (NAGaM17) (GSM2290636 and GSM2290637).

DESIGN
- Two conditions design comparison of one strain including a dye swap or Microarray comparisons 1. - One condition design comparision of two strains including a dye swap for Microarray comparisons 2 and 3.
