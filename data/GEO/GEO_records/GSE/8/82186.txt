TITLE
Gene expression analysis of mouse E9.5 presomitic mesoderm wt vs TCre/+;Taf10flox/flox

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) were microdissected from E9.5 mouse embryos (WT and TCre/+;Taf10flox/flox). 3 PSM (17-19 somites stage) were pooled per microarray, in triplicates, per genotypes
