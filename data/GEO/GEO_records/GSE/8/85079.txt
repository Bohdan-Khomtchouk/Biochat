TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling of Neofusicoccum parvum virulence factors in response to different growth substrates in vitro and during an interaction time course with grapevine stems

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing determined the genome-wide patterns of expression of N. parvum virulence factors when PDA or grape wood were provided as nutrient source and during an extensive interaction time course with grapevine stem.

DESIGN
N. parvum UCD646So (ATCC number: MYA-3706) was grown on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) or agar containing ground grapevine wood (V. vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon clone FPS 08 and V. vinifera cv. Merlot clone FPS 03). Potted V. vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon clone FPS 19 plants were inoculated with N. parvum UCD646So mycelia. Stems were collected at seven time points: 0 hour post-inoculation (hpi), 3 hpi, 24 hpi, 2 weeks post-inoculation (wpi), 6 wpi, 8 wpi, and 12 wpi from 1 cm below the inoculation site. Three biological replicates were collected from each medium and for each infection time point.
