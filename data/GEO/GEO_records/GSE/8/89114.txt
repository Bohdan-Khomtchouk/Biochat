TITLE
Deregulation of lncRNAs by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Deregulation of host lncRNAs following infection with Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) was assessed. Total RNA was prepared from uninfected TIVE cells (telomerase-immortalized vein endothelial cells), and from TIVE cells latently infected with either wild-type KSHV or with a deletion mutant (Δcluster-KSHV) lacking ten of the twelve KSHV microRNA genes. The RNA was converted to labeled cRNA and used to probe a human lncRNA microarray. The goal was to investigate which host lncRNAs were either up- or down-regulated during latent infection with KSHV, and to determine if deregulation of host lncRNAs was dependent on KSHV miRNAs.

DESIGN
One biological replicate of each of mock infected, wtKSHV-infected and Δcluster-KSHV infected cells was used. Three technical replicates were performed for each.
