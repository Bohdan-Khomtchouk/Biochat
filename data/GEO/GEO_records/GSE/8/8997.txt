TITLE
XX hour expression data of AM from C57Bl/6 or gp91phox-/- mice following exposure to conidia or polystyrene beads

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The response of AM transcription to exposure to conidia is expected to provide information about the mechanism by which these cells prevent conidial germination and therefore invasive aspergillosis. Keywords: timecourse comparison with mock bead and conidia
