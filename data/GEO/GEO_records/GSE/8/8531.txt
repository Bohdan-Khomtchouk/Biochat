TITLE
Profiling Motility Signal-Induced Genes in Human Keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In an acute skin wound, newly released serum growth factors in the wound bed drive lateral migration of human keratinocytes (HKs) to re-epithelialize the wound. However, profiling the migration signal-specific genes has long been challenged by pleiotropic effects of a given growth factor, including proliferation, migration and factor-specific responses. To overcome these technical problems, we 1)  took advantage of a unique response of HKs to transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) to selectively suppress growth signal-responding genes and identify motility-specific genes and 2) employed dual stimulation of HKs with TGFalpha and insulin to identify the common genes and eliminate factor-specific genes. Under these conditions, DNA microarray analyses were utilized to study the profiles of both TGFalpha-regualted and insulin-regulated immediate early (IE, 30 min), early (E, 60 min) and delayed early (DE, 120 min) genes. Keywords: time course, growth factor response
