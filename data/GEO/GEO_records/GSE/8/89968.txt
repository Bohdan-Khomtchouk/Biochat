TITLE
Genome-wide SNP Profiling of 27 Neuroblastoma Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used SNP arrays to perform genome-wide profiling of commonly-used neuroblastoma cell lines.

DESIGN
Cells were cultured, pelleted, and DNA was extracted as below. DNA was used according to the manufacturer's guidelines in a genome-wide SNP array.
