TITLE
SETBP1-WT and SETBP1-G870S transcriptional profiles [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq experiments on SETBP1-G870S and Empty cells was performed in order to assess if the presence of mutated SETBP1 may induce differential RNA expression.

DESIGN
n=6: 2 conditions, namely SETBP1-WT and SETBP1-G870S, in triplicate
