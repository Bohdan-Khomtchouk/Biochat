TITLE
Disabled-2 is a negative immune regulator of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Toll-like receptor 4 internalization and signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a pivotal role in the host response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria. Here we elucidated whether the endocytic adaptor protein Disabled-2 (Dab2) that is abundantly expressed in the macrophages plays a role in LPS-stimulated TLR4 signaling and trafficking. Molecular analysis and transcriptome profiling of the RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells expressing short-hairpin RNA of Dab2 revealed that Dab2 mainly regulated LPS-stimulated TRIF-dependent, but not MyD88-dependent TLR4 signaling. Consequently, knockdown of Dab2 augmented TRIF-dependent interferon regulatory factor 3 activation and the expression for the subsets of inflammatory cytokines and interferon-inducible genes. We further delineated that Dab2 acted as a “clathrin sponge” and sequestered clathrin from TLR4/MD2 complex in the resting stage of macrophages. Clathrin was released from Dab2 and associated with TLR4 to facilitate the internalization of TLR4/MD2 complex together with the bound ligand from the cell surface upon LPS stimulation. Dab2 thereby functions as a negative immune regulator of TLR4 endocytosis and signaling, supporting a novel role of Dab2-associated regulatory circuit in the control of inflammatory response of macrophage to endotoxin.

DESIGN
In this study, RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells expressing short-hairpin RNA of Dab2 revealed that Dab2 mainly regulated LPS-stimulated TRIF-dependent, but not MyD88-dependent TLR4 signaling upon LPS stimulation.
