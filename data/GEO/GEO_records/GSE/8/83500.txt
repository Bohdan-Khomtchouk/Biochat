TITLE
Expression data from aortic wall between myocardial infarction (MI) and non-MI group

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aortic wall of patients with ischemic heart disease may have an indicative characteristic of mRNA predictive of future cardiovascular events. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
Ascending aortic wall punch biopsies obtained as a standard part of coronary artery bypass surgery, will be used as a novel approach to study the vessel wall of patients with atherosclerosis. A total of 37 (17 MI, 20 Non-MI) frozen aortic tissues  were embedded in TissueTek optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (TissueTek; Sakura Finetek USA). The embedded aortic tissues were trimmed and sectioned to a thickness of 10µm and placed on an RNase-free Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN) membrane slide (Carl Zeiss; Germany). Haematoxylin and eosin staining (H & E) was also performed to establish the correct orientation of the embedded aortic tissue.  Each slide containing frozen aortic sections was stained with Arcturus Histogene LCM Frozen Section Staining Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol to enhance the visibility of VSMCs – elongated and spindle-shaped. LCM was performed immediately upon completion of staining using the LMPC technology in MicroBeam system (PALM microlaser, Carl Zeiss). The dissected VSMCs were scraped into a microcentrifuge tube containing 100µL of ice-cold TRI Reagent® (Molecular Research Centre, USA), with 19G sterile needles and freeze down in dry ice. Total RNA was isolated from VSMCs with Tri Reagent® (Molecular Research Centre) following manufacturer’s protocol and amplified with Ovation FFPE WTA System (NuGEN Technologies).
