TITLE
Temporal gene expression of human-fetal and glioblastoma stem cell cultures under directed differentiation conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary glioblastoma (GBM) cultures vary with respect to differentiation competency. We sought to identify putative transcription factors necessary for the differentiation of GBM cultures. In this dataset, we include expression data obtained from 2 human-fetal neural stem cell  (HF-NS) cultures and 2 GBM stem cell (GSC) cultures. We assessed changes in gene expression from 3 timepoints during an in vitro differentiation protocol.

DESIGN
Exon microarray analysis of 12 samples total were performed. 2 HFNS cultures and 2 GNS cultures were analyzed at acute timepoints during directed differentiation (days 0, 2, and 9).
