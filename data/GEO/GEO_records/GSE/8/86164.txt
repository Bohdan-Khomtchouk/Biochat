TITLE
p53 ChIP-seq in Nutlin-treated HCT116, MCF7, and SJSA cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genomic loci occupied by p53, we performed p53 ChIP-seq analysis of colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116, breast carcinoma line MCF7, and osteosarcoma line SJSA treated with MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin.

DESIGN
HCT116, MCF7, and SJSA cells were treated with either DMSO or Nutlin for 12 hours. Samples from formaldehyde cross-linked cells were subjected to chromatin immunnoprecipitation and recovered DNA was sequenced.
