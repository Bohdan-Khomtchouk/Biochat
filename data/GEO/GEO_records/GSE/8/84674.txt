TITLE
Array-CGH for cell lines derived from paired primary and metastatic tumor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characterization of DNA copy number changes in cell line derived from patient using DNA microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization method. Our study identified genomic alterations between primary and metastatic tumor within a single individual

DESIGN
Two samples: HN137 metastatic cell line and HN137 primary cell line. One replicate per sample. Reference sample: HN137 blood
