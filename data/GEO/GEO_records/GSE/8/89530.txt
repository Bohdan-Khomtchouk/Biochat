TITLE
RNA-SEQ analysis of bdf1-Y187F-Y354F mutant strain during yeast sporulation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to compare NGS-derived yeast transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) of wild-type and bdf1-Y187F-Y354F mutant strains after sporulation induction (time points: 0h 4h and 8h).

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae wild-type and bdf1-Y187F-Y354F mutant strains were collected 0h, 4h and 8h after sporulation induction in triplicates. mRNA were purifired, prepared and sequencedusing Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer.
