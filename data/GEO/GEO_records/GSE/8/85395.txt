TITLE
Effect of tcdR mutation in Clostridium difficile sporulation

ORGANISM
Clostridioides difficile

SUMMARY
Clostridium difficile is an important nosocomial pathogen and the leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea. Antibiotic use is the primary risk factor for the development of C. difficile-associated disease because it disrupts normal protective gut flora and enables C. difficile to colonize the colon. C. difficile damages host tissue by secreting toxins and disseminates by forming spores. The toxin-encoding genes, tcdA and tcdB are part of a pathogenicity locus, which also encodes the gene tcdR that codes for the toxin genes positive regulator. TcdR is an alternate sigma factor that initiates transcription of tcdA and tcdB at their promoters. Alternative sigma factors are known to regulate virulence and virulence associated genes in many pathogenic bacteria. We created a tcdR mutant in the epidemic-type C. difficile R20291 strain in an attempt to identify the global role of tcdR. A site-directed mutation in tcdR affected both toxin production and sporulation in C. difficile R20291. Spores derived from the tcdR mutant were found to be mildly temperature sensitive. Moreover, nearly two fold more taurocholate was needed to germinate spores from the tcdR mutant than the spores prepared from the wild-type parent strain. Comparison of the tcdR mutant transcriptome with the parent strain revealed many differentially expressed late sporulation genes in the tcdR mutant. These data suggests that gene regulatory networks of toxin production and sporulation in Clostridium difficile are linked with each other.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 2 independent biological replicates of âˆ†tcdR and WT of the R20291 C. difficile strain.
