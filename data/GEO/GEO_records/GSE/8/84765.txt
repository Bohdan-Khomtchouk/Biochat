TITLE
Analysis of gene expression changes in mature colonic macrophages due to TGFβR1 deficiency

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have analysed transcriptomic changes of colonic macrophages due to TGFβR1 deficiency.

DESIGN
Macrophages (Lin-CD45+CD11b+CD64+Ly6C-MHCII+) were FACS purified from colonic cell isolates from CD11cCrexTgfbr1fl/flxRag1-/- mice. Microarray data were generated using a refined version of the Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarray 4x44 K v2 from Agilent Technologies. Three replicates deriving from Cre+ mice (that lack the receptor) and Cre- controls were analysed.
