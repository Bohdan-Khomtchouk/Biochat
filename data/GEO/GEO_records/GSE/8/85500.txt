TITLE
Expression data from nucleus accumbens of rats infused  with lentivirus LV-GFP and LV-miR-495 overexpression  constructs

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to determine the effect of lentiviral- mediated overexpression of miR-495 (LV-miR-495) on the levels of gene expression in the nuclues accumbens of rats relative to control rats injected with the empty vector (LV-GFP). We used Rat Gene 2.0 ST Affymetrix expression arrays ( to identify genes whose expression levels were downregulated by overexpression of miR-495.

DESIGN
Rats were infused with replication deficient lentiviral contructs LV-miR-495 or control LV-GFP (System Biosciences, Inc)  using sterotaxic injections. One week post-infusion the animals were sacrificed and the nucleus accumbens  microdissection and processed for RNA extraction using Trizol and RNA was used for hybridization on Affymetrix Rat Gene 2.0 ST arrays. We used 3 biological replicates: rats 1, 3 and 9 were infused with control LV-GFP and rats
