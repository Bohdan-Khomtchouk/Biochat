TITLE
Prefrontal cortex gene expression signature in autistic BTBR mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by a high degree of genetic heterogeneity. Genomic studies identified common pathological processes underlying the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of ASD, and transcriptome analyses revealed that gene networks involved in synapse development, neuronal activity and immune function are deregulated in ASD. Mouse models provide unique tools to investigate the neurobiological basis of ASD. Here we used the BTBR (BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J) ASD mouse model to identify conserved ASD-related molecular signatures.
