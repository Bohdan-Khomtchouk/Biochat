TITLE
Gene expression changes in mouse aorta during activation of or interference with PPAR gamma signaling.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ligand-mediated activation of the nuclear hormone receptor PPAR gamma lowers blood pressure and improves glucose tolerance in humans.  Two naturally occurring mutations (P467L, V290M) in the ligand binding domain of PPAR gamma have been described in humans that lead to severe insulin resistance and hypertension.  Experimental evidence suggests that these mutant versions of PPAR gamma act in a dominant negative fashion.  To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying PPAR gamma action in the vasculature, we determined the gene expression patterns in mouse aorta in response to activation or interference with the PPAR gamma signaling pathway. Keywords: time course, dose response
