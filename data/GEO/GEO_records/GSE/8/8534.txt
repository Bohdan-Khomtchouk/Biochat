TITLE
50uM Casodex treatment of PC-346C Prostate Cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide expression changes following 50uM Casodex treatment were investigated to determine regulatory targets commonly overlooked in gene function specific microarrays and for comparison of the effects the wild-type AR expressing PC-346C cells against the mutant androgen receptor (AR) LNCaP cell line. Keywords: Expression response to treatment, will be used with another array dataset for cell type comparison.
