TITLE
PC1/3 deficiency impacts POMC processing in human embryonic stem cell-derived hypothalamic neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed a technique for generating hypothalamic neurons from human pluripotent stem cells. Here, as proof-of-principle, we examine the use of these cells in modeling of a monogenic form of severe obesity: PCSK1 deficiency. We generated PCSK1 (PC1/3)-deficient human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines using both shRNA and CRISPR-Cas9, and investigated pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) processing using hESC-differentiated hypothalamic neurons.

DESIGN
We tried to idenitify transcripitional profiles and specific transcription factors that involved in of different stages during hypothalamic neuron differentiation from single cell sequencing for hESC-derived Day27 hypothalamic neurons, Day 12 neuron progenitors and undifferentiated stem cells
