TITLE
Ornithine decarboxylase is sufficient for prostate tumorigenesis via androgen receptor signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ornithine decarboxylase is sufficient for prostate tumorigenesis via androgen receptor signaling

DESIGN
Normal prostate epithelial cells (RWPE1) were transfected with a plasmid to overexpress ODC1 (RWPE1_ODC) and the gene expression analyses of RWPE1 and RWPE1_ODC was perfromed to identify which pathways were altered with this genetic modification
