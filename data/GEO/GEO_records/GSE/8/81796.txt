TITLE
Gene expression analysis of C4-2 cells treated with ACLY inhibitor and Enzalutamide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study examined the gene expression effects of treating androgen-deprived C4-2 prostate cancer cells with the ACLY inhibitor BMS-303141 and the AR antagonist enzalutamide.

DESIGN
Cells were treated with vehicle control, ACLY inhibitor alone, Enzalutamide alone, and ACLY-inhibitor and Enzalutamide combined together for 24 hours under androgen-depleted conditions (RPMI + 5% charcoal stripped serum). Biological triplicate samples were prepared.
