TITLE
A hyperactive transcriptional state marks genome reactivation at the mitosis-G1 transition [CaptureC]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Capture-C of G1E ER4 cell line in a nocodazole arrest-release experiment anchored at multiple gene promoters to quantify long-range chromatin interactions at the mitosis-G1 transition.

DESIGN
Nocodazole arrest-release in G1E ER4 cell line under conditions of 13h estradiol treatment (unless otherwise specified as 'unin', i.e. no estradiol treatment).
