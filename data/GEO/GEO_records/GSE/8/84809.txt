TITLE
Microarray analysis of white adipose tissue and liver from CD301b+ MNP-depleted mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tissue-resident mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) in metabolic organs contribute to the regulation of whole body metabolism. CD301b+ MNPs are a subset of MNPs that are found in most peripheral organs including metabolic organs.  In a mouse model in which CD301b+ MNPs can be selectively and transiently depleted, we examined the impact of the depletion on gene expression in the white adipose tissue and the liver.

DESIGN
Male Mgl2-DTR mice or control wild-type mice were treated with diphtheria toxin for 10 days to depleted CD301b+ MNPs. Total RNA was isolated frrom the inguinal and epididymal white adipose tissue and the liver.
