TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine whether differences between background strains or housing conditions altered the hepatic methylome, We report the generation and analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution in mouse liver from two male mice on a mixed background (mixed-1, mixed-2) and two males on a pure Black-6 (B6-1, B62) background. Using Enhanced high-throughput Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (ERRBS), we enriched CpG islands in mouse liver, and covered a representative sampling of conserved non-coding elements, transposons and other genomic features,Â for mouse liver. We found that the total CpG methylation of each methylome was strikingly similar among the 4 mouse liver samples from two different genetic backgrounds. Analysis of all CpG sites with at least 10x coverage showed a bimodal distribution of methylation, with all samples having 25% of hypermethylated CpG sites and 60% as hypomethylated CpG sites. Given the high percent of genome coverage and robust depth at single nucleotide level, these datasets provide a resource for investigation into changes in DNA methylation patterns in liver disease, tumorigenesis and regeneration.

DESIGN
Ehanced reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (MspI 70~320bp size fraction) of liver tissue
