TITLE
Expression data from miR-27a/b-overexpressing HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In infection with an adenovirus, it remains to be clarified whether host miRNAs affect Ad replication. We focused on miR-27 as an miRNA crucial for regulation of Ad infection because miR-27 has been reported to be involved in infection of other viruses, including MCMV and herpesvirus saimiri (HVS). We used microarrays to detail gene expression profiles in miR-27a/b-overexpressing HeLa cells and demonstarted that expression levels of various genes were down- or up-regulated following transfection with miR-27a/b mimics.

DESIGN
Hela cells were transfected with miR-27a/b mimics at 20 nM. After 48 h incubation, the cells were collected and gene expression profiles in the cells were analyzed by microarray analysis.
