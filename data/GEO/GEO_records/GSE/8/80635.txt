TITLE
Psychoactive pharmaceuticals at environmental concentrations induce in vitro gene expressions associated with neurological disorders

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We tested if psychoactive pharmaceuticals (fluoxetine, carbamazapine, venlafaxine) at lower concentrations (in ppb) could induce gene expressions linked with neurological disoders.

DESIGN
We used human nueronal cells as a model to study gene expressions induced by psychoactive pharmaceuticals at lower concentrations.
