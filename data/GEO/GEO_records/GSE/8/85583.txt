TITLE
Genomic binding of PAX8-PPARG fusion protein regulates cancer-related pathways and alters the immune landscape of thyroid cancer [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PAX8-PPARG fusion protein (PPFP) results from a t(2;3)(q13;p25) chromosomal translocation, is found in 30% of follicular thyroid carcinomas, and demonstrates oncogenic capacity in transgenic mice. A PPARG ligand, pioglitazone, is highly therapeutic in mice with PPFP thyroid carcinoma. We used our previously characterized transgenic mouse model of PPFP thyroid carcinoma to identify PPFP binding sites in vivo using ChIP-seq, and to identify genes and pathways regulated by PPFP with and without pioglitazone treatment via integration with RNA-seq and Affymetrix microarray data. This submission contains the Affymetrix microarray data. PPFP and pioglitazone regulated genes involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism, ribosome function, immune processes, cell death and other cancer-related processes. The RNA-seq data yielded similar findings.

DESIGN
Mice of genotype PPFPThy;PtenThy-/- or control genotype PtenThy-/- were treated with pioglitazone 200 parts per million in chow, or control diet, starting at 10 weeks of age for 10 weeks. Thyroid RNA was isolated and prepared for analysis on Affymetrix GeneChip mouse 430 2.0 arrays.
