TITLE
The profiling of gene expression in the roots of rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In order to research the genetic mechanism of deep rooting in rice, we performed the transcriptomic assay of the roots in rice.

DESIGN
The root tips about 2 cm length  were used for expression analysis in deep roots and shallow roots in the same plant. Two type rice varieties were used in this study including deep rooting and shallow rooting rice.12 root samples from six rice varieties were obtained in this experiments. The expression profiles were generated using Agilent rice micoarrays.
