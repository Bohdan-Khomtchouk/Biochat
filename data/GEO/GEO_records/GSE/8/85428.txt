TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for family UNK-129-KW with multiple patients suffering from a lethal form of a primary immunodeficiency.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Linkage analysis and Copy Number Variation were performed on DNA isolated from the peripheral blood of the 2 affected male patients, their unaffected parents, and their unaffected 4 male siblings, according to the manufacturer's description. This allowed to narrow down the region of homozygosity specifice to the patients. This approach, in combination with Whole Exome sequencing performed on DNA isolated from the 2 affected patients and their mother, allowed to identify a homozygous missense mutation in the base excision repair enzyme NEIL3 that reduced its enzymatic activity, and a homozygous duplication of exons 48-53 of the LPS Responsive Beige-Like Anchor Protein LRBA that abolished protein expression.

DESIGN
Homozygozity mapping was performed with the Affymetrix genome-wide human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array 6.0, and analyzed with Birdsuite version 1.4 and PLINK version 1.07.
