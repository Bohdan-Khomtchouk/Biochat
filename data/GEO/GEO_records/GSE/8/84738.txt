TITLE
Gene expression analysis of pulmonary artery in a rabbit model of pulmonary thromboembolism

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
Acute pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) refers to the obstruction of the pulmonary artery or its branches by thrombus.  Recent studies suggest that PTE-induced endothelium injury is the major physiological consequence of PTE, and PTE-induced endothelium injury can be used to stratify disease severity.  Several plasma biomarkers have been identified in PTE patients, but genome-wide gene expression has not been attempted in PTE.  In this study, using rabbit autologous thrombus PTE model, we applied gene expression array to identify genes and proteins changes in pulmonary arteries under PTE.

DESIGN
Twenty healthy China big-ear rabbits, specific-pathogen-free (SPF) grade and weighing between 2.5 and 3 kg, were purchased from the Center of experimental animals of the Nantong University.  These rabbits were randomly divided into control (n=10) and experimental group (n=10).  One hour before the experiment, thrombi were generated by collecting 0.5 ml blood from the marginal ear vein and placing into a sterile petri dish for 45 minutes at room temperature.  The autologous blood clot was subsequently cut into 5 mm sized aliquots and suspended in sterile saline.  After anesthesia, a venous catheter was placed in the exposed and isolated femoral vein.  In the experimental group, the blood clot in 10 mL of saline was injected into the femoral vein. An additional 5 mL of saline were used to flush the catheter. In the control group, 15 mL of saline were injected into the femoral vein.  Afterwards, the animals were placed back in the cage.
