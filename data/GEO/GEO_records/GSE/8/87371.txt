TITLE
Expression data from Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is currently divided into three main molecular subtypes, defined by gene expression profiling (GEP): Germinal Center B-cell like (GCB), Activated B-Cell like (ABC), and Primary Mediastinal B-cell Lymphoma (PMBL). DLBCL subtypes were determined according to patients' gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
223 DLBCL patients enrolled in prospective and multicenter LYSA trials were selected and molecular subtype classification was obtained according to GeneChip HGU133+2.0 (Affymetrix)
