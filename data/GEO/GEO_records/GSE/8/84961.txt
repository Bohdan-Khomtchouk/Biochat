TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of lymphoid progenitors in Zbtb1-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Deficiency of Zbtb1 leads to the generation of myeloid cells from lymphoid progenitors when cultured in conditions that do not support myeloid development. We therefore analyzed how was the transcriptional signature altered by Zbtb1 deficiency in lymphoid progenitors ex vivo and after induction of a T-cell developmental program by co-culture with OP9-DL1 stroma cells.

DESIGN
Sorted common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) and lymphoid primed multipotent progenitors (LMPP) were subjected to RNAseq (D0) or co-cultured with OP9-DL1 stroma for 24hs (D1) to induce T-cell differentiation in the presence of IL-7 and Flt3l. After co-culture, cells were sorted and subjected to RNAseq.
