TITLE
BRD4 localization to lineage-specific enhancers is associated with a distinct transcription factor repertoire [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined context specific function of BRD4 in promoting lineage specific gene expression and show that BRD4 is essential for osteoblast differentiation.

DESIGN
We performed ChIP-sequencing from hFOB cells (undifferentiated and differentiated for 5 days into osteoblastic lineage) .  We generated BRD4 and RNA POLII ChIP-Seq data from undifferentiated and differentiated cells; H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H2Bub1 ChIP-Seq data from undifferentiated and differentiated cells with DMSO or JQ1 treatment.  Consistently, Input DNA from all the three conditions was included as well. C/EBPb, TEAD1, FOSL2, JUND and STAT3 ChIP-Seq was performed in differentiated hFOBs . We performed ChIP-sequencing from L3.6 cells.  We generated BRD4 ChIP-Seq data.
