TITLE
mRNA expression profiles of colorectal liver metastases as a novel biomarker for early recurrence after partial hepatectomy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of specific risk groups for recurrence after surgery for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disease. Classical clinicopathologic parameters have limited prognostic and predictive value. The aim of this study was to identify a gene expression signature measured in CRLM discriminating early from late recurrence after surgery for CRLM. Methods: Tumour samples of CRLM from two patient groups were collected: I) patients with recurrent disease within 12 months after surgery (N=33), and II) patients without recurrences and disease free for at least 36 months (N=30). The included patients were clinically homogeneous; all patients had a low risk profile (clinical risk score 0-2) and did not receive (neo-) adjuvant chemotherapy. Extracted total RNA from both groups was hybridized to Illumina arrays, and processed for analysis. A leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) analysis was performed to identify a potentially prognostic gene expression signature.  Results: The LOOCV yielded an 11-gene profile with prognostic value in relation to recurrent disease within 12 months after partial hepatectomy. This gene expression profile had a sensitivity of 81.8%, with a specificity of 66.7% for predicting early recurrences (within 12 months) versus no recurrences for at least 36 months after surgery (X2 P < 0.0001). Conclusion: The current study yielded an 11-gene signature at mRNA level in CRLM discriminating early from late or no relapse after partial hepatectomy.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from FFPE-material was used to generate gene-expression data; from these, a signature was identied in CRC patients  distinguishing early or late relapse after partial hepatectomy.
