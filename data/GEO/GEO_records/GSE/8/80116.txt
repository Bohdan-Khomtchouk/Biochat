TITLE
Identification of a serum six-microRNA panel as potential noninvasive biomarker for meningioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TaqMan low density array (TLDA) was carried out to screen of the profiles of circulating miRNAs in pooled serum samples from healthy controls and pre-operative meningioma patients. The expression changes of circulating miRNAs in meningioma patients were identified.

DESIGN
To select candidate serum miRNAs for meningioma detection and monitoring, we employed TLDA technique to screen expression levels of 739 miRNAs in pooled serum samples from healthy controls and pre-operative meningioma patients (each pooled from 20 individuals).
