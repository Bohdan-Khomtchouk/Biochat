TITLE
Arabidopsis Col0 5 week-old plants: control vs 25 minutes of exposure to mild heat stress 27 degrees Celsius

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of fully developed leaves of Arabidopsis Col0 plants heat-stressed for 25 min at 27.7 degrees Celsius. Goal was to isolate and study the influence of temperature and vpd change in the 30 min high light-stress experiments, since the Isolight rises leaf temperature to 27.5C and increases the vpd from 5 min of exposure.

DESIGN
two-condition, two-colour experiment, Control vs. heat stress, 4 biological replicates per treatment. The experiment comprised a single 4x44 Agilent V4 microarray slide with a dye-swap.
