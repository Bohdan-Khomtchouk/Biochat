TITLE
Elucidation of Transcriptome-Wide MicroRNA Binding Sites in Human Cardiac Tissues by Ago2 HITS-CLIP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We deciphered Ago2:RNA interactions in post-mortem human heart tissues using crosslinking immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (HITS-CLIP) to generate the first transcriptome-wide map of miR targeting events in human myocardium, detecting 4000 cardiac Ago2 binding sites across > 2200 target transcripts.

DESIGN
Profiling AGO2-associated RNAs in cardiac tissues obtained from 6 donors with heart diseases of differing etiologies
