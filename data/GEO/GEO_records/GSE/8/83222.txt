TITLE
Phagocytosis imprints heterogeneity in tissue macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our study identifies the molecular heterogeneity of the populations of tissue resident macrophages that phagocytose circulating cells in the steady state.

DESIGN
Phagocytic macrophages were isolated from bone marrow, large intestine and spleen based on the acquisition, or no acquisition, of DsRed fluorescence derived from phagocytosed DsRed-Tg. The phagocytosed cells originated from DsRed-Tg mice that were conjoined by parabiosis to non-fluorescent mice.
