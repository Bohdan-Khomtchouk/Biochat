TITLE
Gene expression analysis between primary keratinocytes and primary dermal fibroblasts obtained from the same skin sample

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile was obtained from primary keratinocytes and primary dermal fibroblasts obtained from the same skin sample

DESIGN
For the successive promotor analysis, human primary keratinocytes and human primary dermal fibroblasts are obtained from the same skin sample and gene expression were evaluated by DNA microarray
