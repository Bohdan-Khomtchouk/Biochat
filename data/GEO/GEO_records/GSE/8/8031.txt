SUMMARY
gnp3-b4_nitrogen_starvation - nitrogen starvation and re-supply - What are the transcriptomic short- and long-term plant responses to nitrogen starvation and nitrogen re-supply?  - WS Arabidopsis ecotype were grown on 6mM nitrate as sole nitrogen source during 35 days under short days . At T0, plants were then starved for nitrate for 10 days and root and shoot samples were harvested separately 2 and 10 days after treatment (T2, T10). Then, nitrate (6 mM) was re-supplied for 1 and 24 hours (T+1, T+24). Keywords: time course
