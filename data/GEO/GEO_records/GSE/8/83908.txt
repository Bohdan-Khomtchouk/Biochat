TITLE
Effects of digested onion extracts on intestinal gene expression: an interspecies comparison using different intestine models

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Applicability of in vitro (human Caco-2 cells) and ex vivo intestine models (rat precision cut intestine slices and the pig in-situ small intestinal segment perfusion (SISP) technique) to study the effect of food compounds. In vitro digested yellow (YOd) and white onion extracts (WOd) were used as model food compounds and transcriptomics was applied to obtain more insight into which extent mode of actions depend on the model.

DESIGN
Within eight male piglets (5 week-old, 8.2 kg) five paired SISP segments were prepared at 31-58% along the total length of small intestine (jejunum). At t = 0 segments were filled with 20 ml of Saline control solution (S), 20 ml onion digest (YOd or WOd), or 20 ml control digest (Sd). After 30 min, perfusion (2 ml/15 min) was started simultaneously for all segments for a period of 6 h. Perfusion was stopped and for preparation of mucosal scrapings 10 cm of the caudal part of each segment was dissected and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80Â°C. In the first 4 piglets (number 1-4), YOd and Sd samples were distributed over a pair of segments, and over the piglets according to a Latin-square design. In the second 4 piglets (number 5-8) WOd and Sd samples were distributed over segments and piglets in the same manner as in piglets 1-4. jejunum pig, host-feed interaction
