TITLE
microRNA profiling of recurrent high grade ovarian carcinoma compared to primary ovarian cancer and normal ovary

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine microRNA expression in chemoresistant ovarian cancer, we have employed whole microRNA microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to distinguish recurrent ovarian cancer. 8 recurrent ovarian cancer tissue and 8 primary ovarian cancer tissue and 4 normal ovarian tissue was used to identify miRNA profiling.

microRNA profilinf of recurrent high grade ovarian carcinoma compared to primary ovarian cancer and normal ovary
