TITLE
SNAI1 overexpression effect on MCF-10A mammary epithelial cell line (miRNA)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
SNAI1 is a key transcription factor in the EMT process, that is considered as the initial step of metastasis. The microRNAs(miRNAs) invovled in SNAI1-induced EMT may play important roles in regulating the process of metastasis. We used microarrays to establish the miRNAs both upregulated and downregulated in SNAI1-induced EMT process.
