TITLE
Position effects influence HIV provirus latency reversal

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We propose a technology B-HIVE, which allows us to map HIV integrations in a cell population and measure their individual transcription. The principle of B-HIVE is to tag individual viral genomes with a unique barcode of 20 nucleotides that allows us to track the viral transcripts produced by each provirus in the cell population.

DESIGN
We performed two independent infection on Jurkat T cells by barcoded HIV (2 biological replicates). Each sample preparation and data analysis was done in parallel in 2 replicates.
