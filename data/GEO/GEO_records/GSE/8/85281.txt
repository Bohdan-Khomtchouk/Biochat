TITLE
Temperature induced changes in the Arabidopsis transcriptome

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plants developed plasticity to environmental conditions, such as temperature, that allows their adaptation. A change in ambient temperature leads to changes in the transcriptome in plants. Here we study changes in the splicing of Arabidopsis thaliana using an RNA-seq approach. Plants were growing in short day conditions (8h light/16h dark) at 16°C for 5 weeks and then moved to 25°C. We monitor changes in the transcriptome in the time, material was harvested 24h, 3 days and 5 days after the temperature change.

DESIGN
We generate 3 biological replicates for each condition, for a total of 12 samples.
