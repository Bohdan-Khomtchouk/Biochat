TITLE
Analysis of genome-wide occupancy of menin, MLL1 and MLL2 in MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq using antibodies directed at menin, MLL1 and MLL2 in MCF-7 cells in order to assess the genome-wide presence of these proteins in MCF-7 cells.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were synchronized in phenol red-free medium containing 10% charcoal dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (CDT medium). Cells were treated with 10 nM estradiol (E2) or vehicle for 45 minutes. Menin, MLL1 and MLL2 ChIP-seq was performed after vehicle treatment. In addition, the menin cistrome was defined 45 min after treatment with E2.
