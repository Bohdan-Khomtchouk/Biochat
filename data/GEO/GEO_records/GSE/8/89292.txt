TITLE
Systems analysis of protective immune responses to RTS,S malaria vaccination in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied a systems biology approach to study immune responses in subjects receiving 3 consecutive immunizations with RTS,S/AS01 (RRR), or in those receiving 2 immunizations of RTS,S/AS01, following a primary immunization with adenoviral Ad35 (ARR) vector expressing circumsporozoite protein.

DESIGN
The clinical trial (NCT01366534) was conducted at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Malaria Vaccine Branch. 46 healthy malaria-naïve volunteers, randomized to two study arms participated in this study testing the efficacy of RTS,S and AdVac® malaria vaccine candidates. Study arm 1 (hereafter referred to as ARR), comprised of 25 volunteers who received the AdVac® vaccine composed of Ad35 vector expressing full length CSP, as a primary immunization, followed by two doses of RTS,S/AS01 vaccine. The subjects in the second arm, consisting of 21 volunteers, received three doses of RTS,S/AS01 (RRR regimen). Participants in both study arms were vaccinated at 28-day intervals, and subjected to controlled malaria infection 21 days following the final immunization. Controlled human malaria infection  (CHMI) challenge was administered through five bites from malaria-infected mosquitoes to mimic natural infection. Parasitemia was monitored for 28 days, and immunomonitoring continued for 159 days following challenge. The study also included 12 non-vaccinated subjects as infectivity controls. Please note that the non-vaccinated subjects were not profiled by microarray; this cohort served only as infectivity controls, to confirm that the infection protocol was effective.
