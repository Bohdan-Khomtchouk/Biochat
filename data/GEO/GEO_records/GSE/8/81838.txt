TITLE
Gene expression anlaysis of laser-capture microdissected tumor and stroma from triple negative breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LCM was perfomed on adjacent tumor and stromal cells to identify differentially expressed genes in triple negative breast cancer.

DESIGN
To determine differences in tumor and adjacent stromal tissue, laser-capture microdissction was perfomed on 10 triple negative breast cancer specimans to isolate tumor and stromal cells for gene expression analysis. RNA was isolated from captured cells and hybridized to affymetrix gene expression microarrays.
