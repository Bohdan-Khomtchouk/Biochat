TITLE
Nitric oxide(CysNO) mediated transcriptome profiling in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study provides comprehensive information about plant responses to nitrosative stress at transcript level and would prove helpful in understanding and incorporating mechanisms associated with nitrosative stress responses in plants.

DESIGN
1mM CysNO Treatment to Leaf disc, Transcriptome profiling
