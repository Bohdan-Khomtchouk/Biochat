TITLE
A Gene Expression-Based Risk Stratification Model for Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We recently defined a gene expression-based signature of high-risk multiple myeloma; this predictive signature was developed with and independently validated for newly diagnosed patients treated with high dose therapy and stem cell rescue.  Here we use Phase 3 clinical trial data to show that this signature also predicts short survival in relapsed disease treated with single agent bortezomib or high dose dexamethasone.  In addition, a survival signature derived with relapsed myeloma samples identified newly diagnosed patients with short survival.  Taken together these data suggest that a similar biology underlies poor outcome in both newly diagnosed and relapsed myeloma and provide strong evidence that the high-risk signature is a powerful tool to identify patients who are candidates for new therapeutic regimens. Keywords: Model validation
