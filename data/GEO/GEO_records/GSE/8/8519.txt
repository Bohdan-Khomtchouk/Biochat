TITLE
Expression differences between worker(female) and drone(male) honey bee antennae

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
We have identified a honeybee (Apis mellifera) odorant receptor (Or) for the queen substance 9-oxo-2-decenoic acid (9-ODA) from four candidate sex pheromone odorant receptors from the honeybee genome based on their biased expression in drone antennae. Keywords: Tissue Comparison
