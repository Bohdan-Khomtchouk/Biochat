TITLE
Effect of JAK1/3 blockade on IL2 response in NK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IL2 signals are transmitted through JAK1 and JAK3, but the transcriptomic consequences of each to the overall response is unclear. Here we analyzed the relative contribution of JAK1 and JAK3 to the NK cell IL2 response in vitro using titrated doses of isoform specific JAK inhibitors. Blockade of JAK1 and JAK3 have unequal effects on IL2-induced transcripts at pharmacologically relevant doses.

DESIGN
Splenic NK cells were isolated by negative selection from 6wk old male C57BL/6 mice. These were cultured with IL2 (250U/ml) in the presence or absence of JAK1/3 inhibitors for 8hrs in vitro. Cells were then transferred directly into TriZol. RNA was prepared in Trizol for gene expression profiling by  Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
