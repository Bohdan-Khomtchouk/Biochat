TITLE
Targeting Glutamine Synthetase in Tumors Disrupts Tumor Microenvironment-Regulated Cancer Cell Growth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of ovarian cancer cell line HeyA8 coculturing with cancer associated fibroblasts at gene expression level. The hypothesis test in this study is to show that cancer associated fibroblasts can influence the gene expression of HeyA8 under glutamine deprivation condition. Results provide important information of the response of HeyA8 when coculturing with cancer associated fibroblasts under glutamine deprivation, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from Hey8A cocultured with cancer associated fibroblasts subjected to 24 hours glutamine deprivation compared to He8A subjected 24 hours glutamine deprivation and Hey8A with complete medium condition
