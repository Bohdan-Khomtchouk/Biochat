TITLE
Skeletal muscle after fine needle stimulation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Fine needle stimulation also known as acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical practice which causes relief of pain.  We demonstrated that it caused neovascularization and enhanced recovery of blood perfusion in a ischemic portion of skeletal muscle in rats with  hindlimb ischemia.  Therefore we evaluated the effect of fine needle stimulation on skeletal muscle at gene expression level Keywords: Evaluation of physical stimulation
