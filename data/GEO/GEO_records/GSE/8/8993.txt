TITLE
Normal human fibroblast cell line bystander effects by Carbon ion irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have recently investigated the response of irradiated and bystander fibroblasts to heavy ions in confluent cultures exposed randomly to broadbeam and selectively to precision microbeam that target a predefined fraction of cells with counted number of particle(s), respectively, and found the difference in the time course of apoptosis induction and p53 phosphorylation between irradiated and bystander cells [Hamada MR2008]. In the present investigation, to further scrutinize the underpinnings of their temporally distinct responses, we set out to examine the gene expression changes in irradiated and bystander fibroblasts at a genome-wide level with the microarray analysis under the same experimental condition. We demonstrate that the gene expression profiles of bystander cells are substantially different from those of heavy ion-irradiated cells. Keywords: bystander effect, hour-time course cell number dependency, irradiation-dose response
