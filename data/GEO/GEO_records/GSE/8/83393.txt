TITLE
Newborn Sex-specific Transcriptome Signatures and Gestational Exposure to Fine Particles: Findings from the ENVIRONAGE Birth Cohort

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated sex-specific transcriptomic responses to gestational long- and short-term exposure to particulate matter with a diameter < 2.5 µm (PM2.5) in order to elucidate potential underlying mechanisms of action. Whole genome gene expression was investigated in cord blood of 142 mother-newborn pairs that were enrolled in the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort. Daily PM2.5 exposure levels were calculated for each mother’s home address using a spatial-temporal interpolation model in combination with a dispersion model to estimate both long- (annual average before delivery) and short- (last month of pregnancy) term exposure. We explored the association between gene expression levels and PM2.5 exposure, and identified modulated pathways by overrepresentation analysis and gene set enrichment analysis.
