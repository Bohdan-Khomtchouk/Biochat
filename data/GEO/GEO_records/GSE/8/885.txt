TITLE
Genome-wide regulation by TFIID and SAGA

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
TFIID and SAGA share a common set of TAFs, regulate chromatin, and deliver TBP to promoters.  Here we examine their relationship within the context of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome-wide regulatory network. We find that while TFIID and SAGA make overlapping contributions to the expression of all genes, TFIID function predominates at ~90% and SAGA at ~10% of the measurable genome.  Strikingly, SAGA-dominated genes are largely stress-induced and TAF-independent, and are down-regulated by the coordinate action of a variety of chromatin, TBP, and RNA polymerase II regulators.  In contrast, the TFIID-dominated class is less regulated, but is highly dependent upon TAFs including those shared between TFIID and SAGA.  These two distinct modes of transcription regulation might reflect the need to balance inducible stress responses with the steady output of housekeeping genes.
