TITLE
Chronic p53-independent p21 expression deregulates replication licensing, leading to genomic instability II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1 (p21) is a cell-cycle checkpoint effector and inducer of senescence, regulated by p53. Yet, evidence suggests that, through a so-far obscure mechanism, p21 could also be oncogenic. We report that a subset of atypical cancerous cells strongly expressing p21 showed proliferation features. This occurred predominantly in p53-mutant human cancers suggesting p53-independent upregulation of p21 selectively in more aggressive tumour cells. Multifaceted phenotypic and genomic analyses of p21-inducible, p53-null, cancerous and near-normal cellular models showed that after an initial senescence-like phase, a subpopulation of p21-expressing proliferating cells emerged, featuring increased genomic instability, aggressiveness and chemo-resistance. Mechanistically, sustained p21-accumulation inhibited mainly the CRL4CDT2 ubiquitin-ligase, leading to deregulated origin licensing and replication stress. Collectively, our data reveal tumour-promoting ability of p21 through deregulation of DNA replication licensing machinery, an unorthodox role to be considered in cancer treatment, since p21 responds to various stimuli including some chemotherapy drugs.

DESIGN
We compare the genomic instability between Escape and OFF Li-Fraumeni and Saos2 p21WAF1/Cip1 Tet-ON
