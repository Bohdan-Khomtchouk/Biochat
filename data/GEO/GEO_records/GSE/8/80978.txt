TITLE
DGAT1 regulates retinol-dependent regulatory T cell generation and mediates autoimmune encephalomyelitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This file contains gene microarray data from FACS purified mouse memory phenotype CD4+ T cells (CD44hiCD45RBloCD25-), which were isolated from lymph node and spinal cord tissues of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a widely studied model of human multiple sclerosis (MS). Memory phenotype CD4+ T cells infiltrating the CNS during EAE expressed high levels of mRNA for Dgat1 encoding diacylglycerol-O-acyltransferase-1 (DGAT1). We studied the biology of DGAT1 in EAE models and in assays of T cell differentiation and function.

DESIGN
We analyzed transcript expression data from memory phenotype CD4+ T cells derived from draining lymph nodes (n=3) and spinal cords (n=3) of mice with acute symptomatic EAE .
