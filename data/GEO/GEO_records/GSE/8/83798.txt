TITLE
Brain RNA-seq 120 days after worker-gamergate transitions in Harpegnathos ants

ORGANISM
Harpegnathos saltator

SUMMARY
Harpegnathos workers were induced to transition to reproductive gamergates and 120 days later mRNA from their brains was sequenced to determine changes in gene expressioin

DESIGN
Ants were removed from their original colony at d0 and placed in boxes lacking a dominant reproductive. After 120 days individuals were scored for reproductive status by inspecting their ovaries and brains (minus optic lobes) were dissected and processed for sequencing.
