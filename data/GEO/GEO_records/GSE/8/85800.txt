TITLE
Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cell Expansion Without Differentiation is Achieved in Zwitterionic Hydrogels

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of Zwitterionic Hydrogel to enable differention-free expansion of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) derived from cord blood.

DESIGN
To have an advanced insight on the activity of HSPC in  zwitterionic matrix, we conducted mRNA deep-sequencing in HSPC before and after culture
