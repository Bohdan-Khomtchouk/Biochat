TITLE
A novel target of CD274 involvement in AML development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report abonormally expressed genes of MLL-AF9 induced CD274-/- AML mice by RNA-seq analysis. Cyclin D2 was found down-regulated in CD274 depleted AML LSCs, suggesting it might be a novel target gene of CD274 involvement in AML advancement.

DESIGN
Examination of differentially expressed genes in AML LSCs of wild type and CD274 knockout mice. Verification the function of selected gene in pathogenesis of AML involvement CD274 dysfunction.
