TITLE
Copy Number Variation in Brca2 (G25R) variant mouse tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the overall amount of genomic instability seen in various genotypes of Brca2 (G25R) and to see where common gains and losses occur within a Trp53 heterozygous genetic background

DESIGN
Comparing mouse tumor DNA with mouse genomic DNA
