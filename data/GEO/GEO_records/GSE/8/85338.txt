TITLE
RNA sequencing of Hordeum vulgare near isogenic lines

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
NILs containing five parental lines, three wild barley genotypes ssp. spontaneum: HID 4 (A), Iraq; HID 64 (B), Turkey; and HID 369 (C), Israel,  one ssp. agriocrithon: HID 382(D)) and  cv. Morex (ssp. vulgare, USA). Purpose: Variant calling to identifie markers associated  with a awn length QTL on the distal part of chromosome 7HL

DESIGN
Two NILs differing in awn length were sequenced, one having an introgression from HID382 at position 132.01 â€“ 134.21 cM (POPSEQ map) (RD) and the other from Morex (RM).
