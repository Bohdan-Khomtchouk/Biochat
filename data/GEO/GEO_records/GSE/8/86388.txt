TITLE
Analysis of miRNA pattern in mesenchymal stem/stromal cells derived from amniotic fluid (AF-MSCs) versus differentiated AF-MSCs into Adipocyte-Like cells (AL).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of the expression pattern of miRNAs of AF-MSCs compared with differentiated AF-MSCs into adipocyte-like cells (AL cells). Significantly, the miRNAs that were found to be more than 2 fold up- or down-regulated on one or more slides were considered as differentially expressed candidates. The miRNA profile revealed 13 differentially expressed miRNAs between AF-MSCs and AL cells. MiR-26a was identified in high expression levels in AL cells indicating a critical role in the process of adipogenesis.
