TITLE
RARα-PLZF overcomes PLZF-mediated repression of CRABPI contributing to retinoid resistance in t(11;17) APL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study supports an active role for PLZF and RARα-PLZF in leukemogenesis, identifies upregulation of CRABPI as a novel mechanism contributing to retinoid resistance and reveals the ability of the reciprocal fusion gene products to mediate distinct epigenetic effects contributing to the leukemic phenotype. Keywords: Disease state analysis
