TITLE
small RNA-Seq showing transfer of bacterial outer membrane vesicle (OMV) sRNA to host airway epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
This study is the first to show transfer of regulatory bacterial sRNAs from bacterial OMVs to host cells.

DESIGN
Demonstration of transfer of bacterial sRNA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa OMVs to host cells in two cell types. RNA isolated from PA14 OMV exposed primary human bronchial epithelial cells or CFBE41o- bronchial epithelial cells as well as unexposed control cells was analyzed by small RNA-Seq. Primary cell exposures were performed on two donors and exposures of CFBE41o- cells were done in triplicate.
