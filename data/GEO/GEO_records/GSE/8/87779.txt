TITLE
DNA hypomethylation define poorly prognostic pediatric posterior fossa ependymomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A subset of genomically silent childhood posterior fossa ependymomas show reduced H3K27me3, global DNA hypomethylation, are more invasive, exhibit poor prognosis and epigenetically deregulated genes converge on radial glial factors, suggesting developing cerebellar radial glia as candidate cells-of-origin.

DESIGN
Quantification of CpG methylation in 3 ependymoma subtypes
