TITLE
ChIP-Seq based analysis of THAP1 binding in mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome binding/occupancy by wild type THAP1 was profiled by high throughput sequencing in wild type mouse ES cells derived from C57Bl/6 blastocysts

DESIGN
ChIP Seq was performed by standard methods using a commercial antibody (ProteinTech) in untreated cells in the pluripotent state
