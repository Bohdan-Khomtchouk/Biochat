TITLE
Reciprocal Regulation between the Circadian Clock and Hypoxia Signaling at the Genome Level in Mammal

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we propose that the clock plays an important role in fine-tuning the hypoxic response under pathophysiological conditions, which can serve as a strategy to reduce the severity of fatal hypoxia-related diseases.

DESIGN
BMAL1 and HIF1a Chip-seq in U2OS cells at circadian peak and trough with DMOG or DMSO
