TITLE
A genetic screen identifies hypothalamic Fgf15/19 as a regulator of glucagon secretion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia, which restores normal blood glucose levels to ensure sufficient provision of glucose to the brain, is critical for survival. To discover underlying brain regulatory systems, we performed a genetic screen in recombinant inbred mice for quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling glucagon secretion in response to neuroglucopenia. We identified a QTL on the distal part of chromosome 7 and combined this genetic information with transcriptomic analysis of hypothalami. This revealed Fgf15 as the strongest candidate to control the glucagon response. Fgf15 was found to be expressed by neurons of the dorsomedial hypothalamus and the perifornical area. Intracerebroventricular injection of FGF19, the human ortholog of Fgf15, reduced activation by neuroglucopenia of dorsal vagal complex neurons and of the parasympathetic nerve, leading to a lower glucagon secretion. These data show that Fgf15 in hypothalamic neurons is a regulator of vagal nerve activity in response to neuroglucopenia.
