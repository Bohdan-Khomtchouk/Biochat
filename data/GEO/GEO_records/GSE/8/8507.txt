Neutrophil and PBMC gene expression data from Job's Syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hyper IgE Recurrent Infection Syndrome (HIES or Jobâ€™s syndrome), is a rare disorder of immunity and connective tissue, typically manifest with boils, cyst-forming pneumonias, and extremely elevated serum IgE as well as retained primary dentition and bone abnormalities. Inheritance can be autosomal dominant. In order to identify a specific defect or gene of interest, we performed microarray expression analysis on samples from patients with Job's syndrome and from healthy control subjects. Keywords: time course
