TITLE
Cell-cycle regulation of cohesin stability along fission yeast chromosomes

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by cohesin but the process of cohesion establishment during S phase is still enigmatic. Recent data indicate that in mammalian cells, cohesin binding to chromatin is dynamic in G1 but becomes stabilized during S phase. Whether the regulation of chromosomal cohesin turn-over is integral to the process of cohesion establishment is unknown. Here, we provide evidence that fission yeast cohesin also displays dynamic behaviour. Cohesin association with G1 chromosomes requires continued activity of the cohesin loader Mis4/Ssl3, implying that repeated loading cycles maintain cohesin binding. Cohesin retention on G1 chromosomes was improved by deletion of wpl, the fission yeast ortholog of mammalian WAPL, suggestive of a conserved mechanism that controls cohesin stability on chromosomes. wpl is non-essential, indicating that a change in wpl-dependent cohesin turnover is not integral to the mechanism of cohesion establishment. Instead we find that cohesin instability is down-regulated during S phase in a reaction independent of DNA replication. Hence, cohesin stabilization might be a pre-requisite for cohesion establishment rather than its consequence. Keywords: ChIP-chip
