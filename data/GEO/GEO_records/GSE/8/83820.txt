TITLE
Study of the molecular stability of patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) for human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in nude mice during subsequent passages in mice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established a large panel of preclinical models of human RCC directly from patients, faithfully reproducing the biological features of the original tumor. RCC tissues were collected for 8 years from 336 patients undergoing surgery, xenografted subcutaneously in nude mice, and serially passaged into new mice up to 13 passages. Tissue samples from the primary tumor and tumors grown in mice through passages were analyzed at the histology, genetic and for of them at the molecular levels for biological tissue stability.  We established a large panel of 30 RCC models and 5 them of the clear cell type (clear cell renal cell carcinoma, CCC) were characterized at the mRNA expression level.

DESIGN
We used Affymetrix whole genome microarrays to analyze the stability of the PDX models comparing the primary tumor (P0) with the subsequent passages in mice (P1 â€¦).
