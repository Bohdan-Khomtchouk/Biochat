TITLE
RNA-seq reveals changes in the astrocyte transcriptome following Borrelia burgdorferi infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA profiles of astrocytes infected with Borrelia burdorferi for 24 hours, 48 hours, and 24 hour  uninfected controls  were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq.
