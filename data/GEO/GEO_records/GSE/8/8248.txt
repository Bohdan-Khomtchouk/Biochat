TITLE
Identification of hypoxia-inducible genes in Arabidopsis mesophyll cells

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to investigate the early transcript changes (6h) induced by hypoxia treatment in mesophyll protoplasts. A single pair (control & hypoxia) of GeneChipsÂ® was used to confirm that hypoxia treatment altered the expression of an overlapping set of genes controlled by KIN10 (At3g01090) in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. Keywords: KIN10, KIN11, darkness, hypoxia, starvation, stress, sugar signalling, Arabidopsis, SnRK1
