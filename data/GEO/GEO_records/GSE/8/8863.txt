TITLE
Mouse mammary tumor-initiating cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using a syngeneic p53 null mouse mammary gland tumor model that closely mimics human breast cancer, we have identified by limiting dilution transplantation as well as in vitro mammosphere and clonogenic assays a Lin-CD29HighCD24High subpopulation of tumor-initiating cells.  Differentially expressed genes in the Lin-CD29HighCD24High mouse mammary gland tumor-initiating cell population include those involved in DNA damage response and repair, as well as genes involved in epigenetic regulation previously shown to be critical for stem cell self-renewal. Keywords: tumor-initiating cells
