TITLE
Transcriptome Survey of Malaria Parasite Liver Stages

ORGANISM
Plasmodium yoelii

SUMMARY
To facilitate pre-eythrocytic malaria vaccine and drug target identification, a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of the parasites liver stages (LS) was undertaken. Green fluorescent protein-tagged Plasmodium yoelii (PyGFP) was used to isolate LS-infected hepatocytes from the rodent host. Genome-wide LS gene expression was profiled and compared to other parasite life cycle stages. The analysis reveals ~2000 genes active during LS development. Keywords: Stage comparison, time course
