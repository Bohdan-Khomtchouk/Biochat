TITLE
Dietary Gluten-Induced Gut Dysbiosis is Accompanied by Selective Upregulation of microRNAs with Intestinal Tight Junction and Bacteria-Binding Motifs in Rhesus Macaque Model of Celiac Disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study describes miRNA expression in intact jejunum following feeding of gluten containing monkey chow to gluten sensitive (GS) rhesus macaques. Gluten feeding induced several inflammation associated miRNAs validated and predicted to directly target intestinal tight junction proteins. Upregulation of these microRNAs was accompanied significantly reduced mRNA expression of claudin-1, claudin-3 and occludin and severe gut dysbiosis. These findings suggest that miRNA mediated downregulation of intestinal epithelial tight junction proteins could increase intestinal permeability and facilitate translocation of dysbiotic bacteria into the systemic circulation.
