TITLE
Histone H3K4 trimethylation in rat peripheral nerve

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq of H3K4me3 in rat peripheral nerve was used to identify transcription start sites associated with Schwann cell-expressed genes. The analysis was performed in injured and control nerve to identify injury-responsive changes in Schwann cells.

DESIGN
H3K4me3 ChIP samples were prepared from rat sciatic nerve at 1 day post-transection using both the distal stump of the injured nerve and the contralateral (sham) nerve.
