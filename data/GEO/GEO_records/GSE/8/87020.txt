TITLE
Direct mouse fibroblasts toward Leydig-like cells by defined factors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) induced by Dmrt1, Gata4, Nr5a1 transduction, named induced Leydig-like cells (iLCs), comparing control untreated MEFs and mouse adult Leydig cells. Goal was to understand the global transcriptional changes induced by DGN transduction. 10 µg of total RNA were primed with 2 µl of 100 µM T16N2 DNA primer at 70°C for 10 min, then reversed transcribed at 42°C for 1 h in the presence of 400 U SuperScript II RTase (Invitrogen), and 100 µM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP, with 25 µM dCTP, 25 µM Cy3-label

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment,  iLCs vs. MEFs, iLCs vs. Leydig cells.
