TITLE
Biological characterization of virulent therapeutic bacteriophage PAK_P4 infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
We have isolated and characterized several bacteriophages infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa distantly related to Felix O1 virus and proposed they form a new subfamily named Felixounavirinae. The infectious cycle of bacteriophages belonging to this subfamily has not been studied yet in terms of gene expression. The present study reports the RNA-Seq analysis of bacteriophage PAK_P4 infecting PAK strain of P. aeruginosa.

DESIGN
RNA profile of Host and Phage at 0min, 3.5min and 13 min after infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK strain with the Pseudomonas phage PAK P4. Three biological replicates for each time point.
