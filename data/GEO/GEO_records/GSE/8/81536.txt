TITLE
Uridylation-mediated RNA quality control pathway in mammalian cytoplasm [CLIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Uridylation of various cellular RNA species at the 3’ end has been generally linked to RNA degradation. Uridylated pre-miRNAs in mammals and uridylated mRNAs in fission yeast are targeted by the 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease DIS3L2. In humans, DIS3L2 mutations have been associated with Perlman syndrome development and Wilms tumor susceptibility. In this work, we employ crosslinking in vivo and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) method to assess the RNA binding capacity of human DIS3L2 on a genome-wide scale. Our study uncovers a broad spectrum of uridylated RNAs in human cytoplasm, which include mature as well as aberrant forms of coding and noncoding RNAs, such as rRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs, tRNAs and pre-miRNAs. Most importantly, we have identified that a fraction of Pol II transcription start-site associated transcripts are exported to cytoplasm, where they are targeted by the TUT-DIS3L2 pathway. Moreover, this pathway appears to mainly target RNA regions that form stable secondary structures. Our findings imply the role of DIS3L2 and oligouridylation in general RNA quality control of most, if not all RNA classes.
