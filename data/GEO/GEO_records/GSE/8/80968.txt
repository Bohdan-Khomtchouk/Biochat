TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of SNB19 and SHSY5Y cells with single or double knockdown of SDHD and CDKN1C or SLC22A18

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of knockdown of SDHD with or without knockdown of CDKN1C or SLC22A18 at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in this study was to determine whether the gene expression signature following SDHD knockdown together with SLC22A18 or CDKN1C more closely resembles the signature found in tumors than the signature resulting from SDHD knockdown alone.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from SNB19 and SHSY5Y cells with single or double knockdown of SDHD and CDKN1C or SLC22A18 compared to scrambled control
