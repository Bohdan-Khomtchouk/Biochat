TITLE
Functional genomics study of Aspergillus niger biofilms for the identification and characterization of genes of lignocellulolytic enzymes of industrial interest

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
Aspergillus niger produces a variety of lignocellulolytic enzymes (cellulases, hemicellulases, among others) and is regarded as cell factory for the production of heterologous proteins. Therefore, there is a growing interest in the study of its genes and the understanding of the cellular mechanisms in order to expand its applications. On the other hand, we have shown that enzyme production by A. niger is higher when grown forming biofilms than when grown conventionally in submerged systems. The objective of this study was to perform a global transcriptomic analysis and an expression analysis of both lignocellulases and biofilm regulatory genes as compared to A. niger in submerged culture. DNA microarray assays were performed to investigate the global gene expression which yielded information on the expression of more than 90% of A. niger genes. To further this comparison, the two culture systems were supplemented with different carbon sources (glucose, lactose, xylose and maltose) to establish a differential gene expression under different culture conditions. Also, to validate the differential expression qPCR was performed for quantitative comparison of the transcriptional level of genes in both culture systems.
