TITLE
Genome-wide occupancy of EBF1-wt

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the function of EBF1-H240 residue, genome-wide EBF1 ChIP was performed in A-MuLV transformed pro-B  (Ebf1fl/fl;RERTCre) cells transduced with Ebf1wt and Ebf1H240A expressing vectors.

DESIGN
A-MuLV transformed Ebf1fl/fl RERTCre pro-B cells were treated with 2μM 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT) 24h after transduction.  GFP+ cells were sorted two days after transduction and maintained in a 2μM 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen containing medium for 5 days and the replacement was validated. The cells were expanded further and used for ChIP analysis.
