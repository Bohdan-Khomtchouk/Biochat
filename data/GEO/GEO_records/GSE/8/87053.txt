TITLE
Genome wide DNA methylation  in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) disease and adjacent normal tissue samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and adjacent OSCC samples. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 4,50,000 CpGs in tissue samples. Total 21 samples were taken including 10 paired and 1 unpaired tissues. 6 were HPV Positive and 5 were HPV negative.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 21 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
