TITLE
Transcriptomic approach for understanding molecular mechanisms of in situ environmental toxicity of Hg using an aquatic microalgae and a macrophyte

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
The present study aimed to evaluate the use of transcriptomic analyses of two primary producers to assess the impact of Hg environmental pollution in aquatic primary producers.

DESIGN
2h exposure in situ.
