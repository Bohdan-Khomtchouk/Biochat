TITLE
Transcriptome analyses of rhesus monkey pre-implantation embryos reveal a reduced capacity for DNA double strand break (DSB) repair in primate oocytes and early embryos

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Pre-implantation embryogenesis encompasses several critical events including genome reprogramming, zygotic genome activation (ZGA), and cell fate commitment, of which most remain mechanistically unclear in primate. Here we carried out time-series RNA-seq in 26 single and 8 pooled rhesus monkey oocytes and pre-implantation embryos encompassing representative developmental stages to explore these process.

DESIGN
Transcriptome of 8 pooled and 26 single Rhesus Monkey oocytes and preimplantation embryos of stages from germinal vesicle-stage oocytes to blastocyst.
