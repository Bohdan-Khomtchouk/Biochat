TITLE
Sox18 regulated genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Study of Sox18 regulated genes: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were either transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing SOX18 from an IRES-EGFP casette, or IRES-EGFP alone, or left untreated. After 16 hours, mRNA was isolated and analyzed by hybridization to Affymetrix HG-U133A arrays.
