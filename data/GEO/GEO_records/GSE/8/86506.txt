TITLE
RNA-sequencing of human AML cells expressing high and low levels of CD99

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We FACS purified human AML cells based on CD99 expression and performed RNA-sequencing, demonstrating in CD99 high expression AML cells significant enrichment for hematopoietic stem cell and leukemic stem cell gene expression signatures.

DESIGN
FACS purification of two populations (CD99 high and CD99 low) from eight primary AML specimens.
