TITLE
Expression of rat hepatocytic progenitor cells with and without hepatic Thy1-positive cells in retrorsine/partial hepatectomy treated rats models.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We found that the transplantation of Thy1+ cells transiently increased the liver mass by expanding resident small hepatocy-like progenitor cells(SHPCs). We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of receptors of growth factors of SHPCs clusters with and without Thy1+ cells transplantation.

DESIGN
SHPCs clusters were selected by micro-dissected from Ret/PH livers for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
