TITLE
RNASeq of OMP and TRPC2 neuronal population of zebrafish olfactory sensory neurons

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
RNASeq was performed on mRNA obtained from OMP expressing and TRPC2 expressing olfactory sensory neurons from 48hpf zebrafish embryos. Single-cell suspensions of 48hpf olfactory epithelia were FAC-sorted to obtain RFP expressing or venus expressing cells (RFP sample1: 3500 cells, RFP sample2: 5500 cells. Venus sample1: 676 cells, venus sample2:201 cells. RNA was extracted using QIAGEN RNEasy kit and cDNA was synthesized using a custom oligo-dT primer containing T7 promoter sequence courtesy of Jim Eberwine, University of Pennsylvanina. In vitro RNA amplification was carried out through one round for OMP:RFP neurons and through two rounds for TRPC2:venus neurons as per the protocol in Morris et al, 2011. Adapter-tagged libraries were synthesized using Illumina TruSeq v2.0 and deep-sequenced on HiSeq2500 to obtain ~100million reads per sample.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA expression profiles from 2 types of olfactory sensory neurons
