TITLE
S. mansoni gene expression 21-27d post-infection in wt and RAG-/- mice

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
RNA isolated from S. mansoni worms grown in C57BL/6 or RAG-/- mice at 21, 23, 25 and 27 days post-infection was hybridized to a S. mansoni custom microarray.  Expression was compared to a reference pool containing equal amounts of RNA from each condition and time point assayed. Keywords: Time course with two growth conditions (wt and RAG-/- mice)
