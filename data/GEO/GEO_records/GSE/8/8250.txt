Whole plants of a clone of S. cajamarquence and a clone of S. tuberosum were spray inoculated with Phytophthora infestans sporangial suspension 3000 sporangias/ml until run off. Two isolates were used: PE84006 (race 0) and POX067 (avr 8, 9). Leaves in the middle part of the plants were collected at 72 h and 96 h after inoculation. Leaves of untreated plants were collected as control treatment. Keywords: Direct comparison
