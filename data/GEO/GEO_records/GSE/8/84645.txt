TITLE
Expression analysis of transgenic mice with a cardiac specific overexpression of DSC2.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression data indicate an early up-regulation of inflammatory and fibrotic remodeling pathways in DSC2 transgenic mice vs. non-transgenic control mice. The mice were analyzed at the age of 3.5 and 13 weeks. The mice were analyzed at the age of 3.5 and 13 weeks.

DESIGN
Seven DSC2 transgenic and seven non-transgenic control mice were analyzed at the age of 3.5 and 13 weeks.
