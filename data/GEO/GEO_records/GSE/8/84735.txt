TITLE
Gene expression profile of the germaniumu dioxide-related hearing loss cochlea in CBA mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Various organ failure induced by chronic intake of GeO2 is one of the well known disease related to mitochondrial dysfunction. The 0.15% GeO2 treated CBA mice shows severe hearing loss in 4M. Here we analyzed cochlear gene expression of 6 months old CBA mice using microarrays treated with normal chow or that containing 0.15% GeO2 for four months. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) analysis confirmed that severe age-related hearing loss occured in GeO2 treated mice, whereas no hearing loss occured in normal chow treated mice. Comprehensive gene expression analysis identified genes correlated with GeO2-induced mithochodrial dysfunction genes and revealed that  28 genes encoding components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain were significantly down-regulated. These observations provide evidence that GeO2-induced hearing loss is associated with the down-regulation of genes involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in the cochlea of CBA mice.

DESIGN
To determine the effects of GeO2, each control sample (n=5) was compared to each GeO2-intoxicated (n=5), generating a total of 25 pairwise comparisons. Using DAVIS and EASE, the identified genes were assign to “GO: Biological Process” categories of Gene Ontology Consortium. Furthermore, we used EASE to determine the total number of genes that were assigned to each biological process category, and to perform Fisher exact test. Quality control measures were not used. No replicates were done. Dye swap was not used.
