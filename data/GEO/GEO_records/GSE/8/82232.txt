TITLE
A systematic view on Influenza induced host shut-off

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Influenza A viruses (IAV) induces drastic host shut-off during infection. We use RNA-seq and ribosome profiling to systematically look at host genes RNA and translation levels along IAV infection. We show that host shutoff is mainly achieved by reduction in cellular mRNAs levels and that the high translation levels of IAV transcripts are driven by their strong accumulation compared to host transcripts. Interestingly, our systematic analysis reveals that host transcripts are affected differently by IAV infection and the extent of cellular mRNAs reduction is strongly related to transcriptsâ€™ length and GC content.

DESIGN
Ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq along IAV infection
