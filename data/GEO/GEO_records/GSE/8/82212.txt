TITLE
Modulation of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines by FoxO3a promotes host survival against Salmonella typhimurium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We employed microarray expression profiling to identify genes which are differentially regulated in the absence of FoxO3a, upon Salmonella typhimurium (ST) infection. ST induced gene expression changes were measured in Wild-type and FoxO3a-/- bone marrow derived macroophages at 6 hours post infection. The array showed an enrichment of MAPK signaling and alterations in inflammatory cytokines and ROS regulators in the absence of FoxO3a. Gene expression changes in bone marrow derived macrophages was measured after infection with 10 MOI of Salmonella typhimurium. Control samples were left untreated. Two mice from each genotype were used for the experiment.
