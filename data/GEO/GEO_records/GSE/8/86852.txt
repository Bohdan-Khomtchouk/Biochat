TITLE
Genes expression after ZNF717 knockdown in liver cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive lncRNA array (Arraystar human lncRNA microarray V3), we screened the lncRNAs and mRNA abundant in shZNF717-HepG2 and shCtrl-HepG2 cell lines, and the functions of ZNF717 in liver cancer were analyzed along the following research.

DESIGN
Liver cancer cell lines HepG2 with shZNF717 or without shZNF717 treatment were individually profiled the lncRNA and mRNA expression
