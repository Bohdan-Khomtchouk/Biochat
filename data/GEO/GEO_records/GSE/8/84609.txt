TITLE
Effect of GDF11 on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GDF11 treatment leads to  bone loss in mice and strongly stimulates RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis of bone marrowâ€“derived macrophages (BMMs) in vitro. We used microarrays to identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes in BMMs after GDF11 treatment.

DESIGN
Mouse BMMs were treated with or without GDF11 for RNA extraction and and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
