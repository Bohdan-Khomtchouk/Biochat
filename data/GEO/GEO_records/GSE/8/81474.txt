TITLE
Directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to corneal endothelial cell-like cells: A transcriptomic analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The corneal endothelium is composed of a monolayer of corneal endothelial cells (CECs), which is essential for maintaining corneal transparency. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) hold the promise of providing an abundant donor source for generating CEC cells for cell replacement therapies. Here we demonstrate that CEC-like cells can be efficiently derived from human ESCs. In addition, we performed global gene expression profiling of stem-cell-derived CEC cells, incorporating with adult CEC cells, fetal CEC cells and other human tissue type data. Our data indicate that hESC-derived CEC-like cells closely resemble human fetal CEC cells.

DESIGN
We analyzed a total of 44 samples. 6 samples were sequenced by our group. High-throughput RNA-seq data from human ES cell-derived CEC-like cells samples (n=4) and cultured adult CEC samples (n=2) using Illumina HiSeq 2000. 38 samples are publicly available in GEO.
