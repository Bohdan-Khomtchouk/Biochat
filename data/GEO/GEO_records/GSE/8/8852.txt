TITLE
Evaluation of the effects of shear stress on human dermal microvascular blood and lymphatic endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The lymphatic system removes fluid from the interstitial space and returns it to the blood with a tremendous capacity: during inflammation, lymph flow rates can increase dramatically; however, during chronic lymphedema, there is little or no flow. The ability of lymphatic endothelium to sense and actively regulate this function is unknown, and shear stress is likely a key indicator of lymph flow. We profiled gene expression in human dermal microvascular lymphatic endothelial cells exposed to 0, 2 and 20 dyn/cm2 shear stress as representative of chronic lymphedema, normal, and acute inflammatory conditions, respectively. We found important adaptive responses correlated to multiple aspects of lymphatic function. Importantly, shear stress upregulated intracellular water and solute transporters while decreasing cell-cell adhesion and basement membrane components and increasing cell-matrix interactions. This data indicate that during high loading conditions, both passive and active drainage function increases, while conversely when fluid drainage is blocked, transport function is diminished in the lymphatic endothelium. These data demonstrate the first functional-adaptive response of lymphatic endothelium to flow conditions, thus indicating that the lymphatic endothelium plays an active role in regulating their function. Keywords: Shear stress, dose response, cell type comparison
