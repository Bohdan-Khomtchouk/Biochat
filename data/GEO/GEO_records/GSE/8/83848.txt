TITLE
Tumor Interferon Signaling Regulates a Multigenic Resistance Program to Immune Checkpoint Blockade [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to investigate if interferon signaling regulates immune checkpoint blockade in mouse melanoma model.

DESIGN
Transcription profiling for B16, B16 after chronic interferon treatment, B16 derived checkpoint blockade resistant strain 499 and various knockout from 499, coupled with ATA-seq data.
