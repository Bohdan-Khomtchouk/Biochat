TITLE
Expression data from whole lateral ventricle choroid plexus tissue of young (two months old) and aged (eighteen months old) CD1 male mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to reveal the global expression profiles of young and old whole lateral ventricle choroid plexus tissue.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from whole lateral ventricle choroid plexus tissue followed by RNA amplification and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Each sample contains both lateral ventricle choroid plexi from one male CD1 mouse. A total of six samples (three biological replicates from 2 different ages) were analyzed.
