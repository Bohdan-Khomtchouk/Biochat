TITLE
rfppr-Comparing nuclear gene expression in two CMS-systems using microarray technology

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra05-11_cmsrapeseed - rfppr - -To understand how/if fertility and the mitochondrial background are interlinked. -To understand how the mitochondrial background influences the nuclear gene expression. -Compare and describe the total nuclear gene expression of CMS vs. fertile and CMS vs. Restored. -Describe and analyse genes that differ in expression (of special interest are genes that differs in both comparisons). -Group genes e.g. floral genes, highly expressed genes, transcription factors, nuclear encoded genes targeted for the mitochondrion. -Comparing two CMS-systems to elucidate differences and similarities between them.  - Flower buds from three B. napus lines (Pactol, CMS, Rfo PPR) at one developmental stage (stage 8). Keywords: wt vs mutant comparison
