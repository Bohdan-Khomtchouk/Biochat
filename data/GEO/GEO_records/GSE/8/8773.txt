TITLE
Infection with bradyzoites has a diminished impact on host transcript levels relative to tachyzoite infection.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
5 arrays per condition (covering 3 biological replicate experiments) were performed on Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFFs) at 44 hours post infection.  The four experimental conditions include uninfected " standard " , uninfected " stress " , tachyzoite-infected " standard+TZ " , and bradyzoite-infected " stress+BZ " .  Bradyzoite conversion is induced at 4 hours post infection with replacement of standard DMEM+10% FCS with RPMI+1%FCS buffered with 50mM Hepes to pH 8.15.  Approximately 20% of cells are infected and bradyzoite conversion is > 90% in these experiments.  These data are normalized using 2-D loess (span factor .4).  The calculations in the manuscript are based on  are log2 ratios of normalized channel 2/channel 1 medians. A development or differentiation experiment design type assays events associated with development or differentiation or moving through a life cycle. Development applies to organism(s) acquiring a mature state, and differentiation applies to cells acquiring specialized functions. Developmental Stage: Uninfected (standard or stress medium), or Tachyzoite-infected (standard medium) or Bradyzoite-infected (stress medium) Keywords: development_or_differentiation_design
