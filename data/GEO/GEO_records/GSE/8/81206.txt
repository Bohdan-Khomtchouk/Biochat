TITLE
RNA-Sequencing to identify the transcriptional targets of Rai1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to harvest Rai1-deficient mouse brains from multiple tissues and timepoints and compare the transcriptome with their wild-type littermates. Methods:  mRNA profiles from Rai1 conditional knockouts and wild-type mice were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate using Illumina system. Conclusions: Our study suggests that Rai1 preferentially regulate genes involved in cell adhesion and neural projection.

DESIGN
Cortical, striatal, and hypothalamic mRNA profiles of wild-type and Rai1 conditional knockout mice were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicates.
