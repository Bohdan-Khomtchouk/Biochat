TITLE
Bhlha9 deficiency effect in limb bud

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of mouse limb bud (E10.5) lacking the Bhlha9 gene. Bhlha9 knockout mouse shows syndactyly and poliosis in the limb. This microarray results provides insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying Bhlha9 function in the limb development

DESIGN
DNA microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 array. RNA samples were obtained from the whole limb bud of the E10.5 wild-type and Bhlha9 knockout embryos described above. Total RNA (200 ng) was reverse-transcribed and biotinylated using the GeneChip 3â€² IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix). The microarray data were summarized using the MAS 5.0 method.
