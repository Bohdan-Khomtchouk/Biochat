TITLE
Differential roles of promoters, enhancers, and insulators in cell-type specific gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using antibodies against CTCF and formaldehyde crosslinked chromatin from K562 Chromatin cells. The immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified, fluorescently labeled and hybridized to a 391K element tiling array based on NCBI35 build of the human genome (hg17) that contains overlapping 50-mer oligonucleotides, positioned at every 38 basepairs (bp) throughout the ENCODE regions. Keywords: ChIP-chip
