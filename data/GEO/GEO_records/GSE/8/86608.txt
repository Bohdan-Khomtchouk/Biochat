TITLE
Changes in Gene Expression between Soybean F1 Hybrids and their Parents are Associated with Agronomically Valuable Traits

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Gene expression of the F1 Hybrids between two soybean parents (NMS4-44-329 and N7103) were compared. Changes in gene expression were correlated with agronomic traits.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from leaf matrial harvested from the field in july of 2015. Four replicates were grown at two location in a random complete block design. Each samples is represented from three or four replications form each location
