TITLE
Expression data from Treg cells expressing mutant FoxP3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FoxP3 is a central regulator of immunological tolerance, controlling the development and function of regulatory T (Treg) cells. To dissect the complex processes orchestrated by FoxP3, we investigated impacts of three autoimmune disease-associated missense FoxP3 mutations (i.e., I363V, A384T, R397W) through knock-in mutagenesis in mice. We investigated the impacts of these mutations on Treg cell transcriptome by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
CD4(+)hCD2(+) WT or mutant Treg cells were sorted from FoxP3WT or mutant:hCD2/WT:GFP heterozygous mice. CD4(+)GFP(+) WT Treg cells were also sorted from FoxP3WT or A384T:hCD2/WT:GFP mice. CD4(+)hCD2(-)GFP(-) Tconv cells were also obtained from FoxP3WT:hCD2/WT:GFP mice. All cell populations analyzed were generated in duplicates or triplicates.
