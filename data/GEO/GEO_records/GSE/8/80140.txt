TITLE
Gene expression of myeloma cell lines under hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By using myeloma cell lines (RPMI8226, KMS-11, KMS-12BM, and MM.1S), we conducted whole genome gene screening against the cells that were subjected by chronic hypoxia condition.

DESIGN
We compared four myeloma cell lines (RPMI8226, KMS-11, KMS-12BM, and MM.1S) cultured under hypoxia with cultured under normoxia (48hr) to find new anti-apoptotic gene of myeloma.
