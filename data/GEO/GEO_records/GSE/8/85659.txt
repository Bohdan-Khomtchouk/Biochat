TITLE
Altered gene expression in primitive murine hematopoietic progenitors expressing INV16

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of the INV16 genetic translocation in acute myeloid leukemia may be to alter expression in primitive hematopoietic progenitors of genes important for regulating hematopoiesis. To identify transcriptional targets of INV16 in primitive hematopoietic progenitors, FACS-purified progenitors from murine bone marrow were transduced with retrovirus encoding INV16 and analyzed for alterations in gene expression using whole transcriptome expression arrays.

DESIGN
Normal murine bone marrow cells of the Lineage-negative, c-Kit+, Sca-1+, Flt3-negative phenotype (KSLF) were FACS-purified, transduced with retrovirus encoding INV16 (INV), the non-leukemogenic INV16 mutant deleted of the assembly competent domain (ACD) or empty retroviral vector control (MIB). Productively transduced, GFP-positive cells were FACS-sorted 24 hours later, and RNA isolated and analyzed using Affymetrix whole transcriptome expression arrays. Replicate numbers of sorts/transductions/analyses of 4, 3, and 5 were performed for INV, ACD, and MIB, respectively.
