TITLE
Suppression of antitumor immunity by the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations, a hallmark of gliomagenesis, result in the production of the oncometabolite R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2-HG) which is thought to promote tumorigenesis via DNA methylation. Here we identify an additional immunosuppressive activity of R-2-HG: Tumor cell-derived R-2-HG is taken up by T-cells where it induces a strong and immediate perturbation of calcium- and ATP-dependent signaling events, and polyamine biosynthesis. This results in a profound suppression of antigen-specific T-cell activation and effector cytokine production in experimental mouse and human systems. In a large cohort of WHO grade II and III gliomas, IDH1 mutant tumors display reduced infiltration by T-cells compared to IDH1 wildtype tumors. Spontaneous and induced mutation-specific antitumor immunity to syngeneic IDH1-mutant tumors in MHC-humanized mice is improved by isolated genetic ablation of the neomorphic enzymatic function of mutant IDH1. Taken together, these data attribute a novel, fundamentally non-tumor-cell-autonomous role of an oncometabolite in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment.

DESIGN
We investigated the effects of exogenous R-2-HG on primary human T cells.
