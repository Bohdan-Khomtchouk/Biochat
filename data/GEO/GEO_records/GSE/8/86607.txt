TITLE
Genomic copy number aberrations in multiple synchronous lung cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In current study, we applied array-CGH analysis to detect somatic copy number aberrations across tumor genome to help separate multiple primary lung cancers from metastasis cancers.

DESIGN
Genomic analysis was carried out in 15 lung adenocarcinomas and one regional lymph node metastasis from 6 patients with multiple synchronous lung cancer. WGS/WES was applied to profile the somatic mutations in each tumor, while array-CGH data was analyzed to screen somatic copy number changes.
