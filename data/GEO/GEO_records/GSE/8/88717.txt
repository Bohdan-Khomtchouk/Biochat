TITLE
Comparison of Corynebacterium glutamicum chassis C1 with MB001

ORGANISM
Gluconobacter oxydans

SUMMARY
To identify genes which are differentially expressed in Corynebacterium glutamicum chassis C1 in comparison to the prophage free strain MB001, we performed DNA microarray analyses of C. glutamicum C1 against MB001. For this purpose RNA was isolated from cells cultivated in CGXII minimal medium with 2% glucose (w v-1) and harvested in the exponential growth phase at an OD600 of 5. Four biological replicates were performed.
