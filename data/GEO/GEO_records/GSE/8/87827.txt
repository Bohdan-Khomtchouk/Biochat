TITLE
Characterisation of Burkholderia pseudomallei colony morphology variants by microarray

ORGANISM
Burkholderia pseudomallei K96243

SUMMARY
Burkholderia pseudomallei  is the causative agent of melioidosis which is endemic to Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. It is a Gram-negative soil and water bacterium that represents a potential bioterrorism threat. Colony morphology variation is a remarkable feature in primary clinical cultures of B. pseudomallei. Differences in expression of several potential virulence and survival genes were believed to be associated with B. pseudomallei colony morphology variants. Microarrray approach was used to investigate alterations of the global B. pseudomallei transcriptome profile at the mid-logarithmic phase of growth, among the wild type (WT) and small colony variant (SCV) of B. pseudomallei pre- and post-exposed to human lung epithelial cells, A549. Generally, SCV pre- and post-exposed have lower metabolic requirements and consume lesser energy than WT pre- and post-exposed to A549; however, both WT and SCV may limit their metabolic activity during the infection of A549 cells and this is indicated by the down-regulation of genes implicated in metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrate, lipid, and  other amino acids, and biodegradation of xenobiotics. On the other hand, many well-known virulence and survival factors including T3SS, T6SS, fimbriae, capsular polysaccharides, drug resistance and stress response were up-regulated in both WT and SCV pre- and post-exposed to A549 cells.  Several virulence factors expressed at the mid-logarithmic phase of growth. Microarray analysis on the different morphotypes demonstrated the essential difference in bacterial response associated with virulence and survival pre- and post-exposed to A549 cells.
