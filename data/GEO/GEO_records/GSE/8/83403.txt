TITLE
MHC Transcriptomic landscape at haplotype-specific resolution

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the effect of human MHC haplotype on gene expression phenotype across the MHC, we examine the MHC transcriptomic landscape at the haplotype-specific resolution for three prominent MHC haplotypes (A2-B46-DR9, A33-B58-DR3 and A1-B8-DR3) derived from the RNA-sequencing of MHC-homozygous B-LCLs. We demonstrate that MHC-wide gene expression pattern is dictated by the underlying MHC haplotype and identify 37 differentially expressed genes among the haplotypes.

DESIGN
Comparing gene expression patterns between multiple MHC haplotypes in B-LCLs. A total of 16 libraries were prepared with two libraries generated per cell line.
