TITLE
Expression data from young and aged murine B cell subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The origin and nature of recently discovered age-associated B cells (ABCs) is under investigation. We used a microarray to examine the transcriptional signatures of ABCs, follicular B cells from aged mice (AFO), and follicular B cells from young mice (YFO).

DESIGN
ABC, AFO, and YFO from 5 aged (22-24 mo.) and 5 young (3 mo.) C57BL/6 mice were FACS sorted as sources of RNA.
