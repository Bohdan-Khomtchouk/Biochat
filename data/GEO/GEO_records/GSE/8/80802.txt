TITLE
AZ1366: An inhibitor of tankyrase and the canonical Wnt pathway that limits the persistence of non-small cell lung cancer cells following EGFR inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EGFR-mut NSCLC lines show differential suceptibility to inhibition of tankyrase in the presence of EGFR inhibitors

DESIGN
NSCLC cells were treated in quadruplicate with gefitinib, AZ1366 (tankyrase inhibitor) or a combination thereof
