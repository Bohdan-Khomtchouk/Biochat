TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of K-562 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the global effect of c-Myb knockdown by sequencing the transcriptomes of K-562 cells transfected with control siRNA and si2992 (MYB knockdown), as well as K-562 cells stably expressing TY-tagged wild type c-Myb and c-Myb D152V transfected with si2992

DESIGN
Cells were tranfected with siRNA and 24 hours after total RNA was extracted. Three individual experiments were performed. Libraries were prepared and 125-bp paired-end reads were obtained using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer
