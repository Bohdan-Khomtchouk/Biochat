TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the therapeutic effect of VND3207 on irradiation-induced intestinal injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective was to investigate the therapeutic effect of VND3207 on irradiation-induced intestinal injury at gene expression level. Gene expression profilings between VND3207 and vehicle treated mice which were received 9 Gy total body irradiation were compared.

DESIGN
Mice were divided into two groups (3 mice per group) and administered intragastrically with 100mg/kg VND3207 or equivalent volume of vehicle respectively. Vehicle treated mice were served as controls. Half hours later, all mice were given 9 Gy radiation. 6 hours post radiation, mice jejunum tissues were isolated. Total RNA obtained from jejunum tissues and subjected to gene expression profiling assays.
