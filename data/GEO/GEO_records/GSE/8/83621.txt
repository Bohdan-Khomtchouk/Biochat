TITLE
Mating and sperm-free seminal fluid changes the gene expression in the utero-vaginal junction of White Leghorn hens

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Spermatozoa being foreign to the female are to be promptly eliminated after deposition by the local immune defense of female. However, avoiding the local immune defense sperm can be stored in the utero-vaginal junction for weeks and keep their fertilization ability. Whether, UVJ changes their gene expression after mating or SF-infusion to tolerate thjose forign cells are not understood. Therefore this study was done to observe the gene expression in the utero-vaginal junction after mating or SF-infusion.

DESIGN
Twelve White Leghorn chicken were devided into three groups- either hens were kept without mating or insemination (control, n=4) or paired with a male chicken of the same breed (treatment 1, n=4) or inseminated with sperm-free seminal fluid (treatment 2, n=4). The utero-vaginal junction was removed 24 h after mating or insemination.
