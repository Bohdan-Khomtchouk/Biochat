TITLE
PAX7 is a required target for microRNA-206-induced differentiation of fusion-negative rhabdomyosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genes regulated by miR-206 were identified by microarray analysis in RD cells transfected with a Negative Control (NC) or miR-206 Mimic

DESIGN
Human RD rhabdomyosarcoma cells were transfected with a Negative Control (NC) miRNA Mimic or a miR-206 miRNA Mimic, 48 hours post transfection RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
