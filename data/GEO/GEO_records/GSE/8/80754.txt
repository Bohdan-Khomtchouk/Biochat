TITLE
Breast tumors: different structures of tumor cells [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of morphologically-distinct structures of breast tumors: tubular, alveolar, solid, trabecular structures, and discrete groups of tumor cells in comparison with normal breast epithelium. The aim was to identify transcripts and cell signalling pathways which could be associated with the development of clinical relevant structures of tumor cells.

DESIGN
Five types of morphological structures from breast tumors (n=3) vs. normal epithelial cells from tumor-adjacent normal tissues (n=3)
