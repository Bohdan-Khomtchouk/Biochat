TITLE
Chronic nicotine differentially affects murine transcriptome profiling in isolated cortical interneurons and pyramidal neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nicotine differentially affected subset of genes in Sst- and Thy1- neurons, which might contribute to the distinct effect of nicotine on interneuron and pyramidal neuron activities. Meanwhile, the altered transcripts associated with mitochondrial activity were found between interneurons and pyramidal neurons after chronic nicotine.

DESIGN
We assessed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by nicotine in Sst- or Thy1- neurons, respectively, and then compared DEGs between Sst- and Thy1- neurons in the absence and presence of nicotine.
