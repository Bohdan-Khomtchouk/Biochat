TITLE
Epigenome analysis of Peripheral Blood samples from 53 pediatric ASD patients and 10 pediatric controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of blood samples from patients with ASD and controls. The IlluminaInfinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip  was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs. Samples included 53 individuals with idiopathic ASD (aged 2 to 14) and 10 age-matched controls.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 63 samples were hybridized to the  IlluminaInfinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip
