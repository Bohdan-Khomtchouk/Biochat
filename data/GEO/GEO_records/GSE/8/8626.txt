Arginine methylation at histone H3R2 controls deposition of H3K4 trimethylation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Modifications on histones control important biological processes through their effects on chromatin structure. Methylation at histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) by Set1p is found at the 5’end of active genes and contributes to transcriptional activation by recruiting chromatin remodeling enzymes. An adjacent arginine residue (H3R2) is also known to be asymmetrically dimethylated (H3R2me2a) in mammalian cells6, but its location within genes and its function in transcription are unknown. Here we show that H3R2 is also methylated in budding yeast. Using an antibody specific for H3R2me2a in ChIP-on-Chip analysis we determine the distribution of this modification on the entire yeast genome. We find that H3R2me2a is enriched at all heterochromatic loci, at inactive euchromatic genes and at the 3’-end of moderately transcribed genes. In all cases the pattern of H3R2 methylation is mutually exclusive with the presence of trimethylation at H3K4 (H3K4me3). The inverse correlation reflects the fact that methylation at H3R2 disrupts the ability of the Set1-complex to methylate H3K4. H3R2m2a inhibits specifically the trimethylation of H3K4 because it prevents Spp1 (a Set1-methyltranferase subunit) from binding to histone H3. These results indicate that methylation at H3R2 controls the global distribution of H3K4me3 and provides the first mechanistic insight into the function of arginine methylation on chromatin.
