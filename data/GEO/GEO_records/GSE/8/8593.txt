TITLE
Dosage compensation in the mouse balances up regulation and silencing of X-linked genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dosage compensation in mammals involves silencing of one X chromosome in XX females, and requires expression, in cis, of Xist silencing RNA. Using microarray analysis to assay expression of X-linked genes in mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that dosage compensation also involves global up-regulation of expression from the active X in both males and females. Up-regulation is complete (ie. 2-fold) only after 2-3 weeks of differentiation. X-linked gene silencing in female cells occurs on a gene-by-gene basis throughout differentiation and includes a sub-group of genes silenced prior to the onset of differentiation and independently of enhanced Xist expression. Keywords: dosage compensation, gene silencing, Xist RNA, microarray
