TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of MR1 reactive T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MHC class I-related molecule MR1 presents riboflavin-derived microbial metabolites and folate-derivatives to mucosal-associated invariant T cells, but it is unknown whether MR1 can bind alternative antigens that stimulate other T cell lineages. Here we report that human T cells displaying diverse TCR-α and β chains recognize MR1-expressing cells in the absence of microbial ligands and respond to recombinant MR1 molecules loaded with antigens extracted from stimulatory targets. Transcriptome analysis revealed functional heterogeneity of MR1-reactive T cells (MR1T cells), which displayed differential expression of various transcription factors regulating T cell polarization, proliferation and apoptosis. Accordingly, MR1T cells displayed multiple profiles of chemokine receptor expression and secreted variable combinations of cytokines and growth factors, suggesting a diversity of immunological roles across numerous tissues. Functionally, MR1T cells were capable of inducing dendritic cell maturation and stimulating  anti-microbial responses in intestinal epithelial cells. These data demonstrate that MR1 presents endogenous antigens to a novel population of functionally diverse human T cells.
