TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing wide functional analysis of human mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using RNA-seq, we report here that BM-MSC cells have a distinct transcriptomic signature and express a unique cluster of transcripts in response to 4 hrs LPS.

DESIGN
Examination of effects of LPS-stimulated BM-MSCs, were generated by deep sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000(101 cycles PE lane).
