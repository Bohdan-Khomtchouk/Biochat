TITLE
Messenger RNA profiling of bovine endometrium during the estrous cycle using a custom-made cDNA array

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The endometrium provides optimal conditions for the transport of sperm to the oviduct, to the site of fertilization, and later on for the reception of the embryo. To study these changes on the level of gene expression, a messenger RNA expression profiling of endometrium tissue samples collected from 19 cyclic heifers at five stages of the estrous cycle (days 0, 3.5, 12, 18, 20) was performed. RNA was extracted from these tissue samples and analyzed with a custom-made bovine oviduct and endometrium (BOE) cDNA array. The cDNAs present on the array were derived from several previously conducted differential gene expression studies of bovine endometrium between different stages of the estrous cycle, during early pregnancy, and from studies of bovine oviduct epithelial cells. In all of these studies cDNAs of differentially expressed genes were identified using a combination of subtracted cDNA libraries and cDNA array hybridization. 1,440 cDNA fragments are located on the array. Twenty radioactively labeled cDNA samples (n=4 for each cycle stage) were hybridized with BOE arrays. Raw data were normalized using the BioConductor package vsn. Keywords: time course of gene expression in bovine endometrium during estrous cycle
