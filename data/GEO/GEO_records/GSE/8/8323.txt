TITLE
Dynamics of Ecoli Aerobic to Anaerobic Switch Response

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The experiment is a time course for the aerobic to anaerobic switch response in E. coli.  The data was used to validate the utility of a set of predicted transcription factor gene interactions for modeling the dynamic regulatory response networks of this response.  The transcription factor gene interaction predictions were generated by a semi-supervised classification method that takes advantage of a separate compendium of gene expression and a data set of curated interactions. Keywords: time course, environment change response
