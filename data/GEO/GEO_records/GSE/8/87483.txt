TITLE
Dnmt3a restrains mast cell inflammatory responses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By utilizing mast cells lacking Dnmt3a, we found that this enzyme is involved in restraining mast cell responses to stimuli, both in vitro and in vivo.

DESIGN
GEP analysis of WT and KO mast cells, either resting or stimulated with IgE and antigen for 4 hr and 24 hr
