TITLE
Gene expression by high-throughput sequencing of T47D-MTVL human breast cancer cells upon H1.4 knock-down and multiple H1 variants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression of T47D-MTVL human breast cancer cells expressing Dox-inducible shRNAs against histone H1.4 (120sh) or multiple H1 variants (225sh)

DESIGN
Stable breast cancer-derived cell lines expressing an shRNA against one of each of the histone H1 isoforms in response to doxycycline (Dox) were grown for six days in the presence or absence of Doxicycline, RNA extracted and high-thorughput sequenced. Cell lines used: inducible shRNA against H1.4 or multiple H1 variants and random shRNA-expression vector.
