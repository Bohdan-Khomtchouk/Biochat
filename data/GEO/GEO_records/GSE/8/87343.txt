TITLE
Photosynthesis in C3-C4 intermediate Moricandia species

ORGANISM
Moricandia arvensis

SUMMARY
Analysis of the metabolism in mature leaves of Moricandia species with C3 and C3-C4 intermediate photosynthesis

DESIGN
Mature leaves from Moricandia moricandioides (C3), M. suffruticosa (C3-C4) and M. arvensis (C3-C4) were grown in a climate controlled chamber and harvested for analysis of mRNA, metabites, anatomy and physiology
