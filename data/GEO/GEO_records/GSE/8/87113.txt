TITLE
Distinct roles of transcription factors KLF4, Krox20 and PPARg in adipogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Much of our knowledge on adipogenesis comes from cell culture models of preadipocyte differentiation. Adipogenesis is induced by treating confluent preadipocytes with the adipogenic cocktail, which activates transcription factors (TFs) glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and CREB within minutes and increases expression of TFs C/EBPb/d, KLF4 and Krox20 within hours. All of these TFs have been shown to be capable of promoting adipogenesis in culture when they are overexpressed. However, it has remained unclear whether endogenous KLF4 and Krox20 are required for adipogenesis in culture and in vivo. Using conditional knockout mice and derived white and brown preadipocytes, we show that endogenous KLF4 and Krox20 are dispensable for adipogenesis in culture and brown adipose tissue development in mice. In contrast, the master adipogenic TF PPARg is essential. These results challenge the existing model on transcriptional regulation in the early phase of adipogenesis and highlight the need of studying adipogenesis in vivo.

DESIGN
Expression profiling by RNA-seq during adipogenesis (D0, 1h, 2h, 4h, D2, D7) in 3T3-L1 and brown preadipocytes in culture. Expression profiling by RNA-seq in brown adipose tissues of adult mice or embryos.
