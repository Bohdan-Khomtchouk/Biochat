TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the astrocyte transcriptome in multiple sclerosis normal appearing white matter reveals a neuroprotective role

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling has been performed on astrocytes isolated using laser capture microdissection (LCM) from multiple sclerosis normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and control WM to identify whether specific glial changes exist in NAWM which contribute to lesion development or prevent disease progression

DESIGN
Expression profiling of astrocytes from Multiple sclerosis NAWM and from Neurologically normal control WM.
