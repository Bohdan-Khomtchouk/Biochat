TITLE
Association of dysfunctional synapse defective 1 (SYDE1) with restricted fetal growth â€“ SYDE1 regulates placental cell migration and invasion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we identify SYDE1 as a novel GCM1 target gene. We demonstrate that SYDE1 promotes placental cell migration and invasion and that the GCM1-SYDE1 axis is crucial for placental development. Importantly, retarded placental and fetal growth with defective spongiotrophoblast layer, compromised vasculogenesis, and abnormal maternal-trophoblast interface are noted in the Syde1 homozygous knockout (KO) placenta. Along this line, decreased SYDE1 expression is observed in human IUGR placentas. We further demonstrated that components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and Syde2 are differentially expressed in Syde1-KO placenta, which might contribute to normal neonatal delivery in Syde1-KO mothers

DESIGN
E14.5 wild-type and Syde1-knockout placentas were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The differentially expressed genes between wild-type and Syde1-knockout were selected and validated with quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting.
