TITLE
Next generation sequencing of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell line KYSE-180 single cell transcriptomes for radio-resistance analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Single cell RNA-seq could observe heterogeneity of cell transcriptomes. The goals of this study are to compare the changes of  ESCC cell line KYSE-180 RNA profiles in response to different doses of radiotherapy and to analyze the radio-resistance related genes.

DESIGN
Methods: Cultured KYSE-180 cells accepted accumulative irradiation doses of 0 Gy, 12 Gy or 30 Gy, respectively. Single cell libraries were generated by Smart-seq 2 kit, sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript expression level with TopHat followed by DESeq2/Monocle.
