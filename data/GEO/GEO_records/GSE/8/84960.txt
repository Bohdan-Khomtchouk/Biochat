TITLE
Smooth muscle cell mineralocorticoid receptor regulation of vascular microRNAs with aging

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We used a smooth muscle cell-specific mineralocorticoid receptor knockout mouse to generate young and aged MR-intact and SMC-MR-KO aortic miRNA to examine the effect of age on vascular miRNA alterations in the presence and absence of SMC-MR.
