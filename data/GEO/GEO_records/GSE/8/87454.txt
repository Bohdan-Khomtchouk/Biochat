TITLE
Effects Of An Encapsulated Fruit And Vegetable Juice Concentrate On Obesity-Induced Systemic Inflammation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of using a fruit and vegetable juice concentrate to reduce systemic inflammation in obesity. The hypothesis tested whether the presence of polyphenols in the fruit and vegetable juice concentrate could reduce the expression of systemic inflammatory genes in the blood of Obese patients with high levels of plasma CRP (≥3.0).  Results provide evidence that systemic inflammatory genes/ and or pathways may be modulated by the fruit and vegetable juice concentrate.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from blood of 16 Obese individuals, with High plasma CRP (≥3.0), before and after 8 week intervention with fruit and vegetable juice concentrate.
