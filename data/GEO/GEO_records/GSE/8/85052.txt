TITLE
An integrated genomic approach for the study of mandibular prognathism in the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) I

ORGANISM
Dicentrarchus labrax

SUMMARY
A sea bass oligo microarray platform was used to profile gene expression in whole heads of 38 days-old sea bass affected by prognathism, a skeletal malformation that strongly affects sea bass production. Two different conditions: i) prognathous individuals, and ii) normal individuals were analyzed. For each condition, total RNA was extracted from three (3) independent biological replicates, each consisting of pools of five (5) heads.

DESIGN
In this study, we analyzed six (6) samples, three (3) pools of heads dissected from normal sea bass and three (3) dissected from individuals affected by prognathism. Gene expression profiling was performed using the GPL9663 Dicentrarchus labrax Oligo Microarray platform (6 arrays, no replicate) based on single-colour detection (Cyanine-3 only).Â  This series contains samples reanalyzed from GSE19041.
