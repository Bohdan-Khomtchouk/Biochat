TITLE
Gene expression profile of colonic Atoh1+ve cells and their descendants in DSS-colitis mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Atoh1 is the master transcription factor of secretory-type intestinal epithelial cells. By using a lineage-tracing model of Atoh1+ve cells, those Atoh1+ve epithelial cells and their descendants were collected from the colon of DSS-colitis mice or from the control mice, and subjected to global gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Atoh1+ve  epithelial cells and their descendants collected from the colon of DSS-colitis mice (DSS) vs Atoh1+ve epithelial cells and their descendants collected from the colon of untreated mice (control). Biological replicates: One for each condition, independently collected from each group of mice. One replicate per array.
