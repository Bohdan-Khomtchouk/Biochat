Gene regulation in Erbb2 transfected NIH3T3 cells using tet-off system

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
V-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2; synonyms HER2, NEU) encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein with tyrosine kinase-specific activity that acts as a major switch in different signal-transduction processes. ERBB2 amplification and overexpression have been found in a number of human cancers, including breast, ovary and kidney carcinoma. Our aim was to detect ERBB2-regulated target genes regulated in Erbb2 transfected murine fibroblast cells after tetracycline treatment to stop the overexpression of ERBB2. Changes in gene expression patterns in these cells after the switch-off of Erbb2 expression was analysed after 8 different periods of time after the treatement (1h-7d). Identification of co-regulated genes and in cluster analysis were performed. Keywords: Erbb2, cDNA microarrays, murine fibroblasts,
