TITLE
The de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3C protects male fertility from transposon activity (Bisulfite-seq).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To evaluate the impacts of the Dnmt3C IAP mutation in the methylome of germ cells, mutant and control whole genome bisulfite sequencing experiments were conducted starting from genomic DNA obtained from FACS-sorted germ cells.

DESIGN
Comparison of whole genome methylome maps of germ cells of mutant Dnmt3C IAP/IAP and control Dnmt3C IAP/WT isolated from testis at 10 dpp.
