TITLE
Hormone responsive organoid cultures of human endometrium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Endometrial gland cultures were established from human non-pregnant endometrium and decidua. We analysed the global gene expression profile of the human endometrial gland organoid cultures to assess the similarity of their molecular signature to the tissue of origin. Organoid cultures established from decidua were also included in the analysis to assess their similarity to endometrial dervied cultures.

DESIGN
For each tissue sample, the total RNA obtained from established organoids were used compared to both the initial glandular digests and stromal cells isolated from the same endometrial biopsy. Glands, Organoids and Stroma samples 1 to 7 refer to endometrial derived samples. Organoids 8 to 13 refer to decidua derived organoids.
