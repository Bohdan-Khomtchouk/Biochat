TITLE
Gene expression in the quail MBH under short and long day conditions.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Various physiological processes and behaviours are controlled by changing daylength. To dissect genes involved in the photoperiodic changes in physiology and behaviour, global expression analysis was performed using quail kept under short and long day conditions. Keywords: time course
