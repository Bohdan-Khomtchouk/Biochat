TITLE
Ectopic expression of miR-625-3p in SW620 colorectal cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oxaliplatin (oxPt) resistance in colorectal cancers (CRC) is a major medical problem, and predictive markers are urgently needed. Recently, miR-625-3p was reported as a promising predictive marker. Here, we have used in vitro models to show that miR-625-3p functionally induces oxPt resistance in CRC cells, and have identified signalling networks affected by miR-625-3p. The p38 MAPK activator MAP2K6 was shown to be a direct target of miR-625-3p, and, accordingly, was downregulated in patients not responding to oxPt therapy. miR-625-3p resistance could be reversed in CRC cells by anti-miR-625-3p treatment and by ectopic expression of a miR-625-3p insensitive MAP2K6 variant. In addition, by reducing p38 MAPK signalling using either siRNA technology, chemical inhibitors to p38 or by ectopic expression of dominant negative MAP2K6 protein we induced resistance to oxPt. Transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome profiles revealed inactivation of MAP2K6-p38 signalling as one likely mechanism a possible driving force behind of oxPt resistance.   Our study shows that miR-625-3p induces oxPt resistance by abrogating MAP2K6-p38 regulated apoptosis and cell cycle control networks, and corroborates the predictive power of miR-625-3p

DESIGN
Ectopic induction of miR-625-3p or scramble control shRNA were induced by independent treatment with 50 ng/mL doxycycline for 48 hours.
