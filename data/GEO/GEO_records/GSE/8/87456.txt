TITLE
Hypoxic transcriptome of SQ20B human head and neck cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have carried out deep directional sequencing of  mRNA isolated from normoxic (control) SQ20B cells (N=4) and hypoxic (16h at 0.5% oxygen) cells (N=4).

DESIGN
Normoxic compared to hypoxic, with 4 biological replicates.
