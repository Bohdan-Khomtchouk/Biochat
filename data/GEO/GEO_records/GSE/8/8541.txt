TITLE
Evaluation of the impact of neoplastic histamine secretion on melanoma progression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We previously showed that transgenic enhancement of histamine production in B16-F10 melanomas strongly supports tumor growth in C57Bl/6 mice (Cancer Res, 2005 Pos et al.). In this array experiment, gene expression profiles of transgenic mouse melanomas, secreting different amounts of histamine, were compared by whole genome microarrays. Keywords: genetic modification
