TITLE
Gene expression and lung tumors: screening for markers that discriminate tumor histology and genetic background.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The success of targeted therapies creates a need to discriminate tumors accurately by their histological and genetic characteristics. Here, we used cDNA microarray analysis to identify gene expression profiles and single markers that recapitulate the pathological and genetic background (i.e., BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, LKB1, PIK3CA, and TP53 gene alterations) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Gene expression profiles were determined for 6 normal lung tissues and 69 lung tumors from patients diagnosed with NSCLC. We performed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering with the most variably expressed transcript to investigate whether there was evidence for natural grouping samples based on similarity in gene expression profiles. We examined the relationship between the clusters of tumors and patient and tumor characteristics such as gender, smoking status, histological type, degree of differentiation, tumor size, lymph node involvement and genetic background. We used a supervised analysis to identify the genes that are important for distinguishing subgroups of tumors defined by histological type. Moreover, we used this supervised approach to search for markers that characterize those tumors carrying EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA and TP53 alterations. We identify several genes with characteristic patterns of expression in each tumor histological type (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) and we found that the presence of EGFR mutations result in a particular expression profile. Keywords: Transciption profiling of tumors with different histological and genetic background.
