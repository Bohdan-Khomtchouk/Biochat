TITLE
Transcriptional factor FOXO3a controls the persistance of memory CD4+ T cells in HIV infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Persistence of memory CD4+ T cells in ECs was coupled with the inactivation of FOXO3a transcriptional activities, which we have previously identified as a critical regulator of TCM survival. Indeed, expression levels of transcriptional targets of FOXO3a, endowed with pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative functions, were lower in TCM and TEM from ECs as compared to ST individuals. Silencing the transcriptionally active form of FOXO3a by siRNA rescued TCM and TEM of STs from Fas-mediated apoptosis. Moreover the expression of FOXO3a dominant negative form (FOXO3a Nt) rescued the long-term survival of TCM from STs as these cells persisted as long as those derived from ECs. Overall, these studies indicate that FOXO3a activation is an important mediator of the shortened survival and heighteined turnover of TCM and TEM in chronic HIV infection. Targeting this pathway may provide a strategy to preserve memory T cell numbers in HIV infection. Keywords: comparative gene profile, cell-type comparison
