TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of coronavirus-infected human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment is to identify chromatin and transcription factor binding dynamics in host gene expression upon infection of human Huh7 hepatoma carcinoma cells  with human coronavirus HCoV-229E as compared to uninfected cells and in comparison to cells stimulated by  IL-1alpha (10ng/ml) for 1h. All experiments have been performed at 33Â°C which is required for sufficient viral entry/replication.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq
