TITLE
Flagellin-mediated effects of Salmonella enteritidis on gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells stimulated with flagellated or aflagellated S. enteritidis or recombinant flagellin. Results provide insight into how flagellin mediates innate immune responses in intestinal epithelial cells. Keywords: Gene expression analysis
