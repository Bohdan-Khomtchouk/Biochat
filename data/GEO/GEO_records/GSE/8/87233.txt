TITLE
Quantitative predictions of protein interactions with long non-coding RNAs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Computational Approach to define binding sites on lncRNAs validated with eCLIP data

DESIGN
Using Global Score performances, we investigated protein interactions with Xist lncRNA, the master regulator of X chromosome inactivation. We validated our calculations by means of enhanced individual nucleotide CLIP (eCLIP)Â
