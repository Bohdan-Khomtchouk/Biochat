TITLE
Genome-wide mRNA expression profiling for Wild Type and Itch-/- colonic mucosa Transcriptomes by RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To test the hypothesis that defects in the termination of inflammatory signaling led to colon inflammation, we isolated RNA from the colonic mucosa of Itch-/- mice and from the colonic mucosa of wild-type mice treated with DSS and performed genome-wide mRNA expression profiling by RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles comparison between wild type (WT) colon and Itch-/- mice inflammed colon
