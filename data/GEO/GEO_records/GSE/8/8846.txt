TITLE
Zebrafish response to Mycobacterium marinum infection (Compugen series)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Mycobacteria infect macrophages that aggregate with additional macrophages and lymphocytes to form granulomas. We have used a functional genomics approach to identify immune response genes expressed during granuloma formation in Mycobacterium marinum-infected transparent zebrafish larvae where individual infection steps can be viewed in real time. We assessed RNA expression profiles from zebrafish larvae that were either infected with Mycobacterium marinum or mock-infected. Zebrafish infections were performed at 1 day post-fertilization (dpf), and samples were derived from pools of 6dpf zebrafish larvae. Keywords: host response to infection
