TITLE
Social status alters immune regulation and response to infection [cell_specific_RNAseq]

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Social status is one of the strongest predictors of disease risk and mortality in humans, and often influences Darwinian fitness in social mammals more generally. To understand the biological basis of these effects, we combined a functional genomics approach with sequential social status manipulations in rhesus macaques to investigate how social status alters immune function. We demonstrate causal, but largely plastic, effects of social status on immune cell proportions, cell type-specific gene expression levels, and the gene expression and cytokine response to infection. Further, we identify specific transcription factor signaling pathways that explain these differences, particularly status-associated polarization of the TLR4 signaling pathway towards pro-inflammatory versus anti-viral responses. Our findings provide an unprecedented level of insight into the direct biological effects of social inequality on immune function, thus contributing to an improved understanding of social gradients in health and the evolution of social hierarchies. For social status, please refer to table S1 in the manuscript.
