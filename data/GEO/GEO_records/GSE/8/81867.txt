TITLE
miRNA-mediated expression switch of cell adhesion genes driven by microcirculation in chip

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Changes in cell adhesion molecule (CAM) expression and miRNAs regulating them are known to be involved in malignant progression in colon cancer. We investigated expression profiles of CAM genes and non-coding RNAs in CaCo2 colon cancer cells in static culture and under dynamic flow conditions perfused in microfluidic chip emulating physiological microenvironment. We incubated monolayers of CaCo2 cells in TranswellÂ® units either under static conditions or under flow in a microfluidic chip. We identified 7 up-regulated CAM genes (CD44, CDH7, CEACAM5, CEACAM6, CYR61, L1CAM and VCAN), 7 down-regulated genes (COL12A1, FGA, FGB, FGG, GJA1, ITGA5 and LAMA1) and 69 miRNAs targeting them under the influence of microcirculation. The revealed network comprised CAM genes known to interact with each other and 13 miRNAs simultaneously regulating more than one of them.
