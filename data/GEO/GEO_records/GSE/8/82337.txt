TITLE
Early Subclinical Inflammation Correlates with Outcomes in Positive Crossmatch Kidney Allografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate correlations between early subclinical findings (10 and 90 day histology and gene expression data) and late outcomes (transplant glomerulopathy and graft loss) in positive crossmatch kidney transplants (+XMKTx).

DESIGN
Samples from positive crossmatch kidney transplant biopsies (10d or 90d protocol biopsies) were compared to control (negative crossmatch) biopsies obtained at 90d. The experimental design includes patients on or off a C5 inhibitor (Eculizumab). At 10d the XM+ patients are NoC5 or C5+_ON. At 90d the XM+ patients are NoC5 or C5+_On (still on the drug at 90d) or C5+_Off (originally treated with C5 but now off drug).
