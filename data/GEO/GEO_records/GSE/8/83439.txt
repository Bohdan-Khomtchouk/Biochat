TITLE
caArray_nevil-00068: Secretory Activation in Wildetype Mice from Preg12 to Lac9

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to generate a baseline microarray data set in order to investigate natural changes in gene expression profiles from mid pregnancy throuh mid lactation in the murine mammary gland. Four animals per time point were sacrificed, mammary tissue was collected less the lymph node, and data were gathered using MicroArray Suite v.5.0. The resulting data were used to evaluate the differences in gene expression among the timepoints investigated across secretory activation with emphasis on lipid production and secretion. Further, we hope this data set will serve as a baseline model for pathway perturbation studies.
