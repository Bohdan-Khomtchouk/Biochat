TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the NLPHL cell line DEV after coculture with T cells and monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) is an indolent lymphoma, but can transform into diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), showing a more aggressive clinical behavior. Little is known about these cases on the molecular level. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to characterize DLBCL transformed from NLPHL (LP-DLBCL) by gene expression profiling (GEP). GEP revealed an inflammatory signature pinpointing to a specific host response. In a coculture model resembling this host response, DEV tumor cells showed an impaired growth behavior. Mechanisms involved in the reduced tumor cell proliferation included a downregulation of MYC and its target genes. Lack of MYC expression was also confirmed in 12/16 LP-DLBCL by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, CD274/PD-L1 was upregulated in tumor cells after coculture with T cells or monocytes and its expression was validated in 12/19 cases of LP-DLBCL. Thereby, our data provide new insights into the pathogenesis of LP-DLBCL and a concrete explanation of the relatively low tumor cell content. Moreover, our results suggest that treatment of these patients with checkpoint inhibitors may enhance an already ongoing host response in these patients.

DESIGN
DEV cells were MACS purified after coculture experiments with T cells and monocytes, and gene expression profiling was performed.
