TITLE
The effect of VGLL4  on HCT116 colorectal cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
VGLL4, a tumor suppressor, is negative regulator of Hippo/YAP signaling. To explore the role of VGLL4 during colorectal cancer cell line, we explore microarray analysis of HCT116 cells after stable transfection of VGLL4 and shVGLL4 for 48 h.

DESIGN
Scr-1, Scr-2, shVGLL4-1, shVGLL4-2
