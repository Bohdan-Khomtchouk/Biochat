TITLE
Transcription start site positioning is not affected by +1 nucleosome depletion

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The relationship between the positioning of nucleosomes and transcription start sites (TSSs) is unclear. Here, we report that deletion of the Fun30 class chromatin remodelers Fft2 and Fft3 leads to depletion of +1 nucleosome occupancy. Strikingly, in the vast majority of cases, this depletion had no impact on the placement of the TSS, favoring a model where TSS placement is primarily DNA sequence-driven.Â 

DESIGN
5'-Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) of S. pombe wild type and fft2fft3 double mutant cells, in triplicates.
