TITLE
Gene expression data from MDSC subsets, cell lines and tumor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that monocytic and granulocytic subsets of myeloid derived suppressor cells (mMDS, gMDSC) infiltrated in the primary tumor and distant organs with different time kinetics regulate spatiotemporal tumor plasticity. Using co-culture experiments and syngeneic mouse models, we provide evidence that tumor infiltrated mMDSCs facilitate tumor cell dissemination from the primary site by inducing EMT/CSC phenotype. In contrast, pulmonary gMDSC infiltrates support the metastatic growth by reverting EMT/CSC phenotype and in turn promote tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, lung-derived gMDSCs isolated from tumor bearing animals significantly enhance metastatic growth of already disseminated tumor cells. A “metastatic gene signature” identified in aggressive murine tumors following co-culture with MDSC subsets predicts poor patient survival in majority of human solid tumors suggesting clinical implications of our studies.

DESIGN
We utilized monocytic and granulocytic subsets of myeloid derived suppressor cells (mMDS, gMDSC) from the bone marrow , and infiltrated in the primary tumor and lungs to determine their gene expression profile. Using co-culture experiments we analyzed the mMDSC and gMDSC induced gene expression signature of the tumor cells
