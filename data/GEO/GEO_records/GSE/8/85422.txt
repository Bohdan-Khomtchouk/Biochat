TITLE
Gene expression analysis of CD122HI versus CD122LO Vγ7+ murine small intestinal IEL at 14-17 days of age

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background: The neonatal (D14-17) murine small intestinal epithelium is enriched for Vγ7+ IEL displaying an ‘immature’ CD122LO cell surface phenotype. We believe these cells are precursors for signature CD122HI Vγ7+ IEL that predominate among small intestinal IEL from postnatal D21. Method: To further characterise this potential precursor-product relationship, CD122hi Vg7+ and CD122lo Vg7+ IEL were purified from individual D14-D17 mice on four independent occasions and compared by total RNAseq. Conclusion: ~3000 genes are differentially expressed between CD122HI and CD122LO murine Vg7+ neonatal IEL

DESIGN
4 independent Paired samples of CD122hi Vg7+ and CD122lo Vg7+ IEL were purified from the small intestinal epithelium of pooled 14-17 day old mice. RNA was isolated from sorted samples. Gene expression analysis was performed by total RNAseq.
