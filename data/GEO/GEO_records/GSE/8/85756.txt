TITLE
BPTF Depletion Enhances NK Cell Mediated Antitumor Immunity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In mouse models, the bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor (BPTF) chromatin remodeling subunit in tumor cells suppresses natural killer (NK) cell antitumor activity. In vitro, BPTF suppresses NK cell cytolytic activity to mouse and human cancer cell lines, demonstrating a conserved function.

DESIGN
BPTF-depleted tumors from BALB/c or NSG mice were compared to control tumors using gene expresion microarray experiments.
