TITLE
Genome-wide location analysis of Abf1 and Reb1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Abf1 and Reb1, two general regulatory factors playing roles at promoters and other genome functional sites in budding yeast, were mapped genome-wide by ChIP-sequencing using strains expressing TAP-tagged versions of the proteins. As expected on the basis of previous in silico analysis of promoter regions, we found that these factors are enriched at the promoters of ribosome biogenesis (Ribi) genes, a large regulon of more than 200 genes required for ribosome biosynthesis and assembly, and known to be coordinately regulated in response to nutrient availability and cellular growth rate.

DESIGN
The reported analysis was designed as a confirmative experiment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of TAP-tagged Abf1 and Reb1 was carried out using logarithmically growing yeast cells, as described in Fermi et al (2016) Nucleic Acids Res, March 25, doi:10.1093/nar/gkw194
