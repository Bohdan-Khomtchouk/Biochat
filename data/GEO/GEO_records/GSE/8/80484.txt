TITLE
Indole signaling and (micro)algal auxins decrease the virulence of Vibrio campbellii, a major pathogen of aquatic organisms

ORGANISM
Vibrio campbellii ATCC BAA-1116

SUMMARY
Vibrio campbellii BAA-1116 was used as a Harveyi clade model organism to determine the impact of indole signaling on virulence. Gene expression analysis of V. campbellii grown in LB35 broth with or without 100 Î¼M indole revealed that indole decreased: (1) V. campbellii virulence in shrimp and prawn challenge assays, (2) exopolysaccharide production, and (3) swimming motility. The results also indicated that indole inhibits quorum sensing-regulated bioluminescence and blocks the three-channel quorum sensing system by interfering with quorum sensing signal transduction.
