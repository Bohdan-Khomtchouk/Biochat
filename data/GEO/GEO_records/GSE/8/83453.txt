TITLE
Gene expression profile of calcified bicuspid, tricuspid and normal human aortic valves

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify genes differentially expressed between calcified bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) and tricuspid valves with (TAVc) and without (TAVn)  aortic valve stenosis. Ten human BAV and nine TAVc were collected from male who underwent primary aortic valve replacement. Eight TAVn were obtained from male who underwent heart transplantation. mRNA levels were measured using Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip and compared between valve groups.

DESIGN
Gene expression was performed in three groups of human aortic valves including 10 calcified bicuspid aortic valves, 9 stenotic tricuspid valves and 8 tricuspid normal valves. A total of 27 samples are included in this dataset.
