TITLE
Gene expression in response to fluconazole vs. the combination of  fluconazole and osthole

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Candida albicans comparing fluconazole treated cells with fluconazole and osthole treated cells

DESIGN
Clinical fluconazole-resistant strain 0304103 was selected to carry out the expression profile microarray. Two-condition experiment, fluconazole treated vs. fluconazole and osthole treated cells. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 transfected, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
