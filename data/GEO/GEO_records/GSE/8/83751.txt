TITLE
Acetylation enhances TET2 function in protecting against abnormal DNA methylation during oxidative stress [A2780 TET2 KO - methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of A2780 control cells (Scr_1 and Scr_2), and A2780 TET2 KO clones (KO1.1, KO1.36, and KO2.32). The Illuminaâ€™s Infinium Human Methylation450 Beadchip Kit (WG-314-1001) was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs.

DESIGN
A2780 cells were infected with either Control or LentiCRISPR virus against TET2 gene for 2 days, followed by puromycin selection. Single clones were selected and validated after ~8 weeks selection in puromycin. Genome wide DNA methylation of control and KO clones were profiled.
