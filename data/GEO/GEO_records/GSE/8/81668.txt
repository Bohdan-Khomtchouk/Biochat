TITLE
The Proteasome Stress Regulon is Controlled by a Pair of NAC Transcription Factors in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report the expression differences between 5DAG Arabidopsis Col-0, rpn10-1, and rpn12a-1 seedlings treated with 100 uM MG132 for 0, 3, or 24 hours.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different Arabidopsis seedling genotypes (Col-0 (wild-type), and the exon trap mutants rpn10-1 and rpn12a-1) treated with 100 uM MG132 for either 0, 3, or 24 hours.
