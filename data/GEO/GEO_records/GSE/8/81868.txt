TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of promoter DNA associated to the T2D patients in Taiwan

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The GeneChipÂ® Human Promoter 1.0R Array is designed for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. Sequences used in the design of the Human Promoter array were selected from NCBI human genome assembly (Build 34). Repetitive elements were removed by RepeatMasker.

DESIGN
In total 40 samples, 30 T2D patients and 10 healthy control were selected for human DNA promoter methylation status was tested.
