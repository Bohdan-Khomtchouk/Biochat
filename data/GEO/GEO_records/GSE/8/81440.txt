TITLE
Identification of an NKX3.1-G9a-UTY regulatory network that controls prostate differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of NKX3.1 in prostate differentiation, we employed transcriptome analysis of mouse seminal vesicle (from 15-month-old Nkx3.1+/+ mice); mouse prostate (from 4-month-old Nkx3.1+/+ and Nkx3.1-/- mice); human prostate cells (RWPE1 cells engineered with empty vector (altered pTRIPZ), NKX3.1 wild type over-expression, and NKX3.1 (T164A) mutant over-expression); and tissue recombinants (generated from combining engineered mouse epithelial cells (seminal vesicle epithelial cells or prostate epithelial cells from 2-month-old mice) and rat UGS mesenchymal cells). Mouse tissue or human cells were snap frozen for subsequent molecular analysis. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
