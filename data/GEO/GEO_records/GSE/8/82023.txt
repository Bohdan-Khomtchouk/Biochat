TITLE
Mapping Variation in Cellular and Transcriptional Response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study characterizes the genetic basis of variation in the immunomodulatory effects of the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D). This was done by mapping  quantitative traits of 1,25D response both at the cellular and transcriptional level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

DESIGN
Total RNA extraced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 85 healthy individuals of African-African ancestry treated with 1,25D or the vehicle control, ethanol, for 6 hours.
