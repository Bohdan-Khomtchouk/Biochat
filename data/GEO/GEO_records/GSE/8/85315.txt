TITLE
Genome-wide changes in H3K4me3 after MEN1 silencing in MCF-7  cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq using H3K4me3 antibodies in MCF-7 cells after induction of small hairpin RNA's directed at the MEN1 mRNA or a control sequence. We demonstrate that at a selected group of loci H3K4me3 is affected by MEN1 silencing.

DESIGN
Comparison of genome-wide H3K4me3 binding after ShMEN1 induction vs ShCtrl, in duplicate.
