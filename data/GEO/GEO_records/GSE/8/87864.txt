TITLE
Differential gene expression data from MCF7 and MCF7_ADR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially up or downregulated genes in MCF7_ADR cell compare to MCF7, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling. We used microarray to evaluate the up or down regulated genes in doxorubicin resistant MCF7_ADR cells compare to MCF7

DESIGN
Healthy MCF7 and MCF7_ADR cells were used for extraction of RNA and  hybridization on Affymetrix microarray
