TITLE
High-throughput miRNA sequencing and identification of biomarkers for forensically relevant biological fluids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, small RNAs were isolated from individual donations of eight forensically relevant biological fluids (blood, semen, vaginal fluid, menstrual blood, saliva, urine, feces, and perspiration) and subjected to next generation sequencing using the IlluminaÂ® Hi-Seq platform.  Sequencing reads were aligned and annotated against miRbase release 21, resulting in a list of miRNAs and their relative expression levels for each sample analyzed.  Body fluids with high bacterial loads (vaginal fluid, saliva, and feces) yielded relatively low annotated miRNA counts, likely due to oversaturation of small RNAs from the endogenous bacteria.  Both body-fluid specific and potential normalization miRNAs were identified for further analysis as potential body fluid identification tools for each body fluid.

DESIGN
32 samples - 3-5 replicates of each human biological fluid:  venous blood, urine, semen (normal and vasectomized), vaginal secretions, menstrual secretions, perspiration, feces, saliva
