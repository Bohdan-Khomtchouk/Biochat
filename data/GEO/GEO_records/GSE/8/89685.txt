TITLE
Improvement of isopropanol tolerance of Escherichia coli using adaptive laboratory evolution and omics technologies

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
To understand the mechanism of isopropanol tolerance of Escherichia coli for improvement of isopropanol production, we performed genome re-sequencing and transcriptome analysis of isopropanol tolerant E. coli strains obtained from parallel adaptive laboratory evolution under IPA stress.

DESIGN
To examine the contribution of the gene expression changes to the isopropanol tolerance, transcriptome of the parent strain (duplicated) and 6 tolerant strains were analyzed.
