TITLE
Progressive retinal atrophy in the Hungarian Puli

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a common cause of blindness in many pure and mixed breed dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). The typical onset of PRA begins with gradual night vision loss followed by day vision loss due to the death of rod and cone receptors, respectively. There are currently no mutations or genes reported to be causative or associated with PRA in the Hungarian Puli. In this study, we use an extensive list of 53 known PRA genes to screen for putative causal variants in this breed of dog.

DESIGN
2 cases, 12 controls
