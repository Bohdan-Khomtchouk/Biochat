TITLE
DNA methylation in lung cells is a key modulator of asthma endotypes and genetic risk [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated genome-wide RNASeq data from freshly isolated airway epithelial cells of asthmatics and non-asthmatics. This data was paired with genome-wide genetic and methylation data from the same individuals allowing for an integrated analysis of genetic, transcriptional, and epigenetic signatures in asthma.

DESIGN
examination of genome-wide genome-wide gene expression levels and comparison to phenotypes
