TITLE
Modulation of nonsense-mediated decay by rapamycin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rapamycin is a naturally occurring macrolide whose target is at the core of nutrient and stress regulation in a wide range of species. Despite well-established roles as an inhibitor of cap-dependent mRNA translation, relatively little is known about its effects on other modes of RNA processing. Here, we characterize the landscape of rapamycin-induced post-transcriptional gene regulation. Transcriptome analysis of rapamycin-treated cells revealed genome-wide changes in alternative mRNA splicing and pronounced changes in NMD-sensitive isoforms. We demonstrate that despite well-documented attenuation of cap-dependent mRNA translation, rapamycin can augment NMD of certain transcripts. Rapamycin-treatment significantly reduces the levels of both endogenous and exogenous PTC-containing mRNA isoforms and its effects are dose-, UPF1- and 4EBP-dependent manner. The PTC-containing SRSF6 transcript exhibits a shorter half-life upon rapamycin-treatment as compared to the non-PTC isoform. Rapamycin-treatment also caused depletion of PTC-containing mRNA isoforms from polyribosomes, underscoring the functional relationship between translation and NMD. Enhanced NMD activity also correlates with an enrichment of the nuclear Cap Binding Complex (CBC) in rapamycin-treated cells. Our data demonstrate that rapamycin modulates global RNA homeostasis by NMD.

DESIGN
We performed cytoplasmic RNA-seq of HEK 293 T cells stimulated with rapamycin, emetine or control, in triplicates.
