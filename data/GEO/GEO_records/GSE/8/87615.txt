TITLE
ASCL1 mediates neuronal differentiation of primary GBM stem cell cultures upon Notch signalling blockade [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ASCL1 mediates neuronal differentiation of GBM stem cell (GSC) cultures upon Notch signalling inhibition. We sought to identify gene expression changes that were specific to ASCL1 function. In this dataset, we include RNA-seq data obtained from GSC cultures harbouring wildtype or CRISPR-deletion of ASCL1. We assessed differential gene expression between wildtype and ASCL1-knockout after treatment with gamma-secretase inhibitor for 7 days.

DESIGN
Glioblastoma cells with a genetic knockout of ASCL1 is compared to wildtype ASCL1 glioblastoma cells treated with vehicle (DMSO) or gamma-secretase inhibitor (n = 3 biological replicates; total = 12 samples)
