SUMMARY
We have developed a method for rapidly identifying early, regionally-expressed molecules: FACS-Assisted Microdissection of Photolabeled cells (FAM-P). For our first FAM-P project, we injected embryos with purified Kaede protein, a stony coral protein that fluoresces at 514 nm (green) prior to- and 582 nm (red) after photoconversion at 405 nm.  We used the scanning laser of a confocal microscope to photolabel late blastula-stage embryos along 4-6 tiers of marginal cells, comprising the mesoderm and endoderm germ layer precursors.  This procedure left the neurectoderm precursor cells marked by green fluorescence and the mesendoderm precursor cells marked by red fluorescence.  Embryonic cells were dissociated and subjected to FACS, separating red mesendoderm precursors from green neurectoderm precursors.  RNA was extracted and linearly amplified once, then dye-labeled and co-hybridized to a microarray with over 30,000 oligos representing more than 20,000 unique zebrafish genes.  In validation of our strategy, many genes known to have elevated expression in the late blastula margin (e.g., squint, fgf8, lim1 and gata5) and several genes known to be specific to the early neurectoderm (e.g., sox31 and otx2) were independently identified by this approach.  In addition to known genes, our method has identified dozens of previously uncharacterized genes that are enriched in the pre-mesendoderm or pre-neurectoderm.
