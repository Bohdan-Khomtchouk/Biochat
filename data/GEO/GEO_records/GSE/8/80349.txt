TITLE
Quantitative mRNA profile of eif3e (yin6, int6) deleted S. pombe cells

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Int6/yin6 encodes the eIF3e subunits of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 complex (eIF3). To assess the impact of eIF3e on the global transcriptome, RNA seq of total mRNA was performed.

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from wildtype S. pombe (h- ura4-D18 leu1-32) and cells deleted for eif3e (int6, yin6, SPBC646.09c;  h- int6::kanMX6 ura4-D18 leu1-32). Following rRNA depletion and library construction, samples were sequenced on the SOLID4 platform. Two replicates were analyzed and statistical analysis was performed to identify significant differences in mRNA levels.
