TITLE
The impact of tacrolimus on hepatic mirnas

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
we aimed to evaluate the impact of tacrolimus on the expression of hepatic mirnas. HepG2 cells were treated with 0, 5, 20 ng/ml tacrolimus and RNA was extracted. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of mirna expression.
