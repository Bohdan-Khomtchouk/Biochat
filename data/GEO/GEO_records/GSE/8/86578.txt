TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of early gene expression by primary human articualr chondrocytes to the pro-inflammatory stimulus of IL-1+OSM

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of early gene expression and how this correlates to MMP gene expression seen at 24 hours. The hypothesis. Results provide important information of the early gene expression that precedes the catabolic expression of MMPs in chondrocytes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human articualr chondrocytes subjected to 1, 1.25 or 24 hours stimulation by IL-1+OSM compared to unstimulated control chondrocytes.
