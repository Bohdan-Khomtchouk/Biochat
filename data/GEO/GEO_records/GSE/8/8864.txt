TITLE
Global expression profiling applied to the analysis of Arabidopsis stamen development

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To obtain detailed information about gene expression during stamen development in Arabidopsis thaliana, we compared, by microarray analysis, the gene expression profile of wild-type inflorescences to those of the floral mutants apetala3, sporocyteless/nozzle, and male sterile 1, in which different aspects of stamen formation are disrupted. These experiments led to the identification of groups of genes with predicted expression at early, intermediate and late stages of stamen development. Additional experiments aimed at characterizing gene expression specifically during microspore formation. To this end, we compared the gene expression profiles of wild-type flowers of distinct developmental stages to those of the male sterile 1 mutant. Computational analysis of the datasets derived from this experiment led to the identification of genes that are likely involved in the control of key developmental processes during microsporogenesis. Keywords: mutant comparison, developmental series
