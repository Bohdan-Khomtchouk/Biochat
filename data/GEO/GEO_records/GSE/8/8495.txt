TITLE
Expression profiling of the solute carrier gene family in the chicken intestine

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Intestinal development during late embryogenesis and early posthatch has a long term influence on digestive and absorptive capacity in chickens.  The objective of this research was to obtain a global view of intestinal gene expression from late embryogenesis until 2 weeks posthatch with a focus on genes involved in nutrient uptake. Keywords: developmental time course
