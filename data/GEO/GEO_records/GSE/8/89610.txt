TITLE
Impact of IL-27 on hepatocyte antiviral gene expression and function

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IL-27 has been shown to play a role in modulating functions of diverse cell types like Th1, Th2, NK and B cells demonstrating both pro and anti-inflammatory roles. It is also capable of inducing STAT1, STAT3 and ISG's. To investigate the role of IL-27 on hepatocytes, Huh7.5 cells were treated with Il-27 and analysed the differentially expressed genes by microarray analysis. Microarray analysis showed that the upregulated genes belonged to antigen presentation and DNA replication pathways and involved strong upregulation of CXCL-10 a gene associated with liver inflammation.

DESIGN
28 Huh7.5 Samples stimulated with IFNA, IL10, IL17, IL22, IL27 and IL28 for 24 and 72 hrs.
