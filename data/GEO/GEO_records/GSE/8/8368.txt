TITLE
Isolation and transcriptional profiling of embryonic human neural crest cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify new candidate genes for neurocristopathies, a Long-SAGE library has been made from human neural crest cells (hNCC) derived from a normal embryo at Carnegie stage 13.  Data analysis indicates the expression of a number of genes in multiple GO functional classes that were anticipated based on animal studies and/or human disease. An average linkage hierarchical clustering was performed using SAGE data from hNCC and 14 other normal tissues and cell lines. This and other analyses indicate a high degree of molecular identity between hNCC and the two human embryonic stem cells (hES) lines included, compared to the other tissue or cell types included, including more tissue-restricted stem cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells, or hNCC derivatives such as Schwann cells. Keywords: Cell type comparison
