TITLE
Chromatin Binding of Gcn5 in Drosophila is Largely Mediated by CP190 [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
80% of the genomic binding sites of the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 are colocalizing with CP190 binding. Depletion of CP190 reduces the number of Gcn5 binding sites and binding strength to chromatin. Binding dependency was further supported by Gcn5 mediated co-precipitation of CP190

DESIGN
RNA-seq expression profiles of drosophila S2 mRNA after depletion of CP190 and Gcn5
