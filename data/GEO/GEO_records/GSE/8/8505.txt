SUMMARY
Obesity is an epidemic health problem worldwide that impacts the risk and prognosis of many diseases. However, not all obese patients have the same risk of developing these disorders. Individuals with peripheral obesity, i.e., fat distributed subcutaneously, are at little or no risk of the common medical complications of obesity, whereas individuals with central obesity, i.e., fat accumulated in visceral depots, are prone to these complications. In the present study, using microaarays gene expression, we have explored the hypothesis that patterns of fat distribution and, perhaps, to some degree, obesity itself may have a developmental genetic origin. Keywords: Comparative hybridization, cell type comparison
