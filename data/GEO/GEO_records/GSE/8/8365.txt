TITLE
Identification of circadian-regulated genes of Arabidopsis thaliana.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Most higher organisms, including plants and animals, have developed a time-keeping mechanism that allows them to anticipate daily fluctuations of environmental parameters such as light and temperature.  This circadian clock efficiently coordinates plant growth and metabolism with respect to time-of-day by producing self-sustained rhythms of gene expression with an approximately 24-hour period.  The importance of these rhythms has in fact been demonstrated in both phytoplankton and higher plants: organisms that have an internal clock period matched to the external environment possess a competitive advantage over those that do not. We used microarrays to identify circadian-regulated genes of Arabidopsis thaliana to elucidate how the clock provides an adaptive advantage by  understanding how the clock regulates outputs and determining which pathways and processes may be under circadian control. Keywords: time course
