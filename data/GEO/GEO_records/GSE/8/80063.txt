TITLE
Expression profiling of Natural killer B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of global gene expression levels between B cells, Natural killer cells and Natural killer B cells

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling using sorted B cells, Natural killer cells and Natural killer B cells from WT mouse spleen. Total RNA extracted from WT cells were quantified by the NanoDrop ND-1000 and RNA integrity was assessed by standard denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. The sample preparation and microarray hybridization were performed based on the NimbleGenâ€™s standard protocols.
