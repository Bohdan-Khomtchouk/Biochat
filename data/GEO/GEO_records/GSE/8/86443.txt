TITLE
Gene expression changes in response to the overexpression of the Arabidopsis SMB gene, and simultaneous loss of SMB, BRN1 and BRN2 functions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis NAC transcription factors SOMBRERO (SMB), BEARSKIN1 (BRN1) and BEARSKIN2 (BRN2) regulate root cap differentiation. In order to identify genes acting downstream of these transcription factors comparable transcriptome analyses were carried out using Agilent expression arrays.

DESIGN
Transcriptomes were compared between SMB-overexpressing roots and controls root, as well as between wild-type roots and smb brn1 brn2 triple mutant root. For each comparison dye-swapped replicates were performed using independently isolated RNA pools.
