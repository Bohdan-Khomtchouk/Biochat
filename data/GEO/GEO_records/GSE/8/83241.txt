TITLE
Integrative analysis of pathology, mRNA and microRNA in a polygenic diabetes model, NONcNZO10/LtJ mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The NONcNZO10/LtJ mouse is a polygenic model of type-2 diabetes (T2D)  that shows moderate obesity and diabetes, and is regarded as a good model reflective of the conditions of human T2D. In this study, we analyzed pathological changes of pancreases with the progress of time by using histopathology and gene expression analysis, including microRNA. A number of gene expression changes associated with decreased insulin secretion (possibly regulated by miR-29a/b) were observed, and zinc homeostasis (Slc30a8, Mt1 and Mt2) or glucose metabolism (Slc2a2) was suggested as being the candidate mechanism of pancreas failure in NONcNZO10/LtJ mice. These results demonstrate NONcNZO10/LtJ mice have a complex pathogenic mechanism of diabetes, and moreover, this fundamental information of NONcNZO10/LtJ mice would offer the opportunity for research and development of a novel antidiabetic drug.
