TITLE
Quorum Sensing/Quorum Quenching in Acinetobacter baumannii clinical strains

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter baumannii

SUMMARY
We worked with microarrys analysis in presence of 3-oxo-C12-HSL molecule to analyze the profile of the genes implicated in the Quorum Quenching network in A.baumannii clinical strains. Interestingly, only 13 genes were overexpressed under 3-oxo-C12-HSL molecule being the most level a gene which encodes an Alpha/beta hydrolase enzyme (5.01). The 46.15% of the genes overexpressed were implicated in the synthesis of the acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs).

DESIGN
The arrays were designed (Bioarray Genetic Diagnosis, Alicante) using eArray (Agilent) from the complete genome of A. baumannii strain (Ab ST-2 clon_2010). Experiments were performed from three biological replicates of RNA treated with DNAse obtained from a culture in exponential average phase (optical density at 600 nm of 0.6) in the presence of 3-oxo-C12- HSL at a final concentration of 10 uM. As a negative control (RNA untreated) RNA was used with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, a solvent of said acyl homoserine lactone). The RNA samples were quantified in a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). Quality and integrity analysis of the samples was carried out in an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the RNA 6000 Nano reagents and the RNA Nano Chips (Agilent Technologies).
