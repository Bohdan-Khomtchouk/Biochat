TITLE
Etv inactivation effect on embryonic lung development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ETV4 and ETV5 are FGF-activated transcription factor genes. Inactivation of Etv4 and Etv5 in the lung epithelium led to prolonged branch tip growth and delayed new branch formation. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in embryonic day 13.5 mouse lungs and identified distinct classes of dysregulated genes affect by Etv4;5 epithelial specific knockout.

DESIGN
Total mRNA obtained from three samples per group (WT and DKO). Equal mRNA from three samples per group were pooled. Affymetrix microarray transcriptome analysis of Etv4;5 knockout and control embryonic lung (E13.5) was performed and analyzed
