TITLE
Analysis of transcriptomes of naive CD4+ T cells, polarized under Th17 cell skewing conditions for 24h in presence or abscence of CK2 Inhibitor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to elucidate the transcriptional changes evoked by CK2 inhibition in developing Th17  cells

DESIGN
Messenger RNA profiles of naive CD4+ T cells, FACS-purifed from spleens of C57BL6 mice and stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 24h under Th17 polarizing conditions in presence or abscence of CK2 inhbititors DMAT (1.5µM) or CX4945 (1µM) were generated by sequencing using Illumina MiSeq
