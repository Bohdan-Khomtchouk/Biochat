TITLE
Transciptome profiling of NoDice and RNaseIII null cells prior to and after virus infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess the impact of endogenous RNaseIII nucleases on the overall transcriptome and the response to virus infection. We utilized CRISPR techology to engineer an RNaseIII null cell line using the NoDice 293T parental strain generated in the Cullen lab as the parental cell line.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 293T, NoDice 293T, and RNaseIII null cells alone or treated with SINV for 8 hours
