TITLE
Imatinib targeting of KIT-mutant oncoprotein in melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive treatment-refractory malignancy. Recently, c-Kit mutations were discovered in certain mucosal melanomas. A clinical trial was initiated with the c-Kit inhibitor imatinib mesylate.  The first treated patient experienced dramatic clinical improvement within days, followed by major responses by PET/CT four weeks later at all sites of metastatic disease. Several established mucosal melanoma cell lines exhibited imatinib sensitivity in a fashion correlating with c-Kit mutational status. Although c-Kit mutations are uncommon in cutaneous melanoma, they may arise in geographically distinct subsets for whom use of c-Kit targeted kinase inhibition should be considered in a rational therapeutic approach.
