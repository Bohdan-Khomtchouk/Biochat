TITLE
Mouse CIA Cytokine Array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The molecular basis to autoimmune arthritis is unclear. Collagen Induced Arthritis (CIA) in mice, is a model that has many features that resemble Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), although it does not perfectly duplicate RA. The study of CIA has provided insight into relevant pathogenesis and has aided in the identification of potential therapeutic targets. In this study we used Mouse Cytokine Expression Arrays to examine gene expression levels in joints at early, peak and decline stages during disease in DBA/1 mice. The aim of the study was to identify candidate molecules that may be involved in the development and progression of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Keywords: Disease State Analysis
