TITLE
Mouse Dux is myotoxic and shares partial functional homology with its human paralog DUX4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the RNA-seq experiments performed in human myoblasts transfected with human DUX4 and mouse Dux.

DESIGN
Comparison of genes up- and down-regulated by DUX4 and Dux in human myoblasts to identify pathways similiarly regulated by both transcription factors.
