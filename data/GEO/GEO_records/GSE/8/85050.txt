TITLE
Genome-wide mRNA sequencing of Panc-1 cells with or without fused IL-35 gene up-regulated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To screen out the downstream genes of IL-35

DESIGN
The two subunits of IL-35, EBI3 and P35, were fused together and transfected into Panc-1 cell via lentivirus. The sequence of the fused gene is identical to that of a commercial IL-35-overexpessed plasmid (InvivoGEN, pORF9-hIL35elasti). An empty vector was used as the control. The two cell lines were subjected to a genome-wide RNA sequencing.
