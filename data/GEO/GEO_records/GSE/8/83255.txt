TITLE
A hyperactive transcriptional state marks genome reactivation at the mitosis-G1 transition [Hist]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq of H3K27Ac in the G1E-ER4 cell line in prometaphase (nocodazole block), between anaphase-telophase (nocodazole release 40min), and interphase (asynchronous).

DESIGN
Nocodazole arrest-release in G1E ER4 cell line under conditions of 13h estradiol treatment.
