TITLE
Human Toxome Project, comparative genomic hybridization of MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The central goal of the project is to define, experimentally verify, and systematically annotate pathways of endocrine disruption, as a proof of concept of mapping pathways of toxicity by systems toxicology. Experiments were designed to detect possible genomic heterogeneity and genetic drifts within MCF-7 obtained from ATCC (HTB-22, lot number 59388743, passage 147).

DESIGN
4 samples of MCF-7 genomic DNA + human female reference DNA (two with replicates, two wo replicates). Indirect CGH # 1-4. Direct CGH # 5-6. Further desciptions are given in the respective experiments.
