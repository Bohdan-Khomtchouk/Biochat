TITLE
Transcriptome dynamics in early zebrafish embryogenesis determined by high-resolution time course analysis

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Study of transcriptome dynamics using a high-resolution gene-expression time course with 180 individual embryos, obtained from nine different spawns that are profiled from late blastula to mid gastrula stage. All individual embryos of genotype ABTL were photographed and an initial developmental time was estimated using percentage epiboly as a metric.

DESIGN
In this study development was studied at the level of the individual embryo and no treatment was applied.
