TITLE
Early response of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) to HIV-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human MDM were exposed to VSVG-pseudotyped HIV-1 NL-AD8 for 8h, 24h, and with HIV-1 + AZT for 24h

DESIGN
MDM from 3 healthy blood donors were differentiated for 7 days, exposed or not to HIV-1 +/- AZT for 8h and 24h before being lysed. RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed, hybridized on 2.1 ST microarrays to analyse the early transcriptomic response of MDM to infection.
