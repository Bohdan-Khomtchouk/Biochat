TITLE
Circadian expression data from epidermal stem cells from young and aged mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Circadian adaptation is thought to have maximized organismal fitness by anticipating and synchronizing physiological functions to the day-night oscillations imposed by the rotation of the earth. The function of mammalian adult stem cells is under tight circadian control, and conditional deletion of the core clock component Bmal1 in murine tissues results in their premature ageing. In addition, complete Bmal1 and Clock knockout mice show a significantly shortened lifespan. However, it is not clear to what extent circadian disruption is causative of ageing. Moreover, if and how circadian oscillations are altered during physiological ageing in adult stem cells is not known.

DESIGN
C57B6/J female mice were used to perform a circadian transcriptome analyses with EpSCs from 8 week old and aged mice between 102-116 week old. Four mice were used per each of the 6 time points (ZT0, ZT4, ZT8, ZT12, ZT16, ZT20) and per age group.
