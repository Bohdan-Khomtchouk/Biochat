TITLE
Integrative Analysis of Genomic Aberrations Associated with Prostate Cancer Progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide copy number changes were monitored using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of laser-capture microdissected prostate cancer samples spanning stages of prostate cancer progression including precursor lesions, clinically localized disease and metastatic disease. A total of 62 specific cell populations from 38 patients were profiled. Keywords: Disease state analysis using array-based comparatavie genomic hybridization
