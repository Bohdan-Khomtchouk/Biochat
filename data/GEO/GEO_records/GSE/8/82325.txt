TITLE
Advanced maternal age affects hippocampal gene expression in adult mouse offspring

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Advanced Maternal Age (AMA) is a risk factor for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders in offspring. We developed a mouse model to investigate whether pregnancy at advanced age may provoke behavioral and brain gene expression changes in offspring. Mice conceived by 15- to 18-month-old (15-18M) or 3M control females were delivered by cesarean section and were all fostered after birth by 3M dams. Genome-wide mRNA expression was analyzed using microarrays in the hippocampus of 4M male offspring. In conclusion, pregnancy at advanced age yields offspring with altered patterns of gene expression in the hippocampus, typical of human neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. The effects were not reversed by the postnatal maternal care provided by young foster mothers. This suggests that prenatal conditions associated with AMA may negatively affect fetal brain development and hence postnatal behaviors. This work was supported by the Polish National Science Center (2014/15/D/NZ4/04274 to SS and 2011/03/N/NZ29/05222 to AMS) and European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013-n 312097 to GEP). This work was also partially supported by Institute of Genetics and Animal Breeding of the Polish Academy of Sciences (S.III.1.3 to JAM) and by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education (N N519 657940 to JG). SS, FZ and GEP are participating in the COST action FA1201 ‘Epiconcept’ - Epigenetic and Periconception Environment.

DESIGN
We compared gene expression patterns of mice hippocampi harvested from male offspring of old versus young (control) mothers. Comparison was composed of 3 biological replicates in each group. Each biological replicate was a pool composed of equal amounts of 3 total RNA samples from hippocampi of mice belonging to a given group.
