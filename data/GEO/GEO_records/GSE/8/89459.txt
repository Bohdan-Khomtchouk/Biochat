TITLE
Genome wide binding of trr (ChIP-seq) and expression analysis (RNA-seq) of trr- and G9a mutant fly heads

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
trr ChIP-seq, trr RNA-seq, G9a RNA-seq

DESIGN
trr ChIP-seq profiles on 0-5 day old fly heads in two replicates and mRNA profiles of trr- and G9a mutant 0-5 days old fly heads in two and three replicates respectively.
