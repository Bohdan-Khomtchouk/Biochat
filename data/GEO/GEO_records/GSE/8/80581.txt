TITLE
Identification of Amino Enhancer of Split (AES) and DDX21 binding snoRNAs by RIP-Seq.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied AES and DDX21 binding RNAs in Kasumi-1 cells stably expressing V5-tagged AES. RNA immunoprecipitation was performed with V5 antibody (for AES), DDX21 antibody and control IgG. We found that AES as well as DDX21 RIP samples showed enrichment for small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) compared to control IgG. We also showed that AES and DDX21 binding snoRNAs showed significant overlap. Our studies provide mechanisms how AES regulates snoRNAs and rRNA modification.

DESIGN
RIP followed by small RNA sequencing in Kasumi-1 cells
