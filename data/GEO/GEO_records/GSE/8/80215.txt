TITLE
N1ICD overexpression effect on white adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT) isolated from wildtype (WT) and Notch1 overexpression mice (Ad/NICD). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying lipodystrophy of Ad/NICD mice

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, WT WAT vs. Ad/NICD WAT. Biological replicates: 4 WT WAT and 4 Ad/NICD WAT
