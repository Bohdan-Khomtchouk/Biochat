TITLE
Diverse interventions that extend mouse lifespan suppress shared age-associated epigenetic changes at critical gene regulatory regions (WGBS 1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation into changes in the methylome in young (2 months) and aged (22 months) Ames dwarf (Prop1 Hom) and WT (Prop1 Het) mice

DESIGN
Examination of methylation states via high-throughput, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in mouse hepatocytes of young (2 month) and aged (22 month) mice that display increased longevity through a variety of interventions
