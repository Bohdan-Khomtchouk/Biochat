TITLE
Function and hormonal regulation of GATA3 in human first trimester placentation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor GATA3 is down regulated by estrogen and plays a role in trophoblast cell function and placentation.

DESIGN
To identify downstream genes involved in GATA3 regulation of trophoblast function, we performed RNA sequencing of GATA3 knockdown HTR8/SVneo cells. First, GATA3 expression in HTR8/SVneo cells were knocked down by siRNA transfection and the reduction in GATA3 expression confirmed. Then, gene expression profiles of GATA3 knockdown cells were determined using RNA sequencing on the Illumina NextSeq 500.
