TITLE
Expression profiling of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma with perineural invasion implicates the p53 pathway in the process

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common cancer worldwide and accounts for approximately 30% of all keratinocyte cancers.  The vast majority of cutaneous SCCs of the head and neck (cSCCHN) are readily curable with surgery and/or radiotherapy unless high-risk features are present.  Perineural invasion (PNI) is recognized as one of these high-risk features.  The molecular changes during clinical PNI in cSCCHN have not been previously investigated.  In this study, we assessed the global gene expression differences between cSCCHN with or without incidental or clinical PNI.  The results of the analysis showed signatures of gene expression representative of activation of p53 in tumors with PNI compared to tumors without, amongst other alterations.  Immunohistochemical staining of p53 showed cSCCHN with clinical PNI to be more likely to exhibit a diffuse over-expression pattern, with no tumors showing normal p53 staining.  DNA sequencing of cSCCHN samples with clinical PNI showed no difference in mutation number or position with samples without PNI, however a significant difference was observed in regulators of p53 degradation, stability and activity.  Our results therefore suggest that cSCCHN with clinical PNI may be more likely to contain alterations in the p53 pathway, compared to cSCCHN without PNI.
