TITLE
Genome-wide maps of DNA methylation in zebrafish larvae through MeDIP-sequencing after benzo[a]pyrene exposure

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In this research, we used  MeDIP-sequencing technology to detect genome-wide methylation changes in benzo[a]pyrene(BaP)-exposed zebrafish larvae. We identified differentially methylated genes are associated with many diseases, including development of brain, and central nervous system.This high-throughput sequencing could help us to understand new mechanisms of BaP toxicity.

DESIGN
Examination of different methylation in zebrafish larvae after BaP exposure.
