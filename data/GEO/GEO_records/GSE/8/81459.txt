TITLE
Whole genome expression profiling of Brassica juncea BnCRY2aOE transgenics vis-Ã -vis wild-type

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
The BnCRY2aOE transgenics over-expressing a blue light photoreceptor (BnCRY2a) flowered earlier than wild-type plants by more than two weeks. To identify the downstream candidate genes involved in regulating the early flowering phenotype in the transgenics, a genome-wide microarray analysis of the transgenic plant vs. wild type was performed. The microarray data analysis revealed the differential up-regulation of many genes involved in flower development, cell growth and differentiation and hormone biosynthesis/signalling in comparison to wild-type.
