TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation patterns in iAs-transformed cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the global impact of iAs on DNA methylation patterns. Genomic DNA was Bisulfite converted and analyzed using Mini methly-seq.

DESIGN
DNA from both NT and iAs-transformed cells were bisulfite converted and used for analysis through Minimethyl-seq
