SUMMARY
The relation of serial changes in plaque morphology of obstructive nonculprit lesions to HDL efflux, inflammation and transcriptome perturbations in response to high-dose statin therapy (YELLOW II study). YELLOW II is a prospective single center study. Stable patients who were scheduled for elective coronary angiography and/or coronary artery stenting were screened for this study. The final target population were patients with multivessel disease requiring staged intervention, culprit vessel initially and non-culprit vessel later, with maxLCBI4mm greater than 150 by NIRS. Patients underwent PCI for a culprit lesion followed by OCT and NIRS/IVUS of an obstructive non-culprit lesion (NCL). All subjects received rosuvastatin, 40 mg every day for 8-12 weeks. The NCL was reimaged and underwent intervention as a part of staged intervention. Blood samples were obtained for cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) quantification and peripheral PBMC isolation. Despite the extensive evidence for the beneficial effects of statins on clinical outcomes, the mechanisms underlying these effects in remain elusive. In a prospective study, 85 patients with stable multivessel coronary artery disease underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for a culprit lesion followed by intracoronary multi-modality imaging including optical coherence tomography (OCT) of an obstructive NCL. All subjects received 40 mg of rosuvastatin every day for 8-12 weeks, when the NCL was reimaged and intervention was performed. Blood samples were drawn at both times to assess cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) and transcriptomic profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).

DESIGN
Paired, sibship enabled study with baseline and followup expression data analyses.
