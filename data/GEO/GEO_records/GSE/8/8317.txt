Ebola-infected non-human primates - PBMCs

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Infection with Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a fulminant and often fatal hemorrhagic fever.  In order to improve our understanding of EBOV pathogenesis and EBOV-host interactions we have examined the molecular features of EBOV infection in vivo.   Using self-spotted cDNA microarrays, we analyzed genome-wide host expression patterns in sequential blood samples from nonhuman primates (NHP) infected with EBOV. A reference experiement design type is where all samples are compared to a common reference. Keywords: reference_design
