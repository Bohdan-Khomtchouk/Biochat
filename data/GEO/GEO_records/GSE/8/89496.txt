TITLE
RNA-seq of Drosophila 0-2 hr embryos Rnase R

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report the identification of Rnase R resistent stable intronic sequence RNAs (sisRNAs) in Drosophila.

DESIGN
RNA was obtained from 0-2 hr embryos and subjected to deep sequencing. ---------------------------------------- Authors state " We screened by manual inspection on the genome browser after mapping the reads to the genome " and " We managed to obtain 6 candidates with this approach " .
