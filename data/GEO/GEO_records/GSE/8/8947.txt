TITLE
Effect of loss of CREB and CREM on kainate-induced gene expression in the hippocampus (MG-U74C).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ablation of the Creb1 gene in forebrain neurons was performed using the Cre/loxP system, with the recombinase expressed from the Camk2alfa promoter. Mice were crossed into the Crem KO background to prevent compensation of CREB loss by CREM overexpression. Our goal was to analyze how loss of CREB will affect acitivity-regulated transcription induced by strong stimulation, i.e. kainate. Keywords: Treatment x Genotype
