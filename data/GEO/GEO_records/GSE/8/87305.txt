TITLE
Expression data from hematopoietic stem cells from Zeb2-KO (Zeb2Δ/ΔMx1-Cre) mice versus WT mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Zeb2 has been shown to influence hematopoietic differentiation and loss thereof leads to complex differentiation defects in multiple hematopoietic lineages. We used microarrays to compare the expresssion profile of Zeb2-defective with WT hematopoietic stem cells and identified several dinstict classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
A population of cells highly enriched for hematopoietic stem cells (LKS-Slam marker positive cells) was sorted by flow cytometry from bone marrow of (Zeb2Δ/ΔMx1-Cre) mice and WT mice eight weeks after induction with pIC.  Total RNA was RNA extracted and hybridised on Affymetrix microarrays. We used three distict biological replicates from each the Zeb2Δ/ΔMx1-Cre cells versus WT (control) cells.
