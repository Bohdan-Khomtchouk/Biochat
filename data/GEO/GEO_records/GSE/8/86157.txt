TITLE
Microarray data of epidermal basal cells from ventral or dorsal skin of virgin and pregnant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify genes expressed predominantly in the ventral skin epidermal basal cells of pregnant mice, we performed DNA microarray analysis by using FACS-purified epidermal basal cells from ventral skin at 0 and 16 dpc, and dorsal skin at 16 dpc.

DESIGN
The ventral or dorsal skin tissues were isolated from 8-12-week-old C57BL/6 virgin or pregnant (at 16 dpc) female mice. The alpha-6-integrin+ epidermal basal cells were FACS-purified from the isolated skin tissues. Total RNA was isolated from the basal cells and subjected to Affymetrix microarray using GeneChip 3'IVT Expression Kit. The experiments were performed twice.
