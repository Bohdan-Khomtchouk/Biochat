TITLE
Global transcriptome analysis of B. burgdorferi during adherence and invasion of human neuroglial cells

ORGANISM
Borreliella burgdorferi

SUMMARY
As adherence and entry of a pathogen into a host cell are two key components to an infection, identifying the molecular mechanisms responsible for cellular association will provide a better understanding of a microbeâ€™s ability for pathogenesis.  We previously established an in vitro model for B. burgdorferi invasion of human neuroglial cells.  To expand on our earlier study, we performed B. burgdorferi whole-genome expression analysis following a 20-hour infection of human neuroglial cells to identify borrelial genes that were differentially regulated during cellular attachment and invasion as compared with cultured Borrelia in cell-free medium.  This study identifies several regulated genes, the products of which may be important mediators for cellular pathogenesis. Keywords: in-vitro H4 neuroglial cells infected with B. burgdorferi
