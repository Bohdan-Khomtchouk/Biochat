TITLE
PRDM16 binding in brown adipocyte precursors [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PRDM16 is an important transcriptional regulator of brown and beige adipocyte gene programs. We discovered that PRDM16 also represses type I Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in brown and beige adipocytes. ChIP-seq demonstrated that PRDM16 binds proximal to many of the regulated ISGs and this correlates with reduction in the amount of the activating mark, H3K27Ac. Together this data shows PRDM16 represses ISG expression through direct binding at promoter regions to block transcription.

DESIGN
Immortalized adipocyte precursors derived from Prdm16 KO brown adipose were infected with control or PRDM16 expressing plasmids. ChIP-seq was performed for PRDM16 and H3K27Ac to determine PRDM16 binding in adipocyte precursors.
