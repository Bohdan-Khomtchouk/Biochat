TITLE
Mapping drought-responsive genes in cotton

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
Structural and functional approaches were used to study cotton (Gossypium) genes implicated in water-deficit stress. A genetic map representing the hypothetical ancestral diploid genome (Consensus Map) was used to map 1,907 of 15,784 tentative consensus sequences (TCs). These TCs represent 25,119 cotton ESTs derived from various tissues under irrigated and water-limited condition. The correspondence of mapped TCs and 42 stress-related quantitative trait loci (QTLs) revealed that 391 of the initial 1907 TCs co-localized within a QTL interval. About 31% of these TCs were annotated as genes involved in plant responses to abiotic stress. By comparison, only 18% of the total annotated TCs mapped on the Consensus map were classified as abiotic stress genes.  The enrichment of stress-related TCs that map to stress-related QTLs could not be explained by chance (P = 1.5 x 10-7). Gene expression profiling experiments were carried out using a microarray composed of 12,006 oligonucleotides. Transcriptional responses to imposed water-deficit stress in root and leaf tissue of 8-week old cotton plants revealed 1401 transcripts identified as drought responsive. A total of 158 (84 drought-induced and 74 drought-repressed) genes were mapped, of which 22 (8 induced and 14 repressed) genes co-localized with a QTL. A total of 539 unique genes were identified in the drought-stressed libraries. However, only 91 of these genes are contained on the array.  Of these genes, 12 showed significant changes in transcript abundance between stressed and irrigated leaf and root. Forty-five candidate genes implicated in drought-stress response at some level of characterization were identified. Keywords: stress response
