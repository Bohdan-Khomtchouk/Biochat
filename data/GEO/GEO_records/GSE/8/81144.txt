TITLE
Gene expression in BRAFV600E thyrocyte

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate SASP in an in vitro model, we analyzed the gene expression profile of BRAFV600E-induced OIS thyrocytes by RNA sequencing  and detected an increase in SASP expression.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different BRAFV600E-induced thyroctes, each compared with Control thyrocte.
