TITLE
PPARg regulated gene expression in human dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to gain insights into how PPARg regulates different facets of dendritic cell (DC) differentiation, we sought to identify PPARg regulated genes and gene networks in monocyte-derived dendritic cells using global gene expression profiling. We employed an exogenous ligand activation approach using a selective PPARg ligand (rosiglitazone abbreviated as RSG). In addition, we have defined culture conditions in which human serum (HS) induces PPARg activation via a yet uncharacterized endogenous mechanism. We also compared the gene expression profile of developing dendritic cells obtained from patients harboring dominant negative mutations of the PPARg receptor (C114R and C131Y). Keywords: ligand response
