TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression profile analysis of MCL1 over-expressing B-NHL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To get insight into the mechanisms of MCL1-induced survival and transformation, we screened 41,000 human genes in a genome-wide gene expression profile analysis of MCL1 over-expressing B-NHL cells. Keywords: MCL1-induced gene expression
