TITLE
Quantitative transcriptomic analysis metabolic mutant of Clostrdidium acetobutylicum ATCC824 under different physiological conditions

ORGANISM
Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analysis was applied to acidogenic, solventogenic and alcohologenic steady-state C. acetobutylicum cells for understanding the regulation of the metabolism of this organism. Used microarray is Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC824 transcriptional 44k v4, correspondance to GPL10908

DESIGN
Phosphate-limited continuous cultures of C. acetobutylicum were performed under acidogenesis (pH 6.3, 995 mM of carbon from glucose), solventogenesis (pH 4.4, 995 mM of carbon from glucose) and alcohologenesis (pH 6.3, 498 mM of carbon from glucose and 498 mM of carbon from glycerol). Samples were collected for three biological replicates from one control strain and three metabolic mutants, respectively.  Total RNA of 36 samples was extracted using an RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) following the manufacturer's instructions with the supplementation of DNase treatment using RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen). Agilent microarray for Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (4x44K AMADID 024247) was used. The RNAs were labeled with a Low Input Quick Amp Labeling kit and hybridized following a one-color microarray-based gene expression analysis protocol.
