TITLE
Time course analysis of outer medulla-specific gene expression profiles in the kidneys of Sprague-Dawley rats in a repeated dose study of 2-amino-4-nitrophenol.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In the present study, we performed a general toxicity test and a genome-wide gene expression analysis of rat kidney to identify the mechanisms of 2-amino-4-nitrophenol (ANP) -induced chronic renal failure.

DESIGN
Experimental design is the two group (control group vs. ANP treated group). The ANP was dissolved in corn oil, and the animals were dosed orally once daily for 28 days.
