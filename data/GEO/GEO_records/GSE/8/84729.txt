TITLE
Analysis of expression of genes involved in celiac disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated disorder with an important genetic component. We analyzed the expression of candidate genes in biopsies from duodenum.

DESIGN
The sample set consisted of duodenal biopsies from 15 CD children at diagnosis (on a gluten-containing diet, with CD-associated antibodies, atrophy of intestinal villi and crypt hyperplasia), and the same patients in remission after being treated with gluten-free diet (GFD) for > 2 years (asymptomatic, antibody negative, and normalized intestinal epithelium at that time), plus 15 tissue samples from non-celiac individuals not suffering from inflammation at the time of endoscopy, used as controls.
