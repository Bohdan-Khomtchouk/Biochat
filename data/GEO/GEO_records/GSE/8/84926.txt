TITLE
Protein expression related with cell cycle control phosphorylation between TCCSUP and KSHV-infected TCCSUP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Protein expression profile was analyzed by antibody array for cell cycle control phosphorylation with 238 antibodies with bladder cancer cell line, TCCSUP, and KSHV-infected TCCSUP cells.

DESIGN
Protein was extracted from uninfected bladder cancer cell line, TCCSUP, and KSHV-infected TCCSUP cells, and they were analyzed by antibody array for cell cycle control phosphorylation.
