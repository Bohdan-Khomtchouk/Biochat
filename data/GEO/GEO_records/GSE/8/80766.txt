TITLE
Transcriptional response to intracellular DNA in cells lacking AIM2-like receptors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of ALR-deficient cells indicates that ALRs are not required for the IFN response to intracellular DNA. To explore whether AIM2-like receptors activated another innate signaling pathway upon DNA detection, we performed microarray analysis comparing ALR+/+, ALR-/-, and AIM2-/- macrophages and fibroblasts 4 or 8 hours after transfection with calf-thymus DNA.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from ALR+/+, ALR-/-, and AIM2-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) or fibroblasts (MEFs) mock-treated (lipofectamine alone) or transfected with 5ug CT-DNA for 4 or 8 hours.
