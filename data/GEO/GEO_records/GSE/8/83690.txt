TITLE
miR-193b-regulated signaling networks inhibit adipogenesis and promote oncogenesis in liposarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-193b functions as a tumor suppressor in liposarcoma cells. Microarray was used to identify the targets of miR-193b. The functions of identified miR-193b targets were further investigated in liposarcoma cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated after treatment with control miRNA or miR-193b for 72 hours in DDLS and WDLS liposarcoma cells. Samples for each group in triplicate were processed for Illumina bead arrays (Illumina HT-12) by the MSKCC genomics core facility according to manufacturer instructions.
