TITLE
Gene expression changes in the intestinal crypts of mice with loss of imprinting

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify genes differentially expressed in the intestinal crypts between LOI(+) and LOI(-) mice, we performed  microarray experiments using RNA extracted from laser capture microdissection, by microdissecting an average of 8,000 crypts from each of 3 LOI(+) and 3 LOI(-) mice. Keywords: genetic modification design
