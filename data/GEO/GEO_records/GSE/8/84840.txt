Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild-derived mice have contributed to mouse genetics by their genetic diversity that may increase the chance of identifying novel modifier genes responsible for specific phenotypes and diseases. However, gene-targeting using wild-derived mice has been unsuccessful due to the unavailability of stable embryonic stem cells. Here, we report that the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene-targeting can be applied to the Japanese wild-derived MSM/Ms strain. We targeted the nonagouti (a) gene encoding the agouti protein localized in hairs and the brain. We obtained three homozygous knockout mice as founders, all showing black coat color. While homozygous knockout offspring were physiologically indistinguishable from wild-type littermates, they showed specific domesticated behaviors; a high locomotion during the light period and a decline in the avoidance of a human hand. These phenotypes were consistent over the subsequent generations. Our findings support the empirical hypothesis that nonagouti is a domestication gene, which might repress aggressive behavior.
