TITLE
Increased Acid Resistance of the Archaeon, Metallosphaera sedula by Adaptive Laboratory Evolution

ORGANISM
Metallosphaera sedula

SUMMARY
Extremely thermoacidophilic members of the Archaea such as the lithoautotroph, Metallosphaera sedula, are among the most acid resistant forms of life and are of great relevance in bioleaching. Here, adaptive laboratory evolution was used to enhance the acid resistance of this organism while genomics and transcriptomics were used in an effort to understand the molecular basis for this trait. Unlike the parental strain, the evolved derivative, M. sedula SARC-M1, grew well at pH of 0.90. Enargite (Cu3AsS4) bioleaching conducted at pH 1.20 demonstrated SARC-M1 leached 23.78% more copper relative to the parental strain. Genome re-sequencing identified two mutations in SARC-M1 including a nonsynonymous mutation in Msed_0408 (an amino acid permease) and a deletion in pseudogene Msed_1517. Transcriptomic studies by RNA-seq of wild type and evolved strains at various low pH values demonstrated there was enhanced expression of genes in M. sedula SARC-M1 encoding membrane complexes and enzymes that extrude protons or that catalyze proton-consuming reactions. In addition, M. sedula SARC-M1 exhibited reduced expression of genes encoding enzymes that catalyze proton-generating reactions.  These unique genomic and transcriptomic features of M. sedula SARC-M1 support a model for increased acid resistance arising from enhanced control over cytoplasmic pH.

DESIGN
