TITLE
Trichloroethylene-induced miRNA expression changes in B6C3F1 mouse liver

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
To know if Trichloroethylene (TCE) can induce miRNA expression changes in mouse liver, we use microarray to screen for differentially expressed miRNAs in the liver of mice exposed to TCE at a dose of 1000 mg/kg b.w. for 5days . In our results, nine miRNAs were selected by volcano plot filtering (fold change ≥ 2 and P-value ≤ 0.05), out of which eight were up-regulated and one was down-regulated. The differential expression of miR-182-5p, miR-34a-5p and miR-451a were validated by qPCR.
