TITLE
Comprehensive functional screening of miRNAs involved in human fat cell insulin sensitivity

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to detect and functionally investigate miRNAs linked to insulin sensitivity in human subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). Subjects were selected based on the insulin-stimulated lipogenesis response of subcutaneous adipocytes. Eleven miRNAs displayed differential expression between OIR and OIS states. Overexpression of miR-143-3p and miR-652-3p increased insulin-stimulated lipogenesis in human in vitro-differentiated adipocytes. MicroRNAs-143-3p and -652-3p are linked to scWAT insulin resistance independently of obesity.
