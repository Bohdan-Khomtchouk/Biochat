TITLE
Molecular role of the PAX5-ETV6 oncoprotein in promoting B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PAX5 is a tumor suppressor in B-ALL, while the role of PAX5 fusion proteins in B-ALL development is largely unknown. Here we studied the function of PAX5-ETV6 and PAX5- FOXP1 in mice expressing these proteins from the Pax5 locus. Both proteins arrested Blymphopoiesis at the pro-B-to-pre-B cell transition and, contrary to their proposed dominantnegative role, did not interfere with the expression of most Pax5 target genes. Pax5-Etv6, but not Pax5-Foxp1, cooperated with loss of the Cdkna2a/b tumor suppressor in promoting B-ALL development. Regulated Pax5-Etv6 target genes identified in these B-ALLs encode proteins implicated in pre-BCR signaling and migration/adhesion, which could contribute to the proliferation, survival and tissue infiltration of leukemic B-cells. Together with similar observations made in human PAX5-ETV6+ B-ALLs, these data identified PAX5-ETV6 as a potent oncoprotein.

DESIGN
36 samples in total: A) 24 RNA-Seq samples in 5 cell types: pro-B (5 genotypes, 2-4 replicates) large pre-B (2 genotypes, 2 replicates each) small pre-B (1 genotype, 2 replicates) lymph node (1 genotype, 3 replicates) bone marrow (1 genotype, 2 replicates) B) 12 ChIP-Seq samples in 2 cell types: pro-B (H3K27me3, H3K9ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, 1 replicate each; Pax5Etv6 ChIP, Prd ChIP, 2 replicates each; Pax5 ChIP 1 replicate) lymph node (1 genotype, 2 replicates).
