TITLE
RNA-seq of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings treated with MeJA or flg22 under full and low phosphate conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study evaluates the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings chronically exposed to the hormone Methyl Jasmonate (MeJA) or to the bacterial elicitor flg22 (a 22-amino acid peptide from flagellin). Treatments were performed under high and low phosphate availability using wild-type Col-0 plants and the phr1 phl1 mutant.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis seeds (wild-type Col-0 and the phr1 phl1 mutant) were germinated on Johnson medium (1 % sucrose) containing 1 mM Pi (in the form of KH2PO4) for 7 days in the vertical position and then transferred to 1 mM Pi and 5 µM Pi media containing 1 % sucrose either alone or supplemented with 10 µM MeJA or 1 µM flg22. Whole seedlings were harvested 12 days after the transferring. Plants were grown in a growth chamber in a 15-h dark/9-h light regime (21°C day /18°C night). The experiment includes a total of six biological replicates from two independent experiments per condition.
