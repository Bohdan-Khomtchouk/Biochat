TITLE
DAI Senses Influenza A Virus Genomic RNA and Activates RIPK3-Dependent Cell Death

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
293T were transfected with plasmids expressing DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI) or retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I). Transfected cells were subsequently infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus for 12 hours. Cell extract was subjected to FLAG Ab beads, washed, and retained. RNA was sequenced using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library kit. The input sample represents total RNA from vector-infected cells.

DESIGN
Examination of viral RNA production. Samples include 293T fibroblasts transfected with pcDNA FLAG-based plasmids expressing DAI or RIG-I.
