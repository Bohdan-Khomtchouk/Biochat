TITLE
Expression data of HBV infected liver tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed three clinical parameters with gene expression data from 122 liver tissues. Six healthy samples were used in validation.

DESIGN
All hepatitis samples were HBV infected, which was validated by positive HBsAg or serum HBV-DNA. The samples with HCV infection or metabolic liver injury (e.g. fatty liver, chronic alcoholic hepatitis, etc.) were excluded.
