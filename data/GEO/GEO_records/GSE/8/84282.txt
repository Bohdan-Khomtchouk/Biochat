TITLE
A penicillin-binding protein inhibits selection of colistin-resistant, lipooligosaccharide-deficient Acinetobacter baumannii

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter baumannii

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptional expression from wild type, a ponA mutant, and lipooligosaccharide-deficient A. baumannii in order to understand the cellular changes after inactivation of lipid A biosynthesis. Among all strains, genes in the Localization Of Lipoprotein (Lol) transport pathway were upregulated. This study provides a framework to understand how some Acinetobacter baumannii strains can survive without lipid A and lipopolysaccharide/lipooligosaccharide.

DESIGN
Examination of the global transcriptome in four different A. baumannii strains.
