TITLE
Transcriptional changes induced by Brd4 inhibitor, AZD5153, in cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from 12 human cancer cell lines treated with DMSO or AZD5153 for 24h to determine compound mechanism of action

DESIGN
Measured mRNA levels in cell lines treated with either AZD5153 or DMSO for 24h
