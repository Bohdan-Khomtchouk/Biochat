SUMMARY
3 different ES cell lines were compared in order to determine whether there are significant expression profile differences between ES cell lines, or whether the constraints of maintaining pluripotency in culture force a similar expression profile on cell lines derived from disparate sources. Our results indicate that the latter is more likely. We identified 21 genes that were significantly differentially regulated, either on comparison with the pooled control, or on direct comparison of individual ES cell line data from different slides. Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR on 3 separate isolates from each cell line, we have confirmed 4 of these genes as consistently differentially regulated, Hprt, and 3 others. We would conclude therefore that different ES cell lines at the same passage number in identical culture conditions show very similar expression profiles. Keywords: cell type comparison
