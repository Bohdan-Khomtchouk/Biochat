TITLE
Gene expression analysis of LinSLiT08211 KO cells against Salmonella infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Eukaryotic genomes are pervasively transcribed, resulting in the production of many unstable nuclear long noncoding RNAs such as nuclear Short-Lived noncoding Transcripts (nSLiTs). However, the biological significance and turnover mechanism of nSLiTs are largely unknown. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression that is regulated by LinSLiT08211 upon Salmonella infection

DESIGN
To assess the role of LinSLiT against Salmonella infection, we knockout LinSLiT08211 by using CRISPR/Cas9.  KO was performed replicate for each transcripts.  We comparied Salmonella infected/not infected HeLa cells and KO cells.  All data was obtained biological triplicate.
