TITLE
Global expression profiling to study the effect of glyphosate herbicide treatment on Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Using whole genome microarray (Affymetrix ATH1) we studied the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis thaliana to glyphosate (Roundup Original) herbicde that inhibits 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) enzyme and thus disrupts aromaticamino acid biosynthesis. Few genes related to defense and secondary metabolism were altered. Keywords: 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) inhibiting herbicide stress response
