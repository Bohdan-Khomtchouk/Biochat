TITLE
Tumor Interferon Signaling Regulates a Multigenic Resistance Program to Immune Checkpoint Blockade [ATAC-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to investigate if interferon signaling regulates immune checkpoint blockade in mouse melanoma model.

DESIGN
ATAC-seq for B16, B16 after chronic interferon treatment, B16 derived checkpoint blockade resistant strain 499, coupled with RNA-seq data.
