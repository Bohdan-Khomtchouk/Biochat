TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of transcriptomes at 5 day after sexual induction in Fusarium graminearum strains

ORGANISM
Fusarium graminearum

SUMMARY
Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae) is a prominent pathogen that infects major cereal crops, such as wheat, barley, and maize. To dissect molecular mechanisms of small non-coding RNA-mediated gene regulation during ascospore production, we compared transcriptomes of fungal cultures harvested from F. graminearum wild-type strain Z-3639 and RNAi component mutants at 5 days after sexual induction.

DESIGN
7 samples examined: Fungal cultures harvested from Fusarium graminearum wild-type strain Z-3639, Fgdicer1, Fgdicer2, Fgdicer1 Fgdicer2, Fgago1, Fgago2, and Fgago1 Fgago2 at 5 days after sexual induction.
