TITLE
Gene expression signatures in GIST-T1 cells transfected with a miR-186 inhibitor molecule

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify the role of miR-186 in GIST, we carried out a gene expression microarray analysis using GIST-T1 cells transfected with a miR-186 inhibitor or a negative control. We found that 253 probe sets (229 unique genes) were upregulated ( > 1.5-fold) by inhibition of miR-186 in GIST-T1 cells.

DESIGN
GIST-T1 cells were transfected with a mirVana miR-186 inhibitor  (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or a mirVana miRNA inhibitor Negative Control  (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Forty-eight hours after transfection, total RNA was extracted and gene expression signatures were analyzed.
