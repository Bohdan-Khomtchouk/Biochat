TITLE
Gene expression profile of EBF1-wt

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the function of EBF1-H240 residue, a gain-of function microarray analysis was performed by transducing Empty, Ebf1-wt and Ebf1-H240A expressing vectors into Ebf1-/- progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Freshly prepared Ebf1−/− c-Kit+ fetal liver cells were transduced with pmys-Empty-IRES-GFP, pmys-EBF1wt-IRES-GFP or pmys-EBF1H240A-IRES-GFP. The GFP positive transduced cells were sorted 36 hrs after transduction.
