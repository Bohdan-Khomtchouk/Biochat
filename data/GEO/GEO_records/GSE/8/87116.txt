TITLE
Expression data of uteri treated with An Agonist for Lysophosphatidic acid receptor3 (LPA3), T13

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of the genes whose expression levels are regulated by T13 during peri-implantation period

DESIGN
6 different samples (1-6) mixed with uteri from 3 mice, respectively; vehicle-injected pseudopregnant uteri (1,3,5) and lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 agonist injected pseudopregnant uteri (T13; 2,4,6); 0.5 hr after the injection (1,2), 1 hr after the injection (3,4) and 2 hr after the injection (5,6); A comparison between vehicle vs T13 in each timepoint
