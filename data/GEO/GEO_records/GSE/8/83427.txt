TITLE
Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-Seq) reveals lncRNA MANTIS important for the angiogenic function of endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The angiogenic function of endothelial cells is tightly regulated but the impact of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) remains unclear. The lncRNA yielded to be an epigenetically restricted endothelial lncRNAs. Here, the chromatin accessibility after knockdown of MANTIS was investigated. It revealed changes on chromatin accessibility on several promoters which are known to be important for endothelial angiogenic function.

DESIGN
ATAC-seq profiles after knockdown with scrambled or MANTIS siRNA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).
