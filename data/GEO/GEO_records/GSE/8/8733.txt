TITLE
Folate deficiency enhances arsenic effects on ODC mouse skin gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that expression of key markers of keratinocyte differentiation is suppressed by exposure to sodium arsenite.  Folate deficiency exacerbates this effect.  In addition, cancer-related cell movement genes, and growth and proliferation genes are altered.  Several redox-sensitive transcription factors are implicated in mediating these gene expression changes due to arsenic treatment and folate deficiency. Keywords: gene expression/microarray
