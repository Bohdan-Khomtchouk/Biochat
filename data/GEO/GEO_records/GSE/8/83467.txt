TITLE
Mouse pooled LNEPs, pre- and post-influenza - Local lung hypoxia determines epithelial fate decisions during alveolar regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Flow sorted mouse LNEP cells isolated from normal lungs and influenza-infected lungs (day 17 PR8)

DESIGN
Highly purified quiescent LNEPs (EpCAMposb4posCC10negFoxJ1neg) and activated LNEPs (Krt5-CreERT2 traced cells 17 days post infection) were flow sorted and extracted for RNA using ReliaPrepâ„¢ RNA Tissue Miniprep kit (Promega).
