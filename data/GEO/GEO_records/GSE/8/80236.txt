TITLE
Identification of miR-210 target genes in T20 patient-derived sphere culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hypoxia is known to regulate tumor-initiating cells and to have an effect on miRNA expression. We were interested in studying the role of hypoxia-induced miR-210 in colorectal cancer patient-derived sphere cultures. Downregulated genes after overexpression of miR-210 were retained as potential miR-210 target genes for further validation sudies.

DESIGN
Colorectal cancer patient-derived (patient name: T20) sphere cultures were stably transduced with miR-210 lentiviral particles (Biosettia) or control vectors, respectively. Three technical replicates were used for both conditions.
