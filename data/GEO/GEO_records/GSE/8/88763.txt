TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita)-infected tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) roots reveals complex gene expression profiles and metabolic networks of both plant and nematode during susceptible and resistance responses.

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Purpose: To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in disease development during plant-nematode interactions. Methods: We have taken a comprehensive transcriptomic approach to investigate the expression of both tomato and RKN genes in tomato roots at five infection time points from susceptible plants (PR: Pusa Ruby) and two infection time points from resistant plants (M36: Transgenic MM line), grown under soil conditions. Results: Differentially expressed genes during susceptible (1827 tomato, 462 RKN) and resistance (25 tomato, 160 RKN) interactions were identified and a set of genes were validated by qRT-PCR. Conclusion: Our findings, for the first time, provide insights into the transcriptome dynamics of both tomato and RKN during susceptible and resistance interactions and reveal involvement of a complex network of biosynthetic pathways during disease development.

DESIGN
Five infected stages from susceptible tomato plants (PR) and two infected stages from resistant tomato plants (M36) along with their corresponding uninfected controls (water inoculated) were analysed, in duplicates.
