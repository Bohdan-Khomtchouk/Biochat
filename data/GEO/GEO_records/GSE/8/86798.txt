TITLE
IL-1β-induced modulation of gene expression profile in human dermal fibroblasts: the effects of Thai herbal Sahatsatara formula (AVS023), piperine and gallic acid possessing antioxidant properties

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effects of AVS023 and its active compounds (gallic acid and piperine) on human gene expression in primary human dermal fibroblasts induced by IL-1β. The results provided up- and down- regulated genes resulting from IL-1β and IL-1β plus with each test compound in primary human dermal fibroblasts

DESIGN
Human dermal fibroblasts were cultured with test compounds for 30 minutes and stimulated with IL-1β for 4 h. All results  were compared to control or  IL-1β treated only. Total samples were 11 samples with duplicate experiments
