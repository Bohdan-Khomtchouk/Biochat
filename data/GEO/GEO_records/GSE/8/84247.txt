TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of murine splenic chemokines and cytokines [common cytokines assay]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C57BL/6 mice were subjected to sham surgery or orthotopic Hepa1-6 hepatic tumor inoculation. Spleen tissues from mice subjected to sham surgery (control mice), mice bearing a 2-week orthotopic hepatoma, and mice bearing a 4-week othotopic hepatoma were collected. Total RNA was extracted from the spleen tissues, and we used the RT² Profiler PCR array-mouse common cytokines (SABioscience) array panels to quantitate gene expression of cytokine genes from the spleens.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. Spleen tissues from 5 mice per group were used as indicated in the summary.
