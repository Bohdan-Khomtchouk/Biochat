ADTRP siRNA Microarray Data in HepG2 Cell Line

SUMMARY
Coronary artery disease (CAD) and its complication myocardial infarction (MI) are the leading cause of death worldwide.Our genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in the Chinese population identified a genomic variant, rs6903956, in intron 1 of the C6orf105 gene (later named as ADTRP) as a significant risk factor for CAD and MI. Based on itscell membrane localization and its function on regulation of TFPI, we hypothesize that ADTRP acts as a cell signaling molecule that affects function and expression of many downstream genes/proteins. We performed global gene expression profiling in cells with knockdown of ADTRP expression to identify other downstream targets of ADTRP. To identify other downstream targets of ADTRP, we performed global gene expression profiling in cells with knockdown of ADTRP expression.  Because ADTRP downstream genes include those involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis as well as multiple histone genes, we carried out cellular studies on cell cycle, cell proliferation and apoptosis to further characterize the function of ADTRP.

DESIGN
Global gene expression of ADTRP siRNA sampels and negative controls were profiled by Affymetrix GeneChip PrimeView arrays in HepG2 cells,  top downstream genes with differntial expression levels were selected for validation in HepG2, HUVEC, and EAhy926 endothelial cells. Because ADTRP downstream genes include those involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis as well as multiple histone genes, we carried out cellular studies on cell cycle, cell proliferation and apoptosis to further characterize the function of ADTRP.
