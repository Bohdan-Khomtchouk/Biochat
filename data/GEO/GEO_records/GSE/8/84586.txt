TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of tissue macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis of cardiac, renal, and liver macrophages. CD11b+F4/80+Ly6C-Ly6G- tissue resident macrophages were isolated from the heart, kidney, and liver of mice. Isolated RNA was subjected to RNA-seq to identify differentially expressed transcripts.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was done to analyze transcriptomes of cardiac macrophages, liver Kupffer cells, and renal macrophages isolated from adult mice in the steady state.
