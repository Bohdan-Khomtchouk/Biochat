TITLE
Ductal Carcinoma in situ CGH

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. Our goal was to use known aberrations within these samples as a benchmark for determining the ability to differentiate between sample noise and real signal. Keywords: aCGH
