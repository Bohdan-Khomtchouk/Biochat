TITLE
Gene expression signature of the T-ALL cell line LOUCY treated with 250nM (+)-JQ1 for 4h

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptional consequences of the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 in the T-ALL cell line LOUCY by microarray analysis. Short-term exposure to a low dose of JQ1 (4h, 250nM) provided insights in the genes whose expression was immediately affected by BET bromodomain inhibition. Significantly downregulated genes upon short-term drug treatment included stem-cell associated genes and putative oncogenes such as BAALC, WT1, MN1, MEF2C, LMO1 and LMO2. Genes associated with the 500 highest ranked enhancer regions in LOUCY, were significantly enriched in genes downregulated after JQ1 treatment.

DESIGN
LOUCY cells were treated with 250nM (+)-JQ1 or DMSO for 4h. Three biological replicates of this treatment were performed.
