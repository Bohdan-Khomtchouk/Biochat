TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed genes between adult males and adult females of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae)

ORGANISM
Tetranychus urticae

SUMMARY
Sex-specific differences in gene expression underlie differences in morphology, behavior, and reproduction. To date, little is known about sex-specific differences in gene expression in spider mites, even though males and females differ markedly in morphology and behavior. In this study, we describe the complement of sex-specific gene expression differences between males and females of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae), an important generalist herbivore that is a significant crop pest. Gene expression differences were detected from analyses of mRNA-seq data collected with the Illumina method (eight samples in total consisting of four biological replicates each for males and females).

DESIGN
mRNA profiles consisting of four biological replicates each for male and female spider mites (Tetranychus urticae, strain London), eight samples total, were generated with RNA collected from adults grown on bean plants.
