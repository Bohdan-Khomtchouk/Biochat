TITLE
Total RNAseq of human putamen and caudate nucleus tissues in healthy control and Bipolar Disorder individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A multitude of genes have been associated with bipolar disorder via SNP genotyping studies.  However, many of these associated SNPs are found within intronic or intergenic regions of the human genome.  We were interested in studying transcriptional profiles/splice variation of genes associated with bipolar disorder within the human striatum. Understanding how these associated genes are transcribed in the human brain may help to guide the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of bipolar disorder and other neuropsychiatric illnesses.

DESIGN
NEBNext Ultra Directional RNAseq libraries were generated from putamen and caudate nucleus tissues from 4 healthy control individuals and 4 individuals with bipolar disorder.  These libraries were then multiplexed and run on an Illumina HiSeq platform using single read 100bp chemistries.
