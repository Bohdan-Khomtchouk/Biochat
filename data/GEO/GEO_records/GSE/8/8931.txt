TITLE
Examination of protein expression patterns of closely related Salmonella serovars using 2D GE and MS/MS

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
The objective of the present investigation was to consider the level of variation in the protein expression patterns of closely related Salmonella serovars, in order to search for protein factors with levels of expression or posttranslational modifications characteristic for each serovar. For the comparative expression analysis we have utilised classic 2D GE approach which revealed several proteins with serovar specific expression as well as proteins which do not alter their expression levels between serovars and strains. The proteins of interest were identified using LC/MS/MS. Keywords: 2D GE, MS/MS
