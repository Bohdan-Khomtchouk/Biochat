TITLE
Expression data from whole Drosophila pupa of 16-17 hr APF stage

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Expression of activated Ras along with alteration in levels of non-coding RNA hsromega in the eye disc results in lowered ecdysone levels in post pupation stages, resulting in early pupal death. This microarray analysis of total pupal RNAs was undertaken to know how could expression of activated Ras with altered levels of hsromega RNA in eye discs could reduce ecdysone levels

DESIGN
16-17 hr old pupae expressing activated Ras under sevGAL4 either alone or in background of altered  levels of hsromega non coding RNA were selected for RNA extraction  and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Pupae of same stage of individuals expressing only UAS-GFP under the same driver were used as control
