TITLE
Identification of KIN10-target genes in Arabidopsis mesophyll cells

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to explore the extent of KIN10 (At3g01090) transcriptional regulation and identify its early target genes in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. Results suggest that KIN10 targets a remarkably broad array of genes that orchestrate transcription networks, promote catabolism and autophagy, and suppress anabolism and ribosome biogenesis. The transient expression condition ruled out secondary or long-term effects of metabolism and growth, and circumvented experimental limitations caused by redundancy and embryonic lethality observed in mammals and plants.
