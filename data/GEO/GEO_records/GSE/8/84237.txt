TITLE
Integrated Systems Biology Analysis of KSHV Latent Infection Reveals Viral Induction and Reliance on Peroxisome Mediated Lipid Metabolism

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kaposiâ€™s Sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), an oncogenic virus, modulates host cell signaling and metabolism to maintain latent infection. To unravel the underlying cellular mechanisms modulated by KSHV, we identified changes in the host proteome, phosphoproteome and transcriptome landscape upon KSHV infection of endothelial cells. A Steiner Forest algorithm was used to integrate proteomic, phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic data with transcriptome based predicted transcription factor activity to identify cellular networks altered by latent KSHV.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from hTert-immortalized microvascular endothelial (TIME) cells either infected with KSHV or mock-infected in 3 biological replicates
