TITLE
CRISPRi-based genome-scale identification of functional long non-coding RNA loci in human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human genome produces thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) â€“ transcripts > 200 nucleotides long that do not encode proteins. While critical roles in normal biology and disease have been revealed for a subset of lncRNAs, the function of the vast majority remains untested. Here, we developed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) platform targeting 16,401 lncRNA loci in 7 diverse cell lines including 6 transformed cell lines and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Large-scale screening identified 499 lncRNA loci required for robust cellular growth, of which 89% showed growth modifying function exclusively in one cell type. We further found that lncRNA knockdown can perturb complex transcriptional networks in a cell type-specific manner. These data underscore the functional importance and cell type-specificity of many lncRNAs.

DESIGN
96 RNA-seq samples; 16 ChIP-seq samples
