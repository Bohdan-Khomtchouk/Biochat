TITLE
The de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3C protects male fertility from transposon activity (small RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To allow the characterization of the populations of small RNAs in the testes of mutant animal, small-RNA fraction of total testis RNA was isolated and sequenced.

DESIGN
Comparison of small RNA-seq populations from whole testis RNA of mutant Dnmt3C IAP/IAP and control Dnmt3C IAP/WT at 16.5 dpc. A parallel experiment done with Miwi2 KO/WT and KO/KO at the same developmental stages was conducted as a control.
