Whole-Genome Profiling in Liposarcomas Reveals Genetic Alterations Common to Specific Telomere Maintenance Mechanisms

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Telomere attrition ultimately leads to the activation of protective cellular responses such as apoptosis or senescence.  Impairment of such mechanisms can allow continued proliferation despite the presence of dysfunctional telomeres.  Under such conditions, high levels of genome instability are often engendered.  Data from both mouse and human model systems indicate that a period of genome instability might facilitate tumorigenesis.  Here, we employ a liposarcoma model system to assay telomere maintenance mechanism-specific genetic alterations.  A multiassay approach was used to assess the telomere maintenance mechanism(s) active in tumors.  Genomic DNA from these samples was then analyzed by high resolution DNA mapping array in order to identify genetic alterations.  Our data reveal a higher level of genome instability in ALT-positive tumors as compared with telomerase-positive tumors, whereas tumors lacking both mechanisms have relatively low levels of genome instability.  The bulk of the genetic changes are amplifications, regardless of the mode of telomere maintenance employed.  We also identified genetic changes specific to the ALT mechanism, e.g., deletion of chromosome 1q32.2-q44, as well as changes that are underrepresented amongst ALT-positive tumors, such as amplification of chromosome 12q14.3-q21.2.  Taken together, these studies provide insight into the molecular pathways involved in the regulation of ALT and reveal several loci that might be exploited either as prognostic markers or targets of chemotherapeutic intervention.
