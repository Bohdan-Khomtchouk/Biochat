TITLE
RNA-Seq Study Reveals Genetic Responses of Diverse Wild Soybean Accessions to Increased Ozone Levels

ORGANISM
Glycine soja

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression data from four genetically diverse wild soybean accessions helps reveal both sensitive and resistant responses of the plants to increased ozone levels. Results help characterize genetic response of wild soybean to ozone stress and could help provide information on genetic resources for creating ozone-tolerant soybean breeding lines.

DESIGN
2 sensitive genotypes (PI 407179 and PI 424007) and 2 resistant genotypes (PI 424123 and PI 507656) were replicated in 4 complete block designs and subjected to either 75 parts per billion (ppb) ozone or a control of charcoal-filtered conditions ( < 10 ppb ozone). Total RNA was isolated from the first three trifoliate of each plant and deep sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500.
