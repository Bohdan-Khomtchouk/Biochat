TITLE
A Potential Role of the Unfolded Protein Response in the Impaired Production and Release of Epinephrine in Recurrent Hypoglycemia

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In order to gain further insight into the molecular mechanism(s) mediating the blunted epinephrine responses following recurrent hypoglycemia we utilized global gene expression profiling approach. Our results indicate the association between defective counterregulation (impaired epinephrine release) and the activation of the unfolded protein response as well as increased neuropeptide signaling, altered ion homeostasis and downregulation of proteins involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of secretory vesicles.

DESIGN
We compared the entire transcriptomes during recurrent (defective CRR model, 2RH) and acute hypoglycemia (normal CRR group, 2RS) in the adrenal medulla of normal Sprague-Dawley rats.
