TITLE
Mapping chromatin remodelling in delta isw2 cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To define chromatin structure changes along the yeast genome using microarrays. Nucleosomal DNA from WT and delta isw2 yeast were hybridized and differences in signals were calculated. Keywords: Nucleosomal DNA hybridization
