TITLE
Dynamic changes in chromatin states during specification and differentiation of adult intestinal stem cells [k27m3]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine chromatin changes associated with ISCs specification we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) using 2x105 FACS purified E12.5 or E14.5 embryonic intestinal epithelial cells, Lgr5+ adult ISCs and enterocytes.

DESIGN
Intestinal epithelial cells from two embryonic stages (E12.5 and E14.5), adult Lgr5+ ISCs and enterocytes were used. For each stage biological duplicates were analyzed.
