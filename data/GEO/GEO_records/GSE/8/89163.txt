TITLE
Transcriptome analysis in sheep Milk Somatic Cells

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
To investigate the molecular bases of diet induced differences in milk composition, we collected milk from mid lactation dairy ewes  and after 3 weeks of diet supplementation with extruded linseed. RNAs were isolated from milk somatic cells isolated from milk of 3 sheep and Illumina RNA sequencing was performed to analyze RNA synthesis in these cells.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of milk somatic cells of sheep fed with normal diet and with a supplementation with extruded linseed. Sequence data were generated by deep sequencing, on three replicates, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
