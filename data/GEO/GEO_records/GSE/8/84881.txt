TITLE
Transcriptional Alterations in Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells derived from Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients (AML BM-MSC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to get insights into transcriptional alterations in bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells derived from acute myeloid leukemia patients We compared the global gene expression profile from AML BM-MSC (n=19) to healthy donor (HD) controls (HD BM-MSC n=4)

DESIGN
AML BM-MSC and HD BM-MSC were isolated from bone marrow aspirates (see below) and hybridized on an Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip
