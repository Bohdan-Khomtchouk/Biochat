TITLE
Transcriptomic data to assess hexavalent chromium mode of action in mice and rats [rat]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In order to evaluate the mechanisms underlying hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) responses, mice and rats were treated with varying concentrations of Cr(VI) in drinking water, as sodium dichromate dihydrate (SDD). Potential transcriptomic responses were evaluated through microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Mice and rats were exposed to varying concentration of Cr(VI) through drinking water for either 7 or 90 days. Animals were sacrificed on days 8 and 91, respectively, and tissue samples were collected from the small intestine (i.e. duodenum and jejunum) and oral mucosa (palate). Tissue samples were processed and total RNA analyzed using Agilent 4x44K Whole Genome Microarrays. Please note that two-dye Agilent arrays were used but only Cy3 signal was processed.
