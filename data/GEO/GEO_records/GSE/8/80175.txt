TITLE
Inhibition of DNA methylation promotes breast tumor sensitivity to netrin-1 interference [MeDIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Results provide the animal proof of concept that inhibition of DNA methylation can sensitize solid tumors to antibodies mediating tumor cell apoptosis.

DESIGN
Methylated DNA precipitation (MeDP) ) followed by hight-throughput sequencing.
