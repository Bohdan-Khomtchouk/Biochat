TITLE
Small and big Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines L-428 and L-1236 lack consistent differences in gene expression profiles and are capable to reconstitute each other

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis was performed from microdissected small and big HRS cells, which were taken from smears of the Hodgkin cell lines L1236 and L428

DESIGN
Small HRS cells ( < 350µm) and big HRS cells ( > 600µm) were separately microdissected
