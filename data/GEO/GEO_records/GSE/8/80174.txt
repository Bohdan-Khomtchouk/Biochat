TITLE
Analysis of Post-TBI Gene Expression Signature Reveals Tubulins, NFE2L2, NFkB, CD44, and S100A4 as Treatment Targets for Traumatic Brain Injury

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
TBI was induced with lateral fluid-percussion injury in adult male rats. Genome-wide RNA-seq of the perilesional cortex, ipsilateral thalamus and dorsal hippocampus was performed at 3 months post-TBI. The data highlighted chronic transcriptional changes, particularly, in the perilesional cortex and thalamus. Genes showing a significantly altered expression both in the cortex and thalamus were submitted to the LINCS web query to identify novel pharmacotherapies to improve post-TBI outcome.

DESIGN
TBI was induced to 5 rats, 5 sham operated served as a controls.
