TITLE
Transcriptomes of a xylose-utilizing industrial flocculating Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain cultured in media containing different sugar sources

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The molecular basis for glucose and xylose fermentation by industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae is of interest to promote bioethanol production We used microarrays to investigate the transcriptional difference of a industrial strain cultured in both single sugar media and a mixed sugar medium of glucose and xylose
