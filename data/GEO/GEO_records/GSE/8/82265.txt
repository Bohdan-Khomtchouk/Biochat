TITLE
Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 wild-type strain high hydrostatic pressure for 30 min

ORGANISM
Shewanella piezotolerans WP3

SUMMARY
The WP3 strains was cultured at 20Â°C/0.1 MPa, and then was incubated at high hydrostatic pressure (HHP, 50 MPa) for 30 min. The transcriptional profiles after and before HHP shock were compared.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates sample and 6 technical replicates for each experiment
