TITLE
Characterisation of mRNA expression and replication fork stalling in copper-treated yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Here we analyse steady state mRNA levels and yH2A-marked replication fork stalling sites in S. cerevisiae

DESIGN
Histone modification (yH2A, gammaH2A) and transcriptome (mRNA-Seq) from wildtype BY4741 cells grown in YPD and treated for 4 hours with 0 or 1mM CuSO4
