TITLE
APOL1 renal-risk variants induce mitochondrial dysfunction (Affymetrix 2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess differential gene expression by APOL1 renal-risk (2 risk alleles) vs. non-risk (G0G0) genotypes in primary proximal tubule cells (PTCs), global gene expression (mRNA) levels were examined on Affymetrix HTA 2.0 arrays in primary PTCs cultured from non-diseased kidney in African Americans without CKD who underwent nephrectomy for localized renal cell carcinoma.

DESIGN
To detect differentially expressed gene profiles attributable to APOL1 renal-risk genotypes, African American primary proximal tubule cells with two APOL1 renal-risk alleles (N=5) and  lacking renal-risk alleles (N=25) were included in comparisons of global gene expression.
