TITLE
Epigenetic inflexibility of exhausted T cells limits durability of reinvigoration by PD-1 blockade

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Upon PD-1 pathway blockade,the epigenetic landscape of exhausted cells was only minimally remodeled consistent with lineage commitment and re-exhaustion of these cells over time.

DESIGN
Epigenetic profiling of Exhausted T cells & examinaton of epigenetic changes associated with PD-pathway blockade by  ATAC-seq using the mouse model of chronic infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)
