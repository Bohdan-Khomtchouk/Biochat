TITLE
TWIST1 drives cisplatin resistance and cell survival in an ovarian cancer model, via upregulation of GAS6, L1CAM, and Akt signalling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We created two cell lines derived from Ovcar8 by stably transfecting with an eGFP-firefly luciferase fusion protein and either an additional copy of the gene TWIST1 or an shRNA against TWIST1, under the control of the CMV promoter. RNA sequencing was used to look for differential expression of genes that may impact cisplatin resistance in epithelial ovarian cancer.

DESIGN
RNA-seq for differential expression between two cell lines differing in expression of gene of interest. Run as biological replicates and technical triplicates.
