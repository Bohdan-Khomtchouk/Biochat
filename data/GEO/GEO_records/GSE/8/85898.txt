TITLE
Gene expression data before and after interferon-gamma stimulatinon

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three of the melanoma cell lines show higher expression fold change after stimulation than the other 3.

DESIGN
We applied interferon-gamma stimulation to 6 melanoma cell lines and defined 3 responders and 3 responders according to the interfereon-gamma pathway gene expression fold change after stimulation.
