TITLE
Small RNA sequencing of large dense-core vesicle in bovine chromaffin cells

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Objectives: MicroRNA (miRNA) can be released to the extracellular medium and participates in neuronal communication. We investigate the mechanisms of miRNA exocytosis by vesicle fusion as a neuromodulator in a manner that are disparate from silencing gene expression. Methods: Small RNA sequencing data of large dense-core vesicle were generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in triplicate using Illumina Hiseq 2500. Results: Large dense-core vesicles contain a variety of known and novel miRNAs inside including miR-375. Conclusion: miRNAs can be novel neuromodulators, which are stored in LDCVs and released by vesicle fusion by SNARE assembly and synaptotagmin-1

DESIGN
Small RNA sequencing of large dense-core vesicle in bovine chromaffin cells from triplicate including technical replicate and biological replicate.
