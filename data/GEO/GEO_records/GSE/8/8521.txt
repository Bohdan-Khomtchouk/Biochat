TITLE
IFN-gamma-inducible gene expression in Toxoplasma-infected human fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human fibroblasts were infected or not with Toxoplasma gondii (Pru strain) for 18 h at a nominal MOI of 3. Cells were subsequently treated with human recombinant interferon gamma (0.5 ng/ml = 30 pM) for 0, 2, 4 and 8 h before RNA was harvested for cDNA microarray experiments. Uninfected samples were named N0, N2, N4 and N8 (i.e., N2 indicated uninfected cells treated with interferon gamma for 2 h); infected samples were named P0, P2, P4 and P8. Duplicate cultures were analyzed for each condition (indicated as " a " and " b " ). The reference channel (ch1, green) contained Universal Human Reference RNA. Using a genome-wide microarray analysis we show here a complete dysregulation of interferon-gamma-inducible gene expression in human fibroblasts infected with Toxoplasma.  Notably, 46 of the 127 interferon-gamma-responsive genes were induced and 19 were suppressed in infected cells before they were exposed to interferon gamma, indicating that other stimuli produced during infection may also regulate these genes. Following interferon-gamma treatment, none of the 127 interferon-gamma-responsive genes could be significantly induced in infected cells. Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series.
