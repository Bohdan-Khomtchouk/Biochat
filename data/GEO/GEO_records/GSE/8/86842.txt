TITLE
Changes in gene expression upon treatment of SH-SY5Y cells to cisplatin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we investigated the changes in mRNA expression upon treatment of SH-SY5Y cells to 10µM cisplatin for 72h.

DESIGN
Three samples of parental SH-SY5Y cells and four samples of 72h treated SH-SY5Y neuro-blastoma cell line with 10µM CDDP were subjected to Affymetrix chip analyses. RNA quality was determined using the Agilent Bioanalyzer and the Eukaryote Total RNA Nano Chip (Ag-ilent Technologies, Hayward, CA, USA). The RNA integrity number (RIN) was measured as 9.9-10. The Affymetrix HuGene 2.0 ST and WT plus reagent kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California, United States) was used following the provider’s recommendation with a start ma-terial of 100ng of total RNA.
