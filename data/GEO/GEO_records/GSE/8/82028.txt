TITLE
Gene expression alternations in the offspring liver from chromium restriction diet dams

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Maternal chromium restriction may disturb susceptibility in offspring. Liver from maternal chromium diet has 264 up- and 199 down- regulated genes, compared to control. Especially, Insulin signaling pathway and WNT pathway were affected.

DESIGN
We performed microarray analyses of offspring liver from chromium restriction dams and control diet dams at 32 week (n=3 per group).
