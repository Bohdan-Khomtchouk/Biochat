TITLE
mRNA expression of breast cancer cell lines across different densities [SCRB-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA expression profiles for 3 breast cancer cell lines seeded at different density and grown for different duration

DESIGN
This experiment is part of a study fo the effect of cell density on drug sensitivity [1]. Cells plated at different densities in 384-well plates were harvested at the indicated times and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). To ensure sufficient RNA amounts wells with low cell numbers were pooled. Some conditions have been tested in biollogical replicates grown at the same time. Libraries were prepared by the Broad Technology Labs (BTL) following the protocol for SCRB-Seq described in [2]. Transcripts were quantified by the BTL computational pipeline using Cuffquant version 2.2.1 [3].
