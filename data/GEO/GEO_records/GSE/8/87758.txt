TITLE
Intersectionally labeled Drd2-Pet1 single-neuron RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single-neuron transcriptome profiles of Dorsal Raphe neurons marked by a history of expression of Drd2::Cre and Pet1::Flpe (GFP+), as well as Dorsal Raphe neurons marked by a history of Pet1::Flpe expression only (mCherry+).

DESIGN
GFP and mCherry expressing neurons from triple transgenic Drd2::Cre;Pet1::Flpe;RC:FrePe mice were acutely dissociated, manually sorted, and single-neuron RNA-seq was performed (17 GFP+ cells, 8 mCherry+ cells).
