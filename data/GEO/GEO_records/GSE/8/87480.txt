TITLE
Orphan box C/D snoRNAs guide rRNA base acetylations in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Box C/D snoRNAs snR4 and snR45, whose role was unknown, guide 18S rRNA acetylations by Kre33 in yeast. UV-crosslinking (CRAC) was used to determine binding sites of Kre33 on RNA.

DESIGN
Duplicate data-sets of cDNA reads of RNAs UV-crosslinked to Kre33-HTP in vivo using the CRAC protocol. Cells were in mid-log phase when irradiated, immediately collected by filtration and frozen
