TITLE
Lymphtoxin pathway effects on thymic medullary epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression profiles of lymphotoxin alpha- and lymphtoxin beta receptor-deficient thymic medullary epithelial cells with their wild-type littermates, as well as with Aire-deficient and wild-type littermates. This was done in order to determine whether there was overlap in the effects of lymphotoxin and aire. Keywords: genetic modification
