TITLE
PRC2 preserves cellular plasticity and restricts intestinal secretory lineage commitment (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These data include the genome wide occupancy of histone modifications and target protein by ChIP sequencing in mouse crypt cells.

DESIGN
Immuno-precipitation of formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin prepared from wild type crypt cells using specific antibody against different target protein/modification.
