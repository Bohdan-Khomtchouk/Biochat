TITLE
BRD4 localization to lineage-specific enhancers is associated with a distinct transcription factor repertoire [mRNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined context specific function of BRD4 in promoting lineage specific gene expression and show that BRD4 is essential for osteoblast differentiation.

DESIGN
We performed  mRNA sequencing from hFOB cells (undifferentiated and differentiated for 5 days into osteoblastic lineage) following BRD4 inhibition by JQ1 or siRNA mediated depletion.  The mRNA-Seq includes namely 7 conditions: undifferentiated hFOBs treated with DMSO or non-targeting control siRNA (siCNTR), differentiated hFOBs with DMSO or siCNTR treatments; differentiated hFOBs treated with JQ1 or two siRNAs against BRD4 (#3 & #4). The libraries were performed in triplicates.
