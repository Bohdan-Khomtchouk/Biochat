TITLE
caArray_lavar-00111: SPECIFIC GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES ASSOCIATED WITH INFANT DISSEMINATED NEUROBLASTOMA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neuroblastoma (NB) tumours have the highest incidence of spontaneous remission, especially among the stage 4s NB subgroup affecting infants. Clinical distinction of stage 4s from lethal stage 4 can be difficult, but critical for therapeutic decisions. The aim of this study was to investigate differential gene expression amongst infant disseminated NB subgroups. Thirty-five NB tumours from patients diagnosed at < 18 months (25 stage 4 and 10 stage 4s), were evaluated gene expression analyses. Initial comparison analyses between stage 4s and 4 < 12 months tumours revealed distinct gene expression profiles. A significant portion of genes mapped to chromosome 1 (p < 0.0001), 90% with higher expression in stage 4s, and chromosome 11 (p=0.0054), 91% with higher expression in stage 4. Less definite expression profiles were observed between stage 4s and 4 < 18m, yet, association with chromosomes 1 (p < 0.0001) and 11 (p=0.005) was maintained. Distinct gene expression profiles but no significant association with specific chromosomal region localization was observed between stage 4s and stage 4 < 18 months without MYCN amplification. Distinct gene expression profiles characterize spontaneously regressing or aggressive infant NB, providing the biological basis for the distinct clinical behaviour.
