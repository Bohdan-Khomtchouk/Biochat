TITLE
Transcriptom analysis of the cochleae from mice with β-catenin activation, Notch1 deletion, and β-catenin activation combined with Notch1 deletion in Sox2+ SCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used RNA sequencing to compare the transcripts of the cochleae from control mice and from mice with β-catenin activation, Notch1 deletion, and β-catenin activation combined with Notch1 deletion in Sox2+ SCs. We identified the genes involved in the proliferation and transdifferentiation process that are either controlled by individual signaling pathways or by the combination of Wnt and Notch signaling. 

DESIGN
Supporting cell proliferation and mitotic hair cell generation by in vivo genetic reprogramming of Wnt and Notch pathways
