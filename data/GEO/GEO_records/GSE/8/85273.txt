TITLE
Foxh1 marks the embryonic genome prior to the activation of the mesendoderm gene regulatory program

ORGANISM
Xenopus tropicalis

SUMMARY
We examined the binding dynamics of the maternal TF Foxh1 over a time course of germ layer development. Foxh1 binding was compared to the onset of zygotic transcription (RNA pol II), binding of the co-repressor Tle, Nodal signaling (Smad2/3) and the zygotic endoderm TF Foxa.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq analysis of transcription factors Foxh1 and Foxa, RNA Polymerase II and the co-repressor TLE, during zygotic gene activation and germ layer development. Includes biological replicates and stage-matched input controls. Five Samples from GSE53652 are included in this study. The reanalyzed processed data for these Samples are on the Series record.
