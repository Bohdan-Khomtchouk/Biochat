TITLE
Expression data from SKBR3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNA plays a significant role in gene regulation. Long noncoding RNA TMS1AS negatively regulates the sense strand gene TMS1 in breast cancer cells SKBR3. TMS1 is invovled in cell growth and apoptosis through regulating its target genes. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression upon TMS1AS knockdown or TMS1 knockdown and analyzed the specifity of TMS1AS regulating TMS1.

DESIGN
SKBR3 cells were infected with shNC, shTMS1AS or shTMS1 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to identify the genes regulated by TMS1AS or/and TMS1 and analyzed the specifity of TMS1AS regulating TMS1.
