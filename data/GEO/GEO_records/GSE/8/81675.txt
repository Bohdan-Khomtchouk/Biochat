TITLE
Gene expression in Src-/- RAW264.7 cells infected with VSV and HSV-1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to determine what are the effects of Src deficiency on innate antiviral response upon virus infection in RAW264.7 cells. Wild type and Src-/- RAW264.7 cells were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) for 6h. Then the differentially regulated genes were analyzed.

DESIGN
Wild type and Src-/- RAW264.7 cells were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, MOI=1) or herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1, MOI=5) for 6h. Equal amounts of RNA were assayed for gene expression using Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 arrays.
