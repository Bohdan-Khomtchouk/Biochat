TITLE
Analysis of gene expression signatures between bone marrow derived dendritic cells generated from Wild type or DCIR(Clec4a2) knockout mice infected or not with Mycobacterium tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further analysis of our gene expression approach, we have employed whole mouse genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes which are modulated in bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) which expressed or not the receptor DCIR (Clec4a2).  BMDC were obtained from wild type mice or DCIR Knockout mice, and after 7 days of culture, the cells were infected or not with Mycobacterium tuberculosis at a multiplicity of infection of 3 bacteria/cell. A downmodulation of some interferon responsive genes was identified in knock out cells compare to the wild type, in particular in steady state condition and following 4h of infection with the bacteria.

DESIGN
Gene expression in BMDCs was measured at 0, 4 and 18h after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis at a Multiplicity Of Infection (MOI) of 3 bacteria/cell.  Four independent experiments were performed at each time point (0, 4 and 18 hours) using different mice for each experiment.
