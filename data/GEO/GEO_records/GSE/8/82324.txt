TITLE
Expression data from yeasts under non-caloric restriction (NR), caloric restriction (CR) and rapamycin treatment (RM)

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We performed microarrays to identify change of gene expression under NR, CR, and RM and found differentially expressed genes between each condition.
