TITLE
Development of diagnostic exosomal biomarkers for the detection of invasive non-functional pituitary adenomas (NFPAs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The incomplete surgical resection of invasive non-functional pituitary adenomas (iNFPAs) carries the increased risk of complications and requires adjuvant radiotherapy and medications. Thus, the molecular mechanisms and markers of invasiveness must be identified to guide the management of NFPA patients. This study explores the proteomic and transcriptomic variations of invasive and non-invasive NFPAs and other types of pituitary adenomas and evaluates the genetic markers in the exosome related to iNFPAs. The exosome from invasive and non-invasive NFPAs, prolactinomas (PRLs), growth hormoneâ€“secreting adenomas (GHs), adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting adenomas (ACTHs), and normal pituitary tissue were analyzed. We confirmed that elevated matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) expression and its production in the exosome (exo-MMP1) are correlated with the invasive characteristics of NFPA. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the role of exo-MMP1 in invasiveness, we analyzed the effects of MMP1 on cell migration, cell growth and tumor angiogenesis. After transfection of MMP1 or a shRNA expression vector into NFPA cells, we obtained the associated exosome and observed that the altered expression and production of MMP1 in the exosome was significantly synchronized with the transduction of NFPA cells. In addition, the enrichment of MMP1 in the exosome promoted cell migration, cell growth and tumor angiogenesis via protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) signaling in recipient cells. Thus, these data demonstrate that MMP1 plays an important role in tumor invasion and angiogenesis and show that an exosome-mediated regulatory pathway for MMP1 may represent a target for therapeutic treatment.

DESIGN
This study explores the transcriptomic variations of invasive (n=1) and non-invasive NFPAs (n=1) in the exosome.
