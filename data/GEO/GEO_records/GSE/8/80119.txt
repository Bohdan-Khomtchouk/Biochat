TITLE
Effects of exendin-4 in Brunner's glands of male GLP-1R-/-  and wild-type control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the biological functions of the highly expressed GLP-1R in Brunner’s glands, transcriptome analyses were conducted in male GLP-1R-/-  and wild-type control mice. Analyses were performed 6 hours after a single s.c. dose of exendin-4 (1.0mg/kg s.c.),  following 18 hours of two doses of exendin-4 (1.0 mg/kg s.c., administered at 0 and 9 hours), and in untreated controls.  Brunner’s glands were isolated by laser capture micro dissection and extracted total RNA was used for microarray profiling.

DESIGN
A total of 18 samples consisting of laser captured microdissected Brunner's glands from individual male GLP-1R-/- and wild-type (CD-1) mice. Before the isolation of Brunner's glands, mice were dosed with exendin-4 for 6 and 18 hours. The extracted total RNA from Brunner's glands were compared by full transcriptome profiling.
