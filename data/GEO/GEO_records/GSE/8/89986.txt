TITLE
Gene expression profiling in mouse spleen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand Loxl3 gene regulation function in vivo, whole genome microarray expression profiling was used as a discovery platform to identify differential gene expressions in spleen between wild type (wt) mice and Loxl3-/- (ko) mice. Genes including cell-cell adhesion and STAT signaling pathway were identified to be differentially expressed in wt and Loxl3-/- mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA from spleen of Loxl3 wild-type or knock-out mice were used for gene expression analysis.
