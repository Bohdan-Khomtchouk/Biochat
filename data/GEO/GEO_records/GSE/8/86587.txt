TITLE
CCAN Assembly Configures Composite Binding Interfaces to Promote Cross-Linking of Ndc80 Complexes at the Kinetochore

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report that the binding of Cnn1 (CENP-T homolog in yeast) occurs at the core of the yeast centromere and depends on the Ctf3 complex.

DESIGN
The centromere localization of Cnn1 at the centromere in the absence of Ctf3 protein and comparison of its localization with the centromere localization of Cse4
