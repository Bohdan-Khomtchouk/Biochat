TITLE
Astrocyte-specific transcriptional response to glucocorticoid receptor activation in the central nervous system

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Many studies indicated in an indirect way that astrocytes are a major target for transcriptional responses induced by glucocorticoids in the CNS, implying that glial cells an important consituent of stress responses.   To address this issue directly we have generated astrocyte-specific conditional GR knockout mice (Cx30GRko) using Cre/loxP system utilizing connexin 30 promoter driving expression of CreERT2 recombinase. Genome wide analysis of molecular effects of astrocytic GR knockout would allow for dissecting the glial cell-type specific components of stress response mediated by glucocorticoids

DESIGN
We have analyzed 4 groups (5 mice/group): control animals injected with saline, Cx30GRko animals injected with saline, control animals injected with GR agonist dexamethasone (Dex, 4 mg/kg, i.p.) and Cx30GRko animals injected with Dex (4 mg/kg, i.p.). Spinal cord (tissue characterized by the highest efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination) samples were collected 4h after injections.
