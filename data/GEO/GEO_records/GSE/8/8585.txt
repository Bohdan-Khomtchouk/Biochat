TITLE
Hypertensive Study

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Animals. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) weighing about 250g were used. The study was approved by the Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and was conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The animals were housed in Thomas Jefferson University's animal care facilities. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane dissolved in O2 (5% induction; 1% maintenance) and one femoral artery and vein were cannulated (PE-50 tubing) via a small medial incision for measurement of arterial pressure and infusion of drugs, respectively. The cannulae were run subcutaneously to an exit incision between the scapulae. The leg wound was sutured and topical anesthetic (lidocaine) was applied to both skin incisions. Following surgery, after one hour of stable and normal resting blood pressure and heart rate, intravenous infusion was initiated of approximately 1 mL saline, as a control, or phenylephrine (200 µg/mL; 1 mL/hr), to induce hypertension. We followed standard methods in the use of phenylephrine (PE) to elevate blood pressure. PE does not cross the blood brain barrier and the elevated blood pressure it produces has been shown to cause molecular effects in the NTS principally via increased baroreceptor afferent drive by both pharmacological and sinoaortic denervation studies. We titered the PE dose to maintain intermediate levels of elevated blood pressure 25 mmHg above resting blood pressure. Keywords: Hypertension, time series
