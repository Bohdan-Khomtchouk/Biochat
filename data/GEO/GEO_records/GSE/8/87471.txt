TITLE
Atrophin (Atro) ChIP-seq data from Drosophila S2 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq with Drospohila Atrophin (also known as Grunge) antibody using S2 cell chromatin. Atro ChIP-seq peaks are most frequent in promoters and introns of highly expressed, paused genes in S2 cells, including several components of developmental signaling pathways. The Atro peaks overlap significantly with GAGA factor (Trithorax-like, Trl).

DESIGN
ChIP-seq in Drosophila S2 cells with an antibody (4H6) raised against the peptide SRQSPLHPVP in the C-terminus of Drospohila Atro
