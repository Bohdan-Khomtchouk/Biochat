SUMMARY
Alcoholic liver disease is a pathological condition caused by over-consumption of alcohol. Due to the high prevalence of morbidity and mortality associated with this disease, there remains a need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the etiology to develop new treatments. Since peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ (PPARβ/δ) modulates ethanol-induced hepatic effects, the present study examined alterations in gene expression that may contribute to this disease.

DESIGN
Age-matched (8-10 weeks) male Pparβ/δ+/+ and Pparβ/δ-/- mice were fed ad libitum daily with either liquid control or ethanol diets for 16 weeks (N=10 per group). The ethanol diet contained 4% (v/v) ethanol.
