TITLE
Thy-1 Expression Enriches for Self-Renewing Murine MRUs [BL6]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Enriched cell populations from murine mammary epithelium were isolated by FACS and subjected to Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 microarray analysis.

DESIGN
14 Affymetrix array hybridizations were performed on RNA samples that were extracted from sorted mammary epithelial cell populations. Cell populations include Thy-1+CD24medCD49fhigh stem cells, Thy-1-CD24medCD49fhigh progenitor cells, CD24medCD49fmed myoepithelial cells, CD24highCD49fmed luminal progenitor cells and CD24medCD49f-/low differentiated luminal cells.
