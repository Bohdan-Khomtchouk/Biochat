TITLE
Ovarian microRNA profile of long-living Ames dwarf mice during aging

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ovarian tissue was collected at 5-6 months and at 21-22 months of age for miRNA sequencing. We detected a total of 404 miRNAs in the ovarian samples, from which the abundance of 22 and 33 miRNAs changed with age in N and df/df mice, respectively. Of these, only three miRNAs were commonly regulated with age between N and df/df mice, indicating a very divergent miRNA profile between genotypes. We also detected that 46 miRNAs were regulated between N and df/df mice, of which 23 were regulated exclusively in young mice, 12 exclusively in old mice and 12 commonly regulated at young and old ages. Many genes likely to be targeted by these miRNAs are involved in the FoxO, mTOR, PI3k/Akt and insulin signaling pathways. These results suggest that the aging process has a differential impact on the ovarian miRNA profile in df/df mice, and suggest that these miRNAs can be central players in the maintenance of a younger ovarian phenotype.

DESIGN
Ovarian miRNA profile of 6 and 22 month old Ames dwarf (df/df) and Normal (N/df) female mice. Twenty mice were used in this study, for each age/genotype 5 ovarian samples were processed.
