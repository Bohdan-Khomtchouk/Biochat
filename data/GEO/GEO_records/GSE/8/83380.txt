TITLE
Molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by the nuclear zinc-finger protein Zfat in T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ZFAT is a nuclear protein that harbors putative DNA-binding domains. Studies in mice have shown that ZFAT plays a critical role in survival and differentiation in T cells. However, molecular mechanisms whereby ZFAT regulates gene expression programs in T cells remain poorly unknown. We here identify the direct target genes of ZFAT in thymocytes through combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing and transcriptional profiling.

DESIGN
ChIPseq data were obtained for a zinc-finger transcription factor, ZFAT, and histone modifications (H3K9me3 and H3K9ac/K27ac) to further elucidate the functions of ZFAT in thymocytes.
