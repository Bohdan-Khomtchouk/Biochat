TITLE
arrayCGH from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) and hMSC after adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
hMSCs (Lonza) were differentiated towards adipocytes with three cycles of adipocyte differentiation induction and maintenance. hMSCs were differentiated towards osteocytes with osteogenic differentiation medium for 3 days and for 7 days. ArrayCGH experiments were performed before differentiation induction, after 2 and 3 cycles of adipogenic differentiation induction and after 3 days and 7 days of osteogenic differentiation induction.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was isolated form hMSCs before differentiation induction, after 2 and 3 cycles adipogenic differentiation induced cells and from 3-day and 7-day osteogenic differentiation induced cells.
