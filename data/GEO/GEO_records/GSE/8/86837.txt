TITLE
Testicular dysgenesis syndrome and long-lasting epigenetic silencing of mouse sperm genes involved in the reproductive system after prenatal exposure to DEHP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prenatal exposure to 300 mg/kg/day of bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (D300) was administered to pregnant mice during embryonic days 9th to 19th, inducing a Testicular Dysgenesis Syndrome (TDS), observed in 100 days old F1 derived C57BL/6J males. A transcriptomic analysis was performed from spermatozoa produced by D300 mice compared with CTL. We used an adapted RNAseq method able to quantify all RNAs molecules independently of the 5’ and 3’ modifications.

DESIGN
5 CTL versus 5 D300.
