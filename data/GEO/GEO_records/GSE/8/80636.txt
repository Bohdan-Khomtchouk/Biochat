TITLE
Producing enteroendocrine cells from Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells by manipulating quiescence

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lgr5+ adult intestinal stem cells are highly proliferative throughout life. Single Lgr5+ stem cells can be cultured into 3D epithelial organoids containing all cell types at nearnormal ratios. Culture conditions to generate the main cell types have been established previously, but signals inducing the various types of enteroendocrine cells (EECs) have remained elusive. Here we generate quiescent Lgr5+ stem cells in vitro by inhibition of the EGF-receptor (EGFR) and mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in organoids, a state that can be readily reversed. Quiescent Lgr5+ stem cells gain a distinct molecular signature, biased towards EEC differentiation. Indeed, combined inhibition of Wnt, Notch and MAPK pathways efficiently generates a diversity of EEC subtypes in vitro. Our observations uncouple Wnt-dependent stem cell maintenance from EGF-dependent proliferation and cell fate choice, and provide an in vitro approach for the study of the elusive EECs.

DESIGN
We established a stable culture of quiescent Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells in culture. These highly resemble quiescent secretory precursors, which has high EEC differentiation potential. Following on this lead, we elucidated what signals are required to generate EEC cells of all varieties, and provide a method to produce these EEC cells in large numbers.
