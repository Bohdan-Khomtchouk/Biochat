TITLE
Evaluation of ccpA deletion on global gene expression of three M serotype strains of group A streptococcus

ORGANISM
Streptococcus sp. 'group A'

SUMMARY
We sought to determine how deletion of ccpA affects the gene expression profile in three M serotype strains of group A streptococcus

DESIGN
There were 6 strains analyzed, each in quadruplicate replicates: 1) wild-type MGAS2221 ; 2) MGAS2221 ccpA deletion strain; 3) wild-type MGAS10870; 4) MGAS10870 ccpA deletion strain; 5) wild-type MGAS6180; 6) MGAS6180 ccpA deletion strain
