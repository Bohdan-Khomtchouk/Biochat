TITLE
Genomic imbalances of lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was perform to identify regions with genomic imbalance in lung cancer.The aCGH analysis detected a total of 325 regions with genomic imbalance in all 8 lung cancer samples, ranging from focal rearrangements (70 kb–5 Mb) to chromosome-arm alterations with chromosomal segments amplification or deletion. Among these mutations, a total of 115 genomic imbalances were discovered occurring at high frequency varying from 25% to 50%.

DESIGN
Genomic imbalances of lung cancer was tested in 8 randomly-selected pairs of lung cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissues using the Agilent SurePrint G3 human CGH 4×180K array by a commercial company
