TITLE
CTL-OA-OP human IT PF Bone - CompuGen H19K microarray study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aims of study: (1) To identify systemic differences in osteoarthritic (OA) bone that contribute to OA pathogenesis. (2) Identify novel osteoporotic (OP) bone-related disease genes. Study involved comparison of trabecular bone extracted from the intertrochanteric (IT) region of the proximal femur (PF) from OA, OP and normal/control (CTL) individuals. Bone was obtained from OA and OP individuals at surgery for total hip replacement and from CTL individuals at autopsy. Keywords: Bone tissue comparison, diseased versus non-diseased, factorial design, linear modelling
