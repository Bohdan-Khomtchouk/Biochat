TITLE
Ribosome profiling of human platelets, reticulocytes, and in vitro cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Translation is a fundamental biological process and ribosomes are essential in all  cells, but defects in ribosome biogenesis (ribosomopathies) disproportionately  cause hematopoietic dysfunction of red blood cells and platelets. Here, we  analyze translation in primary human reticulocytes and platelets by ribosome  profiling and uncover dramatic accumulation of post-termination, unrecycled  ribosomes in the 3Â´UTRs of mRNAs. We then demonstrate that these ribosomes  accumulate as a result of the natural loss of the ribosome recycling factor ABCE1  during terminal differentiation. We find that induction of ribosome rescue factors  PELO and HBS1L is required to maintain translational homeostasis when ABCE1  levels fall. This activation of ribosome rescue mitigates the effects of ribosome  shortage on translational output, including on hemoglobin production. Our  observations suggest that this distinctive loss of ABCE1 in anucleate blood  lineages sensitizes them to defects in ribosome homeostasis and that activation  of a ribosome rescue pathway plays a lineage-specific role in maintaining  ribosome homeostasis during blood cell development.

DESIGN
Analysis of ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing data from primary human platelets, primary human reticulocytes, in vitro derived platelet-like particles, and hemin-induced differentiation of K562 cells; manipulation by knockdown and overexpression of Pelota (PELO) and HBS1L in K562 cells and Meg01/platelet-like particles.
