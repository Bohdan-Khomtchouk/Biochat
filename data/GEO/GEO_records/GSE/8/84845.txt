TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of zebrafish larvae microRNA expression profilling by 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE47) treatment

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Purpose: We report the application of NGS for the impacts of BDE47 exposure on the miRNA expression profiling of zebrafish larvae. Methods: miRNA profiles of 6-day-old BDE47-treated and control zebrafish larvae were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hisq 2000 platform. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks. Results: Compared BDE47 treatments with solvent control, a dozen of validated zebrafish miRNAs, including dre-miR-142a-3p, dre-miR-142b-5p, dre-miR-144-3p, dre-miR-146a, dre-miR-190a, dre-miR-219-5p, dre-miR-301b-3p, dre-miR-459-5p, rno-miR-33-5p, dre-miR-735-3p, and dre-miR-735-5p, significantly changed their expressions. Conclusions: This study provides a framework for the application of high-throughput sequencing towards characterization of the impacts of BDE47 on whole zebrafish larval miRNA expression profiling.

DESIGN
Examination of zebrafish larvae miRNA expression profilings with blank, vehicle and 2 different concentrations of BDE47 treatments.
