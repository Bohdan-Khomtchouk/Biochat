TITLE
Cytoplasmic polyadenylation is a major regulator of mRNA fate during oogenesis and egg activation.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The GLD-2 class of poly(A) polymerases regulate the timing of translation of stored transcripts by elongating the poly(A) tails of target mRNAs in the cytoplasm. WISPY is a GLD-2 enzyme that acts in the Drosophila female germline and is required for the completion of the egg-to-embryo transition. Though a handful of WISPY target mRNAs have been identified during both oogenesis and early embryogenesis, we aimed to discover the full range of WISPY targets at each stage. To globally identify these targets, we carried out microarray analysis to look for maternal mRNAs whose poly(A) tails fail to elongate in the absence of WISP function. We examined the polyadenylated portion of the maternal transcriptome in both stage 14 (mature) oocytes and in early embryos that had completed egg activation. Our analysis shows that the poly(A) tails of thousands of maternal mRNAs fail to elongate in wisp-deficient oocytes and embryos. Furthermore, we have identified specific classes of genes that are highly regulated in this manner at each stage. Our study shows that cytoplasmic polyadenylation is a major regulatory mechanism during oocyte maturation and egg activation.

DESIGN
Four groups of comparisons: WT vs. wisp total RNA from stage 14 oocytes, WT vs. wisp total RNA from fertilized eggs, WT vs. wisp poly(A)+ RNA from stage 14 oocytes, WT vs. wisp poly(A)+ RNA from fertilized eggs. Each comparison consisted of three independent RNA extractions and each experiment was done with dye-swap pairs as two technical replicates.
