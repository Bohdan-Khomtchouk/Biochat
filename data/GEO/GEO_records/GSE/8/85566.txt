TITLE
DNA methylation in lung cells is a key modulator of asthma endotypes and genetic risk [DNA methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated genome-wide methylation data using the 450K from freshly isolated airway epithelial cells of asthmatics and non-asthmatics. This data was paired with genome-wide genetic and gene expression data from the same individuals allowing for an integrated analysis of genetic, transcriptional, and epigenetic signatures in asthma.

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide methylation levels and comparison to phenotypes
