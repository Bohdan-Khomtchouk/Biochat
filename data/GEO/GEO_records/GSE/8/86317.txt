TITLE
Podocyte-specific JAK2 Overexpression Worsens Diabetic Kidney Disease in Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Overexpression of glomerular JAK2 mRNA specifically in glomerular podocytes of 129S6 mice led to significant increases in albuminuria, mesangial expansion, glomerulosclerosis, glomerular fibronectin accumulation, and glomerular basement membrane thickening as well as a significant reduction in podocyte density in diabetic mice. Treatment with a specific JAK1/2 inhibitor partly reversed the major phenotypic changes of DKD

DESIGN
Glomerular RNA was extracted  using the RNeasy Mini Kit and processed for hybridization on Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.1 ST chip microarrays
