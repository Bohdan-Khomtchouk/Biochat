TITLE
Functional Connection with Cardiac Tissues Confers Maturation Phenotypes in hPSC-Derived PHOX2B::GFP Expressing Sympathetic Neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a remarkable tool for modeling human neural development and diseases. However, it remains largely unknown whether the hPSC-derived neurons can be functionally coupled with their target tissues in vitro, which is essential for understanding inter-cellular physiology and further translational studies. Here, we demonstrate that hPSC-derived sympathetic neurons can be obtained from hPSCs and that the resulting neurons form physical and functional connections with cardiac muscle cells. By use of multiple hPSC reporter lines, we recapitulated human autonomic neuron development in vitro, and successfully isolated PHOX2B::eGFP+ neurons exhibiting sympathetic marker expression, electrophysiological properties, and norepinephrine secretion. With pharmacological and optogenetic manipulations, the PHOX2B::eGFP+ neurons controlled the beating rates of cardiomyocytes, and their physical interaction led to neuronal maturation. Our study lays a foundation for the specification of human sympathetic neurons and for the hPSC-based neuronal control of end organs in a dish.

DESIGN
Using the four genetic reporter systems (OCT4::eGFP, SOX10::eGFP, ASCL1::eGFP, and PHOX2B::eGFP reporter hESC lines), we were able to purify discrete cell populations at four differentiation stages, recapitulating the sympathoadrenal differentiation process in vitro with purified and defined populations in four specific differentiation stages. We performed transcriptome analysis of OCT4::eGFP+ cells (3 biological replicates, representing undifferentiated hESCs), SOX10::eGFP+ cells (3 biological replicates, multi-potent neural crest), ASCL1::eGFP+ cells (3 biological replicates, putative sympathoadrenal progenitors), and PHOX2B::eGFP+ cells (2 biological replicates, putative sympathetic neuronal precursors).
