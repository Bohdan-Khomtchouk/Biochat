TITLE
Gene expression profiling to identify potential therapeutic targets and improve prognostication of advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) receiving first-line chemotherapy, visceral metastases (VM) and ECOG performance status â‰¥ 1 are poor prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). We hypothesized that tumor gene expression profiling may enhance prognostic stratification and identify potential therapeutic targets.

DESIGN
We performed tumor tissue NanoString analysis of 25 patients with locally advanced or metastatic PSCC receiving first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy to identify a prognostic gene expression signature after controlling for VM and PS status.
