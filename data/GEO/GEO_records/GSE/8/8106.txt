SUMMARY
We hypothesized that the estrogen-related receptor a (ERRa), which recruits PGC-1a to metabolic target genes in heart, exerts protective effects in the context of stressors known to cause heart failure. ERRa-/- mice subjected to left ventricular (LV) pressure overload developed signatures of heart failure including chamber dilatation and reduced LV fractional shortening. 31P-NMR studies revealed abnormal phosphocreatine depletion in ERRa-/- hearts subjected to hemodynamic stress, indicative of a defect in ATP reserve. Mitochondrial respiration studies demonstrated reduced maximal ATP synthesis rates in ERRa-/- hearts. Cardiac ERRa target genes involved in energy substrate oxidation, ATP synthesis, and phosphate transfer were downregulated in ERRa-/- mice at baseline or with pressure overload. These results demonstrate that ERRa, a potential therapeutic target, is indispensable for the adaptive bioenergetic response to hemodynamic stressors known to cause heart failure.
