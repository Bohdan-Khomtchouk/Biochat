TITLE
Gene expression analysis of chronically inflamed human peri-implant and periodontal ligament cells in vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the gene expression profiles of chronically inflamed human peri-implant and chronically inflamed human periodontal tissues in order to elucidate potential changes at the molecular level. Cells out of the pocket depth of the inflamed peri-implant and periodontal ligament as well as from the middle third of healthy periodontal ligament were applied. Genome-wide gene expression was compared with the help of microarray analysis, and the data were validated by real-time RT-PCR. The expression rates of 14,239 genes were investigated and 2,079 of them were found differentially expressed by at least two-fold; the expression rates of 1,093 genes were significantly up-regulated and the expression rates of 986 genes were significantly down-regulated in inflamed peri-implant cells compared to inflamed periodontal cells. We focused on genes coding for extracellular matrix components and those that degrade them. Only genes of non-fibril-forming collagens (types IV, VI, VII, and XVII) were increased in inflamed peri-implant tissue, whereas only the genes of two fibril-forming collagens (types III and XVII) were decreased, suggesting that peri-implant tissue re-models faster than periodontal tissue. Furthermore, cathepsin D and cathepsin S might participate to a greater extent in connective tissue destruction of peri-implant tissue. The present investigation demonstrated that, despite their clinical similarities, periimplantitis and periodontitis are two different diseases at the genetic level. Keywords: inflammation, peri-implant, periodontal ligament cells
