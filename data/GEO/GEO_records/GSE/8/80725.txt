TITLE
WGBS assessment of global methylation alterations in Dnmt3aKO/FLT3-ITD lymphoid leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated global DNA methylation maps of FLT3-ITD and Dnmt3aKO/FLT3-ITD lymphoid leukemias, as well as normal control thymocytes.

DESIGN
Whole genome bisulfite sequencing of cells using Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500
