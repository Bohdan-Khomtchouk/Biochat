TITLE
Role of H4K8ac in P. falciparum life cycle [ChIP]

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Study of chromatin changes of P. falciparum in response to changes in the levels of histone H4 acetylations especially H4K8ac using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to microarray chip (ChIP-on-chip)

DESIGN
ChIP-on-chip of P. falciparum intraerythrocyic life cycle upon hyper or hypo acetylated Histone H4 achieved by treating the cells with HDAC inhibitors or mutating the lysine residues respectively
