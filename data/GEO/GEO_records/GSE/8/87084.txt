TITLE
Fam60a defines a variant Sin3a-Hdac complex in embryonic stem cells required for self-renewal

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq). The aim of this RNA-seq experiment was to monitor the genome-wide transcriptional changes in mouse embryonic stem cells depleted of either Fam60a or Sin3a.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq of mRNA level of mESCs depleted for Sin3a and Fam60a.
