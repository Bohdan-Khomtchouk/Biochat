TITLE
Transcriptome of Medicago truncatula abi5 mutants during seed development

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
A transcriptome analysis of developing abi5 and wild type (R108) seeds from Medicago truncatula was performed to decipher the role of ABI54 in the regulation of late seed maturation and seed longevity.

DESIGN
Transcriptome of Medicago WT (R108 background)  lines (3 replicates) compared with two Medicago Tnt1 insertion lines in Medtr7g104480, named abi5-1 (NF4383) and abi5-2 (NF3376) using the Medicago_v1 NimbleGen chip
