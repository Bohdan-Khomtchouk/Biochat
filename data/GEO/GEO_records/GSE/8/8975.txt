TITLE
Global expression profiling of Arabidopsis plants overexpressing a member of the DEVIL gene family.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The DEVIL (DVL) family is a plant-specific family of genes that encode predicted small polypeptides (Wen, et al., 2004; Narita, et al., 2004). Overexpression of DVL family members in Arabidopsis results in pleiotropic developmental phenotypes including shortened stature, rounded rosette leaves, clustered inflorescences, shortened pedicles and horn-like protrusions at the distal end of siliques. Point mutations reveled that a conserved C-terminal domain is required for DVL overexpression phenotypes and is conserved in all family members. Based on the overexpression experiments, DVL family members are suggested to play important roles in plant development. In an attempt to uncover genes whose transcription was changed in response to DVL overexpression, we designed a microarray-based global profiling experiment. A transgenic Arabidopsis line that carried a GVG construct (glucocorticoid inducible) (Aoyama and Chua, 1997) driving the expression of DVL4 was generated and used in this experiment. This allowed for better identification of primary transcriptional responses to DVL overexpression. Experiments with transgenic lines in which DVL overexpression is driven by a constitutive promoter would add the complexity of secondary transcriptional responses as well. Computational analysis of the datasets generated in this experiment lead to the identification of genes that may be involved in responding to DVL overexpression. Experimentation is currently ongoing to investigate the role these genes play in plant development and the DVL overexpression phenotypes.
