TITLE
Influence of chitin on the transcriptome of Vibrio coralliilyticus S2052 and Photobacterium galatheae S2753 (V. coralliilyticus)

ORGANISM
Vibrio coralliilyticus

SUMMARY
Members of the Vibrionaceae family are often found associated with chitin-containing organisms and they are thought to play a major role in chitin degradation. The purpose of the present study was to determine how chitin affected the transcriptome and metabolome of two bioactive Vibrionaceae strains, Vibrio corallilyticus and Photobacterium galatheae. We focused on chitin degradation genes and secondary metabolites based on the assumption that these molecules in nature confer an advantage to the producer. Growth on chitin caused up-regulation of genes related to chitin metabolism and of genes potentially involved in host colonization and/or infection. The expression of genes involved in secondary metabolism was also significantly affected by growth on chitin, in one case being thirty-four folds upregulated. This was reflected in the metabolome, where the antibiotics andrimid and holomycin were produced in higher amounts on chitin. Interestingly, in cultures of P. galatheae grown on chitin we detected high amounts of the biogenic amine phenylethylamine. Overall, these results suggest that both V. coralliilyticus and P. galatheae have a specific lifestyle for growth on chitin, and that the secondary metabolites they produce are likely to play a crucial role during chitin colonization.

DESIGN
Each strain was grown on two carbon sources (glucose G and chitin C). RNA was extracted at two time points: late exponential phase (1*10^8 CFU/ml) and stationary phase (24 hours from inoculation). For each strain in each condition, at 3 biological replicates were analyzed, unless the QC led us to discard one replicate (so at least two biological replicates were analyzed for each strain in each condition)
