TITLE
HiSeq Chip-seq analysis of whole genomic landscape of G9a and H3K9me2-targeted in CCICs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: to demonstrate that G9a maintain CCICs functional triats is independent of its methyltransferase activity. Method: ChIP-seq was applied to CCICs to elucidate the nature of G9a and H3K9me2-regulated differential gene targets by Illumina/Soleza Genome analyzer Results: It was shown that ghe 4,902 G9a-and H3K9me2-targeted genes are broadly idstributed throughout the genome, and both are co-localized at most of the sites in CCICs.

DESIGN
G9a and H3K9me2-targeted in CCICs
