TITLE
Genes expression analysis of 3B7N regulation of hypooctyl elongation under continuous blue light irradiation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the transcript regulation of early Arabidopsis seedlings developments with 3B7N under continuous blue light irradiation.

DESIGN
Genes expression profiles of 3B7N treatment on WT and cry1cry2 were evaluated.  3B7N effect was evaluated by comparing 3B7N-treated sample to respective genotype sample with DMSO treatment.
