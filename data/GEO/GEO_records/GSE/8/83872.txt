TITLE
Chx10 consolidates V2a interneuron identity through two distinct gene repression modes [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During development, two cell-types born from closely related progenitor pools often express the identical transcriptional regulators despite their completely distinct characteristics. This phenomenon highlights the necessity of the mechanism that operates to segregate the identities of the two cell-types throughout differentiation after initial fate commitment. To understand this mechanism, we investigated the fate specification of spinal V2a interneurons, which share important developmental genes with motor neurons (MNs). Here we demonstrate that the paired homeodomain factor Chx10 functions as a critical determinant for V2a fate and is required to consolidate V2a identity in postmitotic neurons. Chx10 actively promotes V2a fate, downstream of the LIM-homeodomain factor Lhx3, while concomitantly suppressing MN developmental program by preventing the MN-specific transcription complex from binding and activating MN genes. This dual activity enables Chx10 to effectively separate V2a and MN pathways. Together, our study uncovers a widely applicable gene regulatory principle for segregating related cell fates.

DESIGN
ChIP DNA samples from Chx10-ESC-derived MNs were prepared for sequencing according to the Illumina protocol, and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000. The peak calling was conducted with MACS software (Zhang et al., 2008). MEME-ChIP Suite (Bailey et al., 2009; Machanick and Bailey, 2011) and TOMTOM algorithm (Gupta et al., 2007) was used for motif analysis.
