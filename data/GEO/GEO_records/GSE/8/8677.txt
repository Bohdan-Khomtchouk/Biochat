TITLE
Panton-Valentine Leukocidin Does Not Impact Virulence of Community-associated MRSA

ORGANISM
Borreliella burgdorferi

SUMMARY
Panton-valentine leukocidin (PVL) has been linked to worldwide emergence of community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) -- its role in virulence in unclear.  Here we show that PVL had no effect on global gene expression of prominent CA-MRSA strains nor did it affect bacterial clearance from lungs, spleen and kidneys in a highly discriminatory rabbit bacteremia model.  These findings negate a large body of epidemiological research that implicated PVL in CA-MRSA virulence. Keywords: mutant vs wild type in 2 different growth phases grown in 2 different medias
