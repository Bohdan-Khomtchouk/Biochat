TITLE
Modulation of LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells by Amauroderma rugosum hexane fraction (HF)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The anti-inflammatory effects of A. rugosum might be associated with various signalling transduction pathways and therapeutic targets. Therefore, with the aid of microarray technology specific signalling pathways and therapeutic targets by A. rugosum hexane fraction (HF) can be easily identified.

DESIGN
Biological replicate (in duplicate) samples were sorted according to four conditions: cells only (control), cells induced with 1 µg/mL of LPS, cells treated with 100 µg/mL of HF, and cells induced with 1 µg/mL of LPS and treated with 100 µg/mL of HF.
