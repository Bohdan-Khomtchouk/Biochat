TITLE
Salt suppresses IFNÎ³-inducible chemokines in mouse kidneys with a high-salt condition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling related cytokines and chemokines of mouse kidneys comparing the kidneys of WNK4 D561A/+ mice fed an 8% high-salt diet with those of WNK4+/+ littermates with a normal diet. Goal was to determine the effects of a high-salt condition on the immune system in kidney.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: mouse kidneys of WNK4+/+ mice fed a normal diet vs. those of WNK4 D561A/+ mice fed an 8% high-salt diet for 7 days (n = 3).
