TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of OPM2 treatment with VS-5584 (SB2343).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The PI3K/mTOR pathway is a constitutively active in multiple myeloma. Single inhibition of mTOR usually confers reactivation of the pathway. VS-5584 (SB2343) is a bispecific PI3K/mTOR inhibitor which effectively and specifically inhibits the target pathways and shows potent anti-myeloma activity. We utilised a gene microarray analysis to analyse and identify the genes that were sensitively regulated by VS-5584 treatment in OPM2.

DESIGN
OPM2 cells were either treated with DMSO(drug solvent) or with 125nM of VS-5584(SB2343) which is half the IC50 concentration of the drug at 48h in OPM2 cells. The cells were harvested at  24h in order to detect the regulation of relatively early response genes.
