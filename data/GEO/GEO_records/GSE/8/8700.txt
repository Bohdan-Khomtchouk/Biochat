TITLE
Expression data from epididymal fat tissues of diet induced obese rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profiles of epididymal fat from DIO rats We applied a comparative functional genomics approach to evaluate diet-induced obese (DIO) rats as an obesity model Keywords: single time point, comparison control animal vs. diet induced obese animal
