SUMMARY
Estrogen receptors (ERs), which mediate the proliferative action of estrogens in breast cancer cells, are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate expression of their primary target genes through several mechanisms. In addition to direct binding to cognate DNA sequences, ERs can be recruited to DNA through other transcription factors (tethering), or affect gene transcription through modulation of signaling cascades by non-genomic mechanisms of action. To better characterize the mechanisms of gene regulation by estrogens, we have identified more than 700 putative primary and more than 1500 putative secondary target genes of estradiol in MCF7 cells through microarray analysis performed in the presence or absence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide. Keywords: drug treatment
