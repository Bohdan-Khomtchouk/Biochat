TITLE
Rare germline copy number variations and disease susceptibility in familial melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mounting evidence suggests that copy number variations (CNVs) can contribute to cancer susceptibility.  The main goal of this study was to evaluate the role of germline CNVs in melanoma predisposition in high-risk melanoma families. We used genome-wide tiling comparative genomic hybridization and SNP arrays to characterize CNVs in 335 individuals (240 melanoma cases) from American melanoma-prone families (22 with germline CDKN2A or CDK4 mutations). We found that the global burden of overall CNVs (or deletions or duplications separately) was not significantly associated with case-control or CDKN2A/CDK4 mutation status after accounting for the familial dependence. However, we identified several rare CNVs that either involved known melanoma genes (e.g. PARP1, CDKN2A) or co-segregated with melanoma (duplication on 10q23.23, 3p12.2 and deletions on 8q424.3, 2q22.1) in families without mutations in known melanoma high-risk genes. Some of these CNVs were correlated with expression changes in disrupted genes based on RNASeq data from a subset of melanoma cases included in the CNV study. These results suggest that rare co-segregating CNVs may influence melanoma susceptibility in some melanoma-prone families and genes found in our study warrant further evaluation in future genetic analyses of melanoma.

DESIGN
We used genome-wide tiling comparative genomic hybridization to characterize CNVs in 255 individuals from American melanoma-prone families (22 with germline CDKN2A or CDK4 mutations).
