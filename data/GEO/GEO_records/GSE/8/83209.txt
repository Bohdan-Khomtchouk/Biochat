TITLE
Schistosomula exposed to HDAC inhibitor (Trichostatin A) [24hrs]

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
HDACs inhibitors induces mortality in the parasite Schistosoma mansoni (schistosomula and adult worms), and became an interesting drug class for the development of new drugs to treat schistosomiasis. In order to understand the effect of histone hyperacetylation on the parasite, we tested the effect of the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A on schistosomula gene expression.

DESIGN
Newly transformed schistosomula were exposed to 1 ÂµM Trichostatin A or vehicle solution (ethanol) and kept in culture for 24 h. Three independent biological replicates were assayed for each condition.
