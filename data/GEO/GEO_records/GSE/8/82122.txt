TITLE
Confirmation dataset of Transcriptome Sequencing (RNAseq) data utilizing Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Biopsies with Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma for Exploration of Disease Biology and Biomarker Development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset complements GSE76207. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are an underused resource for molecular analyses. This proof of concept study aimed to compare RNAseq results from FFPE biopsies (Eikrem et al., PLoS One. 2016 Feb 22;11(2):e0149743. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0149743. eCollection 2016. PMID: 26901863) with FFPE confirmation dataset from clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients. Core biopsies were obtained with a 16g needle from 16 patients undergoing partial or full nephrectomy. The RNA sequencing libraries were generated applying the new Illumina TruSeqÂ® Access library preparation protocol. The goal of the study is to compare the discovery and the confirmation data and to assess the utilization of the data for ccRCC biomarker development.

DESIGN
RNA from paired ccRCC and normal human renal biopsies were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500; platform GPL16791. In accordance with local ethics committee, raw sequence data cannot be provided.  Please contact the submitter for the sequence data.
