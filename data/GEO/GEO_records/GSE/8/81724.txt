TITLE
A comprehensive analysis of gene expression patterns in wild-type and Batf2-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMφ)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We previously identified TLR-independent expression of 4933430F08Rik, encoding Batf2, in T. cruzi-infected bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) (Kayama et al., 2009). To determine the functions of Batf2 in innate immune responses, we performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis in wild-type and Batf2-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMφ). RNA-seq analysis showed that 98 genes are upregulated in Batf2-/- BMMφ stimulated with LPS following IFN-γ treatment, when compared with that in wild-type cells. Among these genes, we focused on Il23a, encoding IL-23p19, because IL-23 is able to promote expression of Il17a in Th17 cells.

DESIGN
mRNA of wild-type and Batf2-/- BMMφ were subjected to deep sequencing profiling using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
