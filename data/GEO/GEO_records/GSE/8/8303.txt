TITLE
Gene expression profiling and array CGH in Ewing's sarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
According to array-CGH data tumors were segregated in two different groups: one genomic stable and other genomic unstable. The genomic unstable group showed a statistically significant shorter overall survival ans was more refractory to chemotherapy. Gene expression profile revealed that genes related with chromosome segregation, DNA repair pathways and cell cycle control were upregulated in the genomic unstable group Keywords: Tumor comparison
