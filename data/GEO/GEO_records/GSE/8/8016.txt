TITLE
Comparative genomic hybridization between chicken and Japanese quail

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Since Japanese quail and chicken belong to the same order Galliforms, DNA sequence of both species are highly conserved and proved to be applicable for various analyses each other. Quail are commonly used to address physiological questions for reasons of economy. To test whether chicken microarrays are useful to quail samples, we compared hybridization signals of chicken and quail genomic DNA on Affymetrix chicken genome array. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
