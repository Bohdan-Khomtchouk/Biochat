TITLE
MiRNAs (microRNAs) involved in the regulation of chemo-resistance of breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By comparing the miRNA expression profiles of parental breast cancer cell and multidrug resistant breast cancer cells, we are trying to find out some miRNAs which are involved in the regulation of chemo-resistance in breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
By approximately imitating the schedules of “time-increasing method” and “dose-escalation method” administration with paclitaxel, two novel multidrug resistant (MDR) cell lines Bads-200 and Bats-72 were successfully developed from drug-sensitive breast cancer cell line BCap37, respectively. We compared miRNA expression in these three cells with a 16.0 version of the miRNA microarray, and each cell was tested in triplicate. These changes of expression of miRNAs were considered to be a candidate for regulation the chemo-resistance in breast cancer cells, which will be further verified by functional experiment.
