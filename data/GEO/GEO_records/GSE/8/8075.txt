SUMMARY
Rib bone growth in red deer stags - Abstract: In 'The Bone and Joint Decade' interest is focused on genetic factors causing bone disorders. Osteoporosis, attacking 10% of the population worldwide, is the most common metabolic bone disease, which is mimiced by several ovarectomised or genetically modified 'cascadeur' animal species, but none of them is able to remedy its pathologically porous bone tissue. Regeneration in skeletal elements is the curiosity of our newly investigated osteoporosis animal model, red deer (Cervus elaphus). The cyclic physiological osteoporosis in red deer stag is a consequence of the annual antler cycle. This phenomenon raises the possibility to explore new genes involved in regulating bone mineral density (BMD) and recovery of bone resorption on the basis of comparative genomics between deer and human. Here we compared the gene expression activities of osteoporotic and regenerating flying rib bone samples versus late autumn dwell control in red deer by heterologous microarray hybridization. Identified genes were tested on human femoral bone tissue from postmenopausal osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic patients. Expression data were evaluated by Principal Components Analysis and Discriminant Analysis. Keywords: Gene Expression experiment
