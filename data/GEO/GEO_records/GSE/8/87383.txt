TITLE
TIFA links Aurora A to NF-κB survival pathway to support chemoresistance in acute myeloid leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant secretion of cytokines contributes to pathogenesis of leukemia and is considered a prognostic signature for recurrence of AML. We asked whether molecular targeting of TIFA can perturb NF-κB-dependent secretion of leukemic cytokines and attain better therapeutic efficacy. We performed cytokine antibody array to profile cytokines secreted by U937 cells in response to TIFA dominant-negative fragments and cytarabine treatment.

DESIGN
4 samples. There are 4 groups: U937 vector cells, U937 vector cells treated with cytarabine, U937 F1F2 cells treated with cytarabine, and U937 F1F2 cells treated with cytarabine.
