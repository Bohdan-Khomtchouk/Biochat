TITLE
DNA microarray-mediated transcriptional profiling of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli O2 strain E058 during its infection of chicken

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
APEC most often infect chickens, turkeys, ducks, and other avian species, and therefore pose a significant economic burden on the poultry industry worldwide. Few studies have analyzed the genome-wide transcriptional profile of APEC during infection in vivo. In this study, we examined the genome-wide transcriptional response of APEC O2 strain E058 in an in vivo chicken infection model to better understand the factors necessary for APEC colonization, growth, and survival in vivo. An Affymetrix multigenome DNA microarray, which contains most of the genomic open reading frames of E. coli K-12 strain MG1655, uropathogenic E. coli strain CFT073, and E. coli O157:H7 strain EDL 933, was used to profile the gene expression in APEC E058.The genes highly expressed during infection were involved in metabolism, iron acquisition or transport, virulence, response to stress, and biological regulation. Many genes encoding putative or hypothetical proteins were also strongly upregulated, implying that some undiscovered mechanism may underlie APEC pathogenesis.
