TITLE
Expression Profiling of Arabidopsis Long Noncoding RNAs Under Continuous Light Condition

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), Natural Antisense Transcripts (NATs), and microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in many biological processes. To profile circadian regulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), we grow Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) under short day SD (8h light/16h dark) condition and used the ATH lincRNA v1 array to profile lincRNA, NAT and miRNA gene expression under continuous light condition. Using JTK_CYCLE to search for cycling expression pattern of genes, we found ~900 genes encoding lincRNAs, NATs and miRNAs showed significant cycling expression patterns (Adjusted P-value < 0.05).

DESIGN
6 time points x 2 replicates.
