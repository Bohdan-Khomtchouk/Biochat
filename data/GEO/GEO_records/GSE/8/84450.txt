TITLE
ER stress increases alternative splicing of SRFS3’s poison exon.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse fibroblasts stressed with 1mM dithiothreitol for 4 hours were interogated for stress-induced alternative mRNA spliceforms

DESIGN
mRNA-Seq Untreated fibroblasts versus dithiothrietol stressed fibroblasts; wild-type, Ire1α-null and Xbp1-null lines were compared.
