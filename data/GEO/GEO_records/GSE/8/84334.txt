TITLE
Gene expression analysis of DAC treated AML: high impact or tumor suppressor gene expression changes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DAC represents a therapeutic option for elderly AML patients. However, there is still a lack of data for valid biomarkers in respect to response. We executed a gene expression analysis prior to treatment to evaluate gene expression patterns associated with response that might be used to predict DAC therapy outcome. In our cohort an objective ORR of 27% was seen. In a class comparison analysis 333 genes were identified that correlated significantly with response. In this gene signature genes that were prior associated with adverse outcome to regular chemotherapy were enriched in the response group. Interistingly for the non response cohort TSG showed an increased expression, suggesting that epigenetic silencing due to promoter hypermethylation might play a lesser role in theses leukemia pathogenesis.

DESIGN
Gene expression was profiled in 45 AML samples in DAC treated patients prior to therapy. Response n=20, non response n=18, unknown n=7)
