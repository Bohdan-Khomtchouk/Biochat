TITLE
The expression patterns correlated with disease severity of adrenoleukodystrophy via microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain molecular insight into the inflammatory phenotype of childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD), we performed microarray-based transcriptional profiling analysis of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), control-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)-iPSCs and CCALD-iPSCs.

DESIGN
200 ng of total RNA from purified hESCs (P35–45), control-iPSCs (P10-20), CCALD-iPSCs (P10–20), AMN-iPSCs (P10–20) was transcribed to yield biotinylated complimentary RNA (cRNA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
