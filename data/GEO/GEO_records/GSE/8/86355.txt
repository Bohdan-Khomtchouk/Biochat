TITLE
Comprehensive Analysis of the DNA Methylome of Human Cutaneous Melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Novel screening techniques are allowing the depiction of the portraits of molecular alterations across cancer types, enabling a better understanding of the progression mechanisms and providing new therapeutic targets. Here, we performed an unbiased genome-wide DNA methylation analysis to interrogate the epigenetic events characterizing melanoma progression and prognosis, on a discovery cohort of clinical specimens. Our data underscores the importance of epigenetic regulation in triggering metastatic dissemination through the inactivation of central cancer-related pathways. Inactivation of cell-adhesion and differentiation programs unleashes malignant dissemination, and subsequent activation of inflammatory and immune system programs impairs anti-tumoral defense pathways. Moreover, we identify several markers of tumor progression previously unrelated with melanoma, and determined a survival prognostic signature with potential clinical applicability. All findings were validated in independent clinical cohorts and cross-correlated with publicly available databases, highlighting the relevance of the identified DNA methylation alterations for melanoma progression.

DESIGN
