TITLE
Myc regulates chromatin decompaction and nuclear architecture during B cell activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We  show  that  stimulated lymphocytes  decondense  chromatin  by  three  differentially-regulated  steps. First, chromatin  is  repositioned  away  from  the  nuclear  periphery  in  response  to  global acetylation. Second, histone nanodomain clusters decompact into mononucleosome fibers  through  a  mechanism  that  requires  Myc  and  continual  energy  input.  Single-molecule imaging shows that this step lowers transcription factor residence time and non-specific collisions during sampling for DNA targets. Third, chromatin interactions shift  from  long-range  to  predominantly  short-range,  and  CTCF-mediated  loops  and contact  domains  double  in  numbers.  This  architectural  change  facilitates  cognate promoter-enhancer  contacts  and  also  requires  Myc  and  continual  ATP  production. Our   results   thus   define   the   nature and transcriptional   impact   of   chromatin decondensation  and  reveal  an  unexpected  role  for  Myc  in  the  establishment  of nuclear topology in mammalian cells.
