TITLE
RNA immunoprecipiation identifies novel targets of DAZL in human fetal ovary

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified 429 potential RNA targets of DAZL in the human fetal ovary (padj < 0.01), with function in synaptonemal complex formation and recombination (SYCP1, SYCP3, HORMAD1, TRIP13, TEX11), structural maintenance of chromosomes/cohesin formation and spindle assembly checkpoint (SMC1B, RAD21L, MAD2L1), and DNA repair (RAD18, RAD51, RAD54B).

DESIGN
Immunoprecipitation of endogenous DAZL from 17weeks gestational age (wga) human fetal ovarian tissue. DAZL-bound RNAs were purified and sequenced.
