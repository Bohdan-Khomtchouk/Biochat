TITLE
Profiling of AKVPL vs AKVPSL derived tumor cells  (Mouse)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from fluorescence activated cell sorted (FACS) Lgr5-GFP+ and Lgr5-GFP- from aged matched subcutaneously implanted Apcmin/+;KrasLSL-G12D/+;VillinCre; Lgr5DTReGFP;p53KO  (AKVPL) and Apcmin/+;KrasLSL-G12D/+;VillinCre; Lgr5DTReGFP;p53KO;SMAD4KO (AKVPSL) intestinal tumours. " SAMPLE_ID " sample characteristic is a sample identifier internal to Genentech. The ID of this project in Genentech's ExpressionPlot database is PRJ0009421

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of Lgr5+ and Lgr5- tumour cells from AKVPL and AKVPSL murine derived intestinal tumours
