TITLE
The effects of fresh oil sands process water, ages oil sands process water, and pure naphthenic acids on fathead minnow larval transcriptome.

ORGANISM
Pimephales promelas

SUMMARY
In this study, fathead minnow (FHM) embryos were exposed to two doses of fresh, aged and pure naphthenic acids mixtures until hatch. Larvae were scored for developmental deformities prior to preservation for gene expression analyses. 5 larvae were pooled per gene expression replicate.

DESIGN
There were 27 samples analyzed:  3) fresh oil sands, salt control;  3)  fresh oil sands, 10ppm; 3) fresh oil sands, 5ppm; 3) aged oil sands, salt control; 3) aged oil sands 10ppm; 3) aged oil sands, 20ppm; 3) pure naphthenic acids, salt control; 3) pure naphthenic acids 1.25ppm; 3) pure naphthenic acids 2.5ppm In this study, a dose response of three sources of naphthenic acids were investigated in larval fathead minnow after an embryo to hatch exposure period.
