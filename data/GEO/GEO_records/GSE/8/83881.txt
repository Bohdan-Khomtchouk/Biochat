TITLE
Gene expression of developed cancer stem cells [all]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA expression of human induced cancer stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells were analyzed.

DESIGN
mRNA expression analysis of cancer stem cells which are induced from human cancer patient tissue cells with defined factors or human iPS cells with a cancer cell culture medium
