TITLE
mRNA Expression data from sodium butyrate or sodium phenylbutyrate treated A549 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As a histone deacetylase inhibitor, sodium butyrate and its derivative sodium phenylbutyrate involve in cellular events such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and cell cycle control via reprogramming gene expression. However, the gene associated with the cell cycle control and molecular signaling triggering cell apopotosis and death are not well elucidated. Here, we treated A549 cells,a cell line belong to the non-small cells lung cancer,with high concentration of sodium butyrate or sodium phenylbutyrate and then used microarray identified differentially-expressed mRNA during this process.
