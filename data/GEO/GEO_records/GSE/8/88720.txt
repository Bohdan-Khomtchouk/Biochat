TITLE
Gene expression data from meningioma samples and healthy meningial cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although meningioma is a common disease, there is a lack of understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms behind its initiation and progression. We used combined miRNA-mRNA transcriptome analysis to discover novel genes and networks in meningiomas.

DESIGN
Fourteen fresh-frozen meningioma samples and one human meningeal cell line were analyzed by using gene expression microarray chips. Data was filtered and analyzed.
