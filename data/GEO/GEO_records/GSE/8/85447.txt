TITLE
Genetic Variation amongst NHBE donor cells containing various TRPV1 SNPs with and without particulate matter treatments

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of our study was to determine the effect the TRPV1 I585V SNP has on lung cells.  NHBE cells, obtained from 4 different donor (Lonza), were genotyped to identify the presence of the TRPV1 SNP I585V.  Of the 4 patient samples, 2 were heterozygous for the I585V SNP and 2 expressed WT TRPV1.  These cells were plated in 12 well plates and treated with Coal Fly Ash (CFA) at multiple concentrations and capsasian.  Differences between the patient samples were assessed.

DESIGN
NHBE cells from 4 different donors, (2 WT, 2 I585V HETS) were compared
