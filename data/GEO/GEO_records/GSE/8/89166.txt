TITLE
HCoV-229E infection of the human HuH7 cell line [Experiment B]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment is to identify changes in host gene expression upon infection of Huh7 hepatoma carcinoma cells  with human coronavirus HCoV-229E as compared to uninfected cells and in comparison to cells stimulated by IL-1alpha (10ng/ml) for 1h. All experiments have been performed at 33°C which is required for sufficient viral entry/replication. Also included are two samples which have been treated with a heat inactivated coronavirus (56°C for 5min).

DESIGN
Single-color hybridization of RNA from HuH7 cells. Duplicates.
