TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of dorsal root ganglia of transgenic sickle and control mouse models for studying genetic signatures of pain in sickle cell disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of transgenic mouse models of sickle cell disease (SCD) and their transgenic controls. Each genotype (strains) were divided into two age groups and each age groups were subjected to two treatment conditions (each simulating acute and chronic pain respectively). Each of these 8 groups had 6 male mice (except one group had 7 mice) resulting into a total of 49 samples. The goal of mRNA sequencing of these samples is to identify genetic signatures associated with transition from acute to chronic pain in SCD.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels from dorsal root ganglion of transgenic mouse models of sickle cell disease and littermate controls under two dffiferent age groups and two different treatment conditions to find genetic targets that underly SCD pain and transition from acute to chronic pain.
