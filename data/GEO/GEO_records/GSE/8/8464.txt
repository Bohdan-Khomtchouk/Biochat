SUMMARY
New findings demonstrate that transcriptional factors alternative to Smad4 can bind to Smad2/3 and mediate different transcriptional effects. In this study, we detected constitutively phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in Smad4-null pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3. Both pan-specific TGF-β-neutralizing antibody and specific TGF-β type I receptor (TβR-I) inhibitor, SB-431542, can decrease steady-state p-Smad2/3 levels. Moreover, exogenous TGF-β strongly stimulated translocation of phosphorylated Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3) into the nucleus. Therefore, we identified TGF-β-responsive genes using genome-wide oligonucleotide microarrays and confirmed their dependency on Smad2/3 by the combination of RNA interference (RNAi) and microarray assay. The major finding from our microarray analysis was that of the 262 target genes seen to be regulated via TGF-β induction, 87 were differentially transcriptionally controlled by Smad2/3 signaling and 175 were Smad2/3-independent. Our results showed that integrin β6 was transcriptionally up-regulated via TGF-β induction in a Smad3-dependent manner, which was validated by real-time RT-PCR and western blot. We also provide evidence that αVβ6 integrin can activate TGF-β-Smad2/3 signaling. Thus, we for the first time suggest the positive feedback loop compose of TGF-β-Smad3 signaling and integrin β6. Functional analysis revealed that exogenous TGF-β can amplify the invasive property of Smad4-deficient pancreatic cancer cells; however, TGF-β-neutralizing antibody, specific TβR-I inhibitor, and anti-αVβ6 integrin antibody can reduce it. Therefore, integrin β6 mediated the invasion of BxPC-3 cells induced by TGF-β signaling. Keywords: cell type comparison
