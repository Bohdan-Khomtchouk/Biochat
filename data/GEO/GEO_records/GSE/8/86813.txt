TITLE
Assessing the impact of loss of ATF7IP and SETDB1 on the transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By comparing HeLa cells lacking ATF7IP or SETDB1 generated through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption to wild-type HeLa cells, the goal of the experiment was to determine the effect of loss of the SETDB1â€¢ATF7IP complex on the transcriptome.

DESIGN
Total RNA-seq of three independent knockout HeLa clones lacking either ATF7IP or SETDB1
