TITLE
5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) increase CREB1 binding to the C/EBP half-site GCAA

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
In human and mouse stem cells and brain, 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) can occur outside of CG dinucleotides.  Using protein binding microarrays (PBMs) containing 60-mer DNA probes, we evaluated the effect of 5mC and 5hmC on one DNA strand on the double-stranded DNA binding of the mouse B-ZIP transcription factors (TFs) CREB1, ATF1, and JUND.  5mC inhibited CREB1 binding to the canonical CRE half-site |GTCA, but increased binding to the C/EBP half-site |GCAA.  5hmC inhibited CREB1 binding to all 8-mers except TGAT|GCAA, where binding is enhanced.  We observed similar DNA binding patterns with the closely related TF: ATF1.  In contrast, both 5mC and 5hmC inhibited binding of JUND.  These results identify new DNA sequences that are well-bound by CREB1 and ATF1 only when they contain 5mC or 5hmC.  Analysis of two x-ray structures examines the consequences of 5mC and 5hmC on DNA binding by CREB and FOS|JUN.
