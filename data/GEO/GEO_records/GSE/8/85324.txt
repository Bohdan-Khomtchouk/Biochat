TITLE
Genome-wide maps of m6A circRNAs identify widespread and cell-type-specific methylation patterns that are distinct from mRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed N6-methyladenosine (m6A) immunoprecipitation of ribosome-depleted RNA to identify m6A-circRNAs

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and HeLa cells. Total RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA and libraries were prepared for sequenceing before and after m6A immunoprecipitation (RIP).
