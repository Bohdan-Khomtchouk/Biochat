TITLE
Evaluation of three small RNA library preparation kits on serum-derived RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We evaluated the effect of the small RNA library preparation method on 5' tRNA-halves and miRNA abundance in libraries prepared from serum RNA using three commercially available small RNA library preparation kits (TruSeq small RNA library preparation kit v2 (Illumina), TailorMix miRNA sample preparation kit v2 (Seqmatic) and the NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA library prep kit (New England Biolabs)). RNA isolated from 100 Âµl of serum collected from healthy mice was used as input for the preparation of a small RNA library in duplicate and libraries were single end sequenced.

DESIGN
Serum samples from healthy mice were used to evaluate three different small RNA library preparation kits. Each kit was evaluated in duplicate.
