TITLE
UNCOVERING VULVAR CARCINOMA: AN INTEGRATIVE APPROACH [CGH]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) analyses was used to analyze 17 VSCC samples from untreated patients. The data were validated using quantitative PCR.

DESIGN
Experiment condition, 17 VSCC DNA samples obtained from untreated patients were labeled with Cy3 and commercial reference samples (Promega) were labled with Cy5. Samples Cy3 and Cy5 were mixed and hybridized at slide glasses Agilent 8x60 platform.
