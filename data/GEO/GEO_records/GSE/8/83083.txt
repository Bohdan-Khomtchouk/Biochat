TITLE
RNA-Seq data for AKT, BAD, ERBB2, IGF1R, RAF1 and KRAS(G12V) overexpressed samples with twelve green fluorescent protein control samples using human mammary epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal was to capture the transcriptional activity due to over-expression of AKT, BAD, ERBB2, IGF1R, RAF1 and KRAS(G12V) genes .Overexpressions were validated using Western Blots. Illumina RNA-Seq technology was used to capture the downstream transcriptional activity. Reads were 101 base pairs long and single ended. An R open source package “Rsubread” was used to align and quantify the read using UCSC hg19 annotation. The integer-based gene counts were later normalized in TPM .

DESIGN
Profiles of gene expression, downstream of  AKT, BAD, ERBB2, IGF1R, RAF1 and KRAS(G12V) over-expression, were generated in cells derived from breast and used to generate a gene-expression signatures.
