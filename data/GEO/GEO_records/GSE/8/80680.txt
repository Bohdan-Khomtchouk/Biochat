TITLE
Global transcriptome analysis reveals aging-related genes in Atp8b1 mutant lungs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aging is associated with progressive decline in lung function and responses to environmental stress culminating in increased incidence of lung diseases. Initial analysis of Atp8b1 (ATPase, Aminophospholipid Transporter, Class I, Type 8B, Member 1) mutant mice (on C57BL/6J background) revealed deficiency in transporter function and was associated with decreased lung function. Therefore, to further study the aging-related genes in the lungs at the molecular level, the transcriptome analysis of Atp8b1 mutant and C57BL/6J lungs were carried out at 14 M and 7_9 wks of age. Global transcriptome analysis revealed 532 differentially expressed genes in Atp8b1 mutant lungs, 157 differentially expressed genes in C57BL/6J mice and 37 overlapping genes. Interestingly, the majority of age-related (350) genes were unique to Atp8b1 mutant lungs in contrast to the 85 genes that were unique to C57BL/6J lungs. Further, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of aged genes in Atp8b1 mutant lungs showed enrichment of canonical signaling pathways such as xenobiotic metabolism signaling and Nrf2-mediated signaling pathway. We validated Adamts2 and Mmp13 in Atp8b1 mutant lungs by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In addition, Col1a1 and CxCr6 were also validated in both Atp8b1 mutant and C57BL/6J lungs, respectively. To summarize, our study provide insights into altered age-related genes in Atp8b1 lungs that are associated with mutation and environmental trigger when compared to C57BL/6J lungs.

DESIGN
This experimental design had three factors: sex, strain (Atp8b1 mutant and C57BL/6J), and time (14 M and 7_9 wk). Female, C57BL/6J mice at 7_9 wks were not represented due to sexing error. The replicate size was three for all sample groups, except for male, C57BL/6J mice at 7_9 wks, which was represented by 5 replicates. A total of 23 Affymetrix Mouse 430v2 Arrays were used in gene expression analysis.
