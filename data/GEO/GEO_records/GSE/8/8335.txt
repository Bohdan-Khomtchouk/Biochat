Saccharomyces cerevisiae response to various stressors

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Samples GSM206658-GSM206693: Acquired Stress resistance in S. cerevisiae: NaCl primary and H2O2 secondary Transcriptional timecourses of yeast cells exposed to 0.7M NaCl alone, 0.5mM H2O2 alone, or 0.5mM H2O2 following 0.7M NaCl, all compared to an unstressed sample.  Repeated using msn2∆ strain. Samples GSM291156-GSM291196: Transcriptional response to stress in strains lacking MSN2  and/or MSN4 Transcriptional timecourses of yeast cells (WT, msn2∆, msn4∆, or msn2∆msn4∆) exposed to 0.7M NaCl for 45 minutes or 30-37˚C Heat Shift for 15 min compared to an unstressed sample of the same strain.
