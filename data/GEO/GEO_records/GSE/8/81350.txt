TITLE
Study of microRNA associated with telmisartan’s anti-tumor effect in esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The miRNAs expression was markedly altered with the treatment of telmisartan　in vitro and various miRNAs induced by telmisartan also may contribute to tumor growth in vitro.

DESIGN
Using a custom microarray platform, we analyzed the expression levels of 2555 human miRNA probes in the OE 19 cell line in vitro that was treated with and without telmisartan.
