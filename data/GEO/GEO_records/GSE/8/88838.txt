TITLE
Effect of serum extracellular vesicle depletion protocols on miRNA expression of cultured cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study examined microRNA expression of cells maintained in media prepared with replete serum (EVR) or with serum depleted of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by either of two methods: standard overnight ultracentrifugation (UC-EVD) or a proprietary method used by Thermo Fisher (TF-EVD).

DESIGN
Human donor monocyte-derived macrophages, T-lymphocytic ACH-2 cells (HIV latency model), and promonocytic U1 cells (HIV-latency model) were maintained in the respective media, with the harvested media conditioned for 48 hours before harvesting. Total RNA was extracted, and miRNA profiles were generated for each sample by custom TaqMan low-density array (TLDA, Thermo Fisher).
