TITLE
Acetylation enhances TET2 function in protecting against abnormal DNA methylation during oxidative stress [A2780 damage time points - methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of A2780 cells untreated (mock), treated with H2O2 for 30 min (H2O2 30 min), or treated with H2O2 for 30 min with additional 2.5 hour resting ( H2O2 3h) . The Illuminaâ€™s Infinium Human Methylation450 Beadchip Kit (WG-314-1001) was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs.

DESIGN
A2780 cells were either untreated (mock), treated with H2O2 for 30 min and harvested immediately (H2O2 30 min), or treated with H2O2 for 30 min, replace with fresh medium and rested fro an additional 2.5 hour ( H2O2 3h). Mock cells were harvested at 30 min time point.
