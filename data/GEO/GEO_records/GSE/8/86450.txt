TITLE
ChIP-Seq of Histone Deacetylases and Cell Cycle-Regulators in Multiple Myeloma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription of oncogenes is regulated by histone deacetylases and cyclins.  Some of these proteins are targetable with small molecules.  This series contains ChIP-Seq targeting transcriptional regulators from a cell line model of multiple myeloma.
