TITLE
H3K36me3 ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plants developed a plasticity to eviromental conditions, such as temperaure, that allows their adaptation. A change in ambient temperature leads to changes in the transcriptome in plants, such as the production of different splicing isoforms. Here we study temperature induced alternative splicing events in Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and two epigentic mutants, sdg8-2 and sdg26-1 using an RNA-seq approach.

DESIGN
We performed 4 biological replicates of H3K36me3 ChIP-seq for each condition (16°C and 25°C day 1).  Anti-He ChIP-seq was used as a control.
