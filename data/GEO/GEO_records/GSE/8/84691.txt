TITLE
RNAseq to profile IFNg response in human primary monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We did transcriptome profiling for monocytes treated with or without IFNg to characterize IFNg response.

DESIGN
Human primary monocytes were cultured for 24 hours with or without IFNg, harversted and prepared for RNA for RNAseq.
