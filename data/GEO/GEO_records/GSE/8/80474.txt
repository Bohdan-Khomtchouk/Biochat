TITLE
Investigating Conservation of the Cell-Cycle-Regulated Transcriptional Program in the Fungal Pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Cell-cycle transcript dynamics from two species of wild-type budding yeast growing at 30 degrees Celsius in rich media: Saccharomyces cerevisiae (BF264-15D background) and Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii (H99F background). We compared programs of cell-cycle-regulated genes between distantly related budding yeasts.

DESIGN
One time course experiment for each yeast over multiple cell cycles
