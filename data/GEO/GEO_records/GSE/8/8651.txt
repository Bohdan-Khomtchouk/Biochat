TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of zebrafish yquem/urod mutant

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zebeafish yquem harbors a mutation in the gene encoding uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), the fifth enzyme in heme biosynthesis, and was established  as a vertebrate model for human hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP). In an effort to investigate the unknown aspects of UROD deficiency pathogenesis, we used a 14,000-oligonucleotide-gene microarray to determine differentially expressed genes in yquem/urod (-/-) and wild type control zebrafish larvae. Keywords: zebrafish, Danio rerio, wild-type yquem, urod, porphyria
