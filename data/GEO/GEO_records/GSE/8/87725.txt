TITLE
Term placenta syncytiotrophoblast transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Placenta is an epitome of cell signalling, including the signalling between two semi-allogenic individuals, mother and fetus. We have studied the putative crosstalk by analyzing the expression of corresponding ligands and receptors on maternal fetal interface. This transcriptome represents one of the important cellular sources, namely the multinucleated fetal layer that is directly bathed in the maternal blood. It was collected by microdissection, as it is too large to be included in the single cell preparation. In combination with other compartments, whose transcriptomes are provided along with this one, we think this study provides a rich resource of gene expression profiles of term placenta.

DESIGN
mRNA-seq of placental syncytiotrophoblast from term healthy pregnancies.
