TITLE
Transciptome profiling of NoDice and RNaseIII null cells prior to and after polyIC treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess the impact of endogenous RNaseIII nucleases on the overall transcriptome and the reseponse to dsRNA. We utilized CRISPR techology to engineer an RNaseIII null cell line using the NoDice 293T parental strain genearated the Cullen lab as the parental cell line.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 293T, NoDice 293T, and RNaseIII null cells alone or treated with polyIC for 8 hours
