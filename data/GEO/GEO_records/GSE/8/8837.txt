TITLE
Transcriptional regulation by the novel Rho GTPase RhoBTB2.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RhoBTB2 is a novel Rho GTPase that undergoes loss, underexpression and mutation in breast and lung cancer. We have shown that we can mimic loss of RhoBTB2 through siRNA treatment of primary cells. We propose to perform comparative microarray analysis of primary lung cells to establish the identification of the gene targets of RhoBTb2 regulation. Keywords: Effects of siRNA expression
