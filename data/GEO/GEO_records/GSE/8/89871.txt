TITLE
CIPHER: An extensive and flexible processing platform for next-generation sequencing data and de-novo enhancer discovery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a unified tool that can be used to process a broad range of sequencing datasets and it's use in identifying transcriptional enhancers

DESIGN
Identification and analysis of transcriptional enhancers in two different chromatin states
