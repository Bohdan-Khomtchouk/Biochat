TITLE
Identification of SOX11 target genes in myxoid liposarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify potential SOX11 target genes in myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) we stably transfected codon optimized full-length human SOX11 into the SOX11 negative MLS cell line MLS-1765. An emtpy vector (EV) was used as control. Potential SOX11 target genes were correlated with data set GSE52390.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates (rep1 and rep2) with different cell passage numbers (early and late) were used for MLS-1765 overexpressing SOX11 or emtpy vector.
