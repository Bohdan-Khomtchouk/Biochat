TITLE
Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines: Control vs. Fn14 or Luciferase siRNA Treated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression profiling on the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 human breast cancer cell lines following siRNA-mediated inhibition of Fn14 expression as an approach to identify the mechanistic basis for Fn14 regulation of invasive capacity. Keywords: siRNA-mediated inhibition
