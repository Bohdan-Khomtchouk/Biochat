TITLE
Hydrogel scaffolds promote neural gene expression and structural reorganization in human astrocyte cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Biomaterial scaffolds have the potential to enhance neuronal development and regeneration. Understanding the genetic responses of astrocytes and neurons to biomaterials could facilitate the development of synthetic environments that enable the specification of neural tissue organization with engineered scaffolds.  In this study, we used high throughput transcriptomic and imaging methods to determine the impact of a hydrogel with no known bioactive epitopes, Puramatrixâ„¢, on human glial cells in vitro. Parallel studies were undertaken with cells grown in a monolayer environment on tissue culture polystyrene. When the Normal Human Astrocyte (NHA) cell line is grown in a hydrogel matrix environment, the glial cells adopt a structural organization that resembles that of neuronal-glial cocultures, where neurons form clusters that are distinct from the surrounding glia.  Statistical analysis of next generation RNA sequencing  data  uncovered a  set  of  genes  that are  differentially  expressed  in  the  monolayer  and  matrix  hydrogel  environments.   Functional  analysis  demonstrated  that  hydrogel-upregulated  genes  can  be  grouped  into  three  broad  categories:  neuronal differentiation  and/or  neural  plasticity, response  to  neural  insult,  and  sensory  perception.  Our results demonstrate that hydrogel biomaterials have the potential to transform human glial cell identity, and may have applications in the repair of damaged brain tissue

DESIGN
RNA sequencing of normal human astrocytes (Lonza) from 2 biological donors that were cultured for 5 days either with the peptide hydrogel Puramatrix or on tissue culture polystyrene
