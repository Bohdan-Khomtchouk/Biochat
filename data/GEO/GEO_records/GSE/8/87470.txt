TITLE
Genome-wide map of Pol II and Flag-LARP7 in human HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated genome-wide maps of Pol II and Flag-LARP7 in human HeLa cells. We find that Flag-LARP7 and Pol II co-locolize on Pol II-specific sn/snoRNA genes.

DESIGN
5 samples were analyzed: Input, two controls, Pol II and Flag-LARP7
