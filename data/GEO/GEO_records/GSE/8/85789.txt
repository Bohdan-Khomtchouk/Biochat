TITLE
Molecular substrates for differences between layers and regions of the entorhinal cortex during postnatal development in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report the first full transcriptome analysis of layer II and deep layers of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex during postnatal development. Our analysis showed that postnatal timepoint was the most important element in entorhinal cortex transcriptional dynamics, followed by laminar differences. There were fewer differentially expressed genes between the medial and lateral parts of the entorhinal cortex, and most of these were found in layer II.

DESIGN
Ribosome depleted deep sequencing of layer II and deep layers of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex of Long Evans rats at postnatal ages 2,9,23, and 45.
