TITLE
LS174T treatment with Selamectin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to determine the expression signature in colon cancer LS174T cell line after selamectin treatment. The current study of selamectin is continuation of our previous work,  PMID: 25143352.

DESIGN
LS174T cells were treated with DMSO or 5uM Selamectin for 16h. Cells were then collected, RNA extracted and used for expression analysis.
