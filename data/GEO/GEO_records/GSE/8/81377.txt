TITLE
Epitope mapping of a monoclonal antibody directed against Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen by peptide microarray

ORGANISM
Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to determine the epitope targeted by 31E10/E7 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) and the cross-reactivity to linear peptide epitopes of 10 different Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) variants. mAb 31E10/E7 was diluted at 1:200 and incubated on a custom PepStar Peptide Microarray platform printed with 560 different peptides in three independent experiments.
