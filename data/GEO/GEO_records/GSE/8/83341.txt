TITLE
Transcriptomes of FA1090,, FA1090cpxA::kan, FA1090cpxR::erm mutant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in late log phase

ORGANISM
Neisseria gonorrhoeae

SUMMARY
To better understand the role of Neisseria gonorrhoeae CpxRA in controlling virulence determinants, here we defined genes potentially regulated by CpxRA by using RNA-Seq. We identified approximately 139 genes differentially expressed between cpxA (Cpx system active) and cpxR (Cpx system inactive) mutants. A large number of the differentially expressed genes encode envelope-localized proteins.

DESIGN
RNA of Neisseria gonorrhoeae wildtype, cpxA and cpxR mutants were collected at late log phase of growth, in quadruplicate.
