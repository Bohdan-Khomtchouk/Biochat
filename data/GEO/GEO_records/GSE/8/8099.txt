TITLE
Whole genome analysis of mRNA decay in P. falciparum reveals a lengthening of mRNA half-life during the IDC

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The rate of mRNA decay is an essential element of post-transcriptional regulation in all organisms.  Previously, studies in several organisms found that the specific half-life of each mRNA is precisely related to its physiological role, and plays an important role in determining levels of gene expression.  We have used a genome wide approach to characterize mRNA decay in Plasmodium falciparum.  We found that globally, rates of mRNA decay increase dramatically during the asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle.   During the ring stage of the cycle, the average mRNA half-life was 9.5 minutes, yet this was extended to an average of 65 minutes during the late schizont stage of development.  Thus a major determinant of mRNA decay rate appears to be linked to the stage of intraerythrocytic development.  Furthermore, we have found specific variations in decay patterns superimposed upon the dominant trend of progressive half-life lengthening.  These variations in decay pattern were frequently enriched for genes with specific cellular functions or processes.  Elucidation of Plasmodium mRNA decay rates provides a key element for deciphering mechanisms of genetic control in this parasite, by complementing and extending previous mRNA abundance studies.  Our results indicate that progressive stage-dependent decreases in mRNA decay rate function are a major determinant of mRNA accumulation during the schizont stage of intraerythrocytic development.  This type of genome wide change in mRNA decay rate has not been observed in any other organism to date, and indicates that post-transcriptional regulation may be the dominant mechanism of gene regulation in P. falciparum.
