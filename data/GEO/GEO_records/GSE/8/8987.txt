TITLE
Expression data from buccal and nasal epithelium of current and never smokers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer death, although only a small percentage of smokers develop the disease. Cigarette smoke exposure is known to cause a field of injury in cells throughout the respiratory tract, and while these airway epithelial cells are morphologically normal, they can undergo genetic alterations in response to cigarette smoke exposure. We used microarrays to analyze the gene expression of epithelial cells in the extrathoracic epithelium, specifically nasal and buccal epithelium, to see if these cells underwent similar genetic alterations in response to tobacco exposure as seen in bronchial epithelial cells as has been previously reported. Keywords: cross sectional
