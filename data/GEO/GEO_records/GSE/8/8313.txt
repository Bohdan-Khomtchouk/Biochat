TITLE
integrin alpha7 overexpression effects on skeletal muscle transcriptions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of integrin alpha7 transgenic mice skeletal muscle transcription profiles comparing to wild type controls. Integrin alpha7 is the major laminin binding integrin in muscle cells. Enhancing its expression has been demonstrated to alleviate pathology in a murine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Results of this study provide insights into the effects of increasing integrin alpha7 expression on skeletal muscle transcription and physiology in vivo.  This analysis also evaluates any potential possible side effects associate with enhancing integrin alpha7 in skeletal muscle. Keywords: transgenic mice comparision to wild type controls
