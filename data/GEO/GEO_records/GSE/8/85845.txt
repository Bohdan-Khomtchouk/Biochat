TITLE
DNA methylation analysis of lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent non-tumor tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of lung adenocarcinoma and non-tumor adjacent tissues. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles. Samples included eight lung cancer and adjacent non-tumor tissues excised from a cohort of 8 patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

DESIGN
DNA was extracted from frozen tissue samples using the Qiagen® Genomic DNA Mini Kit, as described by the manufacturer. DNA quantification was performed using a NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo). The bisulfite conversion of DNA was conducted using the Zymo bisulfite gold kit. The Infinium Methylation 450K assay was performed according to Illumina’s standard protocol. Processed methylation chips were scanned using an iScan reader (Illumina). All samples were processed at the same time to avoid chip-to-chip variation. Infinium Methylation data were processed using the Methylation Module of the GenomeStudio software package (v. 2011.1).
