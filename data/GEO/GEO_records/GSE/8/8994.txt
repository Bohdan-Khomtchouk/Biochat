TITLE
A Comparison of microarray and MPSS Technology Platforms for Expression Analysis of Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
A comparison of microarray and MPSS technologies can help to establish the metrics for data comparisons across these technology platforms and determine some of the factors affecting the measurement of mRNA abundances using different platforms. Here,  different Treatments/Conditions based on different Arabidopsis tissues were used for three different platforms include MPSS, Affymetrix and Agilent. Keywords: MPSS, Affymetrix, Agilent
