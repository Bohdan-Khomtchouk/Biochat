TITLE
Efficient generation of pancreatic β-like cells from the mouse gallbladder

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report here an improved protocol to reprogram mouse gallbladder cells (GBCs) into pancreatic beta cells. To fully understand the extent of reprogramming, mRNA was extracted from FACS-purified MIP-GFP positive insulin-producing cells (namely rGBC2) for RNA-seq after 10-days of in vitro reprogramming. The global gene expression profile of rGBC2 was compared with that of primary gallbladder cells, GBC reprogrammed with the rGBC1 protocol (Hickey et al., 2013) and mouse pancreatic β cells (Benner et al., 2014). We show that rGBC2 from four independent cell batches showed a unique gene expression phenotype. Compared with the rGBC1 protocol, rGBC2 expressed many additional pancreatic β cell genes,  suppressed many gallbladder genes and resulted in an expression profile closer to pancreatic β cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of galbladder reprogrammed, insulin positive cells using the improved reprogramming protocol
