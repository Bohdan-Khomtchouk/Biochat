TITLE
Comparison of planktonic and biofilm growth of Group A Streptococcus by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
Through the use of RNA-seq, we compared the transcriptome of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) at multiple biofilm time points to multiple planktonic time points in order to determine genes that are differentially expressed during biofilm growth.

DESIGN
Biological triplicates from four biofilm time points (8 hour biofilm, 16 hour biofilm, 6 day biofilm and 10 day biofilm) were analyzed and compared to biological triplicates from three planktonic time points (early log phase, late log phase, and early stationary phase).
