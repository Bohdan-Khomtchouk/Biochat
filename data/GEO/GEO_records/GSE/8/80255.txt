TITLE
Comparison of transcriptomes of mouse cumulus cells collected from mice before and after 6-h of hCG priming.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to identify genes that are regulated by the ovulatory signals in mouse cumulus cells. We compared the transcriptomes between cumulus cells colected from mice before (hCG-0h) and after 6 h (hCG-6h) of hCG injection.

DESIGN
3 individual cumulus cell samples of hCG-0h and hCG-6h were collected and subjected to microarray study. Copmarison was done between hCG-0h and hCG-6h groups.
