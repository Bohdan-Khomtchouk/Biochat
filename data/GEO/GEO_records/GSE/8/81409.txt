TITLE
Gene expression levels dependent on cultivated temperature

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To evaluate the gene expression levels dependent on cultivated temperature (15-degree only or 25-degree after 15-degree grown) in wild type (N2 strain) and daf-2mutant

DESIGN
Worms were cultivated at 15-degree from egg to adult or at 25-degree for 12 hours after 15-degree grown until young adult, then total RNA was collected
