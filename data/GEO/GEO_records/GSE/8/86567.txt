TITLE
Changes in miRNA in the lung and blood after whole thorax irradiation in rats: biomarkers for radiation-induced injuries

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used a rat model of whole thorax x-ray irradiation to profile the microRNA (miRNA) in lung and blood up to 4 weeks after radiation. Small RNA from normal and irradiated Wistar rat lungs and blood were analyzed by next-generation sequencing and the changes by radiation were identified by deRNA-seq at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after irradiation.  The average total reads/library was 2,703,137 with a mean of 88% mapping to the rat genome.  Detailed profiles of 100 of the most abundant miRNA in rat blood and lung are described.

DESIGN
Profile of miRNA in Wistar rat lungs and blood with and without radiation from 1 to 4 week after radiation were generated by next generation sequencing. Each group contains three rats.
