TITLE
Comparison of cerebellum between High Runner and Control mouse genotypes in Free or Blocked from Wheel running environments

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goals of this study were: 1) to compare the cerebellum transcriptome and associated networks of one of the High Runner mouse lines relative to mice from a control line and, 2) to evaluate the modulation of potential transcriptome differences between genotypes by the environmental opportunity for physical activity.

DESIGN
At approximately 6 weeks of age, 8 mice from a High Runner line and 8 mice from a Control line were caged individually with free access to wheel for 7 days. On day 7, half of the mice from each genotype were blocked from entering the running wheel.  Samples were profiled using paired-end RNA sequencing
