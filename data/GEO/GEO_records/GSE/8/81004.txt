TITLE
cAMP phosphodiesterase CpdA of Corynebacterium glutamicum: identification, characterization, influence on cAMP level, growth, and global expression, and transcriptional activation by GlxR

ORGANISM
Gluconobacter oxydans

SUMMARY
DNA microarrays were applied to investigate the effect of cpdA deletion (del) or overexpression (over) on the global gene expression of C. glutamicum cells. For overexpression of cpdA the gene was cloned into plasmid pEKEx2 under control of the IPTG-inducible tac promoter, which was induced by addition of 250 ÂµM IPTG.
