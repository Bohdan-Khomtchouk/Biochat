TITLE
P-bodies regulate transcriptional rewiring to promote DNA replication stress resistance

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
mRNA processing bodies (P-bodies) are cytoplasmic granules that form in eukaryotic cells in response to numerous stresses to serve as sites of degradation and storage of mRNAs. Functional P-bodies are critical for the DNA replication stress response in yeast, yet the repertoire of P-body targets and the mechanisms by which P-bodies promote replication stress resistance are unknown. In this study, we identify the complete complement of mRNA targets of P-bodies during replication stress induced by hydroxyurea treatment. The key P-body protein Lsm1 controls the abundance of HHT1, ACF4, ARL3, TMA16, RRS1 and YOX1 mRNAs to prevent their toxic accumulation during replication stress. Accumulation of YOX1 mRNA causes aberrant down-regulation of a network of genes critical for DNA replication stress resistance. Among these genes we identify ALD6, whose de-repression is critical to prevent accumulation of acetaldehyde, a strongly toxic molecule during DNA replication stress. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
