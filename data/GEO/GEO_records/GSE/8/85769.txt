TITLE
Expression and exosome incorporation of microRNA by leukemia versus nonmalignant hematopoietic progenitors

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Exosomes are paracrine regulators of the tumor microenvironment. However, their complex cargo can hamper an understanding of their specific action in target cells. We therefore sought to identify the changes in exosome miRNA content that occur with malignant transformation by comparing two myeloid cancer cell lines to their nonmalignant predecessors, CD34+ human hematopoietic progenitor cells. We employed microarrays to evaluate which miRNA are present at altered concentrations before and after transformation as well as before and after incorporation into exosomes.
