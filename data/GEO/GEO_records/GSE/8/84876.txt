TITLE
Expression data from quadriceps of utrn+/-;mdx mice treated with spironolactone plus lisinopril, eplerenone plus lisinopril or prednisolone compared to untreated

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the gene expression differences in skeletal muscles resulting from treatment of dystrophic mice with spironolactone plus lisinopril, eplerenone plus lisinopril or prednisolone.

DESIGN
12 total samples were analyzed; 3 biological replicates for each spironolactone plus lisinopril, eplerenone plus lisinopril, prednisolone, and untreated groups; a pairwise comparison between groups was carried out and a fold-change â‰¥2 were selected.
