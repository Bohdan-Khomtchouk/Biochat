TITLE
Multi-omics approach to study global changes in a triclosan mutant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978.

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978

SUMMARY
Acinetobacter baumannii AB042, a triclosan-resistant mutant, was examined for modulated gene expression using whole genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and proteomics in order to understand the mechanism of triclosan-resistance as well as its impact on A. Baumannii.

DESIGN
A triclosan mutant (AB042) was isolated by culturing A. baumannii ATCC 17978 in increasing concentrations of triclosan.
