TITLE
Perturbation of epigenetic processes by doxorubicin in the mouse testes: mRNA analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA profiling of mouse testis comparing treatment with doxorubicin to vehicle only control (published in Toxicology Research, DOI: 10.1039/C6TX00078A)

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, doxorubicin vs control at 3 time points (1wk, 4wk and 7 wk following treatment). Biological replicates: 6 control, 6 doxorubicin (implementing a dye swap design of n=3 forward and n=3 reverse). One replicate per dual colour array, which consists of two slides (total of 18 arrays and 36 slides/raw data files).
