TITLE
Identification of an NKX3.1-G9a-UTY regulatory network that controls prostate differentiation (Mouse_Recomb_RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptome of tissue recombinants (mouse seminal vesicle epithelial [SVE] cells or prostate epithelial [PE] cells, and rat urogenital sinus [UGS] mesenchymal cells) grown under the kidney capsule in athymic nude mice for 3 months.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from tissue recombinants generated from combining engineered mouse epithelial cells (SVE or PE from 2-month-old C57Bl/6J mice) and rat UGS mesenchymal cells. Tissue recombinants were harvested and processed for RNA isolation and transcriptome analysis using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen).
