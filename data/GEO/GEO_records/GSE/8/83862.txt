TITLE
Expression profiling of total salivary gland from NOD.H-2h4 mice  with CD40L blockade

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Autoantibodies that arise in autoimmunity can be present years to decades prior to the onset of disease manifestations. This suggests that the initial autoimmune trigger involves a peripheral lymphoid component, which then drives disease pathology in local tissues later in life.  To explore the impact of early peripheral immune dysregulation on the progression of Sjögren’s Syndrome, we blocked the CD40-CD40L pathway in young female NOD.H-2h4 mice at 4 weeks of age with a single injection of anti-CD40L antibody, and collected total salivary gland at the age of week 8, 16 and 24. RNA was extracted and submitted to transcriptome profiling using Affymetrix microarray.

DESIGN
NOD.H-2h4 female mice were treated intra-peritoneally at 4 weeks of age with a single injection of anti-CD40L or human IgG1 isotype control  mAb at 20 mg/kg. Total salivary gland was collected at week 8, week 16 and week 24. RNA was extracted and transcriptome profiling performed using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
