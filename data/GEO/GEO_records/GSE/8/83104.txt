TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles of colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells and oral squamous cell carcinoma Ca9-22 cells to determine SLPI-induced cell migration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we performed microarray-based gene expression profiling of HT-29, Ca9-22 and SLPI-deficient Ca9-22 cells for high-throughput analysis and for screening differentially expressed genes (DEGs)

DESIGN
Cells were seeded on 100-mm cell culture dishes (1 × 10^4 cells/dish), and cultured for 3 days in the growth medium (Minimal Essential Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin) at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After culture, total RNA was extracted from the cells.
