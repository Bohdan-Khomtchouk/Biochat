TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of neonatal mouse cochlear supporting cells [Treated AK]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study examined transcripts that are enriched in neonatal mouse cochlear supporting cells at postnatal day 1 and postnatal day 6 after inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway. Cochleas from postnatal day 0 and postnatal day 5 were cultured for 24 hours in the gamma secretase inhibitor DAPT or DMSO as a vehicle control. Supporting cells were purified by FACS sorting for GFP fluorescence from the cochleas of transgenic mice in which a BAC including the LFng locus drives the expression of GFP. Two replicates of GFP+ supporting cells were compared with all other cochlear cell types that were GFP-. We performed this experiment at two different ages, postnatal day 0+24 hours culture and postnatal day 5 + 24 hours culture.  (corresponding to P1 and P6).

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of P0 and P5 supporting cells (GFP+) and all other cochlear cell types (GFP-) treated with DAPT or DMSO, two replicates each, were generated by deep sequencing using Illumna TruSeq.
