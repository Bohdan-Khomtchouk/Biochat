TITLE
Root transcriptional profile of maize seedlings treated with protein hydolysate, free amino acids and inorganic nitrogen.

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Different forms of N can affect plant metabolism. Differences can be observed at physiological and transcriptional levels comparing maize 4-day-old maize seedlings tretaed for three days with three different N forms: protein hydrolysates (SICIT2000 Spa), inorganic nitrogen (NH4H2PO4) or a mixture of free amino acids.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiles were obtained using roots of 4-day-old maize seedlings grown for three additional days in a diluted nutrient solution (Pinton et al. 1999) supplemented with either protein hydrolysates (SICIT2000 Spa) or inorganic nitrogen (NH4H2PO4) or a mixture of amino acids mimicking the amino acids content of the protein hydrolysates. Three different biological replicates were used for each treatment repeating the grown and treatement experiment three times.
