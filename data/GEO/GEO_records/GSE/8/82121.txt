TITLE
Amino acid catabolism fuels microalgal lipogenesis

ORGANISM
Dunaliella tertiolecta UTEX 'LB 999'

SUMMARY
Microalgal lipid, a feasible substrate for biofuel, is typically accumulated during the stationary growth phase. Generating strains which trigger lipogenesis from the exponential growth phase will enhance lipid productivity, reduce cost of biofuel production. We characterized a lipid-rich microalgal mutant, Dunaliella tertiolecta, which exhibited a six-fold enhancement of neutral lipids production in the exponential growth phase with marginal compromise on growth (4%). Using transcriptomics and metabolomics, regulatory mechanisms of the mutant were uncovered.

DESIGN
Characterization of a lipid-rich mutant using transcriptomics and metabolomics.
