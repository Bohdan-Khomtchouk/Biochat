TITLE
Gene expression analysis of cardiac-specific calreticulin transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of global genome gene expression changes in cardiac-spcifically overexpressed calreticulin mice in 8-10 weeks-old male mice, compared to age and gender matched control mice The characteristics of the transgenic mice analyzed in this study are further discribed in Calreticulin Induces Dilated Cardiomyopathy, PLOS ONE 2013; 8(2): e56387

DESIGN
A MM9 Expression Array (12 x 135K) chip study using total RNA isolated from the heart of three biological calreticulin transgenic mice and three biological control mice
