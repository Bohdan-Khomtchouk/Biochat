TITLE
Identification of GSNO response network in E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
This project used transcriptomic analysis of the S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) response in E. coli, and associated regulatory mutants, to identified the molecular targets of and response to GSNO during aerobic growth in minimal media. Keywords: Comparative genomic response
