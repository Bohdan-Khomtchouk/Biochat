TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Eed knockout and Ezh2 knockout small intestinal crypts [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Polycomb-mediated gene repression plays an important role in adult stem cell maintenance. Direct targets of the Polycomb repressive complex PRC2 in th intestinal epithelium were revealed by performing ChIP-sequencing on crypt samples isolated from wild type murine small intestines. The resulting list of H3K27me3-enriched genes were compared with RNA-sequencing data from wild type and Eed knockout crypts.

DESIGN
Crypts were isolated from wild type murine intestinal epithelium and subjected to ChIP using anti-H3K27me3 and anti-H3K27Ac antibodies, after which DNA isolated from extracted immunocomplexes was sequenced.
