TITLE
Effects of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853 ingestion on Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila melanogaster is a validated eukaryotic model for immunity-concerned studies in the post-genomic era. In the present study we performed oral experimental infection of D. melanogaster with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (strain ATCC27853). By using a whole genome microarray approach, we intended to identify significant alterations in the expression profile of relevant genes amenable to qualify as new models for the investigation of specific host-parasite interactions.

DESIGN
Wild type Oregon males and respectively γCOPS057302/TM6,Tb and γCOP14a/γCOP14a mutant males were feed with P. aeruginosa suspension (treated replicates) or with sucrose solution (untreated replicates). As a reference, we used Oregon untreated replicates (20 biological replicates). For the target groups we used four biological replicates and one target replicate per array.
