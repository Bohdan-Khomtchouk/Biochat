TITLE
Long Noncoding RNA and mRNA Expression Profile in Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the aberrant expressed lncRNA and mRNA and identify the potential lncRNA correlated with core mRNA in LSCC, we screened lnRNA and mRNA expression profile in 9 pairs of primary Stage IV LSCC tissues and adjacent non-neoplastic tissues by lncRNA and mRNA integrated microarrays, conducted in-depth integrated bioinformatics analysis of lncRNA and mRNA, and performed qRT-PCR assays to further validate their expressions in an independent cohort of 30 pairs tissue samples

DESIGN
lnRNA and mRNA expression profile in 9 pairs of primary Stage IV laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) cancer tissues and adjacent non-neoplastic tissues by lncRNA and mRNA integrated microarrays
