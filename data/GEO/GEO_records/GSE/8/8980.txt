TITLE
Recurrent DNA copy number variation in the laboratory mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have conducted a genome-wide analysis of spontaneous copy number variation (CNV) in the laboratory mouse. We used high resolution microarrays to identify 38 CNVs between 14 colonies of the C57BL/6 strain spanning ~967 generations of inbreeding, and examined these loci in 12 additional strains.  It is clear from our results that many CNVs arise through a highly non-random process: 18 of 38 were the product of recurrent mutation, and rates of change vary roughly four orders of magnitude across different loci. These recurrent CNVs are distributed throughout the genome, affect 43 genes, and fluctuate in copy number over mere hundreds of generations, observations that raise questions about their contribution to natural variation.
