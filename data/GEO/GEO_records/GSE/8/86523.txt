TITLE
Hepatocytic parental progenitor cells of rat small hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We analyzed gene expression of hepatocytic parental progenitor cells in a population of small hepatocytes. The hepatocytic parental progenitor cells possess self-renewal capability. These cells maintain the ability to differentiate into mature hepatocytes.

DESIGN
Primary rat small hepatocytes were isolated from fresh livers by using collagenase perfusion method and cultured in serum-free medium. Nine days after plating, colonies were treated with a separation solution and CD44+  cells were isolated by using MACS methods.The sorted CD44+ cells were cultured in Matrigel-coated dishes and passaged every 4 weeks. Second passage cells were cultured for 14 days and then treated with Matrigel-overlay for 7 days. As a control, mature hepatocytes were isolated from fresh livers.
