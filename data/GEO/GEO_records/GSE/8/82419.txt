TITLE
Early response of three Pycnoporus species to various carbon sources [Pycnoporus coccineus]

ORGANISM
Pycnoporus coccineus

SUMMARY
White-rot basidiomycete fungi are potent degraders of plant biomass with the ability to mineralize all lignocellulose components. Recent comparative genomics studies showed that these fungi use a wide diversity of enzymes for wood degradation. Deeper functional analyses are however necessary to understand the enzymatic mechanisms leading to lignocellulose breakdown. In the present study we analyzed the early response of the Polyporales fungi Pycnoporus coccineus CIRM-BRFM310, Pycnoporus cinnabarinus CIRM-BRFM137 and Pycnoporus sanguineus CIRM-BRFM 1264  to various carbon sources including lignocellulosic biomass.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in fungal mycelium after 3 days growth in liquid cultures on maltose, Avicel, xylans-galactomannans, wheat straw, pine or aspen.
