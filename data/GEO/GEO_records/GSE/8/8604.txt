TITLE
Epigenetic therapy with hydralazine and magnesium valproate added to chemoradiation in cervical carcinoma.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As a number of epigenetic alterations have been described in cervical cancer which may participate in the development and progression of this tumor, and the primary treatment for locally advanced disease is concurrent chemoradiation, we wanted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydralazine and valproate added to radiation and cisplatin. In addition, the transcriptome changes induced by the epigenetic drugs were also evaluated. Keywords: Cervical Cancer, epigenetic therapy, valproate, hydralazine, transcriptional response, epigenetic drugs
