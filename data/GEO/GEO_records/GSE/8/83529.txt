TITLE
A MOUSE MODEL OF ALCOHOLIC LIVER FIBROSIS-ASSOCIATED ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY IDENTIFIES KEY MOLECULAR PATHWAYS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We reported this study established a mouse model of fibrosis- and alcohol-associated AKI and identified key mechanistic pathways.

DESIGN
kidney mRNA profiles of Olive oil, CCl4, EtOH, and CCl4+EtOH treatment in C57BL/6 mice were generated by deep sequencing.
