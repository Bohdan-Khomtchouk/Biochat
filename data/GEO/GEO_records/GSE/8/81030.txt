TITLE
Distal regulation of c-myb expression during IL-6 inudced differentiation in murine myeloid progenitor M1 cells [DHS-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report DNAase1 hypersensitive sites located upstream of the c-myb gene,associated with gene expression

DESIGN
Examination of DNAase1 hypersensitive sites in 2 cell types.
