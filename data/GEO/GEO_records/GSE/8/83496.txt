TITLE
The miRNAs diversity between pancreatic body/tail and head cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aim to found the differentially expressed miRNAs between the two subtypes of pancreatic cancer

DESIGN
Four paired (age, gender, CA-19-9, differentiation) pancreatic body/tail and head cancer tissues were used for a  Agilent Human miRNA Microarray Kit (8Ã—15k), version 14.0 (design ID: 31945)
