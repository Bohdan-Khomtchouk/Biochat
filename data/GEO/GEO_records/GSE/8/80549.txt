TITLE
Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) differentially interacts with Cenococcum geophilum and other simultaneously inoculated mycorrhizal (ECM) fungi

ORGANISM
Pinus sylvestris

SUMMARY
To identify specific gene networks induced in host roots by C. geophilum, we inoculated seedlings of Scots pine simultaneously with C. geophilum and either Suillus granulatus or Rhizopogon roseolus, two common ECM fungi associated to pines. We then measured the differential expression of Scots pine genes in the respective mycorrhizas using oligoarrays.
