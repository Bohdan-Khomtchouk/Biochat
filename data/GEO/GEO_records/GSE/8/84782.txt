TITLE
GATA-2 occupancy in Kasumi-3 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GATA-2 is a master regulator of hematopoiesis which controls expression of multiple genes and is implicated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the molecular mechanism how GATA-2 deregulation causes leukemogenesis is still unclear. In this study, GATA-2 ChIP-squ analysis was conducted in Kasumi-3 AML cell line to identify GATA-2 target genes which play important roles in the pathogenesis of AML.

DESIGN
ChIP with GATA-2 antibody was conducted in Kasumi-3 AML cell line and ChIP-seq profile was generated by deep sequencing.
