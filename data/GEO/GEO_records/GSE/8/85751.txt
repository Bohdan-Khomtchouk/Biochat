TITLE
Expression data of vrn2/- emf2/+  and wild-type ovules and seeds

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Polycomb Group proteins belonging to the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) repress seed coat development before fertilization. Removal of PRC2 function in the integuments initiates autonomous seed coat development. We used microarrays to identify those genes that are under PRC2 control and become derepressed in mutants deficient for the PRC2 genes VRN2 and EMF2. Since vrn2 emf2 double mutants have strong developmental aberrations, we used the mutant combination vrn2/- emf2/+ .

DESIGN
WT (Ler) and double mutant vrn2/- emf2/+ plants were emasculated at 1-2 days prior to anthesis. Two days after emasculation half of the WT plants were hand-pollinated. Unfertilized ovules and young seeds were dissected from the siliques at 4 DAE and 2 DAP, respectively.
