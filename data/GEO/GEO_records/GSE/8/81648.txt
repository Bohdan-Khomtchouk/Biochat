TITLE
The effect of antibiotic mediated gut microbiome perturbation on ileal gene expression in NOD mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The early life microbiome plays important roles in host immunological and metabolic development. Because type 1 diabetes (T1D) incidence has been increasing substantially in recent decades, we hypothesized that early-life antibiotic use alters gut microbiota that predisposes to disease.  Using NOD mice that are genetically susceptible to T1D, we examined the effects of exposure to either continuous low-dose antibiotics or pulsed therapeutic antibiotics (PAT) early in life, mimicking childhood exposures. We found that in mice receiving PAT, T1D incidence was significantly higher, microbial community composition and structure differed compared with controls. In pre-diabetic male PAT mice, the intestinal lamina propria had lower Th17 and T reg proportions and intestinal SAA expression than in controls, suggesting key roles in transducing the altered microbiota signals. PAT affected microbial lipid metabolism and host cholesterol biosynthetic gene expression. These findings show that early-life antibiotic treatments alter the gut microbiota and its metabolic capacities, intestinal gene expression, and T-cell populations, accelerating T1D onset in NOD mice.

DESIGN
Microarray experiment was performed on RNA extracted from the terminal ileum of control; STAT; and PAT mice. (Female n=3/group; Male n=5/group except STAT n=3).
