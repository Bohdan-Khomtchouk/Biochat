della-regulation of salt stress responses-DELLAs contribute to salt stress responses

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs06-07_della - della-regulation of salt stress responses - Identification of DELLA-dependent dowtream targets in response to salt stress - Aim was to determine downstream target of DELLA proteins involved in salt stress tolerance. Wt, ga1-3, penta seeds were sterilized, sown on MS agar plates then put for stratification for 3 days at 4degreeC. Plates were placed in growth cabinet for 9 days. Seedlings were transferred to 24 well-plates, with 2 seedlings per well (0.5 ml MS liquid per well). Plates were placed in the same condition for 3 days. Finally, NaCl were added (final concentration 200 mM), except for the control. The salt treatment was applied for 30 min and 1h. Treatment was stopped by freezing in liquid nitrogen.
