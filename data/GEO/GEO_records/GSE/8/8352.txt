TITLE
Generation and purification of Th1 and Th2 effector and memory CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Naïve CD4+ T cells were isolated from spleen of AND TcR transgenic/green fluorescence protein (GFP) transgenic mice (Kaye et al., Nature 1989;341:746, Wright et al, Blood 2001;97:2278) that recognize a peptide of pigeon cytochrome C in the context of I-Ek and express CD44lo, CD62Lhi, CD45RBhi, and CD25-.  After 4 days in vitro stimulation with antigen presenting cells (APC) under either Th1 or Th2 condition, naïve cells become Th1 or Th2 effector cells expressing CD44hi, CD62L lo, CD45RBhi, and CD25+.  Additional 3 days culture in the absence of APC, those effector cells become rested expressing a phenotype similar to memory cells (CD44 hi, CD62L lo, CD45RB lo and CD25-).  These rested effector cells were adaptively transferred into thymectomized, lethally irradiated, and T cell depleted bone marrow reconstituted mice and memory cells were isolated after 4-12 weeks by flow sort.
