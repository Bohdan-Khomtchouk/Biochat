TITLE
Expression data from 9-day-old rat Sertoli cells and MBP-treated rat Sertoli cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Low-dose MBP can stimulated 9-day-old Sertoli cells proliferation and activated proliferation related signal pathway. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process.
