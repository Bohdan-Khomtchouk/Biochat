TITLE
Chromatin access at specific genome sites distinguishes intestinal crypt populations with stem cell potential

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To define differences in chormatin accessibility and histome modifications in intestinal stem and epithelial cells, we performed ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq. We used RNA-sequencing to profile gene expression changes during intestinal stem cell differentiation into different cell types. We find that gene expression is correlated with the chromatin accessibility and reveals differences between intestinal stem cells types.

DESIGN
ATAC-seq, H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K27ac ChIP-Seq analysis of isolated mouse intestinal stem cells and progenitor cells. RNA seq analysis of mouse intestinal stem, progenitor and differntiated cells.
