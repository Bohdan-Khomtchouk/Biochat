TITLE
Excessive leukotriene B4 in nucleus tractus solitarii is pro-hypertensive in spontaneously hypertensive rats.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We have used Affymetrix microarray-driven  gene profiling to comprehensively describe the expression of mRNAs in  the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) in the adult male spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) as compared to  its normotensive parental Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) strain. Keywords: Gene expression
