TITLE
Analysis of pvalb-egfp cells from mouse visual cortex.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We provide an annotated cDNA clone collection which is particularly suitable for transcriptomic analysis in the mouse brain. Using it on microarrays, we compared the transcriptome of EGFP positive and negative cells in a parvalbumin-egfp transgenic background and showed that more than 30Â % of clones are differentially expressed. Our clone collection will be a useful resource for the study of the transcriptome of single cell types. Keywords: Cell type comparison
