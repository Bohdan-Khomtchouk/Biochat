TITLE
MICRORNA EXPRESSÄ°ON PATTERNS OF CD8+ T CELLS IN ACUTE AND CHRONIC BRUCELLOSIS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using miRNA microarray, more than 2000 miRNAs were screened in CD8 + T cells of patients with acute or chronic brucellosis and healthy controls that were sorted from peripheral blood with flow cytometry and validated through qRT-PCR.

DESIGN
Using miRNA microarray, more than 2000 miRNAs were screened in CD8 + T cells of patients with acute or chronic brucellosis and healthy controls that were sorted from peripheral blood with flow cytometry and validated through qRT-PCR.  Findings were evaluated using GeneSpring GX (Agilent) 13.0 software and KEGG pathway analysis.
