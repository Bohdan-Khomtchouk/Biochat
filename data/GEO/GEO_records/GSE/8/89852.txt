TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of liver tissue samples obtained from patients with hepatitis virus-related hepatocellular carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed in paired samples of non-cancerous liver tissue and the corresponding cancerous tissue obtained from patients with hepatitis virus-related hepatocellular carcinomas using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip.

DESIGN
37 paired genomic DNA was extracted form fresh-frozen tissue specimens obtained from partial hepatectomy materials of 37 patients, who had provided written informed consent and suffered from hepatitis virus-related hepatocellular carcinomas. Genomic DNA was subjected to bisulfite conversion followed by Infinium assay.
