TITLE
Expression data from control and drought treated wheat plants

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of transcriptome in two wheat genotypes with contrasting levels of draught tolerance. We used microarrays to investigate the global gene expression in response to drought stress.

DESIGN
Wheat leaf tissues were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
