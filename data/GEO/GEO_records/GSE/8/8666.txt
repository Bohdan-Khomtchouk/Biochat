SUMMARY
Understanding the genetic architecture of cancer pathways that distinguishes subsets of human cancer is critical to developing new therapies that better target tumors based upon their molecular expression profiles.   In this study, we identify an integrated gene signature from multiple transgenic models of epithelial cancers intrinsic to the functions of the Simean virus 40 T/t-antigens that is associated with the biologic behavior and prognosis for several human epithelial tumors.  This genetic signature, composed primarily of genes regulating cell replication, proliferation, DNA repair and apoptosis, is not a general cancer signature. Rather, it is uniquely activated primarily in tumors with aberrant p53, Rb or BRCA1 expression, but not in tumors initiated through the overexpression of myc, ras, her2/neu, or Polyoma middle T oncogenes.  Importantly, human breast, lung and prostate tumors expressing this set of genes represent subsets of tumors with the most aggressive phenotype and with poor prognosis.  The T/t-antigen signature is highly predictive of  human breast cancer prognosis.  Since this class of epithelial tumors is generally intractable to currently existing standard therapies, this genetic signature identifies potential targets for novel therapies directed against these lethal forms of cancer.  Since the these genetic targets have been discovered using mammary, prostate, and lung T/t-antigen mouse cancer models, these models are rationale candidates for use in pre-clinical testing of therapies focused on these biologically important targets.
