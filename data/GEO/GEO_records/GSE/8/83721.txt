TITLE
MicroRNA expression analysis of integrin-linked kinase gene silencing in A2780 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Available evidence has suggested that integrin-linked kinase (ILK) underwent over-expression in ovarian cancer while specific gene silencing of ILK resulted in apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells. Here, potential mechanisms in which ILK induces cell apoptosis was explored from the perspective of microRNA (miRNA) expression.

DESIGN
Alteration in global miRNA expression profile was detected by miRNA microarray technique after ILK shRNA expression lentivirus was transfected into A2780 cells (n = 3). Additionally, the A2780 cells infected by scrambled shRNA lentivirus were treated as negtive control (n = 3).
