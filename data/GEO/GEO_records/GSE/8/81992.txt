TITLE
AML associated oncofusion proteins PML-RARA, AML1-ETO and CBFB-MYH11 target RUNX/ETS-factor binding sites to modulate H3ac levels and drive leukemogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromosomal translocations are one of the hallmarks of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), often leading to gene fusions and expression of an oncofusion protein. Over recent years it has become clear that most of the AML associated oncofusion proteins molecularly adopt distinct mechanisms for inducing leukemogenesis. Still these unique molecular properties of the chimeric proteins converge and give rise to a common pathogenic molecular mechanism. In the present study we compared genome-wide DNA binding and transcriptome data associated with AML1-ETO, CBFB-MYH11 and PML-RARA oncofusion protein expression (GSE46044, GSE23730, GSE30254 and GSE18886) to identify unique and common features. Our analyses revealed targeting of oncofusion binding sites to RUNX1 and ETS-factor occupied genomic regions. In addition, it revealed highly similar expression of common target genes and specific enrichment of several biological pathways critical for maintenance of AML, suggesting oncofusion proteins deregulate common gene programs despite their distinct binding signatures and mechanisms of action.
