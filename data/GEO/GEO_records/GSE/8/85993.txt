TITLE
The effects of waterbourne phenanthrene exposure on teleost hypothalamic transcriptome

ORGANISM
Pimephales promelas

SUMMARY
In this study, female fathead minnows (FHM) were exposed to waterbourne phenanthrene (201.8 Âµg/L) or a solvent control for 7 weeks. Fish were tested for behavioral differences in a modified behavioral test prior to euthansia. Hypothalami were excised and stored for microarray analyses.

DESIGN
Fish were exposed to one dose of phenanthrene. Female and male hypothalami were analyzed (n=8 per group, control vs. treatment); liver was also analyzed. N=7 control and 8 phenanthrene. In this study, a subchronic exposure to phenanthrene was investigated
