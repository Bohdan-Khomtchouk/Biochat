TITLE
The development of Drosophila melanogaster during space flight

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In prospective human exploration of outer space, the need to maintain a species over several generations under changed gravity conditions may arise. This paper reports the analysis of the third generation of fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster obtained during the 44.5-day space flight (Foton-M4 satellite, 2014, Russia), followed by the fourth generation on Earth and the fifth generation under conditions of a 12-day space flight (2014, in the Russian Segment of the ISS). The obtained results show that it is possible to obtain the third-fifth generations of a complex multicellular Earth organism under changed gravity conditions (in the cycle “weightlessness – Earth – weightlessness”), which preserves fertility and normal development. However, there were a number of changes in the expression levels and content of cytoskeletal proteins that are the key components of the spindle apparatus and the contractile ring of cells.

DESIGN
Examination of drosophila genes expression change during space flight by RNA-Seq technique
