TITLE
Gene expression during metabolism of polysaccharides and sugars by Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius

ORGANISM
Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to characterize carbon metabolism and gene regulation in Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius during growth on wheat arabinoxylan and the effect of pentose and hexose sugars on gene expression Chemostat studies and global transcriptome analysis were used to accomplish this goal.

DESIGN
A three chip study using total RNA recovered from three sets of triplicate chemostat experiments using Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius ATCC27009/DSM446 growing using wheat arabinoxylan (WAX) and glucose or xylose.  Each chip measures the expression level of 3,554 genes from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius ATCC27009/DSM446 with seven 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
