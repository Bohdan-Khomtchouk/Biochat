TITLE
Effect of Metformin and AICAR treatments in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP treated with Metformin or AICAR compared to control non-stimulated LNCaP.

DESIGN
Total RNA of human prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) were treated with Metformin (5mM) during 24h or AICAR (5mM) during 24h and compared to control untreated cells. Two independent cell culture experiments for each treatment condition were performed for microarray analysis (marked rep1 or rep2). Each experiment was repeated with a switch in fluorescent Cy3/Cy5 labels to account for dye effects to produce four data points per hybridization spot. Total of 12 samples.
