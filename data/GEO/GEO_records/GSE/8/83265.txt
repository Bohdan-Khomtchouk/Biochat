TITLE
RNA-seq data for bone-marrow-derived macrophages from wildtype and JNK1 knockout mice stimulated with yeast form Candida albicans

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA expression profile for BMDMs from wildtype and JNK1 knockout mice stimulated with yeast form Candida albicans

DESIGN
BMDMs from wildtype and JNK1 knockout mice were left untreated or stimulated with yeast form Candida albicans for 24 hour, mRNA of the cells were isolated with TRIZOL and subject to RNA-seq
