TITLE
Expression analysis of cerebellar granular cell layer isolated from PTEN conditional null mutants and controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A neuronal PI(3,4,5)P3-dependent program of oligodendrocyte precursor recruitment and myelination was identified in mice that conditionally lack PTEN in cerebellar granular cells (PTEN cKO) Expression analysis was performed with RNA obtained selectively from cerebellar granular cell layer of PTEN conditional null mutants and controls

DESIGN
The cerebellar granule cell layer was microdissected from brain sections to isolate total RNA which was amplified and used for expression analysis using micrarrays
