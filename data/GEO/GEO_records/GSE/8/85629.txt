TITLE
miR-199a regulates human mammary epthelial cell function

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-199a expression was enforced in HMLE cells using lentiviral vector pLEX. The transcriptome profiles changes following miR-199a expression was studied.

DESIGN
simple pair design: empty vector control vs. miR199a OE
