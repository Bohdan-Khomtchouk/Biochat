TITLE
Map transformed DNA into W6G from VCXB21

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
Vibrio cholerae isolate W6G transformed with DNA from VCXB21 and selected for chitosan metabolism.  Nine independent transformants compared to parental W6G on microarrays containing probes for all N16961 ORFs.  Regions acquired from VCXB21 hybridize more strongly to the array. A genotyping experiment design type classifies an individual or group of individuals on the basis of alleles, haplotypes, SNP's. Keywords: genotyping_design
