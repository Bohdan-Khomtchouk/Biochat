TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of murine splenic chemokines and cytokines [chemokines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C57BL/6 mice were subjected to sham surgery or orthotopic Hepa1-6 hepatic tumor inoculation. Spleen tissues from mice subjected to sham surgery (control mice), mice bearing a 2-week orthotopic hepatoma, and mice bearing a 4-week othotopic hepatoma were collected. Total RNA was extracted from the spleen tissues,and we used the RTÂ² Profiler PCR array-mouse chemokines & receptors (SABioscience) array panel to quantitate gene expression of chemokine and receptor genes from the spleens.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. Spleen tissues from 5 mice per group were used as indicated in the summary.
