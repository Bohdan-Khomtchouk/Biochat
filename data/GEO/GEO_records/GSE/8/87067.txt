TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and dek2 mutant Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Zea mays subsp. mays

SUMMARY
Analysis of  gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that dek2 mutant influence the expression of mitochondrial function associated genes. Results provide important information of the gene expression level regulation of mitochondrial part and oxidative phosphorylation.

DESIGN
Endosperm mRNA profiles of 15DAP wild type (WT) and dek2 mutant were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2500 (Zea mays).
