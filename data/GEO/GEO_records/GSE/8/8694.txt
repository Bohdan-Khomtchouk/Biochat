TITLE
Comparative gene expression profile analysis between native human odontoblasts and pulp tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knowledge of differential gene expression between pulp and odontoblasts might give insight to the regulation of these spatially related but functionally diverse cells. Our aim was large-scale analysis of expression profiles of native human pulp tissue and odontoblasts, and search for genes expressed only in odontoblasts. Keywords: comparative expression analysis
