TITLE
Expression profiling on lactation day 2 mammary epithelial cells from constitutive miR-150 expressing mice compared to controls.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Constitutive expression of miR-150 in mammary epithelium causes severe lactation defects. Mammary epithelial cells (MECs) at lactation day 2 were isolated from four homozygous ROSA26-lox-STOP-lox-miR-150 (Stop-150) mice with WAP-driven Cre (WAP-Cre) and compared to MECs from four WAP-Cre control mice. Statistical analysis of the mRNA changes between the two genotypes identified supression of many lipid and cholesterol synthesis genes due to constitutive expression of miR-150.

DESIGN
4 replicates from each genotype (Stop-150fl/fl; WAP-Cre+ versus Stop-150-; WAP-Cre+) were hybridized onto Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Mouse Transcriptome Array 1.0 ( probesets)
