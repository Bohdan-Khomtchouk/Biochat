TITLE
miR-130b drives activation of a metastatic CDC42-PAK1-AP1 positive feedback loop in Ewing sarcoma by directly targeting Arhgap1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of miR-130b regulated genes in TC71 Ewing Sarcoma cells. The hypothesis tested being that overexpression of miR-130b increases metastasis in Ewing Sarcoma.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from Tc71 cells expressing a scramble control of miR-130b mimic after 48hrs.
