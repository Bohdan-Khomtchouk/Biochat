TITLE
CD19 CAR immune pressure on B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia induces myeloid lineage switch exposing inherent leukemic plasticity (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study establishs lineage switch as a mechanism of CAR resistance exposing inherent plasticity in genetic subtypes of pre-B cell ALL

DESIGN
Examination of genome wide H3K27ac peaks associate with CAR T cell resistance
