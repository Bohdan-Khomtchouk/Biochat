TITLE
Transcriptional profile of pancreatic and splenic Treg cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we analyzed the transcriptional profile of pancreatic and splenic Treg cells from prediabetic NOD mice.

DESIGN
Treg cells were double-sorted from the pancreata and spleens of 10-week-old prediabetic female NOD.Foxp3-ires-gfp mice directly into TRIzol. RNA was prepared in Trizol for gene expression profiling by  Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
