TITLE
Plasma Cell Niche

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Sorted cells from bone marrow and rectal mucosa of SIV-infected rhesus macaques were analyzed for expression of factors associated with plasma cell recruitment, adhesion, or maintenance mRNA expression anaylsis was performed on 16 CD2-CD19-CD20-HLA-DR+ and 16 CD2-CD19-CD20-HLA-DR- bone marrow cells, and 7  CD2-CD19-CD20-HLA-DR+ and 3 CD2-CD19-CD20-HLA-DR- rectal cells using a custom CodeSet produced by NanoString Technologies containing 44 niche factor genes of interst, 12 cell-type specific genes, and  9 reference genes identified in Genevestigator.

DESIGN
Rhesus macaque CD2-CD19-CD20- cells from 20 bone marrow and 20 rectal tissue samples were sorted into HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR- populations representing antigen-presenting cells, and polymorphonuclear cells, respectively. Isolated mRNA was subject to expression analysis using a 65-gene custom CodeSet manufactured by NanoString Technologies and analyzed on their nCounter Analysis System.
