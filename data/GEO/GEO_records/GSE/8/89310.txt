TITLE
A Homeostatic Shift Facilitates Endoplasmic Reticulum Proteostasis through Transcriptional Integration of Proteostatic Stress Response Pathways [expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Eukaryotic cells maintain protein homeostasis through the activity of multiple basal and inducible systems, which function in concert to allow cells to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions. Although the transcriptional programs regulating individual pathways have been studied in detail, it is not known how the different pathways are transcriptionally integrated such that a deficiency in one pathway can be compensated by a change in an auxiliary response. One such pathway that plays an essential role in many proteostasis responses is the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which functions to degrade damaged, unfolded, or short half-life proteins. Transcriptional regulation of the proteasome is mediated by the transcription factor Nrf1. Using a conditional knockout mouse model, we found that Nrf1 regulates protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through transcriptional regulation of the ER stress sensor ATF6. In Nrf1 conditional-knockout mice, a reduction in proteasome activity is accompanied by an ATF6-dependent downregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation machinery, which reduces the substrate burden on the proteasome. This indicates that Nrf1 regulates a homeostatic shift through which proteostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm are coregulated based on a cell's ability to degrade proteins.

DESIGN
Gene expression in the liver obtained from Nrf1 CKO and control mice. Nrf1flox/flox::CYP1A1-Cre mice subcutaneously injected with 40 mg/kg body weight of 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) were used as Nrf1 CKO mice, while Nrf1flox/flox mice similarly treated with 3MC were used as control mice. Livers were obtained 2 weeks after the 3MC injection.
