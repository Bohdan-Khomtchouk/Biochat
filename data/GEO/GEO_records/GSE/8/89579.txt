TITLE
Apoptosis-related gene expression profiling in hematopoietic cell fractions of MDS patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Quantification of apoptosis-related genes in bone marrow HSPCs from MDS patients compared to healthy donor by microfluidic cards

DESIGN
Bone marrow from MDS patients and healthy controls was collected. The expression of 380 different apoptosis-related genes was measured simultaneously by real-time PCR employing a 384 Microfluidic Card (Applied Biosystems). cDNA obtained from the CD34+, CD71+ and CD13/33+ cell fractions was analyzed. The relative expression of the apoptosis-related genes was calculated by measuring the housekeeping gene GAPDH.
