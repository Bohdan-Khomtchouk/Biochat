TITLE
Expression data from human osteosarcoma bone primaries or lung metastases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The high concentration of Well5 cells was resuspended into 20μl PBS, the needle along the tibia direction, before reaching in a breakthrough sense, direct injection cells. At 7 days after injection, proximal tibia was able to reach mass production. At 20 days after injection, the proximal tibia mass increased.If prolonging exposure by BLI,this stage displayedthat tumor cell signalsbegan to lung metastasis. Osteosarcoma orthotopic lung metastasis model was successfully constructed. Total RNA was extracted from sorted osteosarcoma cells of the primary site and lung metastases using Trizol (Invitrogen). We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during osteosarcoma lung metastasis. In support of the notion that fibrosis marks the lung metastasis, the expression of numerous fibrosis-related genes such as FN1, COLs, and MMPs were upregulated from the primary site to lung metastasis in Well5-luc orthotopic inoculation model.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from sorted osteosarcoma cells using Trizol (Invitrogen). Gene expression profiling was conducted by Shanghai Biotechnology Corporation using Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). All data were analyzed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Raw data generated from Affymetrix CEL files were normalized by RMA background correction; values were log2 transformed. For the enrichment of P values of each GO term, we used Fisher’s exact test to calculate P values and R package stats to calculate FDR (q value) by BH method (www.r-project.org).
