TITLE
RISC factor MOV10 is required for normal development and viability in both mouse and Xenopus

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
MOV10 is an RNA helicase that functions in the miRNA pathway. Our study shows that a knockdown of MOV10 in mouse is embryonic lethal. To determine the cause of this developmental phenotype, we knocked down maternal MOV10 in Xenopus eggs at the one cell stage. We observe a defective Maternal to Zygotic Transition (MZT) phenotype in the MOV10 knockouts that leads to abnormal neural tube formation. We are carrying out this RNA seq in order to ascertain the mRNA changes caused on maternal MOV10 knockdown

DESIGN
The analysis includes 5 samples. Three of these are control morpholino injected stage 10.5 embryos. The remaining 2 are MOV10 morpholino treated embryos from the same stage. The samples are biological replicates.
