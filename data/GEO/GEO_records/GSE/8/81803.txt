TITLE
RNA-sequencing in WT and Fmr1-/- (KO) neurons treated with Jq1 and THZ

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Widespread epigenetic disruptions in FXS mice leads to transcriptional changes that likely contribute to the neuronal phenotpyes underlying FXS.

DESIGN
7DIV cultured cortical neurons from WT or Fmr1 KO mice were treated for 24 hours with vehicle, Jq1, or THZ, performed in triplicate.
