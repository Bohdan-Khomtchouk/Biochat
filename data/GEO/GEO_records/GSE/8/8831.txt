TITLE
Adipose Tissue Expression Profiles of Mice that Vary in Adiposity and Insulin Sensitivity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adipose tissue gene expression was profiled from perigonadal adipose tissue of mice whose body mass and insulin sensitivity varied as a function of diet, gender, monogenic mutations and insulin sensitizing therapies.  Mice were 22-24 weeks of age and sacrificed between 2-3 hours into the light portion of a 12/12 dark-light cycle.  The goal was to identify transcripts whose adipose tissue expression is correlated with adiposity, insulin sensitivity and other measures of metabolic function. Keywords: population
