TITLE
Candidate Gene Identification Through RNA-Seq Analysis of (TRAMP x J:DO) F1 Primary Tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis of 195 randomly selected (TRAMP x J:DO) F1 prostates that had been harvested at experimental termination (210 days or humane endpoints) was performed to identify metastasis associated transcriptomic changes

DESIGN
Total RNA expression profile of TRAMP x DO F1 prostate tumors
