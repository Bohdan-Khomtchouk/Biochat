TITLE
miR expression differences in Chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients after ibrutinib therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRs were discovered to be significantly differentially regulated after ibrutinib therapy Peripheral blood CLL cell samples at pre-treatment, after 2hrs, 24hrs, 8 days, 29 days after threapy were collected and RNA was collected and used for miR nanostring analysis.

DESIGN
Samples from 8 patients at each time point were pooled into 2 groups (4 patients per group) to discover miR expression differences.
