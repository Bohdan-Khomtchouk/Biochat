TITLE
DNA methylation data from human parthenogenetic haploid ESCs (hPGES), normal human ESCs(H9) and human forskin fibroblast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we report the derivation of human parthenogenetic haploid ESCs which contain only one set of chromosome. These two cell lines, which we designated hPGES1 and hPGES2, show conventional ESCs and parthenogenetic-derived DNA methylation state.

DESIGN
we use normal human ESCs and human fibroblast as control and analyse the DNA methylation status of hPGES. DNA methylation profile of these cell lines were performed on Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadArray
