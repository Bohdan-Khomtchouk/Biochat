TITLE
TonEBP/NFAT5 regulates inflammatory gene expression in nucleus pulposus cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing of nucleus pulposus cells transduced with control or TonEBP shRNA and cultured under hypertonic conditions

DESIGN
Total mRNA was collected from primary nucleus pulposus cells (both control and TonEBP knockdown cells and subjected to RNA sequencing, n=4 for both experimental groups
