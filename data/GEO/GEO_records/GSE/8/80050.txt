TITLE
Transcriptome-wide RNA 5-methylcytosine methylation in siliques of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Here we use bisulfite conversion of rRNA depleted RNA combined with high-throughput Illumina sequencing (RBS-seq) to identify single-nucleotide resolution of m5C sites transcriptome-wide in Arabidopsis thaliana siliques. m5C sites were also analyzed in an Arabidopsis T-DNA knockout for the RNA methyltransferase TRM4B.

DESIGN
RNA bisulfite sequencing was used to identify candidate m5C sites transcriptome-wide in Arabidopsis thaliana siliques, using rRNA depleted RNA. Illumina sequencing was performed on a HiSeq platform. The two genotypes used are wild type and trm4b-1. For wild type (WT) there are two biological replicates. The first biological replicate for wild type siliques has only one technical replicate, while there are two technical replicates for the second wild type biological replicate. There are three biological replicates for trm4b-1
