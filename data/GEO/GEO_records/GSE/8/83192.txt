TITLE
Liver tissue from liver specific Vps33b knockout (Vps33bfl/fl-AlfpCre) and control (Vps33bfl/fl) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver tissue from Vps33b liver ko (Vps33bfl/fl-AlfpCre) mice is a model of liver disease associated with ARC syndrome, an autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disorder cause by mutations in VPS33B or VIPAS39. ARC is a multisystem disorder, with liver and kidneys affected in particular. Defects in hepatocyte polarity have been identified. Affymetrix arrays were used to characterise the changes in the liver transcriptome when Vps33b is not expressed.

DESIGN
Mouse liver tissue, 10 samples in total, 4 from control mice, 6 from ko mice.
