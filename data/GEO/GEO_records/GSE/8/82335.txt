TITLE
Diesel exhaust particle (DEP)-treated HBE cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We evaluated the profile of lncRNA and mRNA expression in control and 50Î¼g/ml DEP treated HBE cells using the  Arraystar Human LncRNA Array v3.0 array,7th generation.  Our findings implicates that dysregulation of mitochondria invovled mRNAs may play important role in cytotoxicity of DEP.

DESIGN
Examination of lncRNA and mRNA expression in control or DEP-treated HBE cells
