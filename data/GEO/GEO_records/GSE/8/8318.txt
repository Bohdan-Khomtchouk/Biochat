TITLE
Expression from control subplate neurons with few synapses and cocultured subplate neurons with induced synaptogenesis

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The transcriptional events accompanying synaptogenesis are largely unknown, or have been studied in systems in which synapse formation occurs gradually over time.  With a system in which synaptogenesis is synchronized and controllable, molecular or biochemical techniques can be used to examine cellular events across cultures on a wide scale, as synapses develop. Here, we have triggered synaptogenesis in immunopurified subplate neurons by coculturing with cortical feeder layers and have used microarrays to investigate the transcriptional events occuring in this more defined and controllable system. Keywords: treatment type comparison, time course
