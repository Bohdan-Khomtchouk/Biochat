TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of patient-derived xenograft models of HER2+ breast cancer brain metastases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insights into tumor heterogeneity in anti-cancer drug responses of patient-derived xenograft models of HER2+ breast cancer brain metastases, we performed transcriptome gene expression profiling by Ion AmpliSeqâ„¢ Transcriptome sequencing that targets more than 20,000 human genes. Our data found that all anti-cancer drugs responders have significantly higher expression levels of AKT-mTOR-dependent signature genes as compared to the non-responders, suggesting that most HER2+ breast cancer brain metastases are depend on the AKT-mTOR pathway

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of five PDX samples were generated by Ion AmpliSeq Transcriptome sequencing, in duplcate, using Ion torrent Proton machine.
