TITLE
NF-kB target genes in dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ability of dendritic cells (DC) to initiate immunity and induce antigen-specific tolerance makes DC ideal targets for pharmacological intervention into immune responses. NF-kB factors are a family of transcriptional regulators important for DC development and function. However, the identity of NF-kB target genes that are central to DC biology is largely unknown. In the present study IkBa super repressor (IkBa-SR) and DNA microarray analysis were used to determine the repertoire of NF-kB responsive genes in DC. In DC these genes regulate vital DC functions of antigen uptake and presentation, motility, survival, etc. Taking in account limitations of the genome-wide microarray analysis, generated transcription factor data were confirmed by the independent means of RT-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Kinetics of NF-kB induction by well-known DC activatory agents TNFa and LPS were further analysed. NF-kB regulated genes can be potentially useful targets for the development of more specific anti-inflammatory agents for clinical applications. Keywords: drug treatment, adenovirus transduction
