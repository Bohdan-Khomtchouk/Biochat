TITLE
UPF1 knockdown in differentiating human myoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human myoblast cell line 54-1 is transfected with either a srambled control siRNA or siRNA against UPF1. Two days after transfection, cell were induced to differentiate by changing grow meida to differentiation media. 2 days after induction of differentiation, cells are collected for extraction of RNA.
