TITLE
Expression data from  Congenital disorders of Glycosylation type-1 patients (CDG-I)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Disruption of N-linked glycosylation has a broad impact on proper glycosylation of nascent glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, which affect multiple signalling pathways( by changing the stability of membrane proteins or the signalling ability of membrane receptors) and may be responsible of the fibrotic stage associated to CDG type-I. We used microarrays to characterize the global changes in  gene expression in three distinct groups of CDG-I patients and we identified a common perturbation in the expression of genes encoding for proteins involved in the stress as well as in the fibrotic responses. Keywords: disease state analysis
