TITLE
Genome-wide Identification of Neuronal Activity-regulated Genes in Drosophila [Elav_TrpA1]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We identified ARGs in a genome-wide manner, in fly brains as well as in sorted neurons; they included dopaminergic neurons (DA) and a subset of circadian-related neurons (PDF+ neurons).

DESIGN
Elav-GAL4;UAS-TrpA1 or Elav-GAL4 flies stimulated with temperature shift and mRNA isolated and sequenced 0, 15, 30, 60 min after.
