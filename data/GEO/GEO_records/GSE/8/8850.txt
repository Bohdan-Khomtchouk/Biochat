TITLE
The Role of CcpA in Gene Regulation in Streptococcus mutans

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans

SUMMARY
CcpA is a global regulator of transcription in Gram-positive bacteria that controls gene expression in response to carbohydrate availability.  Using the fructan hydrolase (fruA) gene of S. mutans as a model, we demonstrate that CcpA does indeed play a major role in carbohydrate catabolite repression.  Using DNA microarrays, the expression of at least 170 genes differed in CcpA-deficient cells compared to the parental strains when cells are grown in the presence of glucose, but only 90 genes showed altered expression when cells were cultivated in the poorly-repressing substrate galactose.  Interestingly, 90 genes were differently expressed in wild-type S. mutans in response to cultivation in glucose versus galactose, but the expression of over 500 genes was altered when growth in glucose and galactose were compared in the CcpA-deficient strain.  The results support a major role for CcpA in regulation of gene expression, but reveal that a substantial CcpA-independent network exists in S. mutans to regulate gene expression in response to carbohydrate source.
