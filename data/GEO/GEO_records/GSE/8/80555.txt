TITLE
Downregulation of miR-19a as a Biomarker for Early Detection of Silicosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the early diagnostic value for silicosis we have employed the Human microRNA OneArrayÂ® v5 as a discovery platform to identify microRNAs as biomarkers of silicosis use.To be followed,a microRNA-gene network in silicosis wasestablished by the differential expression profiles so that candidate markers of silicosis could be spotted and validated. Then, the relative expression levels of potential biomarkers were measured by Quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR) and the sensitivity and specificity were assessed by ROC curves.

DESIGN
The gene expressions of 3 silicosis and 3 controls were measured.
