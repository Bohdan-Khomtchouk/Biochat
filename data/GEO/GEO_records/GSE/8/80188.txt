TITLE
Analysis of gene expression patterns of Arabidopsis roots grown in methyl jasmonate (MeJA), cytokinin (CK), MeJA/CK- treated conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Purpose: Understanding of MeJA, CK effect on regulation of gene expression patterns in Arabidopsis roots

DESIGN
Total mRNA was extracted from 7-day-old Arabidopsis roots grown in MeJA (10uM), CK (50nM) and MeJA/CK-treated conditions. To generate cDNA libraries with TruSeq RNA library kit, 1 μg of total RNA was used. This step consisted of polyA-selected RNA extraction, RNA fragmentation, random hexamer primed reverse transcription and 100 nt paired-end sequencing by Illumina HiSeq2000. 4,403 genes satisfying |fold change|≥2 in at least one data set were collected.
