TITLE
Human liver RNA-seq data corresponding to uninfected non-malignant, HCV infected non-malignant, and HCV+ HCC tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify epigenetic regulators of transcription that may be involved in the development and the progression of HCV-associated HCC.  We used directional RNAseq for transcriptome profiling that we correlate with genome wide DNA methylation data.

DESIGN
RNAseq for liver biopsies of 10 uninfected, 9 non-neoplastic infected and 8 HCV infected HCC samples.
