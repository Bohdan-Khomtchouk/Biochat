TITLE
RNA-Seq of STAR-PROM Barcodes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of a massively parallel STAR-PROM assay based on the RNA-seq of 3000+ luciferase barcodes

DESIGN
U2OS cells are transfected with luciferase library, treated with different drugs, and RNA is collected at different time points. Barcodes are amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced.
