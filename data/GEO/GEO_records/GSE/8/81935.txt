TITLE
Gene Expression profiling in IGHV Unmutated vs mutated CLL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study, the gene expression profiling was carried out in 21 early stage CLL patients. A gene expression signature was generated for CLL patients as compared to normal controls; CLL patients were further seggregated into IGHV unmutated (n=10) and  IGHV mutated (n=11) subgroups. The expression pattern was confirmed using real time quantitative PCR and the results were correlated with clinical outcome.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was carried out in 21 CLL samples and pooled samples (n=2) from 10 healthy subjects. The CLL cases were further divided into unmutated (n=11) and mutated subgroup (n=10) on the basis of IGHV mutation status.
