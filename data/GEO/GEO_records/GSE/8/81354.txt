TITLE
Study of microRNA associated with telmisartanâ€™s anti-tumor effect in esophageal adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The miRNAs expression was markedly altered with the treatment of telmisartan in vivo and various miRNAs induced by telmisartan also may contribute to tumor growth in vivo.

DESIGN
Using a custom microarray platform, we analyzed the expression levels of 2555 human miRNA probes in the tumorous tissues in vivo that was treated with and without telmisartan.
