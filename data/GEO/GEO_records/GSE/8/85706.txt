TITLE
GPR41 modulates insulin secretion and gene expression in pancreatic beta-cells and modifies metabolic homeostasis in fed and fasting

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Insulin secretion by pancreatic b-cells is primarily regulated by glucose; however, hormones and additional nutrients, such as long-chain fatty acids, also play an important role in adjusting insulin output to physiologic needs. We examined the role of the short chain fatty acid receptor, GPR41, in funcion of pancreatic beta cells. GPR41 was specifically over-expressed in beta cells by using rat insulin promoter II (41 Tg).

DESIGN
To further understand GPR41 dependent metabolic phenotype we obsereved in-vivo, we examined mouse islets from 41 Tg and wt littermates. Total RNA was isolated, reverse-transcribed, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array.
