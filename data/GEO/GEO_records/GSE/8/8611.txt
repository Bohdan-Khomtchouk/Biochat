TITLE
Renal progenitor cell gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multipotent progenitor cells (MPs) have been observed in human kidneys and particularly in Bowman's capsule and proximal tubules. The kidney owns the ability to repair local damage and renal MPs may play a role in the regenerative processes. Microarray technology was applied to identify differentially expressed genes among resident MPs isolated from glomeruli and tubules of normal renal tissue, renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The results of our analysis represent a starting point for further functional studies. Keywords: cell type comparison
