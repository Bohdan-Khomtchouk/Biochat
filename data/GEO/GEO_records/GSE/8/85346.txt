TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis in Different Macrophage Phenotypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Macrophage activation is the main immunological process occurring during the development of several diseases, and the heterogeneity of macrophage activation or differentiation has been suggested to be involved in disease progression. In the present study, we attempted to identify molecules specifically expressed on human classically activated macrophages (M1) to investigate the significance of the M1-like phenotype in human diseases. Human monocyte-derived macrophages were differentiated into M1, M2a, M2b, and M2c phenotypes, and gene expression profiles were analyzed by cDNA microarray analysis and were used for bioinformatics examination. The gene expression profiles of murine macrophages were additionally evaluated. We identified guanylate-binding protein 5 (GBP5), which is associated with leucine-rich repeat protein 3-mediated inflammasome assembly in the M1 macrophages of both humans and mice. Notably, GBP5 protein expression was detected in cultured M1 macrophages by Western blot analysis. GBP5 is a useful candidate marker of the M1 phenotype.

DESIGN
CD14+ monocytes from human PBMC were cultured with GM-CSF(10 ng mL−1) or M-CSF (50 ng mL−1) for seven days to differentiate into macrophages.To induce macrophage subtypes [M1, M1(-), M2a, M2b, and M2c], the macrophages were further stimulated for 24 h with LPS (10 ng mL−1) + IFN-γ (50 ng mL−1), IFN-γ (50 ng mL−1), IL-4 (10 ng mL−1), IL-1β (10 ng mL−1), and IL-10 (10 ng mL−1). Control macrophages (M0) were prepared by incubating for 24 h without additional factors.Two independent experiments were performed using different donors.
