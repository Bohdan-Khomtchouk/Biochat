TITLE
miR-34a negatively regulates alveolarization in a BPD animal model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Newborn mice were concomitantly treated with antagomiR-scrambled (SCR) or antagomiR-34a (A34a) and exposed either to normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (85% O2). Lungs were harvested at two different time-points, P5.5 and P14.5, in order to compare the differential mRNA expression between the 4 groups. Unfortunately, few changes in mRNA expression were detected.

DESIGN
Mouse pups were randomized and litter size was balanced on the same day of birth. For each time-point, 4 groups were designed: normoxia-SCR, normoxia-A34a, hyperoxia-SCR and hyperoxia-A34a. Comparisons were performed between the 4 groups of the same time-point for each time-point. Total number of samples: 32.
