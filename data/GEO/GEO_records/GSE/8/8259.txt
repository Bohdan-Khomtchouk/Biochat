TITLE
The effect of RPN9 silencing in N. benthamiana

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
N. benthamiana plants were grown under 16 hour light/8 hour dark cycle in a plant growth room at 24Â°C for approximately six weeks before subjected to virus-induced gene silencing. Agrobacterium stain GV2260 (OD600=1.0) carrying silencing constructs were infiltrated into 2 fully expended leaves for inducing gene silencing.  Samples were collected at 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 days post Agro-inoculation (DPI) for RPN9-silenced plants and N-silenced control. For RPN8-silencing, samples were collected at 8, 10, and 12 DPI, and the empty vector treated plants were used as a control. Each sample was a pool of 6 silenced leaves collected from 3 individual plants. All the samples were in biological triplicates from 3 sets of independently silenced plants. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol and DNA was removed with DNase I treatment before cDNA synthesis. Keywords: Reference design
