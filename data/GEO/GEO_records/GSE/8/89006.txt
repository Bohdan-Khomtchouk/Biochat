TITLE
Expression profiles of lncRNAs in bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore non-coding and coding expression profiling and their biological functions in bladder cancer, we surveyed the lncRNA and mRNA expression signature of bladder cancer and para-cancer tissues using microarray for four patients. Thousands of significantly changed lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified. Our findings provide a novel perspective on transcriptional group and lay the foundation for future research of potential roles of lncRNAs in bladder carcinoma.

DESIGN
Total RNA from four pairs of human bladder carcinomas and matched para-carcinomas were used for microarray analysis.
