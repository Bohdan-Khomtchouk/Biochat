TITLE
Characterization of active piRNAs and piRNA machinery in WRR-1 cells deficient for the Hippo pathway (deficient for the warts tumor suppressor) and expressing activated RasV12 (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We have found that oncogenic Ras combined with loss of the Hippo tumour-suppressor pathway reactivates a primary piRNA pathway in Drosophila somatic cells, coincident with oncogenic transformation. In these cells, Piwi becomes loaded with piRNAs derived from generative loci, which are normally restricted to either the germline or the somatic follicle cells. Negating the pathway leads to increases in the expression of a wide variety of transposons and also to altered expression of some protein coding genes.  This correlates with a reduction in the proliferation of the transformed cells in culture, suggesting that at least in this context, the piRNA pathway may play a functional role in cancer.

DESIGN
Small RNAs cloned from whole cells, Piwi-bound small RNAs and long RNA-Seq were performed in wts-RNAi;RasV12 cells to identify piRNAs and gene expression changes compared to RasV12 cells, somatic OSS cells, and germline UAS-wts-RNAi;UAS-RasV12 control ovaries. After knock-down of components of the piRNA machinery in WRR-1 cells ([piwi, zuchini, armitage, aubergine, argonaute3) and GFP and/or dsRED control knock-downs, small RNAs were cloned and gene expression  (RNA-Seq) profiles were established.
