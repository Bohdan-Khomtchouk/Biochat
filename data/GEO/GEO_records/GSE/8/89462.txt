TITLE
Transcriptomal analysis of mouse healthy skin sample and of DMBA/TPA-induced skin Tumor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this analysis we plan to identify the genes that are differentially expressed  during the development of skin carcinoma (SCC) subsquent to the chronic and topical application of  a carcinogene agent (DMBA) and a tumor promoter (TPA)

DESIGN
Female FVB/N mice were topically treated with DMBA, then twice weekly for 6 weeks with (PMA). A second dose of DMBA was administered on the eighth week followed by the resumption of PMA treatment for 14 more weeks. Mice were monitored weekly for papillomas and tumors. Healthy skins (acetone treated), and tumors were harvested throughout the protocol, and biopsies were frozen for RNA extraction
