TITLE
A. thaliana root and flower-bud transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Using A. thaliana microarray platform the root and flower bud specific gene expression was characterized.

DESIGN
Roots and flower-buds from 6 weeks old A. thaliana plants grown hydroponically on a raft were harvested and used as biological tissues for total RNA extraction. Tissues harvested from 8-10 plants were pooled together and were defined as a biological replicate.
