TITLE
Benomyl toxicity links histone H3 lysine 4 methylation to cell cycle control

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The PAT-seq approach was utilised to determine the gene expression changes over the cell-cycle of wildtype and delta-set1 yeast strains. The cell were synchronised by alpha-factor arrest and cell-cycle release

DESIGN
Analysis gene expresson across the S. cerevisiae cell cycle.
