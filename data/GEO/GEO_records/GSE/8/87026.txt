TITLE
Gene expression data from lung tumor biopsie

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the differences in the genetic expression of adenocarcinoma subtypes according to the new WHO 2015 classification.

DESIGN
Microarray gene expression analysis was performed on a cohort of 29 NSCLC patients treated at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerolog√≠a of Mexico from 2008 to 2011. All patients had an available biopsy sample and were classified into four different subtypes of adenocarcinoma (2015 WHO classification).
