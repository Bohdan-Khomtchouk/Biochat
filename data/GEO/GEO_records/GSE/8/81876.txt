TITLE
CPEB4 prevents hepatic steatosis [RIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding (CPEB)-family of RNA-binding proteins regulates pre-mRNA processing and translation of CPE-containing mRNAs in early embryonic development and synaptic activity. However, the specific functions of each CPEB in the adult organism are poorly understood. Here we show that CPEB4 is required to suppress high fat diet- and aging-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and its subsequent hepatic steatosis. Stress-activated expression of CPEB4 in the liver is controlled through a double layer of regulation. First, Cpeb4 is transcriptionally regulated by the circadian clock and then, its mRNA translation is regulated by the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) through the upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs) present in its 5’ UTR. Thus, CPEB4 is synthesized only upon ER-stress but the amplitude of the induction is circadian. In turn, CPEB4 activates a second wave of UPR-translation required to maintain ER and mitochondrial homeostasis. Our results suggest that combined transcriptional and translational regulation of CPEB4 generates a “circadian mediator”, which coordinates the hepatic UPR activity with periods of high ER protein-folding demand preventing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

DESIGN
RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing of CPEB4-associated mRNAs in WT and CPEB4-KO primary hepatocytes.
