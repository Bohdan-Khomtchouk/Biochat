TITLE
Role of Gq/11 and G12/13 signalling in Type II alveolar epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have used microarrays to identify individual genes and pathways regulated by  Gq/11 or G12/13 signalling in type II alveolar epithelial cells isolated from the lungs of knockout mice.

DESIGN
Type II alveolar epithelial cells were isolated from the lungs of mice either singly deficient in Gna11 or Gna12 or double deficient in Gnaq/Gna11 or Gna12/Gna13 genes. Cells were cultured for 7 days and RNA processed from the untreated epithelial cells to compare gene expression patterns in cells from single and double knockout animals.
