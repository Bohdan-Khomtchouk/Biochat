TITLE
RNA-seq of RNase R treated and ribo- RNAs from leg muscle of Xinghua Chickens

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We have used RNA-seq to examine circular RNAs from RNase R treated and ribo- RNAs in  chicken leg muscle of three different development stages (11 embryo age, 16 embryo age, and 1 days post hatch). Our study reveals the prevalence of circRNAs in chicken, and has identified circRNAs differentially abundant in different stage of embryonic skeletal muscle, suggesting its important functions during poultry muscle development.

DESIGN
To assess circRNA expression during chicken skeletal muscle development, we sequenced and analyzed leg musle at 11 embryo age, 16 embryo age, and 1 days post hatch.
