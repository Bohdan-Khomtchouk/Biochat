TITLE
Effect of dopamine covered iron oxide core - titanium dioxide shell nanoparticles on HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of HeLa cell samples treated with nanoparticles for 2 or 4 hours, with matching non-treated samples as controls - exact cell culture growing conditions were replicated, same cell numbers plated in matching pairs of flasks Dopamine covered Fe3O4@TiO2 nanoparticles were added to cells grown for 16h and incubated fror 2 or 4 hours

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from cells after different treatments; four independent experiments were done (labeled as A,B,C and D), three sample sets were run on one array once, one sample was run once each on two arrays
