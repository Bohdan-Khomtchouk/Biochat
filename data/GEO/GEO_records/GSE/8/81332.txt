TITLE
Ribosome profiling in Arabidopsis root and shoot

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to map genome-wide ribosome occupancy on mRNAs in Arabidopsis root and shoot to characterize translatome.

DESIGN
RNAseq and ribo-seq generated from three biological replicates of root and shoot harvested from 4-day old wild-type plant (Col); 12 libraries in total.
