TITLE
Sex hormone responsive genes in rat choroid plexus

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In order to gain additional insight into the functional role of sex steroid hormones in the choroid plexus, the present study compared gene expression patterns between sham and gonadectomized female/male rats choroid plexus.

DESIGN
For microarray analysis choroid plexus were collected from sham (control) and gonadectomized female and male rats. Equal amounts of RNA extract from the 3 pools of sham (control) or 3 pools of gonadectomized animals were used.
