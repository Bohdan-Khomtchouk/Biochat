TITLE
Bulk RNA-sequencing of murine atrioventricular nodes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tissue-resident macrophages abound in the distal atrioventricular (AV) node of the heart, electrically couple to conducting cardiomyocytes via Connexin (Cx) 43-containing gap junctions and are implicated in normal and aberrant cardiac conduction. Moreover, conditional deletion of Cx43 in macrophages (tamoxifen-inducible Cx3cr1 Cx43-/- mice) delays AV conduction and acute depletion of macrophages in Cd11bDTR mice induces progressive AV block.

DESIGN
Comparison of microdissected AV nodes from control, Cx3cr1 Cx43-/- and macrophage-depleted Cd11bDTR mice, three biological replicates each.
