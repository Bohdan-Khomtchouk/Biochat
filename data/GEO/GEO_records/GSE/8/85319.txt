TITLE
Expression data from Aspergillus nidulans FGSCA26 and SirAdelta grown for 24,48, and 72h

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
The sirA gene encodes a member of sirtuin protein that is NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) and ubiquitous in eukaryote. DNA microarray analyses for Aspergillus nidulans FGSCA26 (WT) strain and Gene disruptant of sirA (SirAd) indicated that genes for synthesizing secondary metabolic products such as sterigmatocystin, penicillin G, emericellamide, aspernidine A, xanthone, austinol, and siderophores are down-regulated by SirA.

DESIGN
Aspergillus nidulans WT and SirAd strains were cultured in 200 ml of GMM at 30Â°C for 24, 48, and 72 h, and their total RNA was purified as described above.
