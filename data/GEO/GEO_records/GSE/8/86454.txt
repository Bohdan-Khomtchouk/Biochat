TITLE
Genes and mechanisms regulated by androgens as possible contributors to the male excess observed in autism [hNSCs]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed androgen receptor (AR) target genes on human neural stem cells (hNSCs) by ChIP-sequencing of AR IP after either DMSO (solvent), Testosterone 100nM, DHT 10 or 100nM 4 hours treatment in order to find the role of AR during brain development.

DESIGN
Examination of AR IP sequences after DMSO (1 technical replicate), Testosterone 100nM (AR agonist, 2 technical replicates), DHT 10nM (AR agonist, natural metabolite of testosterone, 2 technical replicates) or DHT 100nM treatment by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500
