SUMMARY
Goal of the experiment:  To examine differential gene expression in the ovaries of heterozygous Lethal Yellow (C57BL/6J Ay/a) mice treated with vehicle or pioglitazone. Brief description of the experiment:  The objective of this study was to use whole mouse genome DNA microarrays (Codelink)  to examine gene expression the ovaries of heterozygous Lethal Yellow (C57BL/6J Ay/a) mice. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) treated with thiazolidinediones (TZD), such as pioglitazone, show reduced androgen levels and improved ovulatory function.  Recent evidence suggests that TZD, acting via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), alter the expression of ovarian genes involved in insulin/IGF signaling that may account for some of the observed effects.  Since TZD can alter the expression of a large variety of genes, there may be other mechanisms involved in the improvement of ovarian function with TZD treatment.  Lethal yellow (LY) mice exhibit progressive obesity, reproductive dysfunction, and altered metabolic regulation (e.g. insulin and leptin resistance) similar to women with PCOS.  This  study was designed to test the hypothesis that prolonged treatment of aging LY mice with pioglitazone would alter the expression of ovarian genes involved in reproduction. Beginning at 120-days and continuing until 180-days of age, female LY mice received daily oral doses of either 0.1 mg pioglitazone (n = 4) or an equal volume of vehicle (0.1 ml 100% DMSO; n = 4).  At the end of the treatment regimen, ovaries were removed and RNA extracted.  Total RNA extracts were run individually on Codelink Mouse Whole Genome Bioarrays (GE).  Relative gene expression was compared between treatments by t-test using GeneSpring software. Keywords:  mouse, drug treatment Experimental factors:  drug treatment Keywords: drug treatment
