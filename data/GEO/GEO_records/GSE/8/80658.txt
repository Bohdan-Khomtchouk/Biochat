TITLE
Expression data from mouse embryonic fibroblasts wild type and lacking functional Pax7 gene

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myogenic differentiation relies on Pax7 function. We used mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking functional Pax7 to follow its role in terminally differentiated cells. Microarray analysis allowed us to compare transcriptomes of mouse embryonic fibroblasts of two genotypes, i.e. Pax7+/+ and Pax7-/-.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were collected  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
