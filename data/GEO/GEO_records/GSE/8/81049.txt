TITLE
Alfa2-COP is involved in early secretory traffic in Arabidopsis and it is required for plant growth

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The loss-of-function mutants of alfa1-COP (alfa1-COP-1) and alfa2-COP (alfa2-COP1), the two alfa-COP isoforms of Arabidopsis. Unlike in alfa1-COP mutant, the alfa2-COP mutant displays defects in plant growth, including small rosettes, stems and roots and mislocalization of p24a5, a protein containing a C-terminal dylisine motif involved in COPI binding. In addition, it exhibited abnormal morphology of the Golgi apparatus. Global expression analyses of the alfa2-COP mutant versus wild-type Arabidopsis plants reveal altered expression of plant cell wall-associated genes. A high expression of the COPII sec31A isoform was observed in the alfa2-COP mutant that also occurs in a mutant of an upstream gene of COPI assembly, the ARF-GEF GNL1

DESIGN
Four biological replicates were generated. The goal of this experiment is to compared the Î±2-COP-3 mutant against a Col-0 wild type line. In the comparison  2 of the replicates were reversed-labeled.
