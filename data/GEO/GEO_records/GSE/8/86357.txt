TITLE
Microenvironment Cell Populations Affymetrix HuGene 1.0ST

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human tissues harbour a wide array of cellular populations, often including both immune and lymphoid cell populations, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. The goal of this study was to identify transcriptomic markers of these cell populations, in order to quantify their abundances using transcriptomic data. The present super-series is composed of a large number of transcriptomic profiles of these cell populations. These profiles were obtained from public repositories, normalized using the fRMA R package (which allows a consistent normalization of profiles across public series), and consistently annotated. This series corresponds to Affymetrix HuGene 1.0ST profiles. Sample's annotation is available as supplementary material.

DESIGN
3224 gene expression profiles from immune cell populations, non-immune non-malignant cell populations and non-hematopoietic cancer cell lines were gathered from 81 different studies. Data was normalized using the fRMA R package, version 1.18.0, and hugene.1.0.st.v1frmavecs version 1.0.0. fRMA was applied to single series independantly, and the resulting gene expression matrices were then concatenated.
