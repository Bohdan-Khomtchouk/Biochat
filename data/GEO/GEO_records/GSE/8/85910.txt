TITLE
Gene expression profile of TGFbeta treated human coronary smooth muscle cell (HCASM)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGFbeta induces VSMC gene expression in human coronary artery smooth muscle cell (HCASM)

DESIGN
Subconfluent human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASM) were starved overnight followed by TGFbeta treatment for 24 hours. RNA was then extracted for deep-sequencing.
