TITLE
Kinetic CRAC uncovers a role for Nab3 in determining gene expression profiles during stress

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
RNA-binding proteins play a key role in shaping gene expression profiles during stress, however, little is known about the dynamic nature of these interactions and how this influences the kinetics of gene expression. To address this, we developed kinetic CRAC, a UV cross-linking method that enabled us to quantitatively measure the dynamics of protein-RNA interactions in vivo on a minute time-scale. Here, using kinetic CRAC we measure the global RNA-binding dynamics of the yeast transcription termination factor Nab3 in response to glucose starvation. These measurement reveal rapid changes in protein-RNA interactions within one minute following stress imposition. Changes in Nab3 binding are largely independent of alterations in transcription rate during the early stages of stress response, indicating orthogonal transcriptional control mechanisms. We also uncover a function for Nab3 in dampening expression of stress-responsive genes. Kinetic CRAC has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of in vivo dynamics of protein-RNA interactions.

DESIGN
kinetic CRAC experiments performed on Nab3 and RNA polymerase II. Glucose to no glucose experiments were performed in duplicate.
