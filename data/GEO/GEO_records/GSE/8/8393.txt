TITLE
Patterns of gene expression following contact of sympathetic neurons with their myocyte targets

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We identified 112 known genes and 150 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) showing more than a 1.3 fold change in target-exposed neurons compared to neurons grown in the absence of target.  Expression of 36 genes and 49 ESTs was upregulated, while expression of 76 genes and 101 ESTs was downregulated by the presence of target during the culture period. Overall, these changes represented approximately 1.6% of the probe set. Keywords: Patterns of gene expression by neuron-target interaction
