TITLE
Transcriptional Dynamics of Cultured Human Villous Cytotrophoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic characterization of cultured primary human cytrophoblasts (2nd trimester) undergoing differentiation/invasion in vitro.

DESIGN
Transcriptome of human villous cytotrophoblasts at 0h (following isolation) or 3, 15, or 39h after plating on Matrigel (in vitro). Sample processing and hybridization was performed by the UCSF Gladstone Institute
