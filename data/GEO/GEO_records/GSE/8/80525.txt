TITLE
Transcriptional response to the HSP70 inhibitor MAL3-101 in parental rhabdomyosarcoma cells and isogenic acquired-resistance lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that inhibition of HSP70 with MAL3-101 induces activation of the unfolded protein response, and that cells with acquired resistance upregulate a cytosolic HSP70 at the level of mRNA.

DESIGN
Whole transcriptome sequencing was undertaken of parental or acquired-resistance RMS13 cells treated with either DMSO or 10 micromolar MAL3-101.
