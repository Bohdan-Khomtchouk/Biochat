TITLE
Genome-wide maps of N_NUP98 and NUP98-TOP1 and MLL1 co-bound targets and their chromatin state in NUP98 fusion transformed cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By performing biotin-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for two different NUP98 fusions, we defined the genome-wide direct binding sites of NUP98-TOP1 or N-NUP98. To test whether NUP98 fusions and MLL1 were recruited to the same region of Hox genes promoters, MLL1 ChIP-seq analysis was carried out in murine NUP98-HOXA9 transformed cells using an anti-MLL1n antibody (MO435). In agreement with our results showing that NUP98 fusions interacts with MLL1 in NSL/MLL1 complex, MLL1 binding targets significantly overlap with that of N-NUP98 or NUP98-TOP1 at promoter region and gene body region.  In summary, our results confirmed that NUP98 fusions and MLL1 are recruited to the same Hox loci, supporting the notion of the association between NUP98 fusions and NSL/Mll1 complex, suggesting that the recruitment of NUP98 fusions to the Hox gene loci maybe through MLL1.

DESIGN
To define the binding targets of NUP98 fusion proteins, and the co-bound sites with MLL1 using NUP98 fusion transformed mouse bone marrow LSK cells.
