TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of adenine-treated murine microglial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In previous study, we demonstrated adenine-induced cell signaling on anti-inflammation in BV2 cells. To investigate the changes of transcriptome mediated by adenine, we used microarrays to compare the difference in expression levels.

DESIGN
A chip study using total RNA recovered from two separate wild-type cultures of murine microglial cells and separate cultures of adenine-treated cells.
