TITLE
Differential RNA Interactions with Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins During Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are involved in many processes in RNA metabolism. In addition to their functions in the nucleus, hnRNPs can function in the replication of RNA viruses in the cytoplasm. In vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-infected cells, several hnRNPs relocalize from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This raises the question of whether these hnRNPs are relocalized together with their host nuclear RNAs or whether they associate with new RNAs in the cytoplasm. hnRNP A1, hnRNP C1/C2, and hnRNP K were immunoprecipitated from mock- or VSV-infected cells, and RNAs were analyzed by high content RNA sequencing.  Each hnRNP displayed a loss of interaction with cellular transcripts in favor of viral mRNAs. hnRNP A1 was preferentially associated with VSV phosphoprotein (P) mRNA; hnRNP C1/C2 was preferentially associated with VSV glycoprotein (G) mRNA, and hnRNP K bound viral transcripts in rank of abundance.

DESIGN
Two experiments, 5 biological samples each. Mock infections and non-specific antibodies used as controls.
