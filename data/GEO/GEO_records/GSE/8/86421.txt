TITLE
The isoxazoloanthrone Y100 perturbs proteostasis and mitochondrial function in NF1 dysregulated cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified a molecule in a synthetic lethal screen with ira2Δ in yeast called Y100. Y100 targets ira2Δ deficient yeast and inhibits NF1-deficient tumor cells. Y100 disrupts proteostasis, metabolic homeostasis, and induces the formation of mitochondrial superoxide in NF1 deficient cancer cells. Here, we examined the transcriptional response following treatment with Y100 or a vehicle control.

DESIGN
RNA expression data was obtained from immortalized mammary epithelial cells (IMECs) that were treated for 8 hours with 1 micromolar Y100 or a vehicle control.
