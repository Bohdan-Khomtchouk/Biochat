TITLE
Drop-Seq analysis of  P17 FACS sorted retinal cells from the Tg(Chx10-EGFP/cre,-ALPP)2Clc or Vsx2-GFP transgenic line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Vsx2-GFP mouse retinas were dissected, FACS sorted for GFP+ cells and single-cell mRNAseq libraries generated with Drop-Seq

DESIGN
Drop-Seq was performed on two different batches. Bipolar1-Bipolar4 are replicates from batch 1 and Bipolar5-6 are replicates from Batch 2
