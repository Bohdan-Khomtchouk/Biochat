TITLE
Differentially expressed genes after miRNA or siRNA transfection in human cancer cell lines (III)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes by anti cancer treatments (microRNAs or siRNAs) in human cancer, several cell lines (pancreatic cancer,  esophageal cancer, tongue squamous cell carcinoma, hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma) were subjected to Agilent whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Human cell lines (Panc-1, SW1990, TE8, TE9, SAS, FaDu and EBC-1) were treated with miRNAs (miR-216b-3p, miR-145-5p, miR-145-3p, miR-150-5p and miR-150-3p), siRNAs (si-ZFP36L2, si-MMP13, si-TPD52, and si-MTDH).
