TITLE
Epitope mapping of a monoclonal antibody directed against Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen by protein microarray

ORGANISM
Neisseria meningitidis

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to determine the epitope targeted by 31E10/E7 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb). mAb 31E10/E7 was diluted at 1:2000 and incubated on a non-commercial Protein Microarray platform printed with NHBA specific recombinant protein fragments and full length NHBA of different variants.
