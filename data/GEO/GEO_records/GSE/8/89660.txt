TITLE
Comparison of gene expression patterns of two SCLC genetically-engineered mouse models; Rb1 floxed, Trp53 foxed, LSL-Myc T58A-IRES-Luc vs. Rb1 floxed, Trp53 foxed, RPR2 (p130) floxed

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myc expression cooperates with Rb1 and Trp53 loss in mouse lungs to generate rapid, aggressive, highly metastatic and neuroendocrine-low tumors which are similar to human variant subset of SCLC with high NEUROD1 expression. Targeted drug screening reveals that mouse and human MYC-driven SCLC are vulnerable to Aurora kinase inhibition in combination with chemotherapy in vivo.

DESIGN
Tumor formation is induced by infecting the conditional Rb1 fl/fl; Trp53fl/fl, LSL-Myc (T58A) and Rb1 fl/fl; Trp53fl/fl, p130 fl/fl GEMMs with adenoviral vectors containing Cgrp promoter driving Cre recombinase. The tumors were macro-dissected from lungs. RNA was extracted from fresh or flash frozen tumors and subjected to single end RNA sequencing.
