TITLE
Clonal isolates of PC3 cells overexpressing CENPU

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified CENPU as prostate cancer metastases genes by analyzing QTL, transcript profiles and SNP associations with aggressive disease phenotypic traits in transgenic mice and human cohorts CENPU was futher validated as a metastases genes in vitro and in vivo utilizing prostate cancer cell lines overexpressing the gene, and we used microarray to analyze the changes in transcripts

DESIGN
Human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 were cloned with etither a control (empty) p-Lenti vector, or a p-Lenti vector containing the CENPU gene. Cells were selected using blastocydin followed by propagation of 5 clonal isolates for RNA extraction and hybridization onto Affymetrix array
