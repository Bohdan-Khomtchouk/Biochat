TITLE
Total RNA-seq from HCT116, MCF7 and SJSA cell lines treated with DMSO and Nutlin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine effects of p53 activation on steady-state mRNA levels, we performed RNA-seq analysis of colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116 (p53+/+ and p53 -/-), breast carcinoma line MCF7, and osteosarcoma line SJSA treated with MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin.

DESIGN
Total RNA was sequenced from HCT116 (p53+/+ and p53 -/-), MCF7 and SJSA cells treated with DMSO or 10 microM Nutlin for 12 hours.
