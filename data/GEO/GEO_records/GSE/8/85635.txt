TITLE
Transcriptome profiles of mouse mammary stem cells and progenitor cells 2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MaSC, Luminal progenitor enriched subpopulations were sorted based on CD24/CD29 expression from mammary epithelial cells of virgin female mice . (Tiede BJ et al., 2009, PLoS ONE 4(11): e8035. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008035), and the transcirptome profiles were determined and compared.

DESIGN
Comparison of two MaSC (P4) and Luminal progenitor (P5) enriched subpopulations
