TITLE
Infection with Enterovirus 71 induces modulation of the microRNA profile of the mouse brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further understand the molecular pathogenesis of Enterovirus 71 infection, we profiled cellular microRNAs of brain tissue from suckling Kunming mice infected with EV71 and uninfected mice as comparison.

DESIGN
Suckling mice infected with EV71 and mice brains were harvested on three and five days post infection. Three of each were chosen for microRNAs detection and three uninfected mice on the same time.
