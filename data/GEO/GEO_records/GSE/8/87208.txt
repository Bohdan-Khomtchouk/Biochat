TITLE
Genome variation profiling of A204 parental and acquired-resistance cells treated with Pazopanib, Dasatinib and Sunitinib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Malignant rhadboid tumors (MRTs) are lethal paediatric cancers characterised by a deficiency in the SWI/SNF subunit SMARCB1. Here we employ an integrated molecular profiling and chemical biology approach to demonstrate that the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) PDGFRÎ± and FGFR1 are coactivated in MRT cells and that dual blockade of these receptors has synergistic efficacy. Genome variation profiling of A204 parental and acquired resistance cell line

DESIGN
Genome variation profiling of 4 cell lines, parental A204, A204 Dasatinib resistant, A204 Pazopanib resistant and A204 Sunitinib resistant
