TITLE
Expression data from hAT1R transgenic and non-transgenic C57BL/6 mouse heart tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Excessive Ang II signaling through AT1R is shown to cause pathological hypertrophy. Underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet known and expression studies are not available so far. To understand hAT1R signaling, cardiac tissue, from C57BL/6 mouse over expressing hAT1R signaling, is subjected to genomic microarray studies. This data compared with the data from healthy, non transgenic C57BL/6 mouse. Keywords: disease state analysis
