TITLE
Expression survey of Rpp1 soybean line PI200492 resistant to P. pachyrhizi

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Affymetrix soybean genome arrays were used to identify genes differentially expressed in the immune resistance response at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after inoculation with Phakopsora pachyrhizi isolates TW72-1 or HW94-1 soybean + HW94-1 = resistant;  soybean + TW72-1 = susceptible Keywords: time course
