TITLE
Differential gene expression analysis of Wildtype and NMD deficient mutants grown at 23°C Long day condition

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA of WT, upf1-5, upf3-1 and their double mutant seedlings grown at 23°C, day 8 after germination, ZT 16

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA level in WT and NMD deficient mutant seedling grown at 23°C
