TITLE
Identification of specific xWNT5A and xWNT11specific target genes in dorsal marginal zone explants of Xenopus laevis

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
The non-canonical signaling branches of the WNT signaling network realize different movements during Xenopus laevis gastrulation movements. The WNT5A branch is responsible for the constriction whereas the WNT11 branch triggers the elongation of the dorsal mesoderm. Therefore we used dorsal marginal zone explants which undergo convergent extension movements as readout system to identify differences in gene expression pattern between the WNT5A and WNT11 signaling branch via microarray analysis.We identified pbk as specific WNT5A target gene and rab11fip5 as specific WNT11 target gene. Therefore the non-canonical branches of the WNT signaling network do not only regulate cell behavior but also the expression of different target genes.

DESIGN
Dorsal marginal zone explants of COMO, WNT5AMO and WNT11MO injected embryos were analysed in three biological replicates.
