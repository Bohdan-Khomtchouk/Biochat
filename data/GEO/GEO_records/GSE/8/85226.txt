TITLE
Impact of Visceral Fat Adiposity on Gene Expression Profile in Peripheral Blood Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled gene expression in peripheral blood cells from 17 obese patients by microarray analysis and revealed that visceral fat adiposity impact on gene expression profile in peripheral blood cells compared to subcutaneous fat accumulation.

DESIGN
Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 kg/m2 according to the Japanese criteria. Visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) were measured by computed tomography (CT) and determined in the cross-sectional slice at the umbilical level. Subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus, malignant diseases, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases were excluded. Patients treated with anti-diabetic drugs were also excluded.
