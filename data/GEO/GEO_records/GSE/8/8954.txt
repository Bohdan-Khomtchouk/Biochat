TITLE
Molecular profiling of human bone marrow and adipose tissue-derived stromal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bone marrow (BM) has been considered so far the reference source for stromal cells (SC) originally called mesenchymal stem cells. Recently human adult adipose tissue (AT) has been reported as a valuable source for the isolation of cells exerting a mesenchymal-like phenotype. Though both BM- and AT- derived stromal cells (BMSC and ATSC) share similar immuno-phenotype and exhibit multi-lineage potential in vitro, a consensual panel of specific markers is still debated and the precise molecular mechanisms governing their differentiated fate are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to compare the genome wide expression profiles of stromal cells isolated from AT and BM and to emphasize the core of MSC stemness properties. Moreover we focused on the molecular characteristics of ATSC, attempting to reveal their specific features.We identified an overlapping dataset of 190 genes commonly regulated by ATSC and BMSC. Among these, we were able to categorize 6 key biological families that could be regarded as a stemness signature  that underlie the self-renewal potential and the ability to generate progenitor cells. In particular, a pivotal role of signalling pathways along with the expression of numerous transcription regulators emerged from this study. Genes specifically modulated in ATSC, suggested that these cells posses anti-oxidative and neuroprotective properties. Taken together, these results provide new hints towards the understanding of the molecular basis  of MSC maintenance and suggest that ATSC have interesting properties which could be useful for several potential clinical applications.
