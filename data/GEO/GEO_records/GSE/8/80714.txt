TITLE
The beneficial effect of pterocarpan-rich extract from soybean leaf on metabolic syndrome in overweight and obese subjects: randomized controlled trial

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the effect of pterocarpan-rich extract from soybean leaf on metabolic syndrome and elucidated anti-inflammation mechanism based on RNA-seq transcriptomic profiles in overweight and obese subjects

DESIGN
Total RNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was obtained from pterocarpan-rich extract soybean leaf (PT) and biomarkers associated with lipid, glucose metabolism and inflammation was measured. Please note that raw data for the " after supplementation " samples have been lost and therefore were not provided,
