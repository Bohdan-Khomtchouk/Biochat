TITLE
Potato cyst nematode repsonses in potato

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Sets of seven 2-week old potato plants carrying the nematode resistance gene H1, grown from tuber ‘chits’ in sandy loam at a constant temperature of 20 ºC and a light cycle of 16 hour light/8 hour dark, were each inoculated in the roots evenly with 2000 juveniles of the virulent potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida, or with the avirulent G. rostochiensis pathotype Ro1, or with water. Plants were manually watered throughout the duration of the experiment.   5, 17 and 33 days after inoculation, the roots were carefully washed and root tissue samples were individually flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 ºC. Total RNA isolations were performed using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. All samples were treated with DNase. The experiment was replicated twice. Keywords: Direct comparison
