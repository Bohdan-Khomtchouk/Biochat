TITLE
Brain RNA-seq during the worker-gamergate transitions in Harpegnathos ants

ORGANISM
Harpegnathos saltator

SUMMARY
Harpegnathos workers were induced to transition to reproductive gamergates and mRNA from their brains was sequenced to determine changes in gene expression at different time points (0, 6, 13, and 110 days after transition onset)

DESIGN
Ants were removed from their original colony at d0 and placed in boxes lacking a dominant reproductive. Dueling was monitored and the top three individuals displaying the most dueling were collected 6 and 13 days later. Pre-transfer individuals (d0) and stable gamergates at d110 were also harvested. Whole brains (including optic lobes) were dissected and processed for RNA-seq.
