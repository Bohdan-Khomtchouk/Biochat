TITLE
Cytotoxic activity of HTI-286 in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HTI-286, an analogue of hemiasterlin, interferes with microtubule dynamics and circumvents transport-based resistance to taxanes. In this study we evaluate the inhibitory effects of HTI-286 on human prostate cancer growth in vitro and in different in vivo models. The results show that HTI-286 is a potent inhibitor of proliferation and induced marked increases in apoptotic rates in all cell lines tested. Despite similar transcriptomic changes regarding cell death and cell cycle-regulating genes after exposure to HTI-286 or docetaxel, the gene array revealed distinct molecular signatures for both compounds. Keywords: Drug comparison
