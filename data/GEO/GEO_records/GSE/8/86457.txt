TITLE
Genes and mechanisms regulated by androgens as possible contributors to the male excess observed in autism [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed androgens effects on human neural stem cells (hNSCs) by RNA-sequencing after either DMSO (solvent) or DHT 100nM 24 hours treatment in order to find the role of androgen receptor (AR) during brain development.

DESIGN
Examination of DHT 100nM regulated genes in hNSCs by generating mRNA profiles of DMSO (3 or 4 technical replicates within the 3 biological replicates: 10 samples in total) and DHT 100nM (natural metabolite of testosterone, AR agonist, 3 technical replicates within the 3 biological replicate: 9 samples in total) 24 hours treated hNSCs by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500
