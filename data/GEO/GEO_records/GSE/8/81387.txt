TITLE
Expression data in mouse liver expressing or not the adapter Grb14

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Grb14 is an endogenous inhibitor of insulin signaling We used microarrays to investigate gene expression patterns after Grb14 silencing in mouse liver

DESIGN
Ten week old mice were injected intraveinously with recombinant adenovirus expressing a control sh RNA (sh scramble) or a sh targetting Grb14 (shGrb14), and liver were studied in the fed state 2 days after the infection
