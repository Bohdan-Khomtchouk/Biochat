Peritoneal Carcinomatosis of gastric cancer

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a frequent finding in patients with primary gastric cancer, and it is associated with a poor prognosis. A major mechanism in peritoneal carcinomatosis is the dissemination of cancer cells into the abdominal cavity, mainly in diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma. The features that enable diffuse primary gastric tumours to develop peritoneal dissemination have been little investigated and are only incompletely understood. We therefore compared the gene expression profile in patients with diffuse primary gastric cancer with and without peritoneal carcinomatosis. Specimens from consecutive gastric cancer patients with and without peritoneal carcinomatosis were investigated using oligonucleotide microarrays. Keywords: Disease state analysis
