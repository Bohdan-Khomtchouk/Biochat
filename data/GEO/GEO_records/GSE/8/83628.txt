TITLE
Gene expression changes with knock-down of linc-9432

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression in pterygium fibroblast cells after 48 h treatment with siRNA to knock down expression of linc-9432 or non-specific oligonucleotide control

DESIGN
21 nM pooled siRNA (Ambion, Life Technologies) or non-specific control oligonucleotides are added to cultured fibroblast cells for 48 hours
