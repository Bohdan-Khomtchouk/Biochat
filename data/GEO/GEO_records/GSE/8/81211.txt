TITLE
Genome-wide methylation approach identifies a novel hypermethylated gene panel in ulcerative colitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of three normal (N) and eight ulcerative colitis (UC) samples as well as one human colon cancer cell (HCT116) . The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation platform was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 480,000 CpGs.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 12 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.
