SUMMARY
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Low-grade B-cell lymphomas include several subtypes of tumors with different degrees of histological, biological or clinical features. Differential diagnosis is frequently compromised by the lack of specific cytogenetic or molecular features. As a consequence, therapies remain in many lymphoma types largely based in common protocols with largely variable success. Our objectives were to describe and to compare the genomic profile of a series of samples from the most prevalent low-grade lymphoma subtypes; all of them systematically analyzed with the same approach. DESIGN-AND-METHODS: We carried out a high-resolution genomic DNA analysis (44K probes) in 87 low grade B cell lymphoma tumor samples that unambiguously presented the clinical picture, analytical features, and peripheral blood morphology and phenotype described for each entity. RESULTS: The genomic integrity of the samples was heavily compromised (80% of the tumors presented at least one aberration). This phenomenon also involved lymphoplasmocytic and marginal zone lymphomas that have not been previously studied by this genomic approach. New aberrations have been described for almost every subtype. We have also generated reports of the extension of the genomic instability, detecting distinct patterns of genomic instability within subtypes. INTERPRETATION-AND-CONCLUSIONS: The genomic profile of each subgroup showed substantive differences. The bioinformatic analysis of the data detected a set of new aberrations which were present in the majority of the subgroups and that pointed out to specific pathways, such as NF-kB (gains that involved REL, BCL11A and COMMD1) or DNA repair checkpoint pathways (deletion of 16q24 involving CDT1).
