TITLE
Analysis of splicing pattern and gene expression level of Matrin3 knockdown.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified RNA targets of Matrin3 using SH-SY5Y by PAR-CLIP analysis.  Because Matrin3 mainly bound to intron of pre-mRNA,  in order to find the effect of Matrin3 on splicing pattern and expression, we knocked down Matrin3 using SH-SY5Y cells by electroporation and extracted total RNAs from those cells.  The total RNAs were subjected to whole transcripts microarray GeneChipÂ® Affymetrix Human Transcriptome array 2.0.

DESIGN
SH-SY5Y cells were electroporated with Matrin3-siRNA or negative control siRNA. Forty eight hours after electroporation, total RNA was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis.
