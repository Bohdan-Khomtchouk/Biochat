TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the prostate cancer cell line PC3.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the effect of miR-130a in prostate cancer, PC3 cells overexpressing miR-130a were analyzed for global gene expression.

DESIGN
PC3 cells were transfected with miR-130a or negative control in three independent experiments.
