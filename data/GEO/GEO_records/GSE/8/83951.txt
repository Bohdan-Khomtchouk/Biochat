TITLE
Whole blood transcriptional analysis of vaccine combination administration in infants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify the gene network and pathway biology associated with response to vaccine administration by determining genome-wide alterations in host RNA in children

DESIGN
Samples were obtained from children before and after vaccine administration. RNA was extracted from whole blood samples with PAXgene blood RNA reagent, followed by clean-up and DNase I treatment with QIAGEN PAXgene blood RNA kit in accordance with the prescribed protocol provided with the kit. Quality control was performed with Agilent Bioanalyser.
