TITLE
RNA sequencing analysis of human podocytes reveals glucocorticoid regulated gene networks targeting non-immune pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the nature of glucocorticoids targeting non-immune cell function, we generate RNA sequencing data from 3 human podocyte cell lines derived from 3 kidney transplant donors and identify the genes that are significantly regulated in dexamethasone-treated podocytes compared to vehicle-treated cells.Our results represent a significant step forward in the genome-wide characterization of the molecular effects of glucocorticoids on human podocytes. The resource generated in this study is important for understanding the targeting of non-immune cell function by glucocorticoids and also for designing more specific podocyte-targeted agents for MCN therapy.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiles of human podocytes treated with vehicle and dexamethasone were generated by RNA-sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500
