TITLE
Chip data of OsMYB30 overexpression and mutant plants under cold stress

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
It is important to reveal the regulatory mechanism of OsMYB30 gene which participated in cold response. We used microarrays to find differentially expressed genes that might be regulated by OsMYB30 and resolve its regulation mechanism. The rice gene OsMYB30 was overexpressed in the two OsMYB30 overexpression plants (OE2 and OE28) compared to the control plant (CK, ZH11). The rice gene OsMYB30 was knocked out in the two osmyb30 homozygous mutants (mutant1 and mutant2) compared to the wild type (WT, Huayang).OE2-C0h and OE28-C0h are two repititions of OsMYB30 overexpression plants under normal conditions with CK-C0h used as control plant. OE2-C6h and OE28-C6h are two repititions of OsMYB30 overexpression plants under cold stress conditions with CK-C6h used as control plant. mutant1-C0h and mutant2-C0h are two repititions of osmyb30 homozygous mutant plants under normal conditions with WT-C0h used as control plant. mutant1-C6h and mutant2-C6h are two repititions of osmyb30 homozygous mutant plants under cold stress conditions with WT-C6h used as control plant.

DESIGN
In order to find differentially expressed genes in the OsMYB30-OE (comparing two independent OE plants with ZH11) and osmyb30 mutant (comparing two independent homozygous mutant plants with Huayang) under normal conditions and cold treatment for 6 hours.
