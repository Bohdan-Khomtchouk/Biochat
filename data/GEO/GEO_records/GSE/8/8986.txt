TITLE
NF-κB target gene microarray in HAECs in response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An NF-κB target gene array (Panomics, Inc., Redwood City, CA) was performed to profile the PAO1-dependent expression pattern of 111 NF-kB-regulated genes in primary human airway epithelial cells (HAECs). A small scale microarray was carried out using NF-κB target gene array kit (Panomics, Inc., Redwood City, CA).  A long sense-strand oligonucleotide for each of the 111 human genes that have been previously shown to be regulated by NF-KB signaling pathway was spotted in duplicate on the nitrocellulose membrane. Biotinylated DNA was spotted along the right and bottom sides of the array membrane as control. The arrays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Keywords: cellular response to bacteria
