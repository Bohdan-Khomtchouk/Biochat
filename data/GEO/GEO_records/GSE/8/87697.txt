TITLE
RNA sequencing of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum SC596 in response to various substrates

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium longum

SUMMARY
The purpose of this project was to determine the whole transcriptome response of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum SC596 to pooled and individual human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) relative to lactose

DESIGN
Bacterial isolates grown on lactose, pooled human milk oligosaccharides (HMO), lacto-N-tetraose (LNT), lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT), 2’fucosyllactose (2’FL), 3-fucosyllactose (3FL). RNA was extracted and sequenced, in duplicate, on an Illumina HiSeq. Early, mid, and late timepoints in response to pooled HMO were additionally sequenced in duplicate.
