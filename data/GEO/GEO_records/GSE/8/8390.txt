Added effects of acute heat-stress on the clinical signs associated with fescue toxicosis

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Intake of ergot alkaloids associated with endophyte-infected fescue (E+) has adverse effects on animal health and productivity, which is collectively, termed fescue toxicosis. These effects are exacerbated under hot and humid (summer) conditions. A rat model for this condition was used to evaluate the effect of endophytic toxins on hepatic gene expression under acute (three days) heat stress (HS). Core temperature (Tc) was monitored continuously in rats (n=12) implanted with telemetric transmitters. Rats were fed ad libitum an E+ diet and maintained under thermoneutral (TN) conditions (21 ˚C) for five days, followed by TN or HS conditions (31 ˚C) for three days. Feed intake (FI) and body weight (BW) were measured daily. Both E+ and HS induced alterations in hepatic genes were evaluated using DNA microarrays. Intake of E+ reduced FI and BW under TN and HS conditions from pretreatment level, with greater reduction occurring during HS period. Core temperature at TN did not change from pretreatment level, but increased during HS. Genes associated with ATP synthesis, immune function, chaperone activity, and antioxidant function were reduced in E+HS vs E+TN. Present findings suggest that rats respond to E+ during heat stress by inducing hepatic CYP3A4 expression and suppressing chaperone, antioxidant and immune systems, which could ultimately increase the stress resulting in various pathological abnormalities.
