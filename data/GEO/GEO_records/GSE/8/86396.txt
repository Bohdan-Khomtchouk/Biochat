TITLE
Transcription Factors Sp8 and Sp9 Coordinately Regulate Olfactory Bulb Interneuron Development [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To asses changes in gene expression profiles from the P11 no cre littermate control olfactory bulbs and conditional double knockout olfactory bulbs of Dlx5/6-CIE; Sp8 Flox/Flox; Sp9 Flox/Flox (Sp8/Sp9-DCKO) mice. Methods: Total RNA was isolated and sequenced from the olfactory bulbs of the P11 no cre littermate controls or Sp8/Sp9-DCKO mice in duplicate using an illumina high-seq 2500. Raw data was analyzed using TopHat. Genes were considered changed  which performed fold-change > =2 and FDR < =0.05. Changed genes were then filtered to reveal the downstream targets of Sp8 and Sp9. Results: 32 genes were significantly increased and 144 genes were significantly decreased in expression level due to the loss of Sp9 and Sp8 expression.
