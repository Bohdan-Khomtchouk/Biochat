TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation analysis of paired prostate tumor and noncancerous tissues was perform in order to identify potential DNA methylation biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnostics and prognosis. Based on comparison of tumors versus noncancerous tissues and cases with and without biochemical disease recurrence (BCR), several gene targets were selected for more detailed analysis. Differences in methylation were further confirmed by means of methylation-specific PCR and significantly correlated with gene expression. Survival analysis indicated various combinations of DNA methylation biomarkers as significant prognosticaters of time to BCR, therefore, showing their potential clinical significance.

DESIGN
DNA methylation profile was analyzed in 9 pairs of tumor and noncancerous tissues of prostate cancer patients (18 samples in total). Biochemical disease progression was observed in 4 of 9 patients. No biolocigal replicates were performed.
