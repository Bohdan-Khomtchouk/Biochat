TITLE
Effect of growth in TSA or SCFA on gene expression in E. histolytica

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
In order to dtermine the role of histone actylation in gene expresssion, E. histolytica 200:NIH trophozoites were treated with the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A, or grown in short chain fatty acids, which have been shown to alter histone actylation patterns in Entamoeba species. Keywords: Expression
