TITLE
Steinernema carpocapsae Breton small RNA sequencing insect in vitro simulation system, from

ORGANISM
Steinernema carpocapsae

SUMMARY
We report small RNA sequencing of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae. The nematodes were grown in liquid culture in homogenates of pig kidney/fat and infective juveniles were gathered. Then Galleria mellonella insect haemolymph was added to simulate insect infection, control nematodes weren't added haemolymph. Nematodes were collected after two hours after haemolymph addition.

DESIGN
infective juveniles S. carpocapsae were incubated with and without haemolymph, three replicates
