TITLE
Investigation of androgen-regulated lncRNAs in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and androgen receptor (AR) downstream signalings promote prostate cancer cell proliferation. To investigate the AR signaling, we performed directional RNA sequence analysis in AR positive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP and VCaP. Using Noncode and GENCODE data sets. We identified androgen-regulated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in prostate cancer cells.
