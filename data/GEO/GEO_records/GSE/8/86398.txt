TITLE
The chromatin associated Pf1 protein maintains nucleolar integrity: gene expression from Pf1 +/+ and Pf1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pf1, also known as Phf12 (plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger protein 12) is a member of the PHD zinc finger family. Pf1 was first identified in a yeast-two hybrid screen for proteins interacting with the paired amphipathic helix (PAH) 2 domain of mSin3A, and shown to function as a transcriptional repressor . We generated Pf1 knockout mice to define the physiological role of Pf1. To  identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular defects elicited by genetic inactivation of Pf1, we next examined the impact of a Pf1 deletion on genome-wide transcriptome. RNA extracted from wild-type and Pf1-depleted MEFs was profiled by hybridization to a whole genome microarray.

DESIGN
Total RNA from Pf+/+ and Pf1 -/- MEFs at passage 2-3 (Pf+/+ lines 7706-5 and 7706-6 and Pf1 -/- lines 7706-2 and 7706-4) was isolated using Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturers protocol.  The RNA samples were examined on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array
