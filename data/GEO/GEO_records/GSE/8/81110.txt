TITLE
Classifying the Canine B-cell Lymphoma Cell line CLBL1

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
In 2013, Richards, et al. reported in Cancer Research that canine b-cell lymphomas could be subclassificed by gene expression profiling as ABC-like or GCB-like, similar to their human diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. This study, therefore, sought to classify the cell line CLBL1 as either GCB or ABC.

DESIGN
We downloaded supplementary microarray data (GSE43664) from GEO and then merged the microarray data for CLBL1 and processed the combined data using the robust multiarray averaging (RMA) method in version 3.1.2 of the R statistical programming environment.
