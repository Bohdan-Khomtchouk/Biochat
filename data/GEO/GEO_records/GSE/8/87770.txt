TITLE
R:FR and blue signaling during competition at high plant densities

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Growth in dense stands induces shade avoidance responses. Late stages of stand development lead to low red:far-red (R:FR) and low blue light conditions. We studied gene expression in late stages of canopy development when both light signals were present, and studied gene expression in the single and combined light treatments.

DESIGN
Plants were grown either single (all light treatments, and canopy control), or put in a high density of 2066 plants / m2. Gene expression measured in petioles.
