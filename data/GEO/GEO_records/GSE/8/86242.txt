TITLE
Gene expression changes in yeast cells deleted for Nat4 and cells grown in calorie-restriction

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report here mRNA-seq data of wild-type and Nat4-deletion mutant yeast cells. We also report mRNA-seq data of wild-type yeast cells grown under non-calorie restriction (NCR) and calorie restriction (CR) conditions.

DESIGN
Comparison of differential gene-expression changes detected in Nat4-deletion mutant and cells grown in calorie restriction
