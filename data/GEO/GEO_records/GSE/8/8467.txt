Micro-RNAs in Adult Rat Liver are Refractory to  19 Hours Dioxin Exposure

SUMMARY
Dioxin-like chemicals are well-known for their ability to upregulate expression of numerous genes via the AH receptor (AHR).  However, recent transcriptomic analyses in several laboratories indicate that dioxin-like chemicals or AHR genotype itself also can downregulate levels of mRNAs encoded by numerous genes.  The mechanism responsible for such downregulation is unknown.  We hypothesized that microRNAs (miRNAs), which have emerged as powerful negative regulators of mRNA levels in several systems, might be responsible for mRNA downregulation in dioxin/AHR pathways.  We used the Ambion miRNA array platform as well as quantitative RT-PCR to measure miRNA levels in dioxin-sensitive Long-Evans (Turku/AB; L-E) rats vs. dioxin-resistant Han/Wistar(Kuopio; H/W) rats. Treatment with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in vivo caused no significant changes in miRNA levels in rat livers. AHR genotype had no effect on hepatic miRNA levels in response to TCDD â€“ no miRNAs differed in expression between between L-E rats (that have wildtype AHR) compared to H/W rats (whose AHR has a large deletion in the transactivation domain).  It is unlikely that mRNA downregulation by dioxins is mediated by miRNAs, nor are miRNAs likely to play a significant role in dioxin toxicity in adult rodent liver.
