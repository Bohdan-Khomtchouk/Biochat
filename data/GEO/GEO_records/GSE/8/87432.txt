TITLE
Therapeutic Mechanisms of Chinese Herbal Medicine Qushi Huayu Decoction (QHD) in the Treatment of NAFLD

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To understand the therapeutic mechanisms of QHD, we examined the effects of QHD treatment on the liver transcriptomes of NAFLD rats and identified multiple therapeutic targets of QHD. We used microarrays to examine the effects of QHD and GC treatment on the liver transcriptomes of NAFLD rats induced by high fat diet and identified multiple therapeutic targets of QHD.

DESIGN
Rats were randomized into 4 groups.  Rats in the control group were fed with standard chow; rats in the NAFLD group were fed with HFD
