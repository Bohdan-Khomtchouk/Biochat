Micro-RNAs in Adult Long-Evans (Turku/AB) Rat Liver are Refractory to 96 Hours Dioxin Treatment

SUMMARY
Dioxin-like chemicals are well-known for their ability to upregulate expression of numerous genes via the AH receptor (AHR).  However, recent transcriptomic analyses in several laboratories indicate that dioxin-like chemicals or AHR genotype itself also can downregulate levels of mRNAs encoded by numerous genes.  The mechanism responsible for such downregulation is unknown.  We hypothesized that microRNAs (miRNAs), which have emerged as powerful negative regulators of mRNA levels in several systems, might be responsible for mRNA downregulation in dioxin/AHR pathways.  We used the Exiqon miRNA array platform as well as quantitative RT-PCR to measure miRNA levels in dioxin-sensitive Long-Evans (Turku/AB; L-E) rats. Treatment with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) for 96 hr in vivo caused few changes in miRNA levels in rat livers and those changes that were statistically significant were of modest magnitude. Feed-restricted-control L-E rats were included to ensure that changes in miRNA levels were due to TCDD-treatment per se and not the result of the decreased feed intake which occurs in dioxin-sensitive strains within 96 h after TCDD exposure.
