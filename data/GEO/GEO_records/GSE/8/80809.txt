TITLE
Expression data from lung CD11b+ conventional dendritic cells in the steady-state and following exposure to house dust mite allergens

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using mouse lung resident conventional CD11b+ dendritic cells (CD11b+ cDCs) in the context of house-dust mite (HDM)-driven allergic airway sensitization as a model, we aimed here to identify transcriptional events regulating the pro-Th2 activity of cDCs. We used microarray analyses to identify genes differentially expressed by lung CD11b+ conventional dendritic cells in response to house dust mite allergens in wild-type and Irf3-deficient mice

DESIGN
Lung Cd11b+ conventional dendritic cells were isolated from either wild type or Irf3-deficient mice 12 hours after a treatment with house dust mite extract or saline excipient
