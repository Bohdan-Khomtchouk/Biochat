TITLE
JQ1 +/- Vemurafenib in BRAF mutant melanoma (A375)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The combination of JQ1 and Vemurafenib acted synergistically in BRAF-mutant cell lines, resulting in marked apoptosis in vitro, with up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. In vivo, combination treatment suppressed tumor growth and significantly improved survival compared to either drug alone. RNA sequencing of tumor tissues revealed almost four thousand genes that were uniquely modulated by the combination, with several anti-apoptotic genes significantly down-regulated.

DESIGN
16 samples analyzed from 8 mice (each mouse was bearing two tumors, one on each flank) in 4 treatment groups (control, vemurafenib alone, JQ1 alone, JQ1+vemurafenib)
