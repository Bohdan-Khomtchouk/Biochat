TITLE
Global transcriptomic analysis of the response of Corynebacterium glutamicum to ferulic acid

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032

SUMMARY
Corynebacterium glutamicum can survive by using ferulic acid as the sole carbon source. In this study, we assessed the response of C.glutamicum to ferulic acid stress by means of a global transcriptional response analysis. The transcriptional data showed that several genes involved in degradation of ferulic acid were affected. Moreover, several genes related to the stress response; protein protection or degradation and DNA repair; replication, transcription and translation; and the cell envelope were differentially expressed. Deletion of the katA or sigE gene in C. glutamicum resulted in a decrease in cell viability under ferulic acid stress. These insights will facilitate further engineering of model industrial strains, with enhanced tolerance to ferulic acid to enable easy production of biofuels from lignocellulose.

DESIGN
Samples were collected during the mid-logarithmic growth phase in minimal medium with added glucose (control sample: 100 mM) or ferulic acid as the sole carbon source (3 mM), respectively.
