TITLE
Expression Quantitative Trait Loci Mapping Reveals a New Susceptibility Locus for Nonsyndromic Cleft Lip with or without Cleft Palate in Individuals of High Native American Ancestry [SNP array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The vast majority of genome-wide association studies hits reported for nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) fall within noncoding regions or gene deserts. Given that NSLC/P originates early in development, it is likely that associated variants are present in regulatory regions that are active during the fetal period. In this study, we identified a new locus involved with NSCL/P by conducting a two-step study where we first mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in a disease-related tissue (mesenchymal stem cells derived from 46 orbicularis oris muscle samples), followed by a case-control association study for these regulatory loci. By correlating genome-wide expression levels and genotypes, we identified 119 cis-eQTLs related to 18 genes (P-value < 0.0001; FDR=14%). We then selected 31 candidate eQTLs for a case-control association study in a large Brazilian cohort (624 patients and 668 controls). We found a significant association for rs1063588, the best eQTL for MRPL53 (P-value=0.0008). MRPL53 (2p13.1) encodes a 39S protein subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes and interacts with MYC, a transcription factor required for normal facial morphogenesis. Stratifying the analysis by ancestry revealed that the sub-sample with high Native American component drives the observed association, and it may represent a population-specific susceptibility locus.

DESIGN
In order to understand the genetic basis of NSCL/P susceptibility, we searched for genetic variants with regulatory role in a disease-related tissue, the lip muscle (orbicularis oris muscle, OOM) of affected individuals. From OOM samples, which are frequently discarded during corrective surgeries that patients with orofacial clefts routinely undergo, we derived mesenchymal stem cells (OOMMSC), and correlated the individual genetic differences with gene expression. We obtained OOM samples from 43 NSCL/P-affected and four normal individuals, and established OOMMSC  primary cultures according to previously published protocol (Bueno et al, 2009). DNA samples extracted from OOMMSC cell cultures were genotyped with the GeneChip Human Mapping 250K Nsp/250K Sty Arrays according to the manufacturesâ€™ protocol (Affymetrix, USA).
