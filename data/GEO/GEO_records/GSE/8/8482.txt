TITLE
Comparison of Agr-regulated virulence factor expression in FRI1169 and non-hemolytic variant

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
These cultures were grown to examine the differences in Agr-regulated virulence factor gene expression between wild-type S. aureus FRI1169 and a non-hemolytic variant isolated from a biofilm inoculated with FRI1169. The study is described more thoroughly in the paper " Generation of virulence factor variants in Staphylococcus aureus biofilms " , Yarwood et al., J. Bacteriol. 2007. Keywords: Wild-type versus mutant comparison, single time-point
