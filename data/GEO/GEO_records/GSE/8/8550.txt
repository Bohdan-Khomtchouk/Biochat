TITLE
Transcriptome of soleus muscle of Tenascin-C deficient 129/SV mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
1 year-old male Tenascin-C deficient 129/SV mice with the targeted insertion of a beta-lactamase cassette in the NcoI site of exon 2 of the TNC gene (Forsberg, E., Hirsch, E., Frohlich, L., Meyer, M., Ekblom, P., Aszodi, A., Werner, S. & Fassler, R. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A 93, 6594-6599) were used for the study. Animals were derived from the original strain and back-crossed with wildtype 129/SV mice (Institut f√ºr Labortierkunde, University of Zurich). Animals were acclimatized to housing in single cages for one week. Soleus muscle was harvested, total RNA isolated and subjected to transcript profiling with custom microarrays with custom-designed ATLASTM cDNA nylon filter as described (Dapp, C., Schmutz, S., Hoppeler, H. & Fluck, M. (2004) Physiol Genomics 20, 97-107). Keywords: Transcriptome
