TITLE
Shrinking the Psoriasis assessment gap: Early gene-expression profiling accurately predicts response to long-term treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prediction of response to adalimumab and methotrexate treatments based on gene expression profiles at baseline, weeks 1, 2, 4 and 16

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated from skin tissue at baseline - non-lesional and lesional - weeks 1,2,4 and 16 in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis
