TITLE
Nuclear Localization of Hog1 MAPK is Not Necessary for Resistance to Hyperosmotic Stress

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In budding yeast, this signaling pathway—  the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) response  —culminates in dual phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the MAPK, Hog1 (ortholog of mammalian p38/SAPK).  Induction of at least 50 genes requires nuclear Hog1, implying that transcriptional up-regulation is necessary to cope with hyperosmotic stress.  Contrary to this expectation, we found that cells lacking the karyopherin (Nmd5) required for Hog1 nuclear import or in which Hog1 was permanently anchored at the plasma membrane(HOG1-CCAAX) (or both) withstood hyperosmotic challenge by three different solutes (1 M sorbitol, KCl or NaCl).  In cells where activated Hog1 is excluded from the nucleus, there was little change in transcriptional program after exposure to hyperosmotic shock (comparable to hog1∆ cells), as judged by examining several diagnostic mRNAs and by global transcript measurements using microarrays.  Systematic genetic analysis ruled out the need for any transcription factor known to be influenced by Hog1 (Hot1, Msn2, Msn4, Sko1 and Smp1). Keywords: Time course of stress response gene expression array
