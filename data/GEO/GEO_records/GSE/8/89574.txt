TITLE
Cbx3 Maintains Lineage Specificity During Neural Differentiation [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cbx3 (HP1Î³) that is a member of the heterochromatin protein 1 family play important roles in development and differentiation. To determine the regulatroy mechanisms of Cbx3 during neural differentiation from ESCs to NPCs, we performed RNA-seq analysis of ESCs or ESC-derived NPCs depleted for Cbx3 or Cbx3-assocatied Mediator subunit Med26.

DESIGN
ESCs or ESC-derived NPCs were transfected with control siRNA targeting to luciferase or siRNA mediated knockdown of Cbx3 or Med26. RNAs were extracted from control or knockdown group and subjected to library preparation and deep sequencing.
