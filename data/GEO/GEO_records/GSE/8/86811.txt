TITLE
Assessing the impact of loss of ATF7IP and SETDB1 on the global distribution of H3K9me3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By comparing HeLa cells lacking ATF7IP or SETDB1 generated through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption to wild-type HeLa cells, the goal of the experiment was to determine the effect of loss of the SETDB1â€¢ATF7IP complex on the distribution of the repress

DESIGN
H3K9me3 ChIP-seq analysis of wild-type HeLa cells compared to ATF7IP knockout and SETDB1 knockout HeLa cells.
