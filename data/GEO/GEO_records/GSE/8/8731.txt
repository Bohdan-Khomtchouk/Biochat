TITLE
Comparison of apoptosis related gene expression in p7-p14 mouse lenses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lens development exhibits a seamless progression from embryogenesis through ageing. Lens maturation and growth proceed throughout life; lens fibre cells differentiate from lens epithelial cells at the equator of the lens, migrate inwards at the bow region and mature around pre-existing fibre cells at the centre of the lens. Lens fibre cells lose their nuclei via an apoptosis like mechanism as they mature. We therefore decided to study further the relationship of apoptosis related gene expression during vital stages of lens maturation in the mouse. This is an important question as defects in lens function and/or maturation result in clouding of the lens, or cataract, which can result in considerable visual impairment. Keywords: development/age comparison
