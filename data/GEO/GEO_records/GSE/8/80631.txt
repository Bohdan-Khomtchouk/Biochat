TITLE
Gene expression of extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of extranodal nasal-type NK/T cell lymphoma and other EBV-associated lymphoid proliferation disease patients was analyzed to elucidate association between JAK-STAT pathway and canonical or non-canonical PRC2/EZH2 target pathways using Illumina HumanRef-8 v3 chips.

DESIGN
In total, 47  samples were assayed in this data set. The non-normalized data were used for analysis. No normalization was performed.
