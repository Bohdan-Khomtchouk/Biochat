TITLE
Methylome analysis reveals alterations in DNA methylation in the regulatory regions of left ventricle development genes in human dilated cardiomyopathy (methylation)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression have been implicated in the development of human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In this study, we analyzed DNA methylomes (Infinium 450K HumanMethylation BeadChip) and characterize differentially methylated probes between the left and right ventricles

DESIGN
Illumina 450K array and HT-12 v4 array for the left, right ventricles
