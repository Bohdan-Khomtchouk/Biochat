TITLE
Expression profile in Plk1(+/-) aortas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse aortas comparing control wild-type animals with aortas from three different Plk1(+/-) mice. Goal was to determine the effects of Plk1 haploinsufficiency in aorta expression profiles.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Plk1(+/+) vs. Plk1(+/-) aortas. Biological replicates: Pool of three Plk1(+/+) samples, 3 individual Plk1(+/-) samples.
