TITLE
p53 Regulates Enhancer Accessibility and Activity in Response to DNA Damage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The tumor suppressor p53 is a well-characterized transcription factor that can bind gene promoters and regulate target gene transcription in response to DNA damage.  Recent studies, however, have revealed that p53 binding events occur predominantly within regulatory enhancer elements.  The effect of p53 binding on enhancer function has not been systematically evaluated.  Here, we perform a genome-scale analysis of enhancer activity from p53-bound sequences using a series of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) coupled with the assay for transpose-accessible chromatin (ATAC-Seq).  We find that the majority of p53 bound sequences examined are potent regulators of enhancer activity during the DNA damage response.  Enhancer regulation requires the presence of the p53 consensus sequence and results in significant induction of target gene transcription.  Surprisingly, our analyses revealed that most p53-bound enhancers are located within regions of inaccessible chromatin.  Many of these enhancers display significantly increased accessibility in response to DNA damage suggesting that p53 regulates their activity, in part, by altering local chromatin environments.  The recognition and activation of inaccessible enhancers may contribute to the ability of the p53 network to function across the diverse chromatin landscapes of different cell and tissue types.

DESIGN
MPRA (massively parallel reporter assay) and ATAC-Seq (assay for transpose-accessible chromatin) screening enhancer activity from p53 binding sites in cultured human fibroblasts.
