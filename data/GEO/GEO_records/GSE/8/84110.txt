TITLE
The development and growth related transcriptome landscape of ovariectomized goat muscle

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
In this study, ovariectomized and normal ewe longissimus thoracis were used to thoroughly explore the global transcriptome to reveal how the castrated ewes influence muscle development by Illumina2000 sequencing technology. As a result, 1,612 differently expressed unigenes were revealed between ovariectomized and normal ewe groups, which containing 718 up-regulated and 894 down-regulated genes in ovariectomized ewe muscle. Moreover, in the 1,612 unigenes, 903 genes were expressed commonly in the two groups, 288 and 421 genes were uniquely expressed in normal and ovariectomized ewe group, respectively. This study validated some differently expressed genes in samples by quantitative real-time PCR, and the results were consistent with the RNA-seq. Furthermore, this study revealed 24 and 11 differently expressed genes which associated with development and reproduction, respectively. These results were helpful for elucidating the molecular mechanism of muscle development of ovariectomized animal and the application of female castrated on fatting.

DESIGN
Five female hybrid lambs with similar body weight at about 5 months old were randomly divided into treatment group (three lambs) and control group (two lambs). The goats in the treatment group were ovariectomized at the beginning of the experiment and the goats in control group were untreated. All the five goats were slaughtered at the 50th day.Two samples were derived from normal goat muscle and three samples were derived from ovariectomized goat muscle.Then total RNA was extracted from the five samples and sequenced by deep RNA sequencing method
