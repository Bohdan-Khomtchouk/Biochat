TITLE
Genes in apoptosis induced by anisomycin in human leukemia U937 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Anisomycin is known as a potent apoptosis inducer by activating JNK/SAPK and inhibiting protein synthesis during translation. However, only few details are known on the mechanism of apoptosis induced by this compound. Genes in apoptosis induced by anisomycin in human leukemia U937 cells were investigated by using an Affymetrix GeneChip system. DNA fragmentation and phosphatidylserine externalization assays clearly demonstrated that anisomycin induced apoptosis in a time- and concentration- dependent manner. Of 22,283 probe sets analyzed, this compound down-regulated 524 probe sets and up-regulated 523 by a factor 1.5 or greater. Keywords: anisomycin, gene expression, Human lymphoma U937 cell
