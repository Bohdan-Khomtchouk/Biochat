TITLE
Overview of gene expression alternatively modulated during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hES)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptome analysis was performed in triplicate using two human embryonic stem cells lines (hES_VUB01 and hES_SA01) by comparing the expression profiles of the undifferentiated hES cells and two types of progenitors derived from the hES cell lines: Neural progenitors (NPC) and Mesodermal progenitors (MSC). Keywords: Cell type comparison
