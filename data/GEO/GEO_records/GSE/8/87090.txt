TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression by IFN-beta in U6A cells expressing WT or T387A STAT2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used an Illumina Gene Expression Array to understand in more detail how T387 phosphorylation affects ISG induction. mRNA preparations from U6A cells expressing wild-type or T387A STAT2, treated with IFN-β for 0, 4, 8, or 24 h, were analyzed.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from U6A cells expressing wild-type or T387A STAT2, treated with IFN-β for 0, 4, 8, or 24 h
