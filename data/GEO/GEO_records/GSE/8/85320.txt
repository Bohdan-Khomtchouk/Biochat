TITLE
ChIP seq of H3K4me3 and pan-H3  in WT and jhd2Δ Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We describe the landscape of H3K4me3 in WT and jhd2Δ cells in YAR media by ChIP seq

DESIGN
To determine the contribution of Jhd2 to the H3K4me3 landscape in respiring yeast cells, we performed H3K4me3 ChIP and normalized to pan-H3 ChIP signal.
