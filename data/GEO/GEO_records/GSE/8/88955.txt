TITLE
CD74 role in transcription regulation [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD74 activation was previously shown to affect gene transcription. The goal of this study was to research its role as a transcriptor regulator. CD74 was activated in primary CLL cells obtained from patients for 1 h. The cells were then fixed using DSG and formaldhyde, and ChIP-seq was conducted.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq was done for CD74 activated or non activated CLL cells with Ab for CD74 (4 replicates), CD74 activated H3K4Me2 (2 replicates), CD74 non-activated H3K4Me2 (2 replicates), H3K4Me3 (2 replicates), H3K27Ac (2 replicates).
