TITLE
Gene regulation by EZH2 inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our previous study has found that UNC1999 and GSK343 are potent autophagy inducers. To further investigate the underlying mechanisms, microarray analysis was performed.

DESIGN
EZH2 inhibitor-induced gene expression in HCT116 was measured at 4 hours after exposure to 5 uM UNC1999 or 10 uM GSK343.
