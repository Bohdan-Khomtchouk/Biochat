TITLE
Nutritional targeting of the gut microbiota: a novel approach in the management of endothelial dysfunction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice knocked-out or wild type for the apoE gene were recruited for this expression profiling experiment in the cecum. Each group of mice (WT versus cKO) were fed with a n-3 PUFA depleted diet, supplemented or not with prebiotics for the last fifteen days. Then mice were sacrificed and cecal tissues were isolated and processed for RNA extraction. Total RNA of each sample was then pooled with those of the same group and treatment for microarray hybridization.

DESIGN
Two groups of mice: (I) WT DEF and KO DEF. Each group was submitted to a diet treatment: (I) without prebiotics and (ii) without prebiotics
