TITLE
Expression data from mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Livers from 15 month old mice mainatined on one of 25 different diets varying in protein, carbohydrate, fat (P,C,F) and energy content were analysed. Energy content was categorised as low (8kJ/g), medium (13kJ/g) or high (17kJ/g) Mice were placed on diet from 3 weeks of age and a subset culled for various analyses. The rest of the cohort was allowed to live out their natural life to assess lifespan. We used microarrays to details the global programme of gene expression as a result of changes in dietary macronutrient composition and intake.

DESIGN
30 cages of male and female mice per diet were used in this experiment. One mouse from each cage was randomly selected for harvest at 15 months old, while the others were left to age naturally. RNA from mouse livers were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays
