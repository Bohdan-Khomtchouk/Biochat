TITLE
Interferon regulated genes in mouse intestine after irradiation and prophylactic Rig-I activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
As RIG-I activation induces potent IFN-I responses,we analyzed the role of IFN-I in intestinal tissue protection and prevention of GVHD. We performed RNA sequencing with tissue samples from SI of WT mice that received TBI -/+ previous 3pRNA treatment and  -/+ antibody-mediated blockade of IFNAR. Application of 3pRNA before TBI resulted in a significant increase of IFN-inducible genes in the SI as compared to solely irradiated mice. Blockade of IFNAR signaling abrogated 3pRNA-mediated up-regulation of IFN-induced genes, demonstrating that RIG-I-induced gene-regulation depends on IFN-I.

DESIGN
Balb/c mice were solely irradiated (9Gy) (n=3), pretreated with Rig-I agonist 3pRNA prior (d-1) to irradiation (n=3) or pre-treated with 3pRNA (d-1) + anti-IFNaR1 blocking antibody (d-2) prior to irradiation (n=3). RNA from small intestines was isolated 12h after irradiation and used for RNA sequencing.
