TITLE
Expression data from  control and demylination zebrafish at 10dpf

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zebrafish is ideal model organism to study myelination and demyelination. We could use this model to screen demylination relative genes and provide a new idea for clinic therapy. We used microarrays to identify the genes involved in the demyelination of our zebrafish model, and screen alteration gene relative to demylination disease

DESIGN
First, we generated the Tg (mbp:nfsB-egfp) transgenic line using nitroreductase / metronidazole cell ablation technology. Second, we used metronidazole to  treat zebrafsih and contrbuting to demyelination. Third,  Control group and demylination zebrafih were selected at 10 day after fertilization for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. At last, we used microaarray to obtain demyelination disease relative genes.
