TITLE
Regulatory Role of SLFN5 in Type I Interferon Signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We provide evidence that a member of the IFN-regulated member of the Schlafen (SLFN) family of proteins, SLFN5, promotes the malignant phenotype in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).  Our studies demonstrate that SLFN5  negatively regulates  expression of key interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that mediate important biological functions, including anti-viral and antineoplastic responses.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from untreated and IFNβ-treated U87MG SLFN5 WT and U87MG SLFN5 KO human glioblastoma cell lines. Cells were treated for 6 hours with or without mouse IFNβ (5000 IU/ml).
