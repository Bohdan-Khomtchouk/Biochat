TITLE
Profiling of Angiotensin II Rapid Response Genes in Human, Bovine, and Rat Adrenocortical Cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Angiotensin II (Ang-II) regulates adrenal steroid production and gene transcription through several signaling pathways. Changes in gene transcription occur within minutes after Ang-II stimulation, causing an acute increase in aldosterone production and subsequent increase in the overall capacity to produce aldosterone. Our goal was to compare the Ang-II regulation of early gene expression and confirm the upregulation of selected genes using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) across three species: human, bovine, and rat. Keywords: species comparison, adrenal glomerulosa, microarray, angiotensin II
