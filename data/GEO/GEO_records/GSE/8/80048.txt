TITLE
Histone deacetylase inhibition enhances antimicrobial peptide but not inflammatory cytokine expression upon bacterial challenge

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report expression of genes from human Caco-2 cells (subclone TC7) after inhibition of histone deacetylases by trichostatin A, upon an E. coli bacterial challenge

DESIGN
RNAseq on cells pretreated or not with 5 uM TSA and challenged or not for 2 hours with E. coli
