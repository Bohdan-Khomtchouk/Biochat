TITLE
Nfib promotes Metastasis through a Widespread Increase in Chromatin Accessibility [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We describe Nfib as an important regulator of chromatin accessibility in SCLC.

DESIGN
We performed ChIP seq for Nfib in three different cell lines. Replicates of input and pulldowns for three cell lines is given.
