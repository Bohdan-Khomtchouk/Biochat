TITLE
Respiratory burst oxidase homologues D and F in catalase2 deficient plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can act as a signaling molecule that influences various aspects of plant growth and development, including stress signaling and cell death. Catalase deficient plants are pioneering systems which accumulate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from peroxisomal origin during photorespiratory challenges. Respiratory burst oxidase homologues D and F are known to participate in intracellular oxidative stress response launched in cat2 mutants (Chaouch et al., 2012). We studied the compared the transcriptional response of cat2 rbohD and cat2 rbohF double mutants versus the cat2 background to further adress their role during photorespiratory stress.

DESIGN
After 3 weeks of growth, leaf tissue from the three different genotypes was harvested in triplicate.
