TITLE
Neuronal activity modifies the chromatin accessibility landscape in the adult brain (ATAC-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated the chromatin accessibility profiling datasets from adult mouse dentate gyrus upon neuronal activation at 3 different time points

DESIGN
Examination of chromatin accessibility changes in mouse dentate gyrus upon neuronal activation
