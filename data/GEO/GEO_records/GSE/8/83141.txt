TITLE
Lead Modulates trans- and cis-eQTLs in Drosophila melanogaster Heads

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The goal was to study the effects of lead exposure on gene expression and identify the lead-responsive genes. After detecting 1,536 cis-eQTLs (FDR ≤ 10%) and 952 trans-eQTLs, we focused our analysis on Pb-sensitive “trans-eQTL hotspots”.

DESIGN
158 randomly selected Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (A2) samples (control 79 samples and Pb-treated) without replicates
