TITLE
Expression data from LPS/IFNgamma-treated Tet2-/- and Tet2+/+ mouse macrophages.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the effect of ablation of Tet2, an epigenetic regulator of gene transcription, in the global programme of gene expression underlying pro-inflammatory activation of macrophage.

DESIGN
Thioglycllate-elicted macrophages were isolated from the Tet2 -/- mice and their wildtype littermates (N=3/group), treated with LPS and IFNg for 10 hours, and isolated for total RNA. Whole-genome transcript profiling was performed using Affymetrix microarray to identify genes that were dysregulated due to Tet2 ablation under the inflammation stimuli.
