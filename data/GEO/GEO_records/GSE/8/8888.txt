SUMMARY
VEGF165 is one of the key regulators of tumor development. Using HCT116 cells transfected with full-length vegf mRNA, full-length vegf mRNA with mutations of H9D and L14E, mutated vegf mRNAs lacking untranslated regions (UTRs), and 5’UTR mutated between nt 591 and nt 746, we found that vegf 5’UTR resided an anti-apoptotic activity against chemotherapy independently of VEGF165. We next established HCT116 clones stably expressing vegf 5’UTR or the mutated vegf 5’UTR. The cells expressing 5’UTR, but not the mutated UTR, showed the drug-resistant phenotype, anchorage-independent growth, and rapid tumor growth when implanted in athymic nude mice. Microarray and real-time PCR showed that the vegf 5’UTR-expressing tumors up-regulated anti-apoptotic genes including mia and down-regulated pro-apoptotic genes including fas, pdcd1, nrg1, and bax. Microarray analysis also revealed specific down-regulation of IFN-inducible genes (43 genes) in the growing tumors. HCT116 cells stably transcribing vegf 5’UTR decreased STAT1 expression and IFN alpha-STAT1 pathway. In addition to 5-fluorouracil treatment, the vegf 5’UTR-expressing tumors did not respond to IFN alpha therapy at all. This novel tumor-promoting function in the vegf 5’UTR may partly explain the insufficiency of the VEGF-VEGFR strategies and suggest a vegf-targeted silencing strategy as a more effective anti-tumor therapy.
