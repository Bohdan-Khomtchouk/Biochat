TITLE
Expression data of normal and under developed testes obtained from sexually mature rats.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Zucker (fa/fa) obese rats often have non-identical and different sized paired testes, leaving one testis underdeveloped. Our earlier study found that the underdeveloped testes have a selective decrease in docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, C22:5n-6), a dominant fatty acid in the testes

DESIGN
Normal and under developed testes were collected from zuker rats, RNA isolated and gene expression was studied.
