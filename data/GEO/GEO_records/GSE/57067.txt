TITLE
Role of Fun30 remodelers in retrotransposon regulation [MNase-Seq]

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Retrotransposable elements are genomic parasites that are both key drivers of evolution and the ancestors of retroviruses. Although host cells have developed numerous mechanisms to keep these elements in check, there is also evidence from yeast to mammals that stressed cells sometimes activate transposition.   Here we show that the fission yeast tf2 retrotransposons are regulated by alternative transcription start site (TSS) usage. Which TSS is used is determined by nucleosome positioning, which is in turn controlled by the Fun30 chromatin remodelers Fft2 and Fft3. By maintaining a high level of nucleosome occupancy at retrotransposon-flanking Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) elements, Fft2 and Fft3 promote the use of a downstream TSS and the production of RNA incapable of reverse transcription and retrotransposition. More generally, we show that Fft2 and Fft3 are involved in repressing the transcriptional response to stress, of which retrotransposon activation is a part. Finally, we show that in stressed cells retrotransposon TSS usage switches, allowing the production of full-length retrotransposon RNA. We propose that allowing retrotransposon transcription from a nonproductive TSS allows for the rapid activation of these elements in times of stress, while preventing their uncontrolled proliferation in the genome.

DESIGN
For MNase samples, duplicate mutant mononucleosome fractions were compared with duplicate WT mononucleosomes
