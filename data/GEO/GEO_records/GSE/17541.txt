TITLE
Role of MicroRNA-214 in Ginsenoside-Rg1-induced Angiogenesis

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that act as post-transcriptional gene modulators. Ginsenoside-Rg1, one of the active components of ginseng, has been confirmed by us as an angiogenesis inducer. Using miRNA microarray analysis, a total of 15 (including miR-214) and 3 miRNAs were found to be down- or up-regulated by Rg1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), respectively. Since miR-214 is closely related to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and hence angiogenesis; its expression was further validated by qRT-PCR. We also investigated the role of miR-214 on eNOS expression and in tubulogenesis of HUVEC by transfection of specific miRNA inhibitor or precursor. Our results suggested that Rg1 can down-regulate miR-214 expression in HUVEC, leading to an increase in eNOS expression which can promote angiogenesis. This result signifies a new understanding towards how a simple natural compound can affect physiological changes through modulation of miRNA expression.
