TITLE
Atac-seq of 2.5 hpf zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Here we analyze the genome-wide accessability during zebrafish embryogenesis before zygotice genome activation 2.5 hours post fertilization

DESIGN
Atac-seq to generate genome wide accessibility data pre ZGA zebrafish development at 2.5 hpf, including two biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL20828 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Danio rerio)
