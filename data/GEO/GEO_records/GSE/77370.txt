TITLE
Negative control of CSL gene transcription by stress/DNA damage response and p53 [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CSL is a key transcription factor, mostly acting as a repressor. While known as main effector of Notch signaling, it can also play Notch-independent functions. Despite the wide interest in CSL, the mechanisms responsible for its own regulation have been little studied. We recently showed that CSL down-modulation in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) leads to conversion into cancer associated fibroblasts, which promote keratinocyte tumor development. We show here that levels of CSL gene transcription differ among HDF strains derived from many different individuals, with negative correlation with genes involved in DNA damage/repair. CSL expression in all tested strains is negatively regulated by stress / DNA damaging insults caused by UVA, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), smoke extract and doxorubicin treatment. p53, a key effector of the DNA damage response, functions as common negative regulator of CSL gene transcription, through both suppression of CSL promoter activity and, indirectly, through increased p21 expression. CSL was previously shown to bind p53 suppressing its activity. The present findings indicate that p53, in turn, decreases CSL expression, which can serve to enhance p53 activity in the acute response of cells to DNA damaging cancer-threatening conditions.
