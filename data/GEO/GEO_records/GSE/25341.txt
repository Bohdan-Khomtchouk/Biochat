TITLE
Accurate inference of transcription factor binding  from DNA sequence and chromatin accessibility data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Accurate functional annotation of regulatory elements is essential for understanding global gene regulation. Here, we report a genome-wide map of 827,000 transcription factor binding sites in human lymphoblastoid cell lines, which is comprised of sites correspond-ing to 239 position weight matrices of known transcription factor binding motifs, and 49 novel sequence motifs. To generate this map, we developed a probabilistic framework that integrates cell- or tissue-speciﬁc experimental data such as histone modiﬁcations and DNa-seI cleavage patterns with genomic information such as gene annotation and evolutionary conservation. Comparison to empirical ChIP-seq data suggests that our method is highly accurate yet has the advantage of targeting many factors in a single assay. We anticipate that this approach will be a valuable tool for genome-wide studies of gene regulation in a wide variety of cell-types or tissues under diverse conditions.
