TITLE
Toxicogenomics and phenotypic characterization of adult male zebrafish liver treated with cadmium (II)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We performed microarray-based expression profiling on liver of male zebrafish exposed to 30 Âµg/L of cadmium (II) chloride for 8-96 h, to identify global transcriptional programs and biological pathways involved in cadmium-induced adaptive responses under in vivo environment.

DESIGN
We analyzed 10 arrays of Cadmium-treated adult male zebrafish liver and 12 arrays of control fish.
