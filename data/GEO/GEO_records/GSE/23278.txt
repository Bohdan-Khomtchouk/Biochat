TITLE
embryo A-class motor neurons tiling array

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_654 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Robert Waterston. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: Our experiments are designed to detect all C. elegans transcripts by hybridizing RNA to commerically available genome tiling arrays. To maximize the chances of detecting rare transcripts with limited expression in specific cells, we are extracting RNA from selected embryonic cells isolated by FACS and from postembryonic cells by use of the mRNA tagging method. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf Keywords: Transcript tiling array analysis
