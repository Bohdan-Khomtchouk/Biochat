TITLE
Rpph1 regulated Cdc42 and modulated hippocampal pyramidal neurons by competing endogenous miR-330-5p

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To build up competing endogenous RNA regulatory network based on APP/PS1 transgenic mice model and verify Rpph1, miR-330-5p and Cdc42 interaction

DESIGN
Cortex samples were isolated from two pairs of APP/PS1 transgenic mice and wild type mice control
