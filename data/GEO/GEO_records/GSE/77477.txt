TITLE
Divisional History Identifies Differential Precursor Contributions in Native and Perturbed Hematopoiesis and Reveals Functionally Distinct Stem Cell Subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To uphold appropriate homeostasis of short-lived blood cells, immature blood cells need to proliferate vigorously. Here, using a conditional H2B-mCherry labeling mouse-model, we characterize hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and progenitor proliferation dynamics in steady state, upon physiological aging and following several types of induced stress. Following transplantation, HSCs shifted towards higher degrees of proliferation that was sustained long-term. HSCs were, by contrast, poorly recruited into proliferation following cytokine-induced mobilization and after acute depletions of selected blood cell lineages. Using indexed single cell sorting coupled to multiplex gene expression analyses, proliferation history separated candidate HSCs into units with distinct molecular and functional attributes. Our data thereby highlight that HSC proliferation following transplantation is fundamentally different not only from native hematopoiesis but also from other stress contexts, and demonstrate the power of divisional history as a functional criterion to resolve HSC heterogeneity.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling of mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Four 96-well plates with pre-amplified single HSC bone marrow cell cDNA (with no template controls) were loaded on to a 96.96 Dynamic Array Chip for Gene Expression. Samples Ids follow where 2w or 5w denotes weeks chase before HSC isolation, and P < X > denoted the plate. No cell was sorted into 2 wells on each plate were = No template controls.
