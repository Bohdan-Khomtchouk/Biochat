TITLE
Expression profiling of the effect of treatment with GNF-7 on mutant NRAS-positive leukemia cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The complexity of RAS signaling makes targeting RAS challenging. We therefore hypothesized that inhibiting a combination of downstream targets of RAS may potentially lead to an effective therapeutic intervention. We performed a high-throughput chemical screen using a library consisting of multi-targeted inhibitors with the expectation that one or more inhibitors would likely- due to their broad spectrum inhibitory potential- hit critical targets of mutant NRAS. We identified GNF-7, a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor that proved to have high selectivity and sensitivity for leukemia cells with NRAS mutations both in vitro and in vivo. We used microarrays to determine which transcripts were affected by treatment with GNF-7. We selected a single comparative timepoint, 8 hours post-treatment with GNF-7. GSEA (gene set enrichment analysis) was performed using gene signatures in MSigDB (Molecular Signatures Database) for analysis. This led to the identification of MYC-network genes as being the downstream conduit of the effect of this treatment. We also found that treatment with GNF-7 abolished

DESIGN
OCI-AML3 cells and KO52 cells were treated with 1.0μM of GNF-7 for 8 hrs in biologic triplicates.  RNA of cells before and after the treatment was then extracted for global transcriptional profiling using HuGene 1.0 ST chip.
