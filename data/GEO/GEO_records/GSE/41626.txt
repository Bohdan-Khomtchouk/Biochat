TITLE
The rsa3-1 mutation affects global gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana under salt stress.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Salt stress is one of the most severe environmental conditions which cause huge losses in crop production worldwide. We identified an essential regulator of salt stress RSA3 and used the Affymetrix whole-genome arrays to study the effect of rsa3-1 mutation on global gene expression under salt stress. A set of genes differentially expressed in rsa3-1 under salt stress are identified.

DESIGN
Six-day-old seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (Columbia gl1 expressing RD29A::LUC transgene) and rsa3-1 mutant seedlings subjected to salt stress at 120 mM NaCl for 24 h were used for total RNA extraction and hybridizations with Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips. There are two biological replicates per genotype.
