TITLE
Identification of novel long non-coding RNAs as biomarker for patients with renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) play an important role in carcinogenesis, but knowledge  of lncRNA expression in renal cell carcinoma is rudimental. We screened 32,183 lncRNA transcripts in malignant and adjacent normal renal tissue and determined dysregulation of approximately 4% of the lncRNA transcripts in clear cell renal cell carcinoma tissue. The distinct changes of lncRNA expression may be used to develop a non-invasive biomarker, because lncRNAs are detectable in bodily fluids.

DESIGN
Microarray experiments were performed to determine the expression of 32,183 lncRNA transcripts belonging to 17,512 lncRNAs in 15 corresponding normal and malignant renal tissues
