TITLE
Methylomic analysis identifies epigenetically silenced genes and implies an activation of β-catenin signal in cervical cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the pools of DNA from squamous cervical carcinomas (SCC) and DNA from normal scraping cells discovered the abnormal changes of genomic wide methylation  by methylation BeadChip. The 61 genes were selected to validate by quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) and bisulfite pyrosequencing in further processes. A CpG islands methylator phenotype (CIMP) was confirmed at 14 candidates in an independent set contained a spectrum of scraping cells form abnormal cervical lesions. In addition, we found among of 7 genes were announced to imply to potentially biological functions of β-catenin signal.

DESIGN
A pool DNA collected from equal amount of DNA of 38 SCC, and the other pool collected from equal amount of DNA of 19 normal cervical scraping cells. Based on 40 percent of different methylation in two pools of samples, we selected 91 genes  showed abnormal methylation in SCC. After the confirmation of gene restored expression in cervical cell lines, there 61 genes showed upregulation in the treatment with demethylating drug.  In addition, gel based of MSP were contributed to confirm in a small size of samples, and quantitative MSP was contributed to validated in an independent set. The methylation status of qMSP was also confirmed by bisulfite pyrosequence. Finally, we selected 14 genes demonstrated clinical relevance in the high methylation of CIMP associated to a risk factor in  cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) and worse lesions. isk factor in  cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) and worse lesions.
