TITLE
Analysis of gene expression changes in KPT-185-treated HMLE cells transduced to stably overexpress SNAI1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HMLE-SNAIL cell cultures were  treated with KPT-185 drug (KPT, 150 nanomolar) or vehicle (DMSO) for 24 hours, in parallel quadruplicates. KPT-185 is an Exportin 1 (XPO1) inhibitor with possible pluripotent or unexpected effects on cell signaling. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed in an Agilent two-color experiment, where four biological replicates of each condition were directly compared, expression ratios are KPT-treated condition relative to control (DMSO vehicle-treated).

DESIGN
The experiment object was to identify genes that displayed significantly altered expression in response to KPT treatment inorder to confirm on-target drug impact and elucidate other potential effects in this cell line model.
