TITLE
KMT2D regulates p63 target enhancers to coordinate epithelial homeostasis [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KMT2D plays a critical role in the control of epithelial enhancers and p63 target gene expression, including the re-quirement of KMT2D for the maintenance of epithelial progenitor gene expression and the coordination of proper terminal differentiation.

DESIGN
Determination of gene expression changes in keratinocytes with depletion of KMT2D by shRNA (shKMT2D)

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
