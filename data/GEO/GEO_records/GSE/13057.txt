TITLE
In vivo transcriptome of Listeria monocytogenes EGDe

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Time course study of the mouse infection by comparing the genomic transcriptional patterns of Listeria monocytogenes EGDe grown under laboratory conditions (exponential growth phase) with that of in vivo-grown bacteria (in mouse spleens) over three days of infection.
