TITLE
Gefitinib sensitivity in NSCLC cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Eleven NSCLC cell lines with widely divergent gefitinib sensitivities were compared using gene expression.  Genes associated with gefitinib response were used to classify additional NSCLC lines with unknown gefitnib sensitivity. A subset of the test set data was tested for gefitinib sensitivity, and results correlated strongly with the gene expression-based predictions All eleven training set lines, and seven test set lines had both HGU133A and B chips done, while other test set lines had only HGU133As. Keywords: cell response comparison

DESIGN
Baseline (unstimulated) gene expression was measured in a large panel of NSCLC cell lines
