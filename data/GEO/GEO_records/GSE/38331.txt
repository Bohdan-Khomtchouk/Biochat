TITLE
miRNA Expression in AMuLV Cell Lines upon STI571 Treatment

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We conducted a screen for miRNAs that have a change in expression upon STI571 treatment of AMuLV pro-B cells. We used AMuLV pro-B cells as a model system to identify miRNAs important at the pro-B to pre-B transition in developing B cells in vivo.  Previous groups have shown that miRNAs are necessary for the pro-B to pre-B transition.  We hypothesize that specific miRNAs induced upon STI571 treatment, regulate important developmental programs and pathways to the pre-B stage of B cell development.
