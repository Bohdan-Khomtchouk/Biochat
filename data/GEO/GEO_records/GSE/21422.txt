TITLE
Expression profiling of human DCIS and invasive ductal breast carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human healthy tissue samples, DCIS and invasive mammary tumors were analyzed in order to identify marker genes which show enhanced expresssion in DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas. Using this approach, we were able to identify a set of genes which might allow a better detection of DCIS and invasive carcinomas in the future.

DESIGN
5 healthy tissue samples, 9 DCIS and 5 invasive ductal carcinomas were analysed.
