TITLE
Genome wide profiling of RNA Pol II and CSB in CS1AN cells or wild type CSB reconstituted cells [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report how CSB affects globally the density of RNA Pol II at TSS and how this effect correlates with the gene expression alterations observed from microarray analysis. We also show globally the distribution of CSB.

DESIGN
RNA Pol II and CSB ChIP-Seq in CS1AN cells and CSB reconstituted wild type cells, in duplicate, using Illumina GAIIx

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
