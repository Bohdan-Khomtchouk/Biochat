TITLE
Effect of Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation on Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients undergoing pancreatic resection at William Beaumont Hospital (Royal Oak, MI) were consented prior to surgery with local IRB oversight. Samples were collected at time of surgery and stored at -80°C according to CAP (College of American Pathologist)-accredited standard operating procedures. Disease pathology of frozen samples was validated with hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue sections from adjacently collected formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue. The objective of this study was to examine the gene expression patterns of pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy compared to pancreatic adenocarcinoma that had not under gone neoadjuvant treatment. The results of this study demonstrate that neoadjuvant therapy alters the gene expression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma

DESIGN
Samples from patients that receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation before surgery (n=6) were compared to samples from patients that did not receive any treatment prior to surgery (n=10). Additional comparisons to adjacent “normal” tissue were also made (n=10).
