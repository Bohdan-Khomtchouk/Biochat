TITLE
Combinatorial transcriptional regulation modulates cytoskeletal-mediated dendritic arbor development

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transcription factors (TFs) have emerged as essential cell autonomous mediators of sub­type specific dendritogenesis, however, the downstream effectors of these TFs remain largely unknown, as are the cellular events that TFs control to direct morphological change. As dendritic morphology is largely dictated by the organization of the actin and microtubule (MT) cytoskeletons, elucidating TF­mediated cytoskeletal regulatory programs is key to understanding molecular control of diverse dendritic morphologies. Previous studies in Drosophila melanogaster have demonstrated that the conserved TFs Cut and Knot exert combinatorial control over aspects of dendritic cytoskeleton development, promoting actin­ and MT­based arbor morphology, respectively. To investigate transcriptional targets of Cut and/or Knot regulation, we conducted systematic neurogenomic studies, coupled with in vivo genetic screens utilizing multi-fluor cytoskeletal and membrane marker reporters. These analyses identified a host of putative Cut and/or Knot effector molecules and a subset of these putative TF targets converge on modulating dendritic cytoskeletal architecture and are grouped into three major phenotypic categories, based upon neuromorphometric analyses:¬¬ complexity enhancer, complexity shifter, and complexity suppressor. Complexity enhancer genes normally function to promote higher order dendritic growth and branching with variable effects on MT stabilization and F-actin organization, whereas complexity shifter and complexity suppressor genes normally function in regulating proximal-distal branching distribution or in restricting higher order branching complexity, respectively, with spatially restricted impacts on the dendritic cytoskeleton. Collectively, we implicate novel genes and cellular programs by which TFs distinctly and combinatorially govern dendritogenesis via cytoskeletal modulation.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of control Class I da neurons, Class I da neurons overexpressing Cut (Class I X Cut) or Class I da neurons overexpressing Knot (Class I X Knot), isolated via magnetic bead sorting (using protocols as described in Iyer et al., 2009), was performed at the third instar larval stage of development from independent cell isolations from 40-50 age-matched third instar larvae expressing mCD8::GFP under the control of either GAL4221 driver, in the presence or absence of UAS-Cut (UAS-Cut;Gal4221) or UAS-Knot (UAS-Knot;Gal4221).
