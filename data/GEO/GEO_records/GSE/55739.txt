TITLE
A microRNA driven epithelial differentiation model: primary culture and long-term expansion of intestinal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In this study, we put specific efforts in the development of primary intestinal colonic cells (CEC) in monolayer culture that can be expanded to phenotypically uniform and stable, finite cell lines. Morphological assessment showed that limited passaging had no obvious effect on phenotype and proliferation of CEC. For a fundamental verification of this observation we performed a whole transcriptome microarray study using isolates from 2 different animals and CEC culture passages 1 to 4. Data analysis did not reveal any effect of subcultivation on the global gene expression. When comparing the two different isolates, interindividual effects on expression profiles were not observed. Functional annotation of the genes showing robust expression in cell culture (log ratios â‰¥ 0, compared with native tissue) pointed to a high metabolic activity, migratory capacity and a stable degree of mesenchymal marker expression and supporting the crypt-like character.

DESIGN
Intestinal epithelial cells (passage 1-4) originally isolated from ascending colon of 2 individual piglets were cultivated in 25 cm2 cell culture flasks until confluence. Additionally original colon tissues were used as the common reference. Number of samples: 8 samples plus 1 common reference; 2 merged replicate microarrays for CEC#11P2 sample; Reference sample: RNA from pooled whole tissue samples from ascending colon; Dye Swaps: none
