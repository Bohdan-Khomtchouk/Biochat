TITLE
Effect of prenatal ischemia on gene expression in the mouse cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine whether preterm brain injury affects brain development, we produced ischemic brain damage in mouse embryos by occluding the maternal uterine arteries at embryonic day (E) 16.5. Then gene expression analysis was conducted using cortices from ischemic or control mice at postnatal day (P) 1.5. Results show influence of embryonic ischemia on the gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
Gene expression levels in the P1.5 cortices were measured for the control or ischemic pups in which ischemia had been induced by maternal uterine artery occlusion at E16.5. Four mice in each group were analyzed.
