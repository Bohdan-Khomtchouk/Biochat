TITLE
RNA-Seq-mediated transcriptome analysis of Staphylococcus aureus Newman wild-type, walKD119A, walKV149A and DHBP-treated wild-type strains

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus str. Newman

SUMMARY
We reported the RNA-Seq results of  Staphylococcus aureus Newman wild-type, walKD119A, walKV149A and DHBP-treated wild-type strains. We found that mutations of the potential signal transduction residues of WalK attenuate the activity of walKR two-component system, whereas DHBP supplementation activates this two-component system.

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptome changes in the mutant and drug-treatment strains.
