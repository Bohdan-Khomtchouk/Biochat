TITLE
Effectes of temperatures on meiotic recombination in S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Temperature is key for biological activities, but its role in meiotic recombination processes is less known. Here, we uncovered the patterns of meiotic recombination by monitoring the genotypes of diploid strain JSC22-1-derived spores formed at 14ºC, 30ºC, and 37ºC. These spores were analyzed by whole genome SNP microarray that can examine about 13,000 SNPs distinguishing W303-1A and YJM789 sequences throughout the genome.

DESIGN
Using whole genome SNP microarray, we examined crosssovers and non-crossover gene conversion from all four products of 21 S. cerevisiae meioses at different temperatures. 11 were from 30-degree, 5 were from 14-degree, and the other 5 were from 37-degree.
