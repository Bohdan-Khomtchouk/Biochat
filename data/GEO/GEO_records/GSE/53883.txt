TITLE
Bacteroides fragilis in vivo gene expression

ORGANISM
Bacteroides fragilis 638R

SUMMARY
Compare BF638R gene expression during growth in vivo in a rat tissue cage/artificial abscess model, to cells grown in vitro in minimal defined media with either glucose or mucin glycans as sole carbon/energy source

DESIGN
11 chip study with 8 technical replicates on each chip comparing gene expression in vivo in a rat tissue cage model over an 8 day period to in vitro cultures grown to mid-log phase in defined media

PLATFORM
