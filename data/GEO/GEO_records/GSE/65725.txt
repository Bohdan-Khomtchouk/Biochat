TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Foxi3 deficient embryonic molar tooth epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Foxi3 is a transcription factor expressed in the epithelium during tooth development. In this study we used a microarray analysis to indentify differentially expressed genes in bud stage (E13.5 ) mandibular molar epithelium of conditional Foxi3 knock-out embryos compared to control littermates.

DESIGN
Dispase-dissociated molar epithelia of 5 conditional Foxi3 knock-out (K14-cre43;Foxi3-/floxed) or wild-type E13.5 mouse embryos were pooled together and altogether 4 biologial replicates of both genotypes were analyzed. Array and data analysis were performed in the Biomedicum Functional Genomics Unit (University of Helsinki, Finland).
