TITLE
Escherichia coli planktonic cultures: mono-species culture vs. mixed-species culture

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Transcription profile of Escherichia coli cells in mono-species pure planktonic cultures was compared to that of E. coli cells in E. coli-Stenotrophomonas maltophilia dual-species planktonic cultures E. coli cells were separated from dual-species planktonic cultures before total RNA extraction to eliminate possible cross hybridization from S. maltophilia transcripts. The separation method was developed by combining the use of reagent RNAlater and immuno-magnetic separation. Pure E. coli planktonic cultures were processed with the same separation protocol before RNA extraction.

DESIGN
Two condition experiments: E. coli mono-species pure planktonic culture vs E. coli in mixed-species planktonic cultures. Two biological replicates with independently grown and harvested planktonic cultures. Each biological replicate has two technical replicates of hybridization on microarray slides. Each slide has three built-in replicates for each probe.

PLATFORM
GPL11108 University of Alberta Escherichia coli 19K v2.0
