TITLE
Skeletal muscle of adrenalectomized mice with and without a glucocorticoid injection 3 or 24 h previously (MG-U74Av2)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Forty male C57BL6 mice 12-15 weeks old fed chow ad libitum. 30 mice underwent adrenalectomy (Adx) and 10 others a sham-Adx. Three or 24h before tissue sampling, groups of 10 mice received an I.P. injection of cortisol (0.1 mg per mice), while the remaining Adx and intact mice received an I.P. injection of the vehicle (ethanol) 24 h prior to the sacrifice. All mice were killed within a period of a few hours. Gastrocnemius muscle were dissected and pooled together for each one of the four groups. Total RNA was isolated by Trizol. Samples were processed following the labeling protocol from Affymetrix. In the MG-U74A2, each of the 12488 murine transcripts are represented by 16 probe pairs of 25mer. Images were scanned using a GeneChip scanner 3000 with autoloader, and analyzed with the MAS 5.0 software (Affymetrix). The ratio of fluorescence intensities for the 5' end and the 3' end of beta-actin and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was less than 2. This microarray analysis was performed once.
