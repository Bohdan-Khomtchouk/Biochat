TITLE
CBP60g and CBP60h play partially redundant and critical roles in salicylic acid signaling

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Our previous study on CBP60g, a calmodulin binding protein that is important for disease resistance and microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-induced SA accumulation, led to our discovery of a closely related family member CBP60h. CBP60h is also important for defense against P. syringae but is induced differently by pathogen and MAMP stimulus. Transcriptome profiling of cbp60h mutants suggested that CBP60h might be primarily functioning in response against P. syringae. We constructed a double mutant of cbp60g and cbp60h, which demonstrated severely defective defense against P. syringae and SA accumulation. Profiling of the cbp60g/h showed that its expression pattern is very similar to that of pad4. Transient expression in Tobacco showed that both CBP60g and CBP60h localized to nucleus. Our observation suggest that CBP60g and CBP60h share partially redundant but critical role in defense response and SA signaling.

DESIGN
This experiment consists of three biological replicates. For each genotype, two leaves per plant were pooled from three pots to prepare total RNA.
