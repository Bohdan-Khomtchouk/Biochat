TITLE
Mapping of H3, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac on Ring and Schizont stages of P. falciparum

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Epigenome profiling has led to the paradigm that promoters of active genes are decorated with H3K4me3 and H3K9ac marks. These data on synchronized parasites reveals significant developmental stage specificity of the epigenome. In rings, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac are homogenous across the genes marking active and inactive genes equally, whilst in schizonts they are enriched at the 5â€™end of active genes.

DESIGN
Chip-chip (and cDNA) from Plasmodium falciparum strain NF54 Rings and Schizonts with H3, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac.
