TITLE
Initial Gene Epxression Responses to Bleomycin Treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand initial gene expression responses in confluent human fibroblasts to different bleomycin drug doses and their potential effects on later cellular events.

DESIGN
Confluent human fibroblasts AG01522 were treated with 0.1, 1.0 and 10 microgram/ml of bleomycin for 3 hours. Duplicate treatments were done.
