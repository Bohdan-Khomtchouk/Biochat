TITLE
A new look at adenovirus splicing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adenovirus type 2 RNA splicing sites were mapped by using deep cDNA sequencing. The majority of the previously identified splice sites were detected. In addition, novel splicing sites were identified

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from four time stages of human primary lung fibroblast cells IMR-90 infected by adenovirus type 2 compared to the control mock-infected by adenovirus type 2.
