TITLE
Double-tiled DNA microarrays -- proof of principle

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We have developed a double-tiling method that effectively doubles the number of sequences on a microarray, and with these arrays we confirm that our design can be utilized quickly and easily. Keywords: testing novel microarray design

DESIGN
GPL4107 is a double-tiled array, and GPL4111 is a conventional array. Both contain the entire yeast genome at approximately 150 and 280 bp resolution, respectively. Our proof-of-principle experiments were done with plasmids; we subsequently performed a more complex experiment (comparing galactose vs glucose-grown yeast) on both the double-tiled arrays and on the conventional array (for use as a standard).
