TITLE
Gene expression of FACC canine cancer cell line panel (Affymetrix Canine 2.0 array)

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Cancer cell line panels that incorporate genomic and pharmacologic screening data have become powerful tools for investigating the relationship between gene expression and drug response in human cancer research.  Similar cell line panels of such a scale as the NCI60, CCLE, or GDSC do not currently exist in canine cancer research.  Here we have assembled a canine cancer cell line panel of 29 cell lines representing multiple tumor types that have undergone gene expression profiling and have begun to be used for pharmacologic screening.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from drug na√Øve canine cancer cell lines and subjected to microarray analysis.
