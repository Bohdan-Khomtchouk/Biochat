TITLE
Very deep small RNA sequencing of whole rat medial entorhinal cortex

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We performed very deep small RNA sequencing on one sample of medial entorhinal cortex of a Long Evans rat aged P23 to see which small RNAs could be detected in this brain area.

DESIGN
Small RNA sequencing of medial entorhinal cortex of one rat on one lane of the Illumina HiSeq2000
