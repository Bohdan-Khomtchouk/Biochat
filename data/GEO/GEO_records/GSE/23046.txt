TITLE
affy_dormance_totalrna_sunflower-Molecular mechanisms of seed dormancy release: transcriptome evolution and ROS signalling during sunflower seed after-ripening.

ORGANISM
Helianthus annuus

SUMMARY
affy_dormance_sunflower - affy_dormance_totalrna_sunflower - We focus our research on the release of embryonic dormancy in sunflower seeds and more precisely on the molecular mechanisms controlling seed dormancy release during dry after-ripening. Our data show an increase of ROS during dormancy release associated with an increase of stored mRNA oxidation during after-ripening as shown with determination of the RNA oxidation marker : 8-hydroxyguanosine (8OHG) To assess to role of mRNA oxidation in this process, we isolated 8OHG-containing mRNA to identify oxidized transcript using microarray analysis.-The samples compared are the following:  1) Population of 50 embryonic axis from dry dormant seed (D) ie. Seed which have been frozen at -30Â°C after harvest to keep dormancy  2) Population of 50 embryonic axis from dry non dormant ie. Seeds which have been after-ripened (stored) at 70% RH during 2 month.  3) Embryonic axis from dry dormant seed but after ripened at very low relative humidity (2% RH) (control of storage: S). Replicates correspond to different batches of seeds from the same harvest which have been treated (after ripened) independently. - We want to compare D vs ND; D vs S and ND vs S.

DESIGN
6 arrays - SUNFLOWER; dormant vs non dormant seed embryo
