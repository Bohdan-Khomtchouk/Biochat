TITLE
Microarray data of benzo[a]pyrene-treated WHCO1 vs EPC-2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this project was to investigate the differential effects of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) treatment on global gene transcription, comparing normal (EPC-2) and cancer (WHCO1) cell lines from the oesophagus, in order to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of BaP-induced development and maintenance of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

DESIGN
Two cell lines (WHCO1, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and EPC2-hTERT, telomerase-immortalized normal esophageal cell line) were used. For both cell lines total RNA was extracted from a vehicle control (Untreated) and treatment with 10 uM benzo[a]pyrene after 24 hours treatment, with biological repeat duplicate samples for each treatment. 8 samples in total
