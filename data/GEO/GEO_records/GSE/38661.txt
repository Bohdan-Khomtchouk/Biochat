TITLE
Fis occupancy along the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 fis::3XFlag strain grown in different aeration regimes.

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
The regulatory role of the Fis protein in fis and in the transcription of several gene regions during mid-exponential and late-stationary phase, and during different growth aeration regimes, has been investigated. Studies were done during those two growth phases and in aerated and non-aerated (microaerobic) conditions, to measure Fis enrichment and binding peaks in strategic gene regions by genome-wide microarray analysis ChIP-chip. This research investigation points to central roles for SPI-1, SPI-2, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase I, the elements of the stringent response, and the regulatory function of Fis-binding patterns, in setting and re-setting the activity of the fis gene and other involved promoters as a function of the growth conditions and aeration regimes experienced by Salmonella.
