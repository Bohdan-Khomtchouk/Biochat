TITLE
Transcriptome characterization of the mouse Lgr5+_MaSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lgr5 positive and negative MaSC enriched P4 subpopulation were isolated from virgin Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 mice. The transcriptome profiles of the cells are compared to elucidate the molecular mechanism Lgr5+_MaSCs as a more defined MaSCs subpopulation within the P4 (MaSC and basal progenitor enriched popuation).

DESIGN
Pair of MaSC samples: Lgr5 positive vs negative
