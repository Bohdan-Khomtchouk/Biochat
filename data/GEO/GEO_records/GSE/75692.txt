TITLE
The role of unliganded thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) in human adipose derived stem cells (hADSC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of change in transcriptosome after TRα or TRβ knockdown in hADSC. Analysis of effects of siRNA transfection (siCtrl, siTRα, siTRβ or siETV5) in hADSC at gene expression level.The hypothesis tested in the present study was that unliganded TRα and TRβ have distinctive roles in these cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from hADSC, transfected with siCtrl,  siTRα, siTRβ or ETV5. siTRα, siTRβ or siETV5 samples were compared to  siCtrl samples.
