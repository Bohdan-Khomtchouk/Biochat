TITLE
Genomic DNA 1:1 mixtures in Allele Specific Expression study

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Genomic DNA of Col-0 and Van-0 were mixed at 1:1 and labeled using Bioprime randon labeling kit. A total of 16ug labelled products were hybridized to AtSNPtile1. Used as the reference of equal allele expression.

DESIGN
Col and Van genomic DNA were mixed at 1:1 with four biological replicates. Single chanel. Total 4 samples.
