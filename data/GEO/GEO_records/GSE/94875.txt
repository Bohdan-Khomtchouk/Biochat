TITLE
Transcriptional profile of E2 response of CD-1 mouse uterus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional responses of the CD-1 mouse strain following treatments with E2 or the short acting estrogen estriol (E3) were evaluated by microarray and compared to our previous profiles done in C57Bl6 mice. The pattern of response was similar in both strains, with early (2h) responses to E2 or E3 appearing very similar. The later (24h) response revealed that E2 exhibits a more robust response than E3, illustrating the short-acting nature of E3.

DESIGN
E2 or E3 regulation of uterine transcription was evaluated in triplicate samples from CD-1 mouse uterus.
