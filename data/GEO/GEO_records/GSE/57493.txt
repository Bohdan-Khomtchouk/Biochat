TITLE
Gene expression changes initiated by miR-34c in Dicer/Pten double knockout mouse serous epithelial cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miR-34c inhibits Dicer/Pten double knockout mouse serous epithelial cancer cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We found that miR-34c had a more dramatic effect on inhibiting tumor cell viability than let-7b. The action of miR-34c induced tumor cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and apoptosis and was accompanied with the regulation of key genes involved in cell proliferation and cell cycle G1/S transition. miR-34c suppressed the expression of EZH2 and MYBL2, which may transcriptionally and functionally activate CDKN1C.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from DKO tumor cell lines transfected with miR-34c (n=3) and control miRNA (n=3).
