TITLE
A genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify genes required for transgene silencing in human cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
A population of KBM7 cells harboring epigenetically-repressed GFPdim transgenes was mutagenized using a genome-wide CRISPR sgRNA library, and GFPbright cells containing relevant gene disruption events isolated by two rounds of FACS.

DESIGN

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
