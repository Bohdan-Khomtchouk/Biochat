TITLE
Genome wide identification of SHYG early target genes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Global transcriptome patterns were performed using SHYG-IOE-5h (5h after Estradiol and Mock treatment)

DESIGN
To identify genes more rapidly responding to elevated SHYG , we perfromed gene expression profiling (Affymetrix) upon 5h Est treatment of SHYG-IOE plants.
