TITLE
Expression data from soybean after soybean mosaic virus inoculation

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Chinese soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) cultivars Rsmv1 and Ssmv1 were used for soybean mosaic virus (SMV) resistance genes screening. The Rsmv1 cultivar was highly-resistant to SMV but the Ssmv1 cultivar was highly-susceptible. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying SMV inoculation and identified distinct expression genes between Rsmv1 and Ssmv1.

DESIGN
The four sets RNA samples, i.e., SMV inoculated Ssmv1 and Rsmv1, mock inoculated Ssmv1and Rsmv1 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
