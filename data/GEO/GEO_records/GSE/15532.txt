TITLE
Transcriptional changes of the human pathogenic fungus Trichophyton rubrum related to dermatophyte-skin interaction

ORGANISM
Trichophyton rubrum

SUMMARY
Trichophyton rubrum, an anthropophilic and cosmopolitan fungus, is the most common agent of superficial mycoses, causing rarely deep dermatophytosis in immunocompromised hosts.

DESIGN
In this study, an infection condition of T. rubrum was modeled by adding human skin sections into a limited medium containing glucose to monitor T. rubrum gene expression patterns using cDNA microarrays on a global level. We found that exposure to human skin resulted in up-regulation of the expression levels of T. rubrum genes related to many cellular and biological processes, including transcription and translation, metabolism and secondary transport, stress response, and signaling pathways. These results provide a reference set of T. rubrum genes whose expression patterns change upon infection and reveal previously unknown genes that probably corresponding to proteins that should be considered as virulence factor candidates and potential new drug targets for T. rubrum infections.
