TITLE
STAT3-mediated CD133 upregulation promotes hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified a novel mechanism by which IL-6/STAT3 signaling up-regulates CD133 expression and promotes HCC progression. STAT3 activation upregulates the expression of CD133 during liver carcinogenesis. Targeting STAT3-mediated CD133 overexpression may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC patients via eradicating the liver tumor microenviornment.

DESIGN
To develop novel cancer therapeutic strategies by identification of signaling pathways or biomarkers and understanding their functions on cancer stem cell biology, we determined CD133 expression and STAT3 activation with tumor microenvironment in HCC patient tissues. The relation of STAT3 activation and CD133 expression was investigated by luciferase assay, shRNA knock-down, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay in HCC cells, and in vivo xenograft model.
