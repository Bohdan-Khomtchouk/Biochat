TITLE
Array CGH in retinoblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This series represents the data set described in the publication â€œAllelic loss in a minimal region on chromosome 16q24 is associated with vitreous seeding of retinoblastoma Keywords: array CGH

DESIGN
Two patients with retinoblastoma were hybridised on a submegabase resolution whole genome tiling path BAC array. Detailed step-by step protocols for labelling and hybridisation can be downloaded from our website. Each case was hybridised once. No background subtraction was done and signal intensities were normalized by subgrid LOWESS. Circular binary segmentation was employed to define segments of the same DNA copy number change. Aberrations were defined as segments, which exceeded a fixed log2 threshold of +/- 0.2.
