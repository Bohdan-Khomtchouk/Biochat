TITLE
Differential microRNA gene expression between normal and aberrant late lung development induced by hyperoxia in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Newborn mouse pups were exposed either to normoxia (21% O2) or to hyperoxia (85% O2) since the day of birth. Lungs were harvested at P2.5, P3.5, P5.5 and P14.5 and homogenized for a downstream microRNA (miR) microarray in order to compare the differential expression of miRs between normoxia and hyperoxia group. Several miRs appeared to be dysregulated, mainly and with a higher significance, at P5.5 and P14.5.

DESIGN
Pups were randomized on the day of birth and litters were balanced. 4 cages were placed in normoxia whereas 4 cages in hyperoxia. Then, pups of the same age being placed in normoxia or hyperoxia were sacrificed on the same time-point. Total number of samples: 32.
