SUMMARY
Expression and differential expression analysis of astrocytoma patient samples (WHO grades I and III) and primary glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). Expression and differential expression was assessed by using an Agilent custom microarray (244K). The custom array contains probes for genomic regions that have been found to be differentially expressed (i) throughout cell cycle progression, (ii) in response to the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic p53 pathway, and (iii) the anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative STAT-3 pathway by employing TAS (Kampa et al. " Novel RNAs identified from an in-depth analysis of the transcriptome of human chromosomes 21 and 22 " . Genome Research, 14:331-42, 2004).  In addition, the Agilent custom array (244K) interrogates probes for genomic regions predicted to contain a conserved secondary structure identified by RNAz (Washietl et al. " Fast and reliable prediction of noncoding RNAs. " Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 102:2454-9, 2005.) or Evofold (Pedersen et al. " Identification and classification of conserved RNA secondary structures in the human genome. " PLoS Comput Biol. 2:e33, 2006.), as well as known non-coding RNAs from public databases, and the Agilent mRNA probe set 014850.

DESIGN
We analyzed four arrays each for astrocytoma patient samples of grade I, grade III and grade IV.
