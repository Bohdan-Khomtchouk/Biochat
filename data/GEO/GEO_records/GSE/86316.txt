TITLE
Messenger RNA expression after silencing or inhibition of MEN1in MCF-7 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-seq in MCF-7 cells after silencing of MEN1 using small hairpin RNA's directed at the MEN1 mRNA or chemical inhibition of the MEN1 gene product, menin. We demonstrate that a selected group of transcripts is affected by reduced menin function.

DESIGN
Comparison of mRNA levels using RNA-seq in mCF-7 cells after silencing of MEN1 using small hairpin RNA's directed at the MEN1 mRNA or chemical inhibition of menin.
