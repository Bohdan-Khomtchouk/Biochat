TITLE
Comparison of Agr-regulated virulence factor expression in FRI1169 and non-hemolytic variant

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
These cultures were grown to examine the differences in Agr-regulated virulence factor gene expression between wild-type S. aureus FRI1169 and a non-hemolytic variant isolated from a biofilm inoculated with FRI1169. The study is described more thoroughly in the paper " Generation of virulence factor variants in Staphylococcus aureus biofilms " , Yarwood et al., J. Bacteriol. 2007. Keywords: Wild-type versus mutant comparison, single time-point

DESIGN
Two indepent batch cultures were grown for both the wild-type strain FRI1169 and the non-hemolytic variant on two separate days (4 total experiments).  Transcript levels from FRI1169 and non-hemolytic variant grown in parallel on the same days were compared (FRI1169 replicate #1 versus non-hemolytic variant #1 and FRI1169 replicate #2 versus non-hemolytic variant #2).  Those Agr-regulated virulence factors whose expression was determined as being significantly changed in the non-hemolytic variant in both experiments/comparisons are shown in Table 1 of the paper " Generation of virulence factor variants in Staphylococcus aureus biofilms " , Yarwood et al., J. Bacteriol. 2007, in press.  The fold-change values shown in this table represent the average of the two experiments.
