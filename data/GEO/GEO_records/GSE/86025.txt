TITLE
miR-1199-5p and Zeb1: a novel double-negative feedback coordinating EMT and tumour cell invasion (miRNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed miRNA-sequencing in a detailed time course of a TGFbeta-induced EMT in normal mammary gland cells and discovered 32 strongly, differentially expressed miRNAs.

DESIGN
MiRNA profile of time-resolved TGFbeta-induced EMT of NMuMG cells.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
