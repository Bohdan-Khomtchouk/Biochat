TITLE
Gene expression profile in CD4+ T-cell infection with a SIV mutant related to altered humoral immune responses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A mutant simian immunodeficiency (SIVmac239) virus, found to be selected within chronically SIV-infected Burmese rhesus monkeys with relatively enhanced SIV-specific antibody responses, was reconstituted as a molecular clone. The virus (SIV Nef G63E) was then subjected to a preliminary analysis for their intracellular signal transduction and gene expression modulation patterns (as compared with wild type SIVmac239) within infected CD4+ T cells. Analysis implicated that the mutant virus had a moderately enhanced cytopathic phenotype.

DESIGN
A SIV mutation (SIVmac239 Nef G63E) found to be enriched in rhesus monkeys with enhanced SIV-specific antibody responses was reconstituted on a pBR-based SIV molecular clone pBRmac239. HSC-F cynomolgus macaque central memory Th2-like T cells were infected with mutant and wild type SIVmac239 at MOI 5 in triplicate along with uninfected controls (i.e. a total of 9 samples) for 24 hours and subjected to analysis of their gene expression patterns.
