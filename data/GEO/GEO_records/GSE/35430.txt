TITLE
Expression data from H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 double KO cells

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The histone variant H2A.Z is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to vertebrates. H2A.Z regulates gene expression when localized to promoter region. Recently, we identified two genes encoding H2A.Z, H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 in vertebrate genome. However, it is not clear that both H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 were required for the function of H2A.Z in gene regulation. To address this issue, we generated the H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 double knock out (KO) cells in chicken DT40 cells. The expression pattern of H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 double KO cells was compared with WT cells to characterize the genes regulated by H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2. We used microarrays to analysis the alternation of gene expression between WT and H2A.Z double KO cells and identify classes of up or down regulated gene by H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2.

DESIGN
In H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 double KO cells, H2A.Z-2 is knocked out constitutively, but H2A.Z-1 conditionally by tetracycline. The expression of H2A.Z-1 transgene is suppressed completely when H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 double KO cells culture with tetracycline for three days. For this reason, we prepared the total RNA of WT cells and H2A.Z-1and H2A.Z-2 double KO cells treated with tetracycline for three days and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
