TITLE
Digital gene expression tag profiling of pig subcutaneous adipose tissue from postnatal 0 day to 7 years

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Adipose tissues have important roles in the pathogenesis of obesity and its comorbidities by secreting cytokines involved in the regulation of metabolism. In mammals, part of the extends life span across species from yeast to primates is thought to be mediated by decreases in adipose mass. Indeed, depletion or expansion of adipose tissue using genetic or surgical approaches has been shown to impact the risk of many metabolic diseases and affect mean and maximum lifespan in rodents. An age-related function changes in adipose tissue is well documented in several species and may predispose to obesity and metabolic alterations also associated with advancing age, such as insulin resistance or hyperlipidemia. As a result, comparing gene expression profiles of adipose tissue from different ages may elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying adipose tissue changes. Here, we used Digital Gene Expression tag profiling (DGE) to determine the gene expression profiles of postnatal 0 day, 30 days, 180 days and 7 years subcutaneous adipose tissues from pigs.

DESIGN
A large-scale analysis of gene expression of postnatal 0 day, 30 days, 180 days and 7 years subcutaneous adipose tissues from pigs using digital gene expression tag profiling approach.
