TITLE
Expression data from Human MicroVascular Endothelial Cells (HMVECS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The activation of endothelium by tumor cells is one of the main steps by tumor metastasis. The role of the blood components (platelets and leukocytes) in this process remain unclear. We used microarrays to detail the repsonse of endothelial cells to tumor cells in the presence or absence of blood components.

DESIGN
HMVECs were cultured to 90% confluency. Tumor cells (LS180 or HT-29) in the presence or in the absence of blood components were co-cultured for 8 h with HMVECs. After the purfication of HMVECS by MACS sorting RNA was isolated.
