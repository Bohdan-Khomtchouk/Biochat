TITLE
Epigenetic Effects of Maternal Obesity on Wharton's Jelly (WJ) Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs): Implications For Cellular Therapy. (expression study)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
7 WJ-MSC lines from non-obese BMI < 25 kg/m2 were compared with 7 WJ-MSC lines obese BMI > 30 kg/m2.  No template was used as a negative control Triplicates for each line were analyses for human whole-genome gene expression profile using HumanHT-12 v4.0 Expression BeadChip (Illumina).

DESIGN
RNA (good quality with 8-10 RIN score) from the 14 samples (triplicates from 14 lines) were hybridised to the HumanHT-12 v4.0 Expression BeadChip (Illumina).

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
