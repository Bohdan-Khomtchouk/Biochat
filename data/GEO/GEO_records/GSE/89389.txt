TITLE
Novel data integration approaches identify concordant and discordant immune responses between mice and humans [mouse]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have conducted experiments to compare transcriptional response to tuberculosis (TB) in whole blood in two different TB murine models (susceptible 129S2 strain and resistant C57BL/6 strain) in time points day 1, day 7, day 14 and day 21 after infection.

DESIGN
We collected whole blood samples from two TB murine models (129S2 and C57BL/6 mice), uninfected and at day 1, day 7, day 14 and day 21 p.i. , extracted RNA and performed microarray experiments. There were 5 infected mice of each strain in every time point after infection, 8 control 129S2 non-infected mice and 6 control C57BL/6 non-infected mice.
