TITLE
Genes Differentially Expressed as a result of a fluconazole-resistant variant Candida albicans strain CaLY188 with trisomy of Chromosome R.

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Candida albicans CaLY188 compared to the wild type SN152

DESIGN
A fluconazole-resistant variant Candida albicans strain CaLY188 with trisomy of Chromosome R was selected to carry out the expression profile microarray. Two-condition experiment, CaLY188 vs.SN152. Biological replicates: 2 control, 2 transfected, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL9728 28K Candida albicans Genome Array
