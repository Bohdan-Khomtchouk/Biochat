TITLE
Over-expression of either MECP2_e1 or MECP2_e2 in mouse MECP2 knockout fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aim: to detect genes that are differentially transcribed in mouse MECP2 knockout fibroblasts over-expressing either of the two human MECP2 isoforms, MECP2_e1 or MECP2_e2. Methods: mouse Mecp2tm1.1Bird knockout fibroblast cell line was stably infected by lentiviral vectors over-expressing MECP2_e1, MECP2_e2, or eGFP. RNA extracted, and used for gene expression microarray analysis

DESIGN
3 biological replicates for MECP2_e1; 3 replicates for MECP2_e2; 3 replicates for eGFP as control; 3 replicates for MECP2_e1 with 9bp insertion mutation in N-terminal

PLATFORM
