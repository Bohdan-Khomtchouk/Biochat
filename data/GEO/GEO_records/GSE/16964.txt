TITLE
Iron-deficiency-induced changes in wild type, ubc13A and cucumber CsUBC13 overexpressed Arabidopsis roots

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
CsUBC13 was identified via proteomics from iron starvation treated Cucumber root. ubc13A is an ABRC seed stock (CS51269). CS851269 was purchased from ABRC and confirmed as homozygous Atubc13A knock-out T-DNA mutant. We generated transgenic arabidopsis with ectopic expression of CsUBC13 gene under control of the cauliflower 35S promotor. Both genotypes and Col-0 were used to investigate the transcriptional response to Iron (Fe) deficiency.

DESIGN
Wild type Col-0, ubc13A and transgenic overexpressor OE were grown under normal and iron-deficiency conditions. Roots were collected with 3 biological replicates.
