TITLE
Mouse iPS cells-derived 3D-retinas: Vehicle control- vs. 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-treated 3D-retinas w/o supplements

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of 3D-retinas differentiated from mouse iPS cells comparing vehicle control with 4-OHT-treated  w/o supplements. 4-OHT is an inverse agonist of estrogen-related receptor beta (ERRβ), a rod-enriched transcription factor responsible for maintenance of rod photoreceptor cells and the treatment induces photoreceptor specific cell death in the 3D-retinas. Goal was to understand the mechanism of protective effects of representative ophthalmic supplements for treating the photoreceptor degeneration.

DESIGN
4-OHT w/o supplements-induced gene expression in the 3D-retinas was measured at DD 25 when the photoreceptor cells started to be degenerated. Four-condition experiment, vehicle control- vs. 5 µM 4-OHT- vs. 5 µM 4-OHT with 400 µM vitamin E- vs. 5 µM 4-OHT with 200 nM lutein-treated 3D-retinas. Biological replicates: each sample has 24 3D-retinas and 1replicate.
