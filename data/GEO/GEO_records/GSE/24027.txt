TITLE
PCPTC screening

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary cultures of patient tumor cells (PCPTC) were used in a cell-based cytotoxicity screen. Microarray-based mRNA profiling was used to identify the mechanism-of-action for the small molecule VLX 50.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were treated with the PCPTC screening hit VLX 50 or DMSO control for 6h prior to RNA isolation. One sample per treatment. Data were analyzed using both MAS5.0 and RMA.
