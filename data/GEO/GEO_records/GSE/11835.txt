TITLE
Gene expression data in heifers with persistently infected (PI) or transiently infected (TI) fetuses.

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The response to the presence of the ncpBVDV-infected PI or TI fetus is expected to provide information on the impact of the PI fetus on the immune response of the dam

DESIGN
Fetal PI infection was induced by intranasal inoculation of pregnant heifers with ncpBVDV on day 75 of gestation. Fetal transient infection (TI) was induced by infection of pregnant heifers with ncpBVDV on day 175 of gestation. Control heifers were kept uninfected. Blood samples from pregnant heifers of the PI and control groups were collected on day 160 of gestation. Blood samples of PI, TI and healthy fetus carrying heifers were collected for microarray on day 190 of gestation.
