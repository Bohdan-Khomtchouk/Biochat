TITLE
Gene expression profiles of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) overexpressing miR-511-3p

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HS/PCs) were transduced with lentiviral vectors overexpressing OFP and either miR-511-3p or a control, mutated miRNA sequence (miR-511-3p-mut). The transduced HS/PCs were then transplanted in recipient C57BL/6 mice. Tumors (Lewis lung carcinomas, LLC) were injected s.c. 4 weeks after HS/PC transplant. Lentiviral vector-transduced (OFP+), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were isolated 4 weeks after LLC injection by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Gene expression profiles of TAMs overexpressing either miR-511-3p or miR-511-3p-mut were obtained from 3 independent biological samples/each. Gene expression profiles of miRNA-overexpressing TAMs were then compared with the gene expression profiles of wild-type TAMs isolated from LLCs grown in nontransplanted C57BL/6 mice; the latter TAMs were subfractioned into MRC1+CD11c(low) or CD11c+MRC1(low) subsets before RNA isolation and analysis. Comparison of gene expression profiles of TAMs revealed that miR-511-3p overexpression tunes down the expression of multiple genes that are classically upregulated in protumoral MRC1+CD11c(low) TAMs.

DESIGN
TAMs were isolated from Lewis lung carcinomas grown s.c. in C57BL/6 mice.
