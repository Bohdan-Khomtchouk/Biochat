TITLE
Genome-wide maps of transcriptional factor binding in mouse erythroid cells.

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Regions bound by the erythroid transcription factors GATA1 and NFE2 and the general factor CTCF were identified in mouse erythroid cells using ChIP-seq.

DESIGN
Chip-seq experiements were performed in mouse erythroid Ter119+ cells.
