TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Genes Regulated by Macrophage-Conditioned Media Treatment of Human Adipocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A major development in obesity research is the recognition that the condition is characterized by chronic mild inflammation. Within adipose tissue, this involves the infiltration of macrophages as well as a direct inflammatory response of adipocytes. This study has used Agilent whole-genome microarrays to examine the effects of macrophage-conditioned medium on the global inflammatory response of human adipocytes.

DESIGN
Human adipocytes (SGBS cells), differentiated in culture, were treated with macrophage (U937 cells) conditioned media for 4 or 24 h. Control SGBS cells were treated with unconditioned media (control) or RPMI media alone to control for differences in media used to culture U937 cells. There were 6 replicates per group.
