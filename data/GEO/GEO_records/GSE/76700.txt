TITLE
Whole transcriptome analysis of mouse brain with chronic diazepam treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global transcriptional analysis of chronic DZP administrated mouse brain using microarrays identified some up- and down- regulated genes after chronic DZP administrations. Diazepam (DZP), a medication of the benzodiazepine family, is widely used to treat various conditions including anxiety, muscle spasms, seizures, trouble sleeping, and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Chronic DZP treatment has significant risks such as tolerance, dependence, withdrawal effect and Alzheimer's disease. As the molecular mechanisms of these risks were complex processes, global analysis has been required.

DESIGN
Control (INTRALIPID, vehicle) or DZP chronically administrated mice (n=3, respectively) were decapitated and brains were quickly removed under deep anesthesia. Total RNA were extracted from cerebral cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. The samples were named as follows: CC;control cerebral cortex, DC; DZP cerebral cortex, CH;control hippocampus, DH; DZP hippocampus, CA; control amygdala, DA; DZP amygdala. 100 ng of total RNA were subjected to GeneChipÂ® Mouse Transcriptome Array (MTA-1_0, Affymetrix) according to manufacturer's protocol.
