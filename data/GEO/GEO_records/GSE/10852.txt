TITLE
Pentylenetetrazol treatment and its withdrawal induced gene expression changes in female Drosophila head

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We have recently developed a Drosophila behavioral- and transcriptomic- based (systems) model of chronic pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced locomotor plasticity. Pharmacological validation using antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) shows that the model is predictive of antiepileptic, antiepileptogenic, disease-modifying and neuroprotective activities. This model is however developed using male flies. The present submission relates to microarray gene expression profiling of fly heads after treatment of female Drosophila adults with PTZ for seven days subsequent withdrawal of PTZ for next seven days. Expression profiles have been generated at three time points during chronic PTZ treatment, namely 12 hrs, 2nd day and 7th day and at the end of withdrawal period, i.e., 14th day from the beginning of the treatment.
