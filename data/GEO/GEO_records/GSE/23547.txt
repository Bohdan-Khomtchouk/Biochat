TITLE
Comparison of tenascin-C proficient versus tenascin-C deficient Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to investigate what signalling pathways are turned on by tenascin-C, we generated Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for tenascin-C and compared their gene expression profile to MEFs proficient for tenascin-C.
