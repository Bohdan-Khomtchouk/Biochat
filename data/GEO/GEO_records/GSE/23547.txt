TITLE
Comparison of tenascin-C proficient versus tenascin-C deficient Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to investigate what signalling pathways are turned on by tenascin-C, we generated Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for tenascin-C and compared their gene expression profile to MEFs proficient for tenascin-C.

DESIGN
TNC-KO MEFs as well as WT MEFs in which tenascin-C was knocked-down (following stable transfection of a short hairpin RNA) were compared to WT MEFs (expressing strong endogenous levels of tenascin-C).
