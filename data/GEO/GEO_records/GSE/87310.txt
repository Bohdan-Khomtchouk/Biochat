TITLE
Gene and microRNA expression changes induced by overexpression of SphK1 in papillary thyroid cancer cells [miRNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The oncogenic roles of Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) in various cancers, including thyroid cancer, have been well demonstrated. However, miRNAs associated with the oncogenic roles of SphK1 remains largely unknown. The goal of this study is to detect the global gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression in response to Sphk1 over-expression and identify potential therapeutic targets. To achieve this, SphK1 was stably overexpressed in papillary thyroid cancer cell line TPC1. Then the mRNA and miRNA expression were quantified using digital gene expression (DGE) analysis and small RNA-seq in TPC1-Vector and TPC1-SphK1 cells, respectively. miRNA-mRNA interactions were explored by microT-CDS and the predicted networks were visualized using CytoScape. In this study, we found that over-expression of SphK1 differentially regulates 46 miRNA and 506 mRNAs expression in TPC1 cells. Combining bioinformatics prediction of mRNA targets and DGE data on mRNA expressions allowed to identify mRNA targets of deregulated miRNAs. The direct interaction between miR-144-3p and FN1 mRNA, which mediates the pro-invasive role of SphK1 in thyroid cancer cells, was experimentally validated. In general, our results provided a miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in response to SphK1 overexpression in thyroid cancer cells. We also demonstrated a role of miR-144-3p and FN1 in mediating oncogenic function of SphK1, which enhance the understanding of etiology of thyroid cancer.

DESIGN
The miRNA profiles of TPC1-Vector and TPC1-SphK1 cells were generated by sequencing, in duplicate, using a Illumina HiSeq 2500.
