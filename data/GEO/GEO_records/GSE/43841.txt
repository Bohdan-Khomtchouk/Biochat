TITLE
Gene expression analysis of microvesicular hyperplastic polyps and sessile serrated polyps/adenomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we compared gene expression of precancerous SSA/Ps and benign MVHPs with particular focus on genes involved in colorectal cancer.  We also identify genes whose expression can be used to differentiate SSA/Ps and MVHPs.  These results provide insight into the development of SSA/Ps and illustrates differences between these related colonic polyps.

DESIGN
Total RNA from 6 samples of normal colon, 6 microvesicular hyperplastic polyps, and 6 sessile serrated adenomas/polyps were compared
