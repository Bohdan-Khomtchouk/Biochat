TITLE
Defining soma-specific/enriched and germline-specific/enriched transcripts

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To define what genes are predominantly or specifically expressed in either soma or germline in C. elegans adults, total RNA was extracted from germline-less glp-4 mutant animals or from dissected gonads, respectively.

DESIGN
Total RNA sequencing was peformed in duplicates. Four samples in total.
