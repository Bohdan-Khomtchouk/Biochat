TITLE
Gene expression profile after CCM1 over expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CCM1 (also known as KRIT1) is critical regulator of endothelial cell biology. Mutations in CCM1 can lead to the formation of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM). CCM lesions are frequent in the human population; however, their pathogenesis is poorly understood. This genome-wide expression analysis is aimed to unravelling novel mechanisms how CCM1 executes its functions in endothelial cells. We used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as a model system to study CCM1 functions after adenoviral over expression. The results of this experiment suggest that CCM1 is a critical regulator of endothelial cell cycle control and proliferation as well as migration and angiogenesis. This fits well to the roles of CCM1 in HUVEC which indeed acts as a negative regulator of angiogenesis.

DESIGN
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were transduced with adenovirus expressing CCM1 or GFP as control. 48 hours after transduction total RNA was isolated from duplicates for genome-wide expression analysis biological replicate: GFP rep1, GFP rep2 biological replicate: CCM1 rep1, CCM1 rep2
