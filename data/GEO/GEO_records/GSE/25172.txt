TITLE
MYC drives resistance to PI3K/mTOR targeted inhibition (gene expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression signatures were measured after treatment of cells with 50nM BEZ235. Affymetrix HG-U133AV2 expression arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions using RNA extracted by Qiagen RNeasy from engineered human cell-lines grown for 72h in the presence of 50nM BEZ235

DESIGN
Resulting expression signatures where derived based on phenotypic properties(resistance to BEZ235) of the cells (enriched vs GFP/HR).
