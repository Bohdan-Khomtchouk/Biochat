TITLE
Genistein Cooperates with the Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Vorinostat to Induce Cell Death in Prostate Cancer Cells (expression data)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have investigated the effects of genistein on several prostate cancer cell lines, including the ARCaP-E/ARCaP-M model of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), to analyze effects on their epigenetic state. In addition, we investigated the effects of combined treatment of genistein with the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat on survival in prostate cancer cells. Using whole-genome expression profiling and whole-genome methylation profiling, we have determined the genome-wide differences in genetic and epigenetic responses to genistein in prostate cancer cells before and after undergoing the EMT. Also, cells were treated with genistein, vorinostat, and a combination treatment, where cell death and cell proliferation was determined.

DESIGN
ARCaP-E and ARCaP-M cells were analyzed for whole genome expression using the Illumina HumanHT-12 Expression BeadChip. Samples were treated with DMSO control, genistein, vorinostat, a combination of vorinostat and genistein, or 5-aza-deoxycytidine. Samples were prepared in triplicate on independent days.
