TITLE
Gene expression patterns in caecal lamina propria mononuclear cells and epithelial cells following preventive administration of T. suis ova in a rabbit model of DSS colitis

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
We describe the transcriptional changes occurring in lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) upon Trichuris suis ova (TSO) treatment in a rabbit model of DSS colitis

DESIGN
NZW rabbits received 3x2500 TSO or vehicle at day 1, 14, 21, i.g. Colitis was induced at day 26 with 0.1% DSS for 5 days, control animal received water. Rabbits were sacrificed at day 35. Caecal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and epithelial cells (EC) were isolated for RNA extraction and genome wide expression analysis by  RNAseq. N=3 per group

PLATFORM
GPL18453 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Oryctolagus cuniculus)
