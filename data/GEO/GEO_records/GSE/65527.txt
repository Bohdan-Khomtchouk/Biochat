TITLE
Gene expression after 24h Urolithin A incubation in LNCaP cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The identification of new agents that may modulate the progression of cancer cell growth is of great interest. In this regard, dietary agents can be utilized to identify molecular targets to be used as part of a chemopreventive strategy. Walnuts contain several bioactive compounds, including pedunculagin, a polyphenol metabolized by microbiota to form urolithins, namely urolithin A (UA).  We performed a genomic analysis to study the effect of UA on androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells. Cells were incubated with 40µM UA for 24 hours, then, RNA was extracted.  RNA samples were processed in the automated  Biomek FX System (Beckman Coulter), where  aRNA was produced, and labeled with Biotin, purified , fragmented and hybridized onto HG U219-24 Array, using the GeneChip HT 3’IVT Express Kit . Afterwards, the GeneTitan® Multi-Channel (MC) Instrument (Affymetrix) was used to hybridize, wash , stain , and scan the arrays. Microarray results were analyzed using the GeneSpring GX v13.0 software.

DESIGN
LNCaP cells were plated in 35mm wells, the following day they were treated with 40µM urolithin A (UA) for  24 hours, after incubation Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNAeasy minikit. The Affymetrix Human Genome U219 array plate was used, which measures gene expression of more than 36 000 transcripts and variants per sample, which represent more than 20 000 genes.
