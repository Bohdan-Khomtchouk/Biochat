TITLE
Expression data from DTL silenced-Ewing Sarcoma's cell lines along with their controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The 1q gain is related to poor survival, and to a profile of cell cycle deregulation in Ewing's Sarcoma (ES). Tumor samples with 1q gain overexpress the gene DTL. We have silenced DTL in three ES cell lines in order to compare the differential expression pattern produced with the differential expression pattern which characterizes 1q gained-tumors.

DESIGN
We silenced DTL in three ES cell lines with two different shRNA constructions by means of lentiviral transduction. pLKO.1-non-targeting control was transduced in the control samples. RNA was extracted and hybridized with Affymetrix expression microarrays.
