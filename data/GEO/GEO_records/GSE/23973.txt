TITLE
Large intergenic non-coding RNAs as novel modulators of reprogramming: siRNA (gene expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
lincRNA-ST8SIA3 was depleted using siRNAs and  associated gene expression changes were profiled on Affymentrix arrays

DESIGN
siRNAs targeting lincRNA-ST8SIA3 were transfected into human induced pluripotent stem cells; non-targeting siRNAs were used as controls GPL570 ;Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array [Affy_HG-U133_Plus_2]
