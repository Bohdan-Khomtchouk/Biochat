TITLE
Expression data from 6-month Helicobacter felis-infected WT and Gli1-/- mouse stomachs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gli1 is necessary for the progression from chronic gastric inflammation to metaplasia in the stomach. We therefore compared the expression patterns between 6-month H. felis infected WT and Gli1-/- stomachs.

DESIGN
Pooled tissue from the gastric fundi of 3 mice per group. Groups are WT, WT + H. felis (6 months), Gli1-/-, and Gli1-/- +H. felis (6 months). All the infected and control mice were obtained from the same experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL11180 [HT_MG-430_PM] Affymetrix HT MG-430 PM Array Plate
