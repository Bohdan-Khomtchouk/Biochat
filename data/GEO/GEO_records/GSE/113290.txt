TITLE
Gender Specific Differences in Expression of Neisseria gonorrhoeae Antibiotic Resistance Genes During Human Mucosal Infection

ORGANISM
Neisseria gonorrhoeae

SUMMARY
Samples were collected from infected male patients and RNA seq was used to determine the transcriptome of Neisseria gonorrhoeae both during infection and during growth in chemically defined media (CDM). Samples were also collected from infected female patients to determine the transcriptome differences between male and female infections.

DESIGN
Examination of 6 male in vivo samples compared to the 6 isolated strains grown in vitro and 7 female in vivo samples

PLATFORM
GPL20720 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Neisseria gonorrhoeae)
