TITLE
Dissecting Stages of the Notch signaling pathway during Kidney Development by Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Samples E12/E13/E14/E16/E18: We aims to screen out different gene expression profile in Embryo kidney on different gestation stages of the Notch signaling pathway  Results from the various study components can help to screening important candidate genes during embryonic kidney development.   Keywords: Embryo kidney, Development, Notch signaling pathway, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis

DESIGN
The Oligo GEArray Assay comprises various components: RNA isolation,Assesing RNA yield and quality,cRNA labeling and synthesis,Hybridization,Chemiluminescent detection and Image acquisition and data analysis. Samples E12: This study has been accomplished with Embryo kidney on gestation 12,  3 techinical replicates.  Samples E13: This study has been accomplished with Embryo kidney on gestation 13, 3 techinical replicates. Samples E14: This study has been accomplished with Embryo kidney on gestation 14, 2 techinical replicates.  Samples E16: This study has been accomplished with 1Embryo kidney on gestation 16, 2 techinical replicates. Samples E18: This study has been accomplished with Embryo kidney on gestation 18, 2 techinical replicates.
