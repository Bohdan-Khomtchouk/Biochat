TITLE
Dissecting Stages of the Notch signaling pathway during Kidney Development by Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Samples E12/E13/E14/E16/E18: We aims to screen out different gene expression profile in Embryo kidney on different gestation stages of the Notch signaling pathway  Results from the various study components can help to screening important candidate genes during embryonic kidney development.   Keywords: Embryo kidney, Development, Notch signaling pathway, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis
