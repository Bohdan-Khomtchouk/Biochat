TITLE
Increased mutability of staphylococci in biofilms as a consequence of oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus NCTC 8325

SUMMARY
In this work we have demonstrated increased mutability of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis in biofilms and have explored the mechanisms underlying the enhanced mutability. A novel static biofilm model, utilising cellulose filter disks, was developed to support the formation of mature biofilms with sufficiently high cell densities to permit determination of mutation frequencies. The mutability of biofilm cultures increased up to 60 fold and 4 fold for S. aureus and S. epidermidis, respectively, compared with planktonic cultures. Incorporation of antioxidants into S. aureus biofilms reduced mutation frequencies, indicating that increased oxidative stress underlies increased mutability in the biofilm. Transcriptional profiling revealed upregulation of the superoxide dismutase gene, sodA, in early biofilm cultures, also suggesting enhanced oxidative stress in these cultures. However, loss of the genes encoding superoxide dismutases or peroxidases did not specifically exacerabate biofilm mutability. In S. aureus SH1000, hydrogen peroxide was found to contribute to biofilm mutability.
