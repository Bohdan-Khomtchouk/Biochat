TITLE
E2F4 wt and knockout neurospheres

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E2F4 wild and knockout type neurospheres from E12.5 forebrain. E2F4 transcription factor regulates the expression of the genes which are required for neural stem cell expansion in the developing mouse brain. The results of microarray analysis will help to identify the signaling pathways affected by E2F4 deletion and refine the neural stem cell regulatory mechanism. Keywords: other

DESIGN
This experiment include 2 samples on 2 platforms for a total of 4 Samples.

PLATFORM
GPL339 [MOE430A] Affymetrix Mouse Expression 430A Array GPL340 [MOE430B] Affymetrix Mouse Expression 430B Array
