TITLE
Targets of AtWRKY27  in Arabidopsis leaves

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis transcription factor WRKY27 was found to be involved in plant defense towards Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000. To identify target genes of WRKY27, we introduced a functional tagged version of WRKY27 into two independent Arabidopsis wrky27 knockout lines (ecotype Columbia) under the control of the estrogen receptor-based chemical-inducible system. 18 days old  plants grown on soil (Metro Mix 200) at 22oC under a 10/14 h light/dark cycle were treated for 6h with 10 microM beta-estradiol after which RNA was immediately isolated. The two independent knockout lines transformed with the empty vectors (pMD::XVE-SALK and pMD::XVE-ETL)  served as controls and were grown under the same conditions and treated identically as the experimental plants.
