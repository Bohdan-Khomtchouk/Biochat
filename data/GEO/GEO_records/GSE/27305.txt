TITLE
Characterize the unique transcriptional changes in the embryonic trachea of knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further identify the transcriptional changes underlying congenital tracheal malformation in a1H knockout mice, the differential gene expression panel was examined by Affymetrix microarray. To investigate the roles of a1H-regulated genes in tracheal development, we characterize the unique transcriptional changes of early trachea in kockout mice, and compare the expression profiles of knock out trachea with those of wild type trachea. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up or down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Mouse embryos trachea were collected at embryo day 16 (E16) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain homozygous mouse embryos trachea in order to compare with gene expression profile of wild type mouse tracheal.
