TITLE
Combination of multiomics approach and BCR-ABL based molecular testing: A better way to monitor treatment regimen and  disease progression in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia [HTA-2_0]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We screened TKI-treated-CML-samples in different-phases  based on < or > 10% copies of BCR-ABL, undetected and control-samples for generating transcriptomics-profile. Transcriptionally, three clusters were identified which showed correlation with BCR-ABL transcript-levels i.e. < 10% copies (I-cluster) , undetectable (II-cluster) and > 10% copies (III-cluster).

DESIGN
CML-new cases as well as Tyrosine kinase treated-different phases of CML

PLATFORM
GPL17586 [HTA-2_0] Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 [transcript (gene) version]
