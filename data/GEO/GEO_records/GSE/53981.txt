TITLE
Sf1+ mouse adrenocortical cells vs. Wnt-responsive mouse adrenocortical cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to determine which gene transcripts are enriched in Wnt-responsive adrenocortical mouse cells compared to the entire adrenocortical mouse cell population in vivo. To this end, we employed transgenic reporter mice that label Wnt-responsive cells with GFP expression (TCF/Lef:H2B-GFP mice) or label all adrenocortical cells with GFP expression (Sf1:eGFP mice). GFP-positive adrenocortical cells were obtained from 6-week-old male TCF/Lef:H2B-GFP mice and Sf1:eGFP mice independently. 10 adrenals per genotype per sort were minced and digested by incubation in DMEM:F12 containing 0.1% collagenase/ 0.01% DNaseI solution for 1 h at 37°C. A single cell suspension was obtained following mechanical dispersion, filtration through a 40 micron nylon cell strainer, centrifugation at 1500rpm for 5 min followed by re-suspension in sterile 1X PBS containing 10% cosmic calf serum and 10μg/mL Propidium iodide. 10,000-50,000 viable GFP-positive cells were isolated via FACS using a BD FACSAria III cell sorter. RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) from 4 independent sorts per genotype. cDNA were prepared according to the NuGen WT-Pico V2 kit protocol from 5 ng total RNA (Ovation PicoSL WTA System V2 P/N 3312). Biotinylated single-stranded cDNA were prepared from 3ug of cDNA (Encore Biotin Module P/N 4200-12, 4200-60, 4200-A01). Targets were assayed on the Mouse Gene ST 1.1 strip arrays using the Affymetrix Gene Atlas system (software version 1.0.4.267). One TCF/Lef:H2B-GFP array was deemed low-quality and discarded. Two-sample T-tests were used to compare the two groups of samples. We also supply a supplementary file holding the data and some statistical analysis, as well as probe-set annotation that we used at that time (users may wish to obtain new annotation though). We analyzed only 28944 probe-sets with category " main " , " --- " , and " flmrna- > unmapped " according to Affymetrix annotation.
