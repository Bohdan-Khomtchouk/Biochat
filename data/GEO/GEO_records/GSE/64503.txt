TITLE
RNA-Induced Silencing Complex-associated RNA in MRC-5 cells transfected with hcmv-miR-UL22A-5p

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of mRNA targets of the human cytomegalovirus miRNA UL22A-5p

DESIGN
One 4-plex chip was hybridized with cDNA originating from either total RNA or from AGO2-associated RNA (i.e. RISC-associated RNA) from fibroblasts transfected 48 hours earlier with hcmv-miR-UL22A-5p mimic or with a negative control siRNA
