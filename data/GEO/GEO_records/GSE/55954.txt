TITLE
Ionizing Radiation Induced micro RNA Expression Alterations in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ionizing Radition is known to cause cell damage. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells have long been used to study radiation induced gene expression profiling. Whithin this study we evaluated gene and microRNA expression alterations of human PBMC irradiated with 60 Gy g-ray. Cells were cultured for 2, 4 and 20h after irradiation before RNA was isolated and Agilent Human microRNA Microarrays was performed.

DESIGN
Radiation induced gene expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured at 2, 4 and 20 hours after exposure to doses of 60 Gy g-rays. Non radiated cell of each donor and time point were used as contol cells. Four independent experiments were performed at each time (2, 4, or 20 hours and 0 h - only 1 sample per donor) using 4 different donors.
