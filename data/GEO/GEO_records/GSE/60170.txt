TITLE
Circulating Dirofilaria immitis microRNAs in dog plasma

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
We report the presence of circulating miRNAs released by the filarial nematode Dirofilaria immitis into the host (Canis familiaris) bloodstream.

DESIGN
MiRNA deep-sequencing combined with bioinformatics revealed over 200 mature miRNA sequences of potential nematode origin in Dirofilaria immitis-infected dog plasma in two independent analyses

PLATFORM
