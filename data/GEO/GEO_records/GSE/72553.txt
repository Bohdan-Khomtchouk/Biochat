TITLE
Lactobacilli modulate epithelial cytoprotection through the Nrf2 pathway [Microarray]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report that cellular ROS enzymatically generated in response to contact with lactobacilli in both mice and Drosophila has salutary effects against exogenous insults to the intestinal epithelium via the activation of Nrf2 responsive cytoprotective genes.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from 40 3rd instar larvae of sterile PBS or L. plantarum treated drosophila melanogaster, combined into two samples and gene expression measured by microarray
