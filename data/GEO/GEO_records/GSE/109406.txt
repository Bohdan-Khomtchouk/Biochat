TITLE
Expression data from MCF7 wildtype and MCF7 MDMXC463A/WT cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MDMX C463A mutation disrupts its binding with MDM2, and leads insufficient of MDM2 E3 ligase activity. With that, p53 degradation would be slower. In this case, p53 remaining its tumor suppressor function without transactivation. To figure out the whole map of transcripts change in MDMX C463A mutation cells. We used MCF7 parental cells as control group, and MCF7 MDMXC463A/WT mutation cells as experimental group for gene chip analysis.

DESIGN
Triplicates of each group were cultured until log phase and subjected to RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (QIAGEN). Purified RNA were send to Danar-Faber core for gene-chip analysis with HTA 2.0 chip (Affymetrix).

PLATFORM
