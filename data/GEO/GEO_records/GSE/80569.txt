Comparsion of IGRP reactive CD8 T cell clones

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Autoreactive CD8+ T-cells recognizing autoantigens expressed by pancreatic islets lead to the destruction of insulin-producing Î²-cells in type 1 diabetes, but these T-cell also occur in healthy subjects. We tested the hypothesis that uncontrolled expansion of diabetogenic T-cells in patients occurs, resulting from failure to activate apoptosis. We compared function, transcriptome and epigenetic regulation thereof in relation with fate upon repeated exposure to islet-autoantigen of islet autoreactive T-cells from healthy and type 1 diabetic donors with identical islet epitope specificity and HLA-A2 restriction. Patient's T-cells proliferated exponentially, whereas those of non-diabetic origin succumbed to cell death. Transcriptome analysis revealed reduced expression of TRAIL, TRAIL-R2, FAS and FASLG (members of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway) in patient-derived compared to healthy-donor-derived T cells. This was mirrored by increased expression of microRNAs predicted to regulate these particular genes, namely miR-98, miR-23b and miR-590-5p. Gene specific targeting by these microRNAs was confirmed using dual-luciferase reporter assays. Finally, transfection of these microRNAs into primary T-cells reduced FAS and TRAIL mRNA underscoring their functional relevance. We propose that repression of pro-apoptotic pathways by microRNAs contributes to unrestricted expansion of diabetogenic cytotoxic T-cells, implicating microRNA-mediated gene silencing in islet autoimmunity in T1D.

DESIGN
Human HLA-A2 restricted IGRP 268-273 reactive CD8 T cell clones derived from T1D patients (IGRP7 & IGRP32) were compared at mRNA and miRNA level with healthy individual derived HLA-A2 restricted IGRP 268-273 T cell clones. Total RNA was isolated after in the resting phase after antigen-specific stimualtion. Clones were generated as previously described in :PMID:  17376840; PMID:23155466
