TITLE
Expression analysis of YAP and Angiomotin target genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess  changes in gene expression regulated by Yap1 or Angiomotin,  either Yap1 or Angiomotin were knocked down in HEK293 cells  using shRNA and expression was assessed by microarray analysis and compared to expression patterns of wildtype cells.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed to compare gene expression in Amot-KD, Yap-KD, and control HEK293 cells. Samples from three individual experiments for each of the three groups were analyzed.
