MUNC downregulation decreases muscle differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling in differentiating C2C12 cells comparing control cells and MUNC-deprived cells

DESIGN
RNA samples were isolated from 4 C2C12 samples: proliferating control (siC) cells, differentiating siC cells, proliferating and differentiating MUNC depleted (siMUNC) cells
