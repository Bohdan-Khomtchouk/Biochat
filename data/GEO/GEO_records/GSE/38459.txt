TITLE
miRNA profiles in head and neck natural epithelial - mesenchymal phenotype cell line pair,  and in TGF-β induced EMT models

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sixth generation Exiqon® locked nucleic acid miRCURY™ LNA microarrays were used to search and validate some unidentified miRNAs that regulate EMT in head and neck cancer carcinoma.

DESIGN
MiRNA array screening was performed to identify the differential expression of miRNAs involved in EMT in natural epithelial - mesenchymal phenotype cell line pair（HN-4, HN-12) and in TGF-β induced EMT models (HN-4 TGF-β,HN-4). HN-4 parental cell was served as the control.One µg total RNA from sample and control was labeled with Hy5™ and Hy3™ fluorescent label, respectively, using the miRCURY™ LNA Array power labeling kit (Exiqon, Denmark) following the procedure described by the manufacturer.
