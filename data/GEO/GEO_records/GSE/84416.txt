TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of primary intestinal epithelial cells with or without Cosmc from 2-month-old mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of mucin-type O-glycan regulation of gene expression in murine intestinal epithelial cells isolated from a mouse. The hypothesis tested in the current study was that loss of Cosmc (by Cre/Lox: Vil-Cre+ X Cosmcflox/+), which is required for core 1-based O-glycan extension, influences gene expression. Transcripts from colorectum and from small intestine were compared to also evaluate whether O-glycans control different genes in different regions of the gut. We had particular interest in identifying transcripts or pathways important in regulating the microbiota or influencing intestinal inflammation. Results provide important information on how cell surface glycosylation controls gene transcription in in vivo.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated intestinal epithelia from colorectum (CR) or small intestine (SI) (method: Neufert et al., Journal of Clinical Investigation, 2013) from 2-month-old Vil-Cre+ or Vil-Cre+;Cosmcflox/y mice.
