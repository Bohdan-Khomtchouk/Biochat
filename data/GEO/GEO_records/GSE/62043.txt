TITLE
Primary and adjacent non-malignant tissue samples of 100 HCC patients (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide mRNA expression profiles of 100 primary and matched non-malignant tissues of HCC patients from a Singapore patient cohort. HCC is a hetergenous disease and it is important to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we studied the role of microRNAs in HCC by integrating microRNA and gene expression profiles of HCC patients.

DESIGN
Profiling of 100 primary and adjacent non-malignant HCC tissue samples on Agilent two-color whole human genome gene expression microarray (design G4112F). All tissues were collected with approvals from the National Cancer Centre, Singapore; the Research Ethics Review Committee; and signed patient informed consent.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
