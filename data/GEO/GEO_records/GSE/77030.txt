TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling in PRKCI vs NT-silenced Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the crucial role of PRKCI in glioblastoma stem-like cell (GSC) survival, gene expression microarray-based transcriptome analysis was conducted on GSCs transduced for 4 days with PRKCI shRNA compared with GSCs transduced with shNT.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates (2 x NCH421k and 1 x NCH644), shNT used as control
