TITLE
Short RNAs expression profiling in circulating CD34+ cells from Primary Myelofibrosis patients and from normal controls pooled bone marrow CD34+ cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of Illumina short RNA sequencing for characterization and discovery of miRNAs and moRNAs, and for identification of differentially expressed small RNAs in circulating CD34+ cells from Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) patients and from normal controls pooled bone marrow CD34+ cells.

DESIGN
Short RNAs sequencing for miRNA quantification, discovery and characterisation.
