TITLE
CEA_SGF:E00015#aft_HU_response

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Analysis of the response to hydroxyurea in a yeast aft1aft2 mutant strain (Y18aft2d) compared to wild-type strain (CM3260). Cells were grown in YPD rich medium containing 200 mM hydroxyurea (HU) for 2 hours. Gene expression changes due to the aft1 mutation were also analysed in absence of HU (BY4741 background). Keywords: repeat sample
