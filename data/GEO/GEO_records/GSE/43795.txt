TITLE
Gene expression of pancreatic tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of pancreas(SPN), ductal adenocarcinoma(PCA), neuroendocrine tumor(NET) and non-neoplastic pancreas. To investigate the specific gene expression of SPN compared to other types of pancreatic tumor, we analyzed large-scale gene expressioin analysis to identify the molecular signature that may affect SPN tumorigenesis. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed on SPNs, PCAs, NETs and Non-neoplastic tissues.

DESIGN
Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) is an uncommon pancreatic tumor with distinct clinicopathologic features. SPNs are characterized by mutations in exon 3 of CTNNB1. However, little is known about the gene and microRNA expression profiles of SPNs. Thus, we sought to characterize SPN-specific gene expression and identify the signaling pathways activated in these tumors. The mRNA expression profile of 14 SPNs, 6 pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PCAs), 6 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), and five non-neoplastic pancreatic tissues were analyzed.
