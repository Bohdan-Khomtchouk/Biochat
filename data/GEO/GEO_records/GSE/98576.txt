TITLE
Global transcriptional responce in C.elegans on a high glucose diet

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We compared differential gene expression in C. elegans on a regular and 2% glucose supplemented diet.

DESIGN
Worms grown on NGM plates seeded with E.coli OP50 till L4 stage, trensferred on NGM or NGM+2% glucose, incubated over night at 20oC, and collected for RNA-seq library preparation.
