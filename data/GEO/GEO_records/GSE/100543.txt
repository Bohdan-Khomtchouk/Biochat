TITLE
Affy MA Comparison of Porcine Esophageal Submucosal Glands (ESMGs), overlying squamous tissue, and ESMG-derived spheroids

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used to compare the transcriptome of esophageal submucosal gland (ESMG) derived spheroids in culture relative to squamous epithelium and fresh ESMGs.

DESIGN
We analyzed analyzed ESMGs, squamous tissue, and ESMG-dervied in vitro spheroids using the Affymetrix PorGene-1_0-st platform.  Three biological replicates were used for each group, no technical replicates were used.
