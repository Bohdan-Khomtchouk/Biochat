TITLE
Detection of genes differentially expressed in radioresistant and radiosensitive tumors before and after irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nu61, a radiation-resistant human tumor xenograft, was selected from a parental radiosensitive tumor SCC-61 by eight serial cycles of passage in athymic nude mice and in vivo irradiation. Obtained tumors were profiled using Affymetrix U133A arrays. Most abundant gene pattern associated with radioresistant phenotype was presented by IFN-inducible, Stat1-dependent pathway Keywords: Pair-wise comparison of radiosensitive vs radioresistant tumors; time course of irradation response
