TITLE
Expression data from rho+ and rho0 budding yeast celles harvetsed from complete medium with 2% glucose before or after shifting to complete medium without glucose

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
This experiment compares mRNA expression in cells with and without mitochondrial DNA (ρ+ and ρ0 cells respectively). We used global RNA profiling to measure mRNA expression in ρ+ and ρ0 cells harvested at log phase from synthetic medium with glucose (CM + 2% glucose, " CMD " ), and at 4 hours after transfer to the same medium without glucose (CM). This profiling provided new clues about the ways in which nutirent signaling is reprogrammed in cells lacking mitocondrial DNA.

DESIGN
mRNA expression was assessed by analyzing the RNA from three biological replicates obtained under four conditions: ρ+ cells in glucose, ρ+ cells no glucose, ρ0 cells in glucose, ρ0 cells no glucose.
