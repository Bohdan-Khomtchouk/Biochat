TITLE
Expression data from different B cell subsets in peripheral blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found the presence of CD19hi and CD19lo B cell populations in the periphery of SLE and pemphigus patientsï¼Œas well as human secondary lymphoid organs. In addition, CD19hi B cells and CD19lo B cells can be induced in vitro with the help of activated CD4+T cells. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression of CD19hi and CD19lo B cells and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes between them.

DESIGN
we established an in vitro CD4+ T and B cells co-culture system to mimic the bilateral T-B cell interaction. Purified human CD4+ T cells were stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads for 24 hrs and co-cultured with autologous B cells. After 3 days, CD19hi and CD19lo B cells were purified.
