TITLE
Widespread regulation of gene expression by the histone acetyltransferase dTip60

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression changes following RNAi knock-down of dTip60 in Drosophila SL2 cells

DESIGN
We compared SL2 cells treated with dTip60-RNAi with SL2 cells mock-treated with eGFP-RNAi to determine global gene expression changes by microarray analysis
