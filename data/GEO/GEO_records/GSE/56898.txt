TITLE
RECK Controls Breast Cancer Metastasis by Modulating a Convergent, STAT3-dependent Neoangiogenic Switch

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metastasis leads to the majority of deaths in breast cancer patients. Here we investigated the molecular and biochemical signaling pathways altered by RECK, a major metastasis suppressor gene in breast cancer.  We overexpressed RECK in 2 highly invasive cell lines and knocked-down RECK expression in 2 poorly invasive cell lines. IPA analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed IL-6, and IL8 signaling alteration with RECK pertubation. This lead us to discover that RECK suppresses metastasis and neoangiogenesis at secondary sites by inhibiting STAT3 dependent VEGF & uPA regulating. This finding is significant because it reveals the biology behind a major metastasis suppressor gene in cancer.

DESIGN
Cell lines were obtained from the ATCC or were generous gifts from Dr Joan Massague (MSKCC). Invasive cell lines were stably infected with a constitutively expressing RECK construct or and Empty Vector control. Poorly invasive cell lines were transfected with a Scramble siRNA or siRNA targeting the RECK gene. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Expression analysis was performed using the Affymetrics U133 2.0 microarray (Affymetrix). Affymetrix CEL files were imported into the Partek Genomics Suite (Partek).
