TITLE
Transcriptome of new DGCR8_KO mouse embryonic stem cells generated by paired CRISPR/Cas9 approach

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goals of this study was to obtain the trasncriptome of DGCR8_KO mESCs to compare it with the transcriptome of WT mESCs (deposit separately).

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of DGCR8_KO mouse embryonic stem cells were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
