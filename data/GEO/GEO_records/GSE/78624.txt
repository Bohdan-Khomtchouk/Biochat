TITLE
polyA mRNA RNA-seq from HT1080 (ENCSR067UNX)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from nuclear fractions of a fibrosarcoma immortalized cell line HT1080 derived from the connective tissue from a 35 year old male. They are stranded PE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted Poly-A+ RNA > 200 nucleotides in size.
