TITLE
The antimicrobial peptide-sensing system aps of Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Coxiella burnetii

SUMMARY
Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of hospital-associated infections. In addition, highly virulent strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are currently spreading outside health care settings. Survival in the human host is largely defined by the ability of S. aureus to resist mechanisms of innate host defense, of which antimicrobial peptides form a key part especially on epithelia and in neutrophil phagosomes. Here we demonstrate that the antimicrobial-peptide sensing system aps of the standard community-associated MRSA strain MW2 controls resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides. The core of aps-controlled resistance mechanisms comprised the D-alanylation of teichoic acids (dlt operon), the incorporation of cationic lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (L-PG) in the bacterial membrane (mprF), and the vraF/vraG putative antimicrobial peptide transporter. Further, the observed increased production of L-PG under the influence of cationic antimicrobial peptides was accompanied by the up-regulation of lysine biosynthesis. In noticeable difference to the aps system of S. epidermidis, only selected antimicrobial peptides strongly induced the aps response. Heterologous complementation with the S. epidermidis apsS gene indicated that this is likely caused by differences in the short extracellular loop of ApsS that interacts with the inducing antimicrobial peptide. Our study shows that the antimicrobial peptide sensor system aps is functional in the important human pathogen S. aureus, significant interspecies differences exist in the induction of the aps gene regulatory response, and aps inducibility is clearly distinguishable from effectiveness towards a given antimicrobial peptide.
