TITLE
Vehicle and sAPPalpha-treated hippocampal slice cultures

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes induced by alpha-secretase cleaved amyloid precursor protein (sAPPalpha) in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures of male, postnatal day 15 mice (C57B6/SJL).  Hippocampal slice cultures were treated with phosphate buffered saline (GSM26700, GSM26701, GSM26702) or 1 nM sAPPalpha (GSM26703, GSM26704, GSM26705) for 24 h.  Each sample consists of total RNA isolated from 8-12 slices from 4 mice.  Data were analyzed with MAS 5.0 and scaled to 2500.  sAPPalpha induces the amyloid sequestration protein transthyretin, insulin-like growth factor 2, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2, and other genes involved in protective pathways such as apoptosis inhibition, detoxification, and retinol transport.
