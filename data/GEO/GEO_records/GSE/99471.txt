TITLE
SNP genotype data from induced Pluripotent Stem cells from Parkinson's Disease patients harboring mutations in the GBA1 gene, and from healthy control donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have generated human induced Pluripotent Stem cells (hiPSc) using Retroviral and Sendai virus-mediated delivery of reprogramming factors. hiPSc lines have been screened using SNP array to assess chromosomal stability (alongside the fibroblast lines from which they were derived), and validation of the pluripotency of the hiPSc lines is provided by Pluritest assessment of transcriptome datasets, prior to differentiation and downstream assays. Proteomic analysis of GBA1 patient-derived dopaminergic neurons reveal impeded neurite outgrowth.

DESIGN
human iPSc lines were derived from human dermal fibroblasts from PD patients harboring the mutation N370S in GBA1, and control donors. SNP datasets were generated from 7 previously unpublished iPSC clones and the fibroblasts from which they were derived
