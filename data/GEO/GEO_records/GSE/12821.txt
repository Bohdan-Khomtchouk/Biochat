TITLE
p53- repressed miRNAs are involved with E2F in a feed forward loop promoting proliferation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There is a distinctive miRNA expression profile between early (young) and replicative senescence (old). We observed a cluster of miRNAs that were repressed upon senescence in both MRC-5 and WI-38 fibroblast cells.

DESIGN
miRNAs profiling in young and senescence human emryonic fibroblasts (MRC-5 and WI-38)
