TITLE
Expression data obtained from  primary dermal papilla cell cultures and human hair follicle organ culture from occipital scalp

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from  primary dermal papilla cell cultures and human hair follicle organ culture from occipital scalp

DESIGN
6 Total samples were analyzed.  We compare  the expression data obtained from  primary dermal papilla cell cultures and human hair follicle organ culture from occipital scalp. Probe set summarization and normalization was performed by robust multi-array averaging (RMA, including background subtraction, summarization by median polish and quantile normalization) using the R/Bioconductor package affy.
