TITLE
Massive dysregulation of genes involved in cell signaling and placental development in cloned cattle conceptus and maternal endometrium

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
A major unresolved issue in the cloning of mammals by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is the mechanism by which the process fails after embryos are transferred to the uterus of recipients, prior to or during the implantation window. We investigated this problem by using RNA-seq to compare the transcriptomes in cattle conceptuses produced by SCNT and artificial insemination (AI) at d18 (pre-implantation) and d34 (post-implantation) of gestation. In addition, endometrium was profiled in order to identify the communication pathways that might be affected by the presence of a cloned conceptus, ultimately leading to mortality prior to or during the implantation window. At d18, the effects on the transcriptome associated with SCNT were massive, involving more than 5,000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among them are 121 genes that have embryonic lethal phenotypes in mice, cause defects in trophoblast and placental development, and/or affect conceptus survival in mice. In endometria at d18, < 0.4% of expressed genes were affected by the presence of a cloned conceptus, whereas at d34, ~36% and < 0.7% of genes were differentially expressed in intercaruncular and caruncular tissues, respectively. Functional analysis of DEGs in placental and endometrial tissues suggests a major disruption of signaling between the cloned conceptus and the endometrium, particularly the intercaruncular tissue. Our results support a bottleneck model for cloned conceptus survival during the peri-implantation period determined by gene expression levels in extra-embryonic tissues and the endometrial response to altered signaling from clones.
