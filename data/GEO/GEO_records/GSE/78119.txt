TITLE
De novo transcriptome analysis profiles gene expression in Vanessa cardui wing patterns

ORGANISM
Vanessa cardui

SUMMARY
Butterfly wing patterns are an important model for studying the genetic basis of morphological evolution. Here we used RNA-seq expression profiling in the butterfly Vanessa cardui to characterize the transcriptional basis of wing pigmentation. This approach identified numerous candidate genes including known and suspected components of the insect melanin and ommochrome biosynthetic pathways.

DESIGN
mRNA profiling of hind wings from 5 developmental stages and Red/Black color regions in melanin stages of the painted lady butterfly (V. cardui), generated by deep sequencing with two replicates, using Illumina HiSeq 2500 for 150 bp paired end sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL21487 Illumina Hiseq 2500 (Vanessa cardui)
