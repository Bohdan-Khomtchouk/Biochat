TITLE
Transcriptomics of the traditional Japanese medicine juzentaihoto (JTX) on small intestines on germfree mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Juzehtaihoto, a Japanese traditional medicine has been used for the treatment of various kinds of disease or disorders in an enteric-flora dependent manner. Here, we performed transcriptome analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip on small intestine (SI) of germ-free (GF)  and specific pathogen free (SPF) mice of IQI, an inbred strain established from ICR.

DESIGN
Male germ-free (GF) and specific pathogen-free (SPF) IQI mice were bred and maintained in the laboratory of Central Institute for Experimental Animals (CIEA, Kawasaki, Kanagwa, Japan). GF mice were housed in a Trexler-type flexible film isolator in a standard germ free state and screened on a weekly basis for germ-free status by sampling feces sterilely and culturing on MRS-agar plates under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. All the GF, SPF, ex-GF mice were kept in a 12: 12-h light/dark cycle and at a temperature of 22±2°C. Nine week old mice (n=3) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the intestines were dissected. comparison of the mice with or without enteric flora
