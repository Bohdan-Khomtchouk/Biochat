TITLE
mRNA expression data from monkey PG-haESCs, ICSI-derived ESCs and somatic fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Haploid cells are amenable for genetic analysis because they contain only one set of chromosomes. Here,we report the derivation of haESCs from monkey parthenogenic blastocysts. These cells, which we designated PG-haESCs (parthenogenic haploid embryonic stem cells), express classical ESC markers, are pluripotent, and can differentiate to different cell lines from all three embryonic germ layers in vivo and in vitro. We used microarrays to compare the gene expression levels among PG-haESC, ICSI-derived ESCs and female monkey somatic fibroblasts.
