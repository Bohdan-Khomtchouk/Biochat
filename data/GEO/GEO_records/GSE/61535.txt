TITLE
The transcriptome of Legionella pneumophila-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the human monocyte-derived macrophage (hMDM)  transcriptional response to L. pneumophila infection at 8 hours post-infection We used microarrays to probe the hMDM transcriptional response to wild type L. pneumophila AA100 infection and its isogenic ankB and T2SS mutants. We identified up-regulation of innate immunity pathways and down-regulation of protein translation pathways

DESIGN
hMDMs were isolated from healthy donors and infected with L. pneumophila AA100 and its isogenic ankB and T2SS mutants for 8 h prior to isolation of total RNA and hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays.
