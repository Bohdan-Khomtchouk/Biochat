TITLE
Expression data from WT (Ws-2), CBF1,2,3, and CBF2Δc (a truncated CBF2) overexpression

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
CBF1, CBF2 and CBF3 regulons comprise nearly identical gene sets The vast majority of CBF2 regulon genes were down-regulated less that 50% by overexpression of CBF2Δc, a truncated version of CBF2

DESIGN
We used Affymetrix GeneChips to examine the CBF regulons of plants overexpressing CBF1, CBF2, CBF3 and a truncated version of CBF2, CBF2Δc.

PLATFORM
