TITLE
RNA-Seq data from ZR75-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the transcription factor Six1 directly increases the expression of many glycolytic genes by performing RNA sequencing using Six1 stable knockdown ZR75-1 breast cancer cell line and control cell line.

DESIGN
Examination of ZR75-1 cells stably infected with lentivirus carrying Six1 shRNA or control shRNA

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
