TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of planktonic stage to biofilm stage of deep sea bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913

ORGANISM
Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913

SUMMARY
We compared genetic profiles of  planktonic stage to biofilm stage of deep sea bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913 and revealed genetic features during switch from planktonic to pellicle stage in Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of  Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913 planktonic cells, initial pellicle cells and mature pellicle cells were generated by Illumina Hiseq2000.

PLATFORM
GPL21095 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913)
