TITLE
Nuclear mRNA quality control is bypassed for rapid export of stress responsive transcripts (Microarray)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Comparative analyses of Mex67 and Npl3 binding to mRNA at normal growth condition (25째C) and upon shift to heat stress (30 min, 42째C).

DESIGN
Comparative analyses of mRNA binding of Mex67, Npl3 and no tag control at normal growth condition (25째C) and upon heat stress (30 min, 42째C) via RNA Co-IP experiments. Respective co-purified mRNAs were subjected to cDNA  Microarray chips.
