TITLE
Sweet orange genes regulated by TAL effectors of Xanthomonas citri (Xc) or Xanthomonas aurantifolii pathotype C

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
Microarray analyses of sweet orange epicotyls transiently transfected with the pthA2, pthA4 or pthC1 gene, relative to epicotyls transfected with the uid gene (GUS) This experiment was used to identify sweet oragne genes regulated by TAL effectors

DESIGN
Citrus epicotyls were transformed with the TAL effector genes via Agrobacterium transfection, and mRNA was extrated and processed 72h after bacterial-plant incubation

PLATFORM
GPL5731 [Citrus] Affymetrix Citrus Genome Array
