TITLE
Identification of miRNAs correlated with Rb-depletion induced spherogenesis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that Rb inactivation induces sphere-forming activity under 3D culture condition in primary soft tissue sarcoma cells derived from p53 null mice. To elucidate molecular mechanism, we employed microRNA array as a discovery platform to identify miRNAs correlated with Rb-depeltion induced sphere-forming cells. To enrich sphere-forming cells and make the culture condition equivalent to that of parental cells (Primary cells), we replated sphere-forming cells on normal dishes (Rb shRNA Secondary cells), and obtained total RNA soon after replating.

DESIGN
In p53 null mice derived soft tissue sarcoma cells, control cells, Rb depleted cells and sphere forming cells derived from Rb depleted cells were measured. Two or three independent experiments were performed at each condition.
