TITLE
Genome-wide maps of H3K27ac localization in HUVECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
H3K27Ac is one of the expressed enhancer markers in endothelial cells, but its genomic localization is unknown.  This time, we established a new antibody for H3K27ac, and performed ChIP-seq to identify H3K27ac binding site in whole genome manner under hypoxia.

DESIGN
We used chromatin immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) of HUVECs treated with or without hypoxia (1%O2) for 24hours, then H3K27ac binding regions were identified.  Normoxia was used as a control condition.  HUVECs were used within the first 6 passages.
