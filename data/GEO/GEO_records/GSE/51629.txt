TITLE
Treatment of prostate cancer cell lines DU-145 and LNCaP with zebularine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cultures of DU-145 cells and of LNCaP cells were treated for 216 hours with 100µM zebularine (SIGMA) in three independent biological experiments. Zebularine acts as a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor thereby upregulating genes that are inactivated by e.g. promotor hypermethylation. The experiment aimed to search for upregulated transcripts to provide new targets for biomarker development and therapeutic use.

DESIGN
Total RNA of untreated and treated (100µM zebularine) DU-145 cells (experiment HK_21_DU_145-HK_26_DU_145), and of untreated and treated (100µM zebularine) LNCaP cells (experiment HK_27_LNCaP-HK_32_LNCaP), were subjected to Affymetrix array analysis to detail the overall expression changes after treatment with a DNMT inhibitor. Treated cells showed no obvious signs of zebularine-induced cytotoxicity as revealed by XTT assays.
