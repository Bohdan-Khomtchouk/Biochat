TITLE
Role of Pfn-1 phosphorylation in gene expression in glioma-associated endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in glioma-associated endothelial cells in Tie2-Cre,Pfn1fl/fl:Y129F and Pfn1fl/fl:Y129F mice We detected different gene expression patterns in the tumor-associated endothelial cells in Tie2-Cre,Pfn1fl/fl:Y129F and Pfn1fl/fl:Y129F mice

DESIGN
We analyzed RNA expression from 6 samples using the Affymetrix Mouse 2.0 ST platform.

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
