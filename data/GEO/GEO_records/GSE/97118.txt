TITLE
RNA-sequencing analysis of differentiating wildtype and Ezh2 deficient immature mouse chondrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Objective: To evalute the role of Ezh2 in chondrocyte differentiation. Method: Ezh2 was inactivated in chondrocytes using the Col2a1-Cre driver in vivo. Immature mouse chondrocytes (IMC) were isolated from wildtype and Ezh2 deficient mice, and plated in micromass culture. Chondrocytes were differentiated and RNA was isolated at days 3, 7, and 14 of culture. Isolated RNA was subjected to RNA sequencing analysis. Results: Ezh2 deficient chondrocytes exhibit enhanced expression of osteogenic genes compared to wildtype cells.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis of wildtype and Ezh2-deficient chondrocytes at days 3, 7, and 14 of differentiation.
