TITLE
LncRNA expression analysis of Clostridium butyricum-induced cell apoptosis in colon cancer SW480 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare lncRNAs and mRNAs expression profiles in colon cancer after co-cultured with CB  and without CB, we extracted total RNA of colon cancer cell line(SW480) after co-cultured with CB(SW480/CB) and paired control without CB(SW480/ctr), and identified the dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs using Agilent Human lncRNAs/mRNAs microarrays.
