TITLE
R. sphaeroides Δlov vs. R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 (singlet oxygen stress, aerobic conditions)

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of R. sphaeroides Δlov compared to control R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 under singlet oxygen stress, aerobic conditions

DESIGN
Two-strain experiment with overnight cultures of the wild type 2.4.1 and the Δlov mutant. Both were diluted to an OD660 of 0.2 and gassed to adjust aerobic conditions (≈ 170 µM O2). 0.2 µM of methylene blue was added to the cultures to act as photosensitizer. After one doubling time of growth in the darkness cells were illuminated with 800 W m-2 of white light for 7 min.
