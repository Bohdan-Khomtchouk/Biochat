TITLE
Gene expression analysis of samples from a phase II clinical trial of decitatbine in combination with carboplatin in patients with recurrent, platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression (by Affymetrix GeneChip Human 1.0ST) profiling of biopsy samples from recurrent, platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer patients before and after treatment of decitabine in combination with carboplatin.  The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in PBMC (14 paired samples), tumor (8 paired samples) and ascites (6 paired samples) (GSE31826).

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from patient biopsies (tumor or ascites) using TRIzol reagent, cRNA was generated, labeled and hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip Human GENE 1.0 ST arrays
