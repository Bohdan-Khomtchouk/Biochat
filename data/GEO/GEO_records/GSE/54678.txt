TITLE
A pivotal role of SRC-2 in Metastatic and Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SRC-2 is frequently amplified or overexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer patients. In this study, we used genetically engineered mice, overexpressing SRC-2 specifically in the prostate epithelium as a mouse model to examine the role of SRC-2 in prostate tumorigenesis. Over-expression of SRC-2 in PTEN heterozygous mice accelerates PTEN mutation induced tumor progression and develops a metastasis-prone cancer. We used microarrays to examine the molecular profile of prostate-specific SRC-2 overexpression adult dorsal-lateral prostate in comparison with that of control PTENF/+ heterozygous deletion  mice.

DESIGN
total RNA was extracted from dorsal-lateral prostate of 7 months old-PTEN flox/+ control and PTEN flox/+; Rosa26-SRC-2 OE/+ adult mice, followed by gene expression profiling using Affymetrix microarrays. Each sample contains pooled prostate RNA from 3 mice.
