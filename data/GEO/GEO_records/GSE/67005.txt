TITLE
Aflatoxin B1 exposure induces epigenetic mechanisms in primary human hepatocytes revealing novel biological processes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (MeDIP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study investigated differential gene expression, microRNA expression and DNA methylation changes in a pool of primary human hepatocyte RNA and DNA following 5 days of repetitive exposure to a low or moderate dose of aflatoxin B1 or DMSO. Three biological replicates per compound/solvent. In total 9 arrays.

DESIGN
In total 9 arrays.
