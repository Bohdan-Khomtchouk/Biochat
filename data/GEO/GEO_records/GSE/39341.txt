TITLE
microRNA expression data from human corneal epithelial cells exposed to media, human tear, media + P. aeruginosa antigens, tear + P. aeruginosa antigens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exposure to tear fluid can enhance corneal epithelial cells' ability to resist bacterial virulence mechanisms by upregulating epithelial-derived innate defense genes. The aim of this study was to further elucidate the mechanisms by which tear fluid modulates epithelial cell susceptibility to P. aeruginosa internalization and the relationship to known to be upregulated genes with tear fluid exposure. The hypothesis tested was that tear fluid effects on epithelial cells involve the induction of microRNA expression to modify innate defense gene responses to bacterial challenge.

DESIGN
Human corneal epithelial cells were incubated in either 40 ul of fresh human tear fluid or high calcium KGM without antibiotics for 16 hours before extraction or before incubation with P. aeruginosa antigens for 3 h then extraction.
