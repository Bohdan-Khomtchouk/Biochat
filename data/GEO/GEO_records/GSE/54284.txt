TITLE
Expression data from human kidney cells (HK2) knocked down for OCRL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify the effects of OCRL depletion on the proximal tubular renal cells transcriptome, we performed Affymetrix Gene-Chip hybridization experiments Transcriptome analysis of the proximal tubular cells depleted of OCRL

DESIGN
For the analysis on proximal tubular cells depleted of OCRL, total RNA was extracted from the HK2 cells of three independent experiments; RNA extracted also from HK2 treated siRNA-non targeting used as control.
