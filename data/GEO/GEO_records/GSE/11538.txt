TITLE
The association between gene expression and whole genome histone H3K4 mono-, di, and trimethylation: expression data

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
These microarrays are part of a study where a comparison was made between the change in transcription and H3K4 mono-, di-, and tri-methylation levels (via ChIP-seq) in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome when plants are subjected to water deficit stress. Water deficit stress causes a large number of genes to change their transcript levels, which provided a large set of genes to examine for corresponding chromatine changes. Keywords: stress response
