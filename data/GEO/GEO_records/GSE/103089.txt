TITLE
Microarray whole transcriptome profiling of Sepantronium bromide (YM-155) treated MDA-MB-231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sepantronium bromide (YM-155) is believed to trigger apoptosis in tumor cells by inducing a major reduction in baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing 5 (BIRC 5) also known as survivin. In MDA-MB-231 cells, the toxic effects of YM-155 were equi potent to standard chemotherapy drugs , having an LC50 < 50ng/ml. In this study we investigate whole transcriptome changes occurring at 8 hours of incubation with YM-155, preceding apoptosis as well as at a 20 hour time point. Microarrays were acquired for mRNAs and long intergenic non-coding RNA transcripts using the GeneChipâ„¢ Human Gene 2.1 ST Arrays by Affymetrix Inc.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells grown under variable experimental treatment; 2 time points; triplicates

PLATFORM
GPL17692 [HuGene-2_1-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.1 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
