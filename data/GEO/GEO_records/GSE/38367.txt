TITLE
UGT2B17 knock down in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell line MEC-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression after stable shRNA induced knock down of UGT2B17 and scrambled shRNA in the cell line model MEC-1. Transfection was performed using lentiviral particles, RNA was harvested after culture for 2 weeks. Results provide insight into functional UGT2B17 involvement in CLL cells.

DESIGN
Knock down of UGT2B17 in comparison to scrambled shRNA in three independent replicates each.
