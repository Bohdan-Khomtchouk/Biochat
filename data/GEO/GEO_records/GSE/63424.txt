TITLE
Sequencing of First-strand cDNA Library Reveals Full-length Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We developed a new method of preparing libraries for strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-Seq). It employs Direct Ligation of Adaptors to First-strand cDNA (DLAF). We compared ssRNA-Seq libraries prepared using either the DLAF and dUTP methods from mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) and libraries were sequenced from one end or both ends. We also conducted a comparison of ssRNA-Seq libraries prepared using DLAF and ScriptSeq v2 kit (Epicenter) from mouse embryonic cortex (mECx).

DESIGN
RNA was isolated using either Trizol or Qiagen Rneasy kit. rRNA is depleted using Eukaryote Ribominus v2 kit and libraries were prepared using one of the methods.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
