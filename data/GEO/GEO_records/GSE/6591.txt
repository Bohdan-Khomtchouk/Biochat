TITLE
Comparative analysis of gene expression in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J aging lungs.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesize that gene expression in the aging lungs of these two strains of mice are divergent thus contributing to the disparity in the phenotypes. More specifically, (1) Aging DBA/2J mice compared to aging C57BL/6  mice are known to be accelerated in their lung physiology and morphometry; (2) C57BL/6J are known to have longer natural longevity than DBA/2J mice. In order to test these hypotheses at the gene expression level, we utilized microarray analysis to examine transcriptional differences between aging lungs of both strains of mice. Keywords: comparative expression profiling
