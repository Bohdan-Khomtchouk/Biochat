TITLE
Aplysia Pleural Ganglia 24 Hours After Long-Term Habituation Training

ORGANISM
Aplysia californica

SUMMARY
We used a custom-designed microarray and qPCR to characterize the persistent transcriptional response to long-term habituation training in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica.  Aplysia were exposed to either 3 days of spaced long-term habituation training (10 rounds of stimulation/day; each round = 15 min brushing at a 10s ISI; 15 min rest between rounds); a matched set of controls was not exposed to any brushing (n = 8/group).  While reflex responsiveness remained stable in controls, trained animals exhibited a large reduction in siphon-withdrawal duration that was evident at stimulation sites across the entire dorsal surface of the body (head, tail, and siphon).  This habituation was retained for at least 24 hours after the end of training.  Immediately after 24 hour retention tests, pleural ganglia were harvested from each trained animal and its matched control.  The pleural ganglia contain the VC nociceptors, which we confirmed are activated by the brush stimulus used to produce habituation.  Microarray analysis from 8 biological replicates suggests that long-term habituation training persistently regulates 21 transcripts.  We used qPCR to test a subset of these transcripts and found persistent regulation of an putative Aplysia cornichon homolog.

DESIGN
Between-subjects comparison of a trained animal to a matched control (matching based on duration of pre-test responsiveness).  Conducted with 8 biological replicates, meaning 8 arrays, each comparing 1 trained and 1 matched control.
