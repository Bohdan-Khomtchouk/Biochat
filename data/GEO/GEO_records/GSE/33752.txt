TITLE
Mycobacterium tuberculosis Growth After Aerobic Expression of the DosR Regulon

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression of M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv:deltaRv3133c::pEXNF-3133c following ectopic expression of a plasmid-borne copy of wildtype Rv3133c compared the same strain with Rv3133c uninduced. The M. tuberculosis H37Rv:deltaRv3133c was originally described in Mol Microbiol. 2003 May; 48(3): 833â€“843.

DESIGN
A six chip experiment in which total RNA from H37Rv:deltaRv3133c::pEXNF-3133c was collected after 24 hours of treatment with chemical expression inducer or vehicle control.  Three separate cultures/biological replicates were interrogated for both induced and uninduced samples.  Labeled cDNA was hybridized to NimbleGen spotted oligo tiling arrays covering both strands of the M. tuberculosis genome at ~200 bp intervals between 60-mer probes.
