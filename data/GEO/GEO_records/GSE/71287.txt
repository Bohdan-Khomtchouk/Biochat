TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of  fungus Penicillium oxalicum and its laeA deletion strains in 24h and 60h

ORGANISM
Penicillium oxalicum

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to compare differential gene expressions for Penicillium oxalicum wild type strain (WT), and laeA knockout strain (ΔlaeA) in different development phase. The deletion of laeA downregulated genes involved in oxidation- reduction process, alkaloid metabolic process, and transmembrane transport. We find the expression levels of seven secondary metabolism gene clusters (totally 28 clusters) were silenced inΔlaeA. This study provides the information that laeA function are required in conidiation and hydrolase activity of P. oxalicum.

DESIGN
Examination of differential gene expressions by digital gene expression tag profiling in Penicillium oxalicum wild type strain and laeA knockout mutant strains in 24h and 60h in modified Czapek culture medium with 2% glucose as carbon resource. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays.
