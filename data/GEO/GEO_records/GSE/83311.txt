TITLE
RNA-seq analyses of ID4-EGFP+ undifferentiated spermatogonia and sorted subpopulations.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
P6 ID4-EGFP+ undifferentiated spermatogonia, including those stained robustly (high) or weakly (low) for TSPAN8 were isolated by FACS.

DESIGN
Three replicate preparations of each population were used for independent RNA-seq using SMART-seq v4, Nextera XT libraries, Hiseq2500 sequencing, and TopHat/Bowtie/Cufflinks analyses.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
