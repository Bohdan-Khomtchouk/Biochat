TITLE
The Heritage (HEalth, RIsk factors, exercise Training And GEnetics) family study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The overall objective of the heritage project is to study the role of the genotype in cardiovascular,metabolic and hormonal responses to aerobic exercise training and the contribution of regular exercise to changes in several cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk factors.

DESIGN
The study cohort in this analysis consists of 473 Caucasian subjects (230 male and 243 female) from 99 nuclear families who completed ≥58 of the prescribed 60 exercise-training sessions.The phenotypic expression of each individual’s genotype is assessed under two well-defined environmental conditions, the pre- and post-training conditions. Here we have made the pre-training data available as used in the article Phillips BE, Williams JP, Gustafsson T, Bouchard C, Rankinen T, et al. (2013) Molecular Networks of Human Muscle Adaptation to Exercise and Age. PLoS Genet 9(3): e1003389. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1003389 52 U133+2 profiles (17–63 yr) generated from pre-exercise muscle biopsy samples from the HERITAGE Family Study. Heritage_pre dataset.
