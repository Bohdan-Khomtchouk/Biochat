TITLE
Genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions in purified quiescent S. cerevisiae cells [MNase-Seq]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Nucleosome positions were determined for purified S. cerevisiae quiescent cells and compared to logarithmically growing cells. By analyzing nucleosome positions and MNase digestion patterns for two separate matched digestion amounts (~80% and ~50% mononucleosomes) we show that global nucleosome stabilization and repositioning occurs at transcription start sites. This repositioning indicates a repressive chromatin architecture that reflects global transcriptional shutoff in quiescent yeast.

DESIGN
Two matched MNase digests from two independent prototrophic W303 isolates during log growth (OD600=0.4-0.6) or from purified quiescent cells (pellet in Percoll gradient from 7-day stationay phase cultures) were subject to paired-end sequencing.
