TITLE
Expression data of statin treated HUVEC cells transfected siRNA KLF2 or KLF4.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KLF2 and KLF4 are important transcriptional factors in endothelial cells, however their roles in statin treatment has not been elucidated. Here we report the comprehensive change of transcripts of statin treated HUVECs transfected with  siRNA KLF2 or KLF4. We used repeated microarray analysis of HUVECs treated with pitavastatin for 4hours. Before statin treatment, cells were transfected with siRNA KLF2 or KLF4.

DESIGN
HUVECs were used within the first 6 passages.  For studies, HUVECs were cultivated in medium EGM2MV containing pitavastatin at a concentration of 1 micromolar.
