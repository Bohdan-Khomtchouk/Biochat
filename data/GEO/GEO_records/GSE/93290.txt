TITLE
Differentially expressed genes after miRNA or siRNA transfection in human cancer cell lines (A-498, 786-O, A549, TE-8, PANC-1, SW1990, PC3 and PC3M)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes by anti cancer treatments (microRNAs or siRNAs) in human cancer, several cell lines ( renal cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, esophageal, pancreatic and prostate cancer) were subjected to Agilent whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Human cell lines (A-498, 786-O, A549, TE-8, PANC-1, SW1990, PC3 and PC3M) were treated with miRNAs (miR-10a-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-150-3p, miR-148a-5p, miR-148a-3p, miR-499a-5p, miR-455-3p and miR-455-5p), siRNAs (si-ANLN).
