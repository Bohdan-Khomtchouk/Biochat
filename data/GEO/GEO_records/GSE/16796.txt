TITLE
Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 Sheds Light on the Role of Phytochromes in Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
A great majority of plants synchronize flowering with day length. In rice, the most important environmental cue that triggers flowering is the photoperiod. Here, we show that the s73 mutant, identified in a gamma irradiated Bahia collection, displays early flowering and photoperiodic insensitivity due to a null mutation in the SE5 gene, which encodes an enzyme implicated in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis. s73 mutant plants showed a number of alterations in the characteristic diurnal expression patterns of master genes involved in photoperiodic control of flowering, resulting in up-regulation of Hd3a, the most important floral integrator. Ehd1, an additional rice floral activator, was also highly expressed in the s73 mutant, suggesting that SE5 represses Ehd1 in wild-type plants. Silencing of Ehd1 in both Bahia and s73 backgrounds implies that SE5 regulates Ehd1 expression. The data also indicate that SE5 confers photoperiodic sensitivity through regulation of Hd1. These results provide direct evidence that phytochromes inhibit flowering affecting both Hd1 and Ehd1  flowering pathways.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates from each genotype (s73 mutant and Bahia wt) were labelled with Cy3 and Cy5 alternatively (2+2) following a dye-swap design. In total, 4 microarrays were hybridized. The supplementary file 'GSE16796_stat_analysis.txt' contains the final statistical analysis of study GSE16796.
