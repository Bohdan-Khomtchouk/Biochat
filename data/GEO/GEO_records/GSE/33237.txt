TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of small RNAs in sorghum under abiotic stresses

ORGANISM
Sorghum bicolor

SUMMARY
To identify novel miRNA and NAT-siRNAs that are associated with abiotic stresses in sorghum, we generated small RNA sequences from sorghum seedlings that grew under control and under dought, salt, and cold stress treatments.

DESIGN
sequencing of small RNAs in sorghum under control, drought, salt, and cold stress conditions.
