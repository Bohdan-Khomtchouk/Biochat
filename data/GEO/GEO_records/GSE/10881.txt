TITLE
Properties of mammalian neural progenitor cells as revealed by genome-wide single cell gene expression profiles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cellular diversity of the brain is largely attributed to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of progenitor cells. In mammalian cerebral development, it has been difficult to determine how neural progenitor cells are heterogeneous, due to their dynamic changes in nuclear position and gene expression. To address this issue, we systematically analyzed the cDNA profiles of a large number of single progenitor cells at the mid-embryonic stage. Keywords: single cell analysis

DESIGN
We randomly picked up single cells from the ventricular zone(VZ)/subventricular zone (SVZ) of E14 mouse dorsal forebrain, and a total of 102 single-cell cDNA samples were amplified as descibed (Kurimoto et al.Nucreic Acid Res.34:e42, 2006).  After checking the quality of the samples, we then chose 70 samples and applied them to GeneChip analysis.
