TITLE
Dexamethasone treatment of VCaP prostate cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The treatment of advanced prostate cancer has been transformed by novel antiandrogen therapies such as enzalutamide.  We identified glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity as modulator of enzalutamite sensitivity in the VCaP prostate cancer cell line.  The GR agonist dexamethasone was sufficient to confer enzalutamide resistance whereas a GR antagonist restored sensitivity.  These expression profiling data demonstrate that GR transcriptional activity overlaps with that of AR in the VCAP model.

DESIGN
VCAP cells growing in complete media were treated with the indicated drugs in biological triplicates for 24 hours prior to harvest.
