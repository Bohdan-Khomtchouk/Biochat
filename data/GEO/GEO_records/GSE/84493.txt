TITLE
Pre-processing method comparison on Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChips array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study is trying to provide guildeline on how to identify the most optimal pre-processing method for  Illumina HumanMethylation450k BeadChips array on prostate cancer dataset.

DESIGN
In total, we have methylation profiles for 310 samples (corresponding to 202 unique samples). Out of the 202 unique samples, 71 samples were repeated twice, 14 samples repeated three times, 3 samples repeated four times.

PLATFORM
