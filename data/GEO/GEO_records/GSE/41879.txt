TITLE
Gene expression analysis of murine SAMHD1 deficient peritoneal macrophages (S1056 to S1075)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate responses of myeloid cells to SAMHD1 deficiency in the absence of exogenous viral infection, we performed global gene expression analysis of SAMHD1 deficient macrophages.

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages from 10 mutants and 10 controls were FACS sorted. Isolated RNA was subjected to next generation mRNA sequencing.

PLATFORM
