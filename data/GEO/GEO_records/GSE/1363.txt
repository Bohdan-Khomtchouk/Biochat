TITLE
Gene expression in T1alpha null mutant lungs compared to wild type at dpc 18.5 and term

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression in T1alpha (-/-) lungs vs wild type at dpc 18.5 when the phenotype is moderate and at term when the phenotype is more severe. Lungs present narrow and irregular alveolar spaces, thicker mesenchyme, reduced number of attenuated type I cells, normal numbers of type II cells and secreted surfactant. At term, but not a dpc 18.5, there is increased proliferation of distal cells. We compared gene expression of T1alpha null mutant lungs to wild type lungs at dpc 18.5. The mutant phenotype at this developmental stage is moderate but the alveolar sacs are narrower than normal. Keywords: other
