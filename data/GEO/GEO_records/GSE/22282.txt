TITLE
Mature dendritic cells under hypoxic condition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells whose activity is intrinsically linked to the microenvironment. Hypoxia is a condition of low oxygen tension occurring in inflammatory tissues that creates a special microenvironment conditioning cell physiology. We studied the effects of hypoxia on the differentiation of human monocytes into DCs and maturation into mature DCs. Mature DCs were differentiated in vitro from human monocytes under normoxic or hypoxic  conditions and the gene expression profile was determined.

DESIGN
The expression profile of mature dendritic cells under normoxia vs hypoxia was studied. Three healthy donors were used as biologial replicates.
