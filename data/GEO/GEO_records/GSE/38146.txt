TITLE
Effects of dietary fat types on growth performance, pork quality, and gene expression in growing-finishing pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
This study was performed to determine the effects of dietary fat sources, i.e., beef tallow, soybean oil, olive oil and coconut oil (each 3% in feed), on the growth performance, meat quality and gene expression in growing-finishing pigs. The results of this study indicate that the type of dietary fat affects fatty acid composition and insulin signaling-related gene expression in the longissimus dorsi muscle of pigs.

DESIGN
Effects of dietary fat types on meat quantity, meat quality and gene expression in pig.
