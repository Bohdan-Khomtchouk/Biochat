TITLE
Characterization of an Arabidopsis mutant deficient in the non-phosphorylating of GAPN gene.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN) is a conserved protein found in higher plants. In photosynthetic cells, the enzyme is involved in a shuttle transfer mechanism to export NADPH from the chloroplast to the cytosol. In this work, we demonstrate that GAPN gene express in leaves and roots at similar levels; showing the highest level of expression in flowers. To investigate the role of this enzyme in different plant tissues, we characterized a mutant from Arabidopsis thaliana having an insertion at the GAPN gene locus. The homozygous mutant was determined to be null respect to GAPN, as it exhibited complete absence of both expression of GAPN mRNA and enzyme activity. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the insertion mutant plant shows altered expression of several enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Significantly, cytosolic phosphorylating (NAD-dependent) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels are induced in the mutant, which correlates with an increase in enzyme activity. mRNA levels and enzymatic activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were also elevated, correlating with an increase in NADPH concentration. Moreover, an increased levels of oxidative stress was measured in the mutant plants. Downregulation of several glycolytic and photosynthetic genes suggests that GAPN is important for the efficiency of both metabolic processes. The results presented demonstrate that GAPN has a relevant role in plant growth and development. Keywords: 2 color experiment in triplicate including dye-swap
