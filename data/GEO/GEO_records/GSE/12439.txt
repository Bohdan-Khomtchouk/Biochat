TITLE
Genomic profiling of chondrosarcoma: chromosomal patterns in central and peripheral tumors (BAC/CGH)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA copy number analysis of 67 fresh frozen chondrosarcoma biopsies using 32k BAC and 244k oligo array CGH. Genomic imbalances, in most tumors affecting large regions of the genome, were found in 90% of the cases. Although rare, recurrent amplifications were found at 8q24.21-q24.22 and 11q22.1-q22.3, and homozygous deletions of loci previously implicated in chondrosarcoma development affected the CDKN2A, EXT1 and EXT2 genes. Keywords: chondrosarcoma, array comparative genomic hybridization
