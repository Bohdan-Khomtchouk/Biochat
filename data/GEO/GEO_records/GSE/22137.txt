TITLE
Expression profiles of the hippocampus of Rsk2-KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Coffinâ€“Lowry Syndrome (CLS) is a syndromic form of mental retardation caused by loss of function mutations in the X-linked RPS6KA3 gene, which encodes Rsk2, a serine/threonine kinase involved in spatial memory. We analyzed hippocampal gene expression profiles  in Rsk2-KO mice to identify changes in molecular pathways. Total RNA was extracted from hippocampi from 6 KO and 6 WT (littermates) 2-month-old male mice. For each genotype, equivalent amounts of RNA from 2 mice were pooled and processed for hybridization to the genome wide oligonucleotide microarray (Murine 430A 2.0 Affymetrix, 22.000 probe sets). Thus, 3 independent pooled samples were hybridized for each genotype.

DESIGN
We compared hippocampal gene expression profiles from rsk2-KO and normal littermate mice to identify changes in molecular pathways
