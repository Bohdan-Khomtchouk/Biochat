TITLE
Expression data in response to Xoo. bacterial infection in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In response to bacterial infection, early transcriptional re-programming occurs in the host plant. We used microarrays to analyse the global transcriptomic response to Xoo. infection in a resistant rice cultivar (IR24). This was analysed in parallel with microarrays examining Xoo infection in a susceptible rice cultivar (IRBB21) as well as in response to Xoc [GSE19239], viral [GSE11025], parasite [GSE10373] and fungal [GSE7256, GSE18361] infections in rice, in order to identify common and distinct responses to biotic stress.

DESIGN
Xoo (strain PXO71) was used to infect 35-day old plants (cv. IR24 and IRBB21) and leaf samples were collected at 24 h and 96 h after infection.
