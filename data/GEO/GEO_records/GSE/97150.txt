TITLE
Genexpression of murine mesothelioma cell lines AC29 and AB1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA from two murine mesothelioma cell lines (AC29 and AB1) was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix Microarrays to compare gene expression. Both mesothelioma cell lines were established following intraperitoneal introduction of crocidolite (asbestos) fibers (Davis et al. 1992) in CBA mice (AC29 cell line), and BALB/c mice (AB1).

DESIGN
AB1 (passage #40) and AC29 (passage #60) cell lines were cultured in 3 T75 flasks per cell line and were harvested at 80% confluency after RNA was extracted from each flask and hybridized to Affymetrix Microarrays.
