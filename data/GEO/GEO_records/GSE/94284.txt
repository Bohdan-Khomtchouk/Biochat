TITLE
RNA-sequencing based analysis of Listeria monocytogenes 10403S::ΔBCHL Prha-sigB and ΔBCHL Prha

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes 10403S

SUMMARY
In this study, RNA-seq was used to compare the transcriptomes of Listeria monocytogenes 10403S::ΔBCHL Prha-sigB and ΔBCHL Prha. RNA-seq was performed on ΔBCHL Prha-sigB and ΔBCHL Prha RNA samples representing three independent biological replicates at log phase in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth under rhamnose induction. Indexed and purified cDNA libraries (6 libraries including 3 replicates for 2 strains) were loaded together onto an independent flow cell without any other samples; sequencing was carried out by running Hiseq 2500 (single-end, 150-bp per read). Reads alignment was carried out using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA). Differential expression of genes in different strains was statistically assessed using the BaySeq method. To identify sigB-dependent promoters, a method of moving sliding windows of 50 nt along the whole genome was used to compare the normalized RNA-seq coverage (NRC) between the two strains. Using the standard whole gene differential expression analysis, significant upregulation of 255 genes was found in the sigB overexpressing strain. While with the sliding windiow analysis, 18 σB-dependent promoters were newly identified.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiles of L. monocytogenes 10403S::ΔBCHL Prha-sigB and ΔBCHL Prha were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2500.
