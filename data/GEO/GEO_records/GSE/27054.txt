TITLE
Sex-linked differences in glyco-gene expression in thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This laboratory is focusing on to clarify the biologic relevance of a virulence factor known as trans-sialidase from Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of the Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis).

DESIGN
We are working with an enzyme able to directly transfer sialyl residues among macromolecules known as the trans-sialidase. It constitutes a virulence factor from Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of the Chagas' Disease the American trypanosomiasis. We described the ability of this virulence factor to induce thymocyte apoptosis in vivo that happens after silayl residue mobilization. The apoptosis is mediated by the thymic epithelial cells in the nurse cell complex. By employing the microarray approach we wish to analyze the gene expression induced in the thymus after TS treatment. Examination of differential expression in thymocytes between male and female mice of genes related to glycosylation. RNA samples (in triplicate) purified from thymocytes were analyzed by Glyco-gene Chip analysis.
