TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of breast cancer cells with Insulin like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study was carried out to identify the genes regulated upon IGFBP2 modulation in breast cancer. This will help to understand the molecular targets and biological pathways targeted by IGFBP2 in breast cancer.
