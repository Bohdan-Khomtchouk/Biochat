TITLE
Role of Notch receptors in ozone induced lung injury in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ozone is a highly toxic air pollutant and global health concern.  Mechanisms of genetic susceptibility to ozone-induced lung inflammation are not completely understood.  We hypothesized Notch3 and Notch4 are important determinants of susceptibility to ozone-induced lung inflammation.  Wild type (WT), Notch3 (Notch3-/-) and Notch4 (Notch4-/-) knockout mice were exposed to ozone (0.3 ppm) or filtered air for 6-72 hours.  Ozone increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein, a marker of lung permeability, in all genotypes, but significantly greater concentrations were found in Notch4-/- compared to WT and Notch3-/-.  Significantly greater mean numbers of BALF neutrophils were found in Notch3-/- and Notch4-/- mice compared to WT mice after ozone.  Expression of whole lung Tnf was significantly increased after ozone in all genotypes, and was significantly greater in Notch3-/- mice compared to WT.  Statistical analyses of the transcriptome identified differentially expressed gene networks between WT and knockout mice basally and after ozone, and included Trim30, a member of the inflammasome pathway, and Traf6, an inflammatory signaling member.  These novel findings are consistent with Notch3 and Notch4 as susceptibility genes for ozone-induced lung injury, and suggest that Notch receptors protect against innate immune inflammation.

DESIGN
Wild-type, Notch3 knockout, and Notch4 knockout mice at 7-13 weeks of age were exposed continuously to air or 0.3 ppm ozone for 6, 24, or 48 hours. Three biological replicates from individual animals were included in each exposure group from each genotype and samples hybridized to the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array (Affymetrix).
