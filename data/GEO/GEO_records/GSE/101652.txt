TITLE
comparative analysis of DNA methylation of soybean

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
In this study, comparative genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of the soybean CMS line NJCMS5A and its maintainer NJCMS5B were completed by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. The results showed that 3,527 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 485 differentially methylated genes (DMGs), including 353 high-credible methylated genes, 56 methylated genes coding unknown protein and 76 novel methylated genes with no known function were identified. Finally, 14 key DMGs were identified as potentially related to CMS in soybean.
