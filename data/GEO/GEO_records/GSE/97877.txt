TITLE
LaminB and H3K9me2 ChIP-seq During Mouse Cardiogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Progenitor cells require coordinated expression of lineage-specific programs, and the nuclear lamina has emerged as an important scaffold for organizing chromatin in many cell types. These ChIP-seq experiments accompany a study focused on defining nuclear organization changes during cardiac development. Specifically, these experiments map the binding sites of LaminB (a key nuclear lamina protein) and H3K9me2 (a histone modification enriched at the nuclear periphery) in mouse ESCs and ESC-derived cardiac myocytes. The observations of these experiments, within the context of the study, indicate that changes in the organization of key genes and cell-type specific genes occurs during cardiogenesis.

DESIGN
A total of 18 samples are included for the ChIP-seq experiments. These include: (2) biological replicate samples of ESC LaminB ChIP-seq; (2) biological replicate samples of CM LaminB ChIP-seq; (2) biological replicate samples of ESC H3K9me2 ChIP-seq; (2) biological replicate samples of CM H3K9me2 ChIP-seq; (1) ESC Input; (1) CM Input; (2) biological replicate samples of uninduced (minus tamoxifen) CMV-creERT Hdac3f/f LB1 ChIP-seq; (2) biological replicate samples of uninduced (minus tamoxifen) CMV-creERT Hdac3f/f H3K9me2 ChIP-seq; (1) CMV-creERT Hdac3f/f Input; (2) biological replicate samples of induced (plus tamoxifen) CMV-creERT Hdac3f/f LB1 ChIP-seq; (1) induced (plus tamoxifen) CMV-creERT Hdac3f/f Input;
