TITLE
Transcriptomic approach to renal toxicity for cisplatin treatment in Nrf2 WT/KO

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor activated by oxidative stress, induces phase II conjugating or antioxidant enzymes. In the present study, we examined the effect of Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2 KO) on the kidney injury induced by cisplatin using cDNA microarray analyses. A transcriptomic approach enabled us to extract gene clusters which show significantly different mRNA expression patterns between wild type (WT) and Nrf2 KO mice. In the experimental set, WT vehicle (WT-Veh) and WT cisplatin (WT-Cis) groups were included in our previous GEO database (GSE35257) because the two groups were simultaneously shared with Nrf2 KO vehicle (Nrf2 KO-Veh) and Nrf2 KO cisplatin (Nrf2 KO-Cis) groups in the current report.

DESIGN
WT and Nrf2 KO C57BL/6 mice (9 weeks old, male) were intraperitoneally injected with vehicle (saline) or a single dose of cisplatin (15 mg/kg body weight). The cDNA microarray experiments were done for the kidney of mice 3 days after treatment. Three animals were used per group. WT-Veh and WT-Cis groups were already deposited in GSE35257.
