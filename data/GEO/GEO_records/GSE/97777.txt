TITLE
Small RNA-sequencing from apple in phase transition

ORGANISM
Malus domestica

SUMMARY
We performed Illumina sequencing of sRNA libraries prepared from juvenile and reproductive phase buds from the apple trees. A large number of sRNAs exemplified by 33 previously annotated miRNAs and 6 novel members displayed significant differential expression (DE) patterns in juvenile and reproductive stages. The study provides new insight into our understanding of fundamental mechanism of poorly studied phase transitions in apple and other woody plants and important resource for future in-depth research in the apple development.

DESIGN
Juvenile phase buds and Reproductive phase buds
