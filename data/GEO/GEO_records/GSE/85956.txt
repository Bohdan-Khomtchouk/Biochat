TITLE
LSD1 inhibitor-induced changes in gene expression profile in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We screened for the changes in gene expression induced by an LSD1 inhibitor to elucidate the mechanism of its cytotoxic effect on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).

DESIGN
We isolated mRNA from the T-ALL cell line MOLT4 cultured with vehicle alone or LSD1 inhibitor, and subjected them to gene expression profiling using an  Agilent GeneChip Array. Please note that experiments were technically performed as dual channel (eg, Cy3 and Cy5-labeled samples hybridized to the same array) but processed dat was provided for each single channel (Cy3 and Cy5 signals; i.e. one raw data file for two sample records).
