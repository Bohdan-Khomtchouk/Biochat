TITLE
Comparison of the Global Gene Expression Profiles in the IFNT treatment bovine cells

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
To examine the difference of the bovine cells between PBS and IFNT treatment, gene expression profiles were compared. The expressions of 902 genes were significantly higher in granulocytes with IFNT treament than those PBS treatment, whereas 1810 genes were lower (Fold change < 1, P=0.05 or lower). The expressions of 555 genes were significantly higher in Bovine Endometrial Stromal cells (BES) with IFNT treatment than those PBS treatment, whereas 874 genes were lower (Fold change < 1, P=0.05 or Low)

DESIGN
Bovine granulocytes and BES were treated with PBS or IFNT
