TITLE
DNA hypermethylation in placental tissues: placental tissues vs. maternal peripheral bloods

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis currently used does not achieve desirable levels of sensitivity and specificity. Recently, fetal methylated DNA biomarkers in maternal whole blood have been explored for noninvasive prenatal detection. However, such efforts cover only chromosomal aneuploidy; fetal methylated DNA biomarkers for detecting single-gene disease remain to be discovered. To address this issue, we systematically screened significantly hypermethylated genes in fetal tissues compared with maternal blood for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of various inherited diseases. First, Methylated-CpG island recovery assay combined with CpG island array was performed in four maternal peripheral bloods and their corresponding placental tissues. Subsequently, direct bisulfite sequencing and combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) were carried out to validate the reliability of methylation microarray analysis. As results, 310 significantly hypermethylated genes in fetal tissues were detected by microarray. Two of five randomly selected hypermethylated genes detected by microarray were confirmed to be hypermethylated in fetal tissue samples by direct bisulfite sequencing. All four randomly selected hypermethylated genes detected by microarray were confirmed to be hypermethylated in five independent amniotic fluid samples and five independent chorionic villus samples from 10 pregnant women by CORBA. In conclusions, We found a lot of hypermethylated genes and methylation sites in fetal tissues, some of which have great potential to be developed into molecular markers for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of monogenic disorders. Further clinical study is warranted to confirm these findings.

DESIGN
Paired experiments,  placental tissues vs. maternal peripheral bloods. Biological replicates: 4 placental tissues and 4 correspoding maternal peripheral bloods.
