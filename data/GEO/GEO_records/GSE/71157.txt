TITLE
microRNA expression in C3H10T1/2 cells treated with BMP7 vs vehicle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Multipotent C3H10T1/2 cells can be induced to differentiate into mature brown adipocytes by 3-days BMP7 pretreatment followed by standard adipogenic induction.

DESIGN
In this study, we used microRNA array to identify the microRNAs that were regulated by 3-days BMP7 treatment in C3H10T1/2 cells. One BMP7-treated sample and one vehicle-treated sample were used in this study to obtain the fold expression of microRNAs between BMP7 vs vehicle.
