TITLE
Digital counting of nucleic acid molecules using random base molecular barcodes

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Several template DNA molecules with random base molecular barcodes were amplified and sequenced, and the efficacy of the random base barcode for digital counting was shown.

DESIGN
Examination of DNA template quantfication using two replicates.

PLATFORM
