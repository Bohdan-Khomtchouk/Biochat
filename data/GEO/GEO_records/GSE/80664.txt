TITLE
Transcriptome-wide mRNA alterations in Streptozotocin induced Type I diabetic mouse heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from Left Ventricles of Streptozotocin induced Type I diabetic mouse hearts or mock treated controls at 4 weeks post-treatment in order to assess alternative splicing changes.

DESIGN
Heart mRNA profiles of Control and Diabetic (STZ:T1D) mice were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 1000.
