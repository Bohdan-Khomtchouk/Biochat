TITLE
Gene expression change induced by TIM-3/galectin-9 interaction in primary AML

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression change after galectin-9 stimulation in primary CD34+TIM-3+ AML cells

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from purified CD34+TIM-3+ primary AML cells with or without recombinant human galectin-9 stimulation (20hrs) was subjected to transcriptome analysis
