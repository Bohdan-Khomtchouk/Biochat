TITLE
Innate versus adaptive lymphoid cell fate choice is controlled by the E-Id protein axis [ATAC-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The lymphoid branch of the immune defense is composed of innate and adaptive immune cells. Using multiple genetic strategies we demonstrate that in the thymus E2A and HEB act in synergy to establish T cell identity and to suppress the aberrant development of innate lymphoid cells that include ILC2 and LTi-like cells.  We found that E2A and HEB induce T cell fate by activating the expression of an ensemble of genes encoding for proteins associated with Notch- and pre-TCR signaling and to promote TCRÎ² antigen receptor assembly. We show that E2A and HEB act in early T progenitors (ETPs) to establish and maintain a T-lineage specific enhancer repertoire, including regulatory elements associated with the Notch1/3 and Rag1/2 gene loci. Based on these and previous observations we propose that the E-Id protein axis specifies innate versus adaptive lymphoid cell fate.
