TITLE
Gene expression profile in yeast under physiological changes of stress adaptation and stress recovery

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The data provide information expression profile in yeast  for 5 different physioloigcal conditions during stress adpatation and stress recovery  (normal growth, during stress adaptation, after stress adaptation, under stress recovery, after stress recovery) in yeast. The purpose of the study is to understand how histone acetyltransferase HATs (Gcn5) apply it is function in gene regulation by changing global or local histone acetylation level under different physiological conditions.
