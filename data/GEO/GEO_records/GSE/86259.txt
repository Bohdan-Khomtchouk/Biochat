TITLE
Expression data from human normal liver cell line HL7702 treated with tributyltin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tributyltin (TBT) accumulates at higher levels in the liver than in any other organ, and it acts as a hepatotoxic agent. Most of the available studies on TBT have focused on observations at the cellular level, and studies at the level of genes and proteins have been limited; therefore, the information concerning possible mechanisms of TBT-induced adverse health effects remains scarce and inconclusive. In the present study, we applied a toxicogenomic approach to investigate the effects of TBT on gene expression in the human normal liver cell line HL7702.

DESIGN
The HL7702 cells were treated with 0 μM (C0), 2 μM(C1), 6 μM (C2) and 10 μM (C3) TBT for 2 h, and three biological replicates for each concentration.
