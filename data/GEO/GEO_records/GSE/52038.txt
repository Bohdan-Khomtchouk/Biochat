TITLE
5'RNA-seq analysis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in mice that carry a human missence mutation in the myosin heavy chain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We developed a 5'RNA-seq methodology to concurrently assess gene expression and start-site usage changes. We applied this methodology to study hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in mice harboring a human deleterious mutation.

DESIGN
5'RNA-seq analysis of transcriptomes from mouse hearts with or without hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Biological replicates were pooled into a single sequencing run. 5'RNA-seq methodology consists of enhanced sequencing of 5' ends and computational assessment of changes at start-sites of genes.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
