TITLE
mRNA expression upon reconstitution of miR-130a, miR-203 and miR-205 in prostate cancer cell line LNCaP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Micro RNAs (miRNAs) miR-130a, miR-203 and miR-205 are jointly downregulated in prostate cancer and act as repressors of AR-signaling.  MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of specific mRNA targets mainly by translational repression, mRNA deadenylation or cleavage. Reconstitution of these lost miRNAs in the LNCaP PCa cell line cause morphology changes, growth arrest, and apoptosis, increasing when the miRNAs were co-expressed. Bioinformatic target prediction, mRNA expression and protein expression analysis upon overexpression of these miRNAs congruently identified targets known to be overexpressed in PCa and to be involved in AR trans-activation. This series profiles loss in mRNA expression in LNCaP cells transfected with one of the three miRNAs miR-130a, miR-203 and miR-205 compared to LNCaP cells transfected with a scramble miRNA.

DESIGN
We analyzed three arrays each for miR-130a, miR-203, miR-205, and a scramble miRNA.
