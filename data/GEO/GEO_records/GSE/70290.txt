TITLE
Long non-coding RNA produced by RNA polymerase V determines boundaries of heterochromatin

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report genome-wide detection of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) generate by Pol V in transcriptional gene silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana. We further show that most of these transcripts are bound by AGO4.

DESIGN
RNA immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (RIP-seq) RNA immunoprecipitation with an anti-AGO4 antibody was performed in one biological replicate and included Col-0, nrpe1, and ago4-1; RNA immunoprecipitation with an anti-NRPE1 (largest subunit of Pol V) was performed in two replicates; replicate 1 included Col-0 and nrpe1, replicated two included Col-0, nrpe1, ago4-1, and idn2-1
