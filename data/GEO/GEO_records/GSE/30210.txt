TITLE
Genome-wide espression kinetics of children progressing to clinical Type 1 diabetes (T1D).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To unravel genes and molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D), we performed genome-wide gene expression profiling of prospective venous blood samples from children developing T1D-associated autoantibodies or progressing towards clinical diagnosis.

DESIGN
247 peripheral blood RNA samples from 18 prediabetic children and their matched controls were analyzed with Illumina Human HT-12 Expression BeadChips version 3 arrays, in order to study the gene expression changes occuring during the pathogenesis of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Each case child (with T1D-specific autoantibodies) was matched with a persistently autoantibody-negative control child, with the same HLA-DQB1 risk category, gender, and place and date of birth. Two control children were selected for T1D cases 3, 5, 13 and 17. Seroconversion is determined as the first detection of T1D-specific autoantibody/autoantibodies (ICA titre > 4 JDFU, IAA > 3.47 RU, GADA > 5.4 RU, IA-2A > 0.43 RU, ZnT8A > 0.61 RU).
