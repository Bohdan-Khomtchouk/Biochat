TITLE
Gene expression profiles for murine submandibular gland stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare the gene expression profile of submandibular gland stem cells to submandibular gland epithelia, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the differential expression in the stem cells and the non-stem cell epithelia.

DESIGN
Murine submandibular gland stem cells and non-stem cell epithelia are sorted through FACS
