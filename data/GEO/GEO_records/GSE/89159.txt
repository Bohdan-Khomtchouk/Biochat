TITLE
Time-course of HCoV-229E infection of A549 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment is to identify kinetic changes in host gene expression upon infection of A549 lung epithelial carcinoma cells  with human corona virus HCoV-229E as compared to unifected cells. Negativ controls include infections with heat-inactivated virus. Positive controls include treatment of cells with human IL-1alpha (10ng/ml) for 1h. All experiments have been performed at 33Â°C which is required for sufficient viral entry/replication.

DESIGN
Single-color hybridizations of RNA from HCoV.229E infected A549 cells, time course (16,24,48 h), with time-mathched controls plus two additional controls (untreated and IL1-treated). No replicates.
