TITLE
SMC2: a candidate gene associated with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
whole-genome aCGH analysis also showed us that the patient carried a 12.01-1M Mb deletion region at chromosome bands 9q31.1-q32 (105,190,105-117,195,154). The deleted region encompasses 22 genes including SMC2

DESIGN
Two-condition Samples, Cornelia de Lange Syndrome vs. Normal cells.

PLATFORM
GPL10150 Agilent-022060 SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray 4x180K (Probe Name version)
