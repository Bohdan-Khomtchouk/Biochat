TITLE
microRNA expression profiling of human esophageal metaplastic lesions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To test the hypothesis that there is a specific miRNA expression signature which characterizes Barrett's esophagus development and progression, we performed miRNA microarray analysis comparing normal esophageal squamous epithelium with the two different metaplastic lesions occuring within Barrett's mucosa (i.e. gastric metaplasia and intestinal metaplasia). Samples of H. pylori-related gastritis and gastric intestinal metaplasia  were also considered in the definition of esophageal-specific miRNAs.

DESIGN
miRNA microarray analysis was performed in a series of samples obtained from (a) 10 histologically-proven long-segment Barrett's esophagus patients; (b) 10 patients with H. pylori-related chronic atrophic gastritis.  Overall,  10 normal esophageal squamous epithelium samples, 10 esophageal intestinal metaplasia samples, 10 esophageal gastric metaplasia samples, 10 H. pylori -related gastritis samples (no atrophic lesion detected; obtained from the antrum) and 10 gastric intestinal metaplasia samples (obtained from the antrum) were considered.
