TITLE
microRNA expression profiling of human esophageal metaplastic lesions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To test the hypothesis that there is a specific miRNA expression signature which characterizes Barrett's esophagus development and progression, we performed miRNA microarray analysis comparing normal esophageal squamous epithelium with the two different metaplastic lesions occuring within Barrett's mucosa (i.e. gastric metaplasia and intestinal metaplasia). Samples of H. pylori-related gastritis and gastric intestinal metaplasia  were also considered in the definition of esophageal-specific miRNAs.
