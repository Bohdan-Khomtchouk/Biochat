TITLE
Response to PI3K/mTOR dual inhibition in Glioma initiating cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is dysregulated in over 50% of human GBM but remains a challenging clinical target. Inhibitors against PI3K/mTOR mediators have limited clinical efficacy as single agents. Gene expression profiling after PI3K/mTOR inhibition treatment was analyzed by Affymetrix microarrays.

DESIGN
Four Glioma Initiating cells (GIC) were treated with PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitors BEZ235 or DS7423 at 100nM for 24 hours. RNA was extracted and analyzed by Affymetrix U133.
