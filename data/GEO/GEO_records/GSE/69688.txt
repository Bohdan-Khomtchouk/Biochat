TITLE
Gene expression data from murine myeloid leukemia genomes induced by Sleeping Beauty transposon mutagenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of mRNA samples from a cohort of mice with histopathologically diagnosed Undifferentiated Myeloid Leukemia.

DESIGN
Tissues from flash frozen leukemic spleen was collected at necropsy from 47 mice with myeloid leukemia (22 males, 25 females) using the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array platform (GPL126). Array data was processed using the RMA algorithm as implemented in the affy package for R. No techinical replicates were performed.
