TITLE
Molecular portraits of human breast tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Set of 65 surgical specimens of human breast tumors from 42 different individuals, using complementary DNA microarrays representing 8,102 human genes. Gene expression variation patterns within this set provided a distinctive molecular portrait of each tumor. Twenty of the tumors were sampled twice, before and after a 16-week course of doxorubicin chemotherapy, and two tumors were paired with a lymph node metastasis from the same patient. Gene expression patterns in two tumor samples from the same individual were almost always more similar to each other than either was to any other sample. This study is described more fully in Perou CM et al.(2000) Nature 406:747-52 Keywords: other
