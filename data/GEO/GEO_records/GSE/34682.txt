TITLE
Expression analysis of Nanog-like-MO1 injected zebrafish embryos at the sphere stage

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in nanog-like knockdown embryos , compared to the control-MO injected embryos. Knockdown of nanog-like impaired early gastrulation. To globally analyze which target genes Nanog-like regulates during early embryogenesis, we performed a genome-wide transcription analysis using sphere stage (4 hpf) nanog-like morphants.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate control-MO injected embryos and three separate nanog-like-MO1 injected embryos at the sphere stage
