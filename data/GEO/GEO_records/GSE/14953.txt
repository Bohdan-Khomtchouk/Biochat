TITLE
Expression profiling of p53-regulated genes by cDNA microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the molecular features of p53 signaling pathway, we generated the  gene-expression profiles of  p53-introduced U373MG cells by genome-wide cDNA microarrays Keywords: time course

DESIGN
U373MG cells were infected with 20 MOI of Ad-p53 or Ad-LacZ. mRNA from infected cells were collected at 0h, 6h, 12h, 24h and 48h.  we used the RNA mixtures from Ad-LacZ infected cells as a reference of cDNA microarray analysis.
