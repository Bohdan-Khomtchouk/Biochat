TITLE
miRNA profiles regulated by PLD1 inhibitor in Wnt-relevant colon cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify potential miRNA effectors responsible for anti-tumorigenesis by targeting PLD1, we performed miRNA microarray in Wnt-relevant colon cancer cells and analyzed miRNAs that were differently expressed by inhibition of PLD1

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated DLD1 cells in Vehicle or PLD1-Inh groups under 1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum condition for 36 hours, respectively.

PLATFORM
GPL18402 Agilent-046064 Unrestricted_Human_miRNA_V19.0_Microarray (miRNA ID version)
