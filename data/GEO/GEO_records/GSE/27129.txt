TITLE
Gene expression profiles using microarrays in mdx and mdx/MMP-2-/- mice at 1 and 3 months of age

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Matrix metalloprotease (MMP) -2 has been reported to be up-regulated in skeletal muscle in the lethal X-linked muscle disorder Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which is caused by loss of dystrophin. However, the role of MMP-2 in dystrophin-deficient muscle is not well known. The aim of this study was to verify the role of MMP-2 in dystrophin-deficient muscle by using mdx mice with genetic ablation of MMP-2 (mdx/MMP-2-/-). Gene expression profiles were analyzed in the skeletal muscle of mdx and mdx/MMP-2-/- mice at 1 and 3 months of age.

DESIGN
Tibialis anterior muscle was isolated from four groups of mice (mdx and mdx/MMP-2-/- mice at 1 and 3 months of age). Total RNA was purified and prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) using Affymetrix reagents and protocols. The mRNA levels of differentially expressed genes from gene chip analysis were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR assay.
