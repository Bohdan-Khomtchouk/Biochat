TITLE
Expression profiling of BMP9-stimulated mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify potential target genes regulated by BMP9 in MSCs, we used microarray to profile expression patterns of BMP9- vs. GFP-stimulated MSCs.

DESIGN
Subconfluent mouse C3H10T1/2 cells were transduced with adenoviral vector expressing BMP9 or GFP for 30h. Total RNA was isolated for microarray analysis using Affymetrix mouse MOE430A GeneChips. Experiments were done in triplicate.
