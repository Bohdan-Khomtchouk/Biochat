TITLE
Expression data from wild-type and rph1-deleted yeasts

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Cells respond to environmental signals by alteration of gene expression through action of transcription factors. A JmjC-domain-containing protein Rph1 belongs to the C2H2 zinc finger protein family and functions to repress transcription of PHR1 via histone demethylation. However, additional targets of Rph1 remain largely unknown. Here, we investigate the regulatory network of Rph1 by microarray analyses. More than 75% of Rph1-regulated genes showed increased expression in rph1Î”, suggesting Rph1 serves as a transcriptional repressor under physiological conditions. The binding motif of Rph1 resembling the STress Response Element (STRE) was over-represented in the promoters of Rph1-repressed genes. In addition, significant proportions of Rph1-regulated genes responded to DNA damage and environmental stress, implying a repressive role of Rph1 in the cross-protection of stress responses.

DESIGN
We used expression microarray to identify Rph1-regulated genes and established Rph1 functioned as a transcriptional repressor to link DNA damage signaling and general stress response. We compared gene expression in wild-type and rph1-deleted strains cultured in rich medium (YPD) during exponential growth. 3 biological samples were analyzed.
