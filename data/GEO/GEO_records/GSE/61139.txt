TITLE
A global transcriptome analysis of keratinocytes upon overexpression of microRNA-132

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MiR-132 is one of the most upregulated miRNAs in keratinocytes of human skin wounds during the inflammatory phase of healing; however its biological role during skin wound healing has not been studied. To study the genes regulated by miR-132, we transfected miR-132 mimics (pre-miR-132) into primary human keratinocytes to overexpress miR-132. We performed a global transcriptome analysis of keratinocytes upon overexpression of miR-132 using Affymetrix arrays.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of primary human keratinocytes transfected with 10nM miR-132 mimics (pre-miR-132) or control oligos (pre-miR-Ctrl) for 48 hours (biological triplicates in each group) was performed using Affymetrix GeneTitan system.
