TITLE
dehydration response: dcp5-1 and WT

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis dcp5-1 comparing control WT with 30min dehydration treatment. Goal was to determine the effects of DCP5 on global transcript abundance during dehydration response.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, time0 and 30min dehydration. Biological replicates: 4 WT replicates, 4 dcp5-1 replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL12621 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Probe Name version)
