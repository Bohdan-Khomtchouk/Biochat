TITLE
Effect of LARK overexpression in CNS neurons

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify, in the head of adult flies, mRNA species whose expresson level are altered by overexpression of the Drosophila RNA-binding protein LARK in CNS neurons. Keywords: genetic modification, gene experssion profile

DESIGN
RNA samples from adult head of the LARK overexpression flies (elav-gal4; uas-lark/+) and control flies were compared. One total RNA sample was isolated from each genotype, of which three technical replicates (repeating the labeling and hybridization processes) were generated, respectively.
