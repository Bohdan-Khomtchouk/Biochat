TITLE
Splicing function of mitotic regulators links R-loop mediated DNA damage to tumor cell killing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We discovered that two mitotic regulators, BuGZ and Bub3, involved in splicing regulation during interphase

DESIGN
8 samples from primary Human foreskin fibroblast cells (HFFs) , 12 samples from TOV21G cells. Control siRNA. BuGZ siRNA or Bub3 siRNA were transfected for 48 h before sample collection. Cells treated with pladienolide B served as positive controls.  For each RNAi experiment, we had two biological replicates.
