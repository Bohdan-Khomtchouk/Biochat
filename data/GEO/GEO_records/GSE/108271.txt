TITLE
miR-200c induction in BT549 TNBC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microarray analysis on BT549 cells that express miR-200c in a doxycycline (dox)-inducible manner from the miR-200c-TripZ system.

DESIGN
Six samples. Two groups in biological triplicate. BT549-pTripZ-200c cells, plated in triplicate, were cultured in DOX for 48 hours. Control cells were left untreated.

PLATFORM
GPL17585 [HTA-2_0] Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 [probe set (exon) version]
