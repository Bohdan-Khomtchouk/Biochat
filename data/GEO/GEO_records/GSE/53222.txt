TITLE
Twist expression in HMLE and breast cancer T47D cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Twist is a key EMT inducer, expression of Twist will induce EMT in HMLE and breast tumor T47D cells By expressing Twist in HMLE and T47D cells, which lack the expression of Twist, will identify the genes regulated by Twist

DESIGN
Expressing Twist in HMLE and T47D cells, stable clones were selected and treated with BET inhibitor JQ1 and RNA were prepared for microarray analysis
