TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Paracoccus denitrificans during Cu-limitation

ORGANISM
Paracoccus denitrificans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222 wild type grown to mid-exponential phase in minimal media with either 13 uM (Cu-H) or 0.5 uM (Cu-L) Cu regimes. The goal was to define the effects of Cu-limitation on denitrification genes
