TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Paracoccus denitrificans during Cu-limitation

ORGANISM
Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222 wild type grown to mid-exponential phase in minimal media with either 13 uM (Cu-H) or 0.5 uM (Cu-L) Cu regimes. The goal was to define the effects of Cu-limitation on denitrification genes

DESIGN
Two growth conditions, three biological replicates of each condition. Each sample hybridised in a two-channel hybridization against Paracoccus denitrificans genomic DNA as the comparator/reference, which also acted as a control for spot quality. Cu-concentration 13 uM (Cu-H) versus 0.5 uM Cu (Cu-L) in anaerobic growth conditions.
