TITLE
PpsR regulon in Rhodobacter sphaeroides

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides

SUMMARY
mRNA levels were measured in  Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 at 20% O2 and 0.5% O2, Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 App11 (AppA-null), Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 (pPNs) and PpsR mutant PPS2-4.   The mRNA samples were prepared from cultures supplied with 20% O2, 1% CO2, and 79% N2, and grown in the dark to an OD of 0.18.   The mRNA levels for each strain was measured three times. Keywords: repeat sample
