TITLE
Wild-type versus HBx-transfected mive

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been clearly recognized as an etiological factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV encodes the potentially oncogenic HBx protein. We aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of HCC caused by HBx and to discover the biomarker related to HCC by HBx. Three experimental groups, 3, 9 and 13 month aged HBx Tg mice and age matched normal wild type B6 mouse which have same background of HBx Tg mice were used to find differentially expressed genes during HCC. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
3-month-old, 9-month-old, 13-month-old wild type B6 mice vs 3-month-old, 9-month-old, 13-month-old HBx transfected mice; Biological replicates at each timepoint; 9 controls vs 9 HBx-mice

PLATFORM
GPL7279 SNU/Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Array (GenePix version)
