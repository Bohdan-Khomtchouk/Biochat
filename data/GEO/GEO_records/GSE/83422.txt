TITLE
Methyl-seq and ChIP-seq analyses of TSPAN8-high and TSPAN8-low subpopulations of ID4-EGFP+ undifferentiated spermatogonia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
P6 ID4-EGFP+ undifferentiated spermatogonia stained robustly (high) or weakly (low) for TSPAN8 were isolated by FACS.

DESIGN
Pooled independent sorts of each population were used for reduced-representation methyl-seq or ChIP-seq for three histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27Ac and H3K27me3).
