TITLE
The effect of endosulfan on gene expression in Homarus americanus using an oligonucleotide microarray

ORGANISM
Homarus americanus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of Homarus americanus larvae exposed to five endosulfan concentrations were compared to the control to identify genes that showed significant changes in expression as a result of exposure.  There was a significant dose response effect during the endosulfan experiment and changes in gene expression were seen at high endosulfan concentrations that could caused developmental delays and mortality

DESIGN
A six condition experiment: control vs 5 endosulfan concentrations. Biological replicates: 6. Array replicates: 1

PLATFORM
GPL16521 Homarus americanus 15K array v2.1
