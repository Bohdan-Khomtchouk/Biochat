TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of Calu-3 2B-4 cells stimulated with Interleukin-1a and TNFa.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Calu-3 2B-4 cells were stimulated with interleukin-1a or TNFa.  Transcriptional analysis of the extracted RNA was done by microarray.

DESIGN
Calu-3 2B-4 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with either IL-1a (0.001ng/ml) or TNFa (0.05ng/ml) or mock diluted in PBS for 40 min at 37Â°C.  Following treatment, cells were washed 3 times, and fresh medium was added.  Triplicate Calu-3 2B4 cultures and triplicate time-matched mock-infected controls were harvested at 3, 6 and 24h for IL-1a and 6 and 24h for TNF post-exposure for transcriptional analysis.
