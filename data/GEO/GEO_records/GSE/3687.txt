TITLE
Temperature Upshift

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Determine if cells in stationary-phase cultures respond to increased temperature. Keywords: Time-course

DESIGN
Yeast cells in stationary-phase cultures were exposed to temperature upshift (30C to 39C) with samples harvested every 30-minutes over 8 hours.  All experimental samples are over an common reference.  There are two replicates for each time point and six replicates of T0.
