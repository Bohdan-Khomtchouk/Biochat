TITLE
Epigenetic silencing of the dual-role signal mediator, ANGPTL4 in tumor tissue and its overexpression in the urothelial carcinoma microenvironment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effect of ANGPTL4 expression on bladder cancer cells, expression profile was compared in BFTC 905 cells overexpressed with control vector vs human full length ANGPTL4 gene.

DESIGN
BFTC 905 bladder cancer cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 (vector control) or plasmid overexpressing ANGPTL4 (treatment).

PLATFORM
GPL15520 Illumina MiSeq (Homo sapiens)
