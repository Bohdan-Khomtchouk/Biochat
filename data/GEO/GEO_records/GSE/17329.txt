TITLE
Aspergillus niger exposed to combinations of carbon source, nitrogen source, nitrogen concentration, and culture pH

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of Aspergillus niger under conditions with differing combinations of carbon source, nitrogen source, nitrogen concentration, and culture pH Fermentor cultures were grown in minimal medium (MM) at a constant temperature of 30 ± 0.5 ºC and with differing combinations of carbon source (either 277.5 mM glucose or 333.0 mM xylose), nitrogen source (NH4Cl or NaNO3) and nitrogen concentration (4x: 282.4 mM; 8x: 564.8 mM), and pH (pH4 or pH5) of the medium (M. Braaksma, A.K. Smilde, M.J. van der Werf, P.J. Punt, submitted for publication). At different time points samples were collected, quenched immediately in methanol at -45 ºC and centrifuged at -20 ºC to remove supernatant. Part of the biomass was frozen into liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ºC for microarray analysis. For each of the 16 culture conditions one sample was selected for microarray analysis; samples were collected either around the time point carbon source depleted or a considerable time (~24 h) after carbon souce depletion. In addition some technical duplicates were included.

DESIGN
20 samples were analyzed from 16 different fermentation conditions. The fermentation conditions were varied according to a full factorial design of four factors tested at two levels. From one fermentation two different time samples were analyzed, from another fermentation four samples, two technical replicates of two different time samples, were analyzed. Samples were collected either around the time point carbon source depleted or a considerable time (~24 h) after carbon souce depletion.
