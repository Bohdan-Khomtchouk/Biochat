TITLE
Microarray whole transcriptome profiling of Trichostatin A and Grape Seed Extract in SK-MEL-3 melanoma cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we initially screened over 1400 natural products for capacity to inhibit the kinetic enzyme activity of nuclear HDACs isolated from SK-MEL-3 cells. From these findings we evaluate whole transcriptome changes that occur at a 24 hour time point in SK-ME-3 cells in the presence of a known HDAC inhibitor (Trichostatin A) (1uM) or a natural product HDAC inhibitor Grapeseed Extract (120ug/ml), both tested at sub-lethal concentrations relative to untreated controls. Microarrays were acquired for mRNAs and long intergenic non-coding RNA transcripts using the GeneChipâ„¢ Human 2.1ST ARRAY by Affymetrix Inc
