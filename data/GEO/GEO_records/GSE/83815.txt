TITLE
mRNA expression profile in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages that were isolated from calpain-6 wild-type and deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of calpain-6-deficient murine bone marrow-derived macrophages comparing with calpain-6 wild-type macrophages. Total RNA was extracted from the pooled cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wild-type macrophages vs. calpain-6-deficiennt macrophages. The cells were derived from four mice, and were pooled for analysis.

PLATFORM
