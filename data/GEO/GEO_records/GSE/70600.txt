TITLE
Gene expression changes in the retina following human neural progenitor cell injection into a rodent model for retinal degeneration

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to compare gene expression changes in retinal degenerate Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats following an injection of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) using RNA-seq, as compared to RCS rats receiving a sham surgery and wild-type Long Evans rats. These changes may lead to understanding of the therapeutic potential of hNPCs in inducing photoreceptor survival and visual function preservation.

DESIGN
RNA-seq from wild-type Long Evans rats, retinal degenerate Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats, and RCS rats following transplantation of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs)

PLATFORM
