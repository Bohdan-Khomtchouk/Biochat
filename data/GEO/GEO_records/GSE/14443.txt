TITLE
Changes in gene expression in MKK2 and MKKKC5 mutants after Alternaria infection

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The mkkkC5 mutant, a knockout line of MAPKKKC5, shows changes in growth and development, as well as an altered Alternaria sensitivity. It was shown by Brader and Djamei et al.(2007) that Alternaria brassicicola sensitivity is also influenced by MKK2-activity. Aim of this experiment is to access the transcriptional changes in the mkkkc5plants as well as in plants overexpressing a constitutively active MKK2-version (MKK2EE). The second part of the experiment addresses transcriptional changes in these plants after Alternaria brassicicola infection. au07-09_alternaria Keywords: treatment variations

DESIGN
Alternaria brassicicola infection of 25 day old mkkkc5- , pGreen::MKK2EE-myc and WT Col-0 plants. Sampling after 0, 1 and 2 days. Comparison between mutants and WT at corresponding timepoints. Additionally comparison between WT-samples at different timepoints. 16 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL6403 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.3
