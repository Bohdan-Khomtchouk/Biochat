TITLE
Expression data from Human CD4 T cells subpopulations of HIV+ patients and HIV- controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Central memory CD4 T cells (TCM) have a critical homeostatic role in chronic HIV infection. We asked if TCM cells from HIV+ patients have a gene expression profile related with less proliferation and less survival capacities. To determine the gene expression profile of CD4+ T cells subpopulations we performed microarrays (Human Gene 1.0 ST, Affymetrix) to identify differentially expressed genes between CD4+ T cells subpopulations from HIV+ patients and controls.

DESIGN
We analyzed mRNA expression patterns of naive CD4+ T cells (TN), central memory CD4+ T cells (TCM), and effector memory CD4 T cells (TEM) from healthy controls, and TN and TCM cells from HIV+ patients for a total of 15 microarrays.
