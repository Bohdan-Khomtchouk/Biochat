TITLE
Beta-blocker reverses hypoxia-inducible gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the transcripts/ pathways that are impacted by beta-blocker under hypoxia

DESIGN
Human endothelial cells are treated with 100uM propranolol (PRO) or diluent alone, and exposed to 2% oxygen (O2) for 24 hours. Normoxic cells served as controls.
