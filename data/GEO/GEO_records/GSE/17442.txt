TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of USF1-associated differential gene expression in mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of adenovirus-mediated USF1 overexpression in liver at gene expression level. Results provide important information of the response of mouse liver to USF1 overexpression, such as specific USF1-induced, suppressed, up- or down-regulated genes invovled in metabolism and immune responses.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from whole mouse liver 5 days post tail vein injection of adenovirus carrying either hUSF1 cDNA or eGFP alone as control vector.

PLATFORM
