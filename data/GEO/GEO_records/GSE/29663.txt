TITLE
Expression profiling of soybean genes in response to drought (vegetative stage)

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Drought-responsive genes in soybean leaves were successfully obtained using soybean gene 1.0 ST array. Leaf samples from the vegetative stage of soybean plants were used.

DESIGN
V6 soybean plants planted in the pots were imposed drought by withholding water for 6 days until the soil moisture content drop to 5% and trifolium 4th were collected for expression profiling
