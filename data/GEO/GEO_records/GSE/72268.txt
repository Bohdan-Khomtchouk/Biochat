TITLE
Reprogramming postnatal human epidermal keratinocytes toward functional neural crest fates

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
During development, neural crest cells are induced by signaling events at the neural plate border of all vertebrate embryos.  Initially arising within the central nervous system, NC cells subsequently undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition to migrate into the periphery, where they differentiate into diverse cell types. Here we provide evidence that postnatal human epidermal keratinocytes, in response to FGF2 and IGF1 signals, can be reprogrammed toward a neural crest fate.  Genome-wide transcriptome analyses show that keratinocyte-derived NC cells are similar to those derived from human embryonic stem cells.  Moreover, they give rise in vitro and in vivo to neural crest derivatives such as peripheral neurons, melanocytes, Schwann cells and mesenchymal cells (osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes and smooth muscle). By demonstrating that human KRT14+ keratinocytes can form neural crest cells, even from clones of single cells, our results have important implications in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of KC and KC derived NC (from 3 biological replicates) were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (pair-end (2x50 bp) rapid run mode).
