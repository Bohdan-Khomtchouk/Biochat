TITLE
FGF18 affects hair cycle.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fgf18 gene is strongly expressed in hair follicles of mouse dorsal skin during regressing (catagen) and resting (telogen) phases of hair cycle, but not in growth (anagen) phase.  This study aims at identifying the effects of FGF18 local delivery on the anagen phase of hair cycle.

DESIGN
To define genes affected by local delivery of FGF18 during anagen phase of hair cycle, we injected FGF18 protein subcutaneously into back skin of C3H/HeN mice on day 4 of depilation-induced anagen. As control PBS was injected in place of FGF18. After 24 h (61-d-old), total RNA was isolated from the back skin and purified to poly A RNA. The RNA samples were pooled for each group. Gene expression was analyzed by one-color analysis using single array for each group.
