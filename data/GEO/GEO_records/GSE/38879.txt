TITLE
Identification of RVE8 target genes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify the targets of RVE8, a MYB-like transcription factor involved in the circadian clock in Arabidopsis. Analysis of 7 days old rve8-1 RVE8::RVE8:GR and rve8-1 seedlings treated with dexamethasone or mock identified genes responsive to RVE8 induction.The RVE8 up-regulated genes are enriched for evening-phased genes while the down-regulated genes are enriched for a morning phase. This study reveals that RVE8 is a master regulator of circadian gene expression in Arabidopsis.

DESIGN
Transgenic line rve8-1 RVE8::RVE8:GR and rve8-1 treated with DEX or mock with three biological replicates each, 12 samples in total.
