TITLE
Chronic Bisphenol A and Genistein Exposure in MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exposures to environmental endocrine disruptors is growing and human contact in industrialized countries has become signficant and constant.  We studied the effect of chronic exposure to two endocrine disrupting compound, bisphenol A and genistein, in an in vitro cell culture system. MCF7 cells were cultured for greater than 70 passages under normal (MCF7-F) conditions or with the addition of 50 nM BPA (MCF7-B) or GEN (MCF7-G).  We performed transcriptome analysis of the all three cell lines in the absence of any estrogenic compounds and in the presence of 10 nM estradiol for 3 hours.

DESIGN
The MCF7-F, B, G cell lines were starved of all estrogenic compounds by culturing the cells for 72 hours in phenol red free DMEM containing 5% charcoal/dextran treated FBS.  Cells were then treated with either ethanol vehicle or 10 nM 17b-estradiol for 3 hours.  Total RNA was harvested and utilized for whole genome analysis on the Affymetrix Human Trascriptome Array 2.0.  The experiment was performed in duplicate
