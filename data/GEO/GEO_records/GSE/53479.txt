TITLE
miRNA expression profiles in nasal NK-cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nasal NK-cell lymphomas are EBV-infected lymphomas of the nasal mucosa. The genome-wide miRNA expression profiles of 36 cases of NNLs are determined with the NanoString technology. It is found that the expression levels of let-7 inhibits progression of nasal lymphomas.

DESIGN
The nCounter miRNA Expression Analysis System (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA) was used to obtain the expression profiles of 654 human miRNAs, and a panel of 6 synthetic miRNAs as internal positive controls. Approximately 0.1 Î¼g of total RNAs were extracted from from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. Mature miRNAs were ligated to sequence-specific miRtags, and the miRtagged mature miRNAs were hybridized to fluorescent reporter probes and to capture probes. After hybridization, the samples were immobilized to a solid-phase cartridge, and a CCD digital analyzer was used for data acquisition.
