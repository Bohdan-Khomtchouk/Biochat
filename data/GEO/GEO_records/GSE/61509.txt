TITLE
Expression profiling pooled Drosophila melanogaster heterozygous for deletions on Chromosome 2L

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We performed mRNA transcriptional profiling on 99 hemizygotic lines (Df/+) from the DrosDel project covering 68% of chromosome 2L, in order to understand how changes in gene copy number affect overall transcriptome.

DESIGN
We performed RNA-Seq analysis on 396 pools of 15-25 adult flies each. Samples include males or females from 99 different genotypes in duplicate. Differential gene expression was analyzed separately for each sex, by comparing each genotype with the remaining 98.
