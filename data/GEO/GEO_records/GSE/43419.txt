TITLE
Expression data from MYCN transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TH-MYCN transgenic (Tg) mice are the model for neuroblastoma. One of the sympathetic ganglia is the origin of neuroblastoma in those mice. The tumor incidences of homozygotes and hemizygotes are 100% and 70-80%, respectively. The involvement of midkine (Mdk), a tumor-related growth factor, was also examined by knockout mice.

DESIGN
Ganglia and tumor tissues were dissected from several genotypes of mice (MYCN Tg homozygote and hemizygote, knockout (KO) of Mdk gene). In some of cases, we cultured neurosphere and tumorsphere. The mRNA extracted from those samples were subjected to Affymetrix microarrays.
