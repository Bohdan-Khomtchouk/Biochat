TITLE
Gene expression profiles during human lung tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Some tumor initiation processes as well as genetic and genomic changes during human lung tumorigenesis have been progressively revealed. In our study, we elucidated expression profiles in normal human airway epithelium cells from non-smokers, immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell lines and lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues. Collectively, these cells reflect a progressively increasing degree of malignancy. Furthermore, from its earliest stages, lung tumorigenesis may be associated with decreased IFN alpha/beta signaling, and this association may provide insights for the selection of high-risk lung cancer patients.

DESIGN
The study material for human lung tumorigenesis consisted of 73 cases of normal human airway epithelium cells from non-smokers, 8 cases of immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell lines and 69 cases of lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues. All the airway epithelium cells were examined with Agilent SurePrint G3 Human GE v2 8x60K Microarray (G4851B), and the immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell lines and lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues were examined with Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K (G4112F). Please note that data were independently processed in two groups; GPL17077-hybridized samples GSM1637811-GSM1637883 GPL6480-hybridized GSM1637884-GSM1637960
