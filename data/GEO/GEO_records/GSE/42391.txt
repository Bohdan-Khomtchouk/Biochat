TITLE
miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p Regulate The Expression of CD133, PAX-2 and TLR2 in Adult Renal Progenitor Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adult renal stem/progenitor cells (ARPCs), first identified in the Bowmanâ€™s capsule, were recently identified also in the tubular compartment and it was demonstrated that renal progenitors from both locations were positive for PAX-2, CD133 and CD24 and exhibited multipotent differentiation ability. Recent studies indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding small RNAs that participate in the regulation of gene expression, may play a key role in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Distinct sets of miRNAs are specifically expressed in pluripotent stem cells but not in adult tissues, suggesting a role for miRNAs in stem cell self-renewal. We compared miRNA expression profiles of renal progenitors with that of renal proximal tubular cells (RPTECs) and of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and found distinct sets of miRNAs that were specifically expressed both in tubular and glomerular ARPCs. In particular, the miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p regulated the expression of important markers of renal progenitors, such as CD133 and PAX-2, and important genes involved in the repair mechanisms of ARPCs, such as TLR2. We demonstrated that the expression of  both the renal stem cell markers CD133 and PAX-2 depends, at least in part, on lower miR-1915 levels and showed that the increase of miR-1915 levels improved capacity of ARPCs to  differentiate into adipocyte-like and epithelial-like cells. Finally, we found that the low levels of miR-1225-5p were responsible for high TLR2 expression in ARPCs. Therefore, together, the miR-1915 and the miR-1225-5p seems to regulate important trait of ARPCs: the stemness and the repair capacity.

DESIGN
Sixteen samples consisting of 5 glomerular and tubular ARPCs each, 3 MSCs, and 3 RPTECS.
