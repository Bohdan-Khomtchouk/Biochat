TITLE
Intestine-adapted bacterial symbiont response to polysaccharide rich and polysaccharide deficient diets in mice lacking fucosyltransferase-2

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

SUMMARY
Analysis of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT) from the ceca of ex-germ free Fut2+ or Fut2- mice on polysaccharide rich or glucose rich polysaccharide deficient diet. BT is involved in the breakdown of plant polysaccharides and is also efficiently utilizes host glycans. BT-colonized mice represent a human gut ecosystem model. Results identify genes that may endow flexibility in adapting to dietary changes by mucosal foraging depending on host fucosylation status
