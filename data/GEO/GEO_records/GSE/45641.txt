TITLE
Intestine-adapted bacterial symbiont response to polysaccharide rich and polysaccharide deficient diets in mice lacking fucosyltransferase-2

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

SUMMARY
Analysis of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT) from the ceca of ex-germ free Fut2+ or Fut2- mice on polysaccharide rich or glucose rich polysaccharide deficient diet. BT is involved in the breakdown of plant polysaccharides and is also efficiently utilizes host glycans. BT-colonized mice represent a human gut ecosystem model. Results identify genes that may endow flexibility in adapting to dietary changes by mucosal foraging depending on host fucosylation status

DESIGN
In vitro transcriptional profiles of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron obtained from ceca of ex-germ free Fut2+ or Fut2- mice on polysaccharide rich or glucose rich polysaccharide deficient diet.
