TITLE
miRNA expression of whole hippocampus 24hr post-injury in rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Traumatic brain injury dysregulates microRNA expression in the brain. We hypothesized that injury-induced epigenetic changes contribute to neurodegeneration and learning and memory deficits after TBI. These changes may provide a mechanistic explanation for neuropsychiatric comorbidities in TBI patients. Our objective is to compare and contrast the effects of several neuroprotective drugs (JM6, PMI-006 and E33-estrogen) on the TBI-induced changes in microRNA expression in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that is critical for learning and memory. We will also study if different neuroprotective drugs have similar effects on common microRNAs which may cooperatively regulate a common set of gene targets.

DESIGN
3 biological samples each of Na√Øve, Sham control, TBI and TBI plus JM6, TI plus PMI-006, and TBI plus E33 rat hippocampi were obtained 24 hr post-sham injury or TBI, stored in RNA later and sent to GenUs Biosystems for microRNA microarray analysis.
