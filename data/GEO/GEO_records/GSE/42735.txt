TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome profiling of SK-Mel-28, UACC-62 and HCT-116 cells stably expressing scrambled shRNA and RAB7 shRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Asess the transcritpional changes induced upon RAB7 knock-down in melanoma (SK-Mel-28 and UACC-62) and in colon cancer (HCT-116) cell lines. Methods: mRNA profiles of tumor cell lines (SK-Mel-28, UACC-62, HCT-116) stably expressing scrambled shRNA or RAB7 shRNA (harvested at day 3 after lentiviral infection) were generated by deep sequencing, using three biological replicates per condition. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed with TopHat and Cufflinks. Validation of induced / silenced genes was performed by western blot. Results show a differential impact of RAB7 expression in the transcriptomic profile of melanoma vs non-melanoma cell lines, and support a lineage-specific role of this small GTPase in melanoma.

DESIGN
Examination of the mRNA profiles RAB7-depleted vs wild type cells, performed in parallel in 3 different tumor cell lines (Melanomas: SK-Mel-28 and UACC-62, Non-melanoma: HCT-116) harvested at day 3 after lentiviral infection.
