TITLE
Chemopreventive effect of flaxseed-enriched diet on ovarian cancer in laying hen.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify the molecular mechanisms and biological pathways associated with the anticancer effects of flaxseed (richest plant source of Omega-3 fatty acid) in laying hen model of ovarian cancer.  Study shows a significant reduction in the severity of the disease and increased survival of the laying hens fed with flaxseed.

DESIGN
2 X 2 condition experiment, Diet (Control & Flaxseed fed) and Tissue (Normal & Cancer). Biological replicates: 6 control normal replicates, 6 control cancer replicates, 6 flaxseed normal replicates and 6 flaxseed cancer replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL6413 Chicken 44K custom Agilent microarray (2nd version)
