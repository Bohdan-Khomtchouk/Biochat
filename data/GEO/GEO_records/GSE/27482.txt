TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of genes regulated by CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 (CUC1) transcription factor in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Samples 1 & 2: Comparison of gene expression between wild type (ecotype Ler) and 35S:CUC1, in which CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1, a master regulator of the shoot meristem and boundary establishment, is constitutively expressed under the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Samples 3 & 4: Comparison of gene expression between stm-1 (ecotype Ler) and stm-1 35S:CUC1

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from cotyledons of 5-day-old  (for Ler vs 35S:CUC1) or 10-day-old (for stm vs 35S:CUC1stm) seedlings.  Two independent biological replicates were analyzed for each comparison.
