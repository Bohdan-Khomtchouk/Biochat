TITLE
Synovial biopsies of osteoarthritis patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Synovial biopsies were obtained from osteoarthritis (OA) synovium to find genes upregulated during OA. The genes upregulated during OA can be used to identify disease characteristic genes.

DESIGN
10 microarrays of end-stage OA synovial biopsies were compared to 7 microarrays of synovial biopsies from individuals without a joint disease. Genes with > 1.2-fold upregulation and P < 0.05 in OA VS HC were selected from the analysis.
