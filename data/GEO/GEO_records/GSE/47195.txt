TITLE
SALT-RESPONSIVE ERF1 expression profiling in rice roots

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To identify genes that are regulated by SERF1, we performed expression profiling on roots of serf1 and  wild-type plants under standard growth conditions.

DESIGN
Plants were grown for  4 weeks at (day/night) 26/22°C, 75/70% relative humidity with a day-length of 12 h and a light intensity of 700 µmol m-2 s-1. Seeds of serf1 T-DNA lines and Nipponbare wild type were placed on hydroponic boxes with full-strength Yoshida medium (Yoshida et al., 1971) using styrofoam adaptors.  For each genotype 3 biological replicates were seperately isolated and measured.
