TITLE
RNA sequencing of Bifidobacterium bifidum SC555 in response to various substrates

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium bifidum

SUMMARY
The purpose of this project was to determine the whole transcriptome response of Bifidobacterium bifidum SC555 to pooled and individual human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) relative to lactose

DESIGN
Bacterial isolates grown on lactose, pooled human milk oligosaccharides (HMO), lacto-N-tetraose (LNT), lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT), 2’fucosyllactose (2’FL), 3-fucosyllactose (3FL), 6’sialyllactose (6’SL) and porcine mucin (MUC). RNA was extracted and sequenced, in duplicate, on an Illumina HiSeq. Early, mid, and late timepoints in response to pooled HMO were additionally sequenced in duplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL18891 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Bifidobacterium bifidum)
