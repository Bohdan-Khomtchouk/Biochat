TITLE
Expression analysis of Lodderomyces elongisporus NRRL YB-4239 grown in glucose or xylose

ORGANISM
Lodderomyces elongisporus NRRL YB-4239

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Lodderomyces elongisporus NRRL YB-4239 grown aerobically in xylose, compared to the same strain grown aerobically in glucose.

DESIGN
A six array study using total RNA recovered from three separate cultures of Lodderomyces elongisporus NRRL YB-4239 grown in glucose and three separate cultures of Lodderomyces elongisporus NRRL YB-4239 grown in xylose.  Each array measures the expression level of 371,451 probes (average probe length 54.1 +/- 4.1 nt) tiled across the Lodderomyces elongisporus NRRL YB-4239 genome with a median spacing distance of 33 nt.  During data processing, probes are filtered to include only those probes corresponding to annotated protein-coding genes.
