TITLE
Gene expression data from mouse hemopoietic stem cells (LSKs), promyelocytes, myelocytes and granulocytes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differentiation of hemopoietic stem cells into granulocytes is characterized by distinct changes in the transcriptome. We analyzed mRNA expression in primary murine myeloid cells at four successive stages of hemopoietic differentiation; Lin- Sca1+ cKit+ stem/progenitor cells (LSKs), promyelocytes, myelocytes and granulocytes.

DESIGN
Using fluorescenceâ€“activated cell sorting, we isolated primary murine myeloid cells at four successive stages of hemopoietic differentiation; Lin- Sca1+ cKit+ stem/progenitor cells (LSK), promyelocytes, myelocytes and granulocytes.
