TITLE
Epigenome analysis of normal and cancer tissues in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and cancer tissue samples in prostate cancer. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs. Samples are pool of 12 normal and 12 cancer tissues.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the normal and cancer DNA pools were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
