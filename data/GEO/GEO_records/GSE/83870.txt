TITLE
Gene expression data of human keratinocytes knocked down for SMC1A, SMC3, or control shRNA.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of the study is to understand the impacts of cohesin knockdown on epidermal gene expression. Primary human keratinocytes were knocked down for SMC1A, SMC3, or control to determine its genome-wide gene expression profile. Global gene expression profiling using U133 plus 2.0 arrays were used to deteremine the genes perturbed by knockdown of SMC1A or SMC3.

DESIGN
For gene expression profiling, cultured primary human keratinocytes were transduced with a retrovirus expressing SMC1, SMC3, or control shRNAs.RNA was harvested from these genetically modified cells 10 days post-transduction. Microarray analysis using Affymetrix HG-U133 2.0 plus arrays was performed on duplicate samples.
