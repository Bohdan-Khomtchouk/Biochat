TITLE
microRNA expression profiling of small intestine of Tlr3+/+ and Tlr3-/- mice after total body g-irradiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray was performed to comprehensively examine microRNA induction in murine small intestine after exposure to total body g-irradiation.

DESIGN
Small intestines were collected from Tlr3+/+ and Tlr3-/- mice at 0 and 6 hr after exposure to 10 Gy of total body g-irradiation. Samples were pooled from 3 mice. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to microRNA microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
