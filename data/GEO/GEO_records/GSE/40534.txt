TITLE
Expression profiling in ductus arteriosus and aorta of Brown-Norway and Fischer344 rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression levels in ductus arteriosus (DA) and aorta in full-term (21 days) neonates of Brown-Norway (BN) and Fischer344 (F344) rats We analyzed the fold difference between BN and F344 rats in ductus arteriosus in order to identify the down-regulated and up-regulated genes specifically in BN rat's DA. The differences in aorta was also examined for additional comparison.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from aorta and DA tissues from BN and F344 rat neonates one hour after delivery, and converted to biotin-labeled cRNAs that were hybridized to Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0 ST Array.
