TITLE
Profiling gene expression of HeLa cells transfected with FOXK1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
C-C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) plays pivotal roles in tumor formation, progression, and metastasis. Although CCL2 expression has been found to be dependent on the nuclear factor (NF)–κB signaling pathway, the regulation of CCL2 production in tumor cells has remained unclear. We have identified a noncanonical pathway for regulation of CCL2 production that is mediated by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) but independent of NF-κB. Multiple phosphoproteomics approaches identified the transcription factor forkhead box K1 (FOXK1) as a downstream target of mTORC1. Activation of mTORC1 induces dephosphorylation of FOXK1 resulting in transactivation of the CCL2 gene. Inhibition of the mTORC1-FOXK1 axis attenuated insulin-induced CCL2 production as well as the accumulation of tumor-associated monocytes-macrophages and tumor progression in mice. Our results suggest that FOXK1 directly links mTORC1 signaling and CCL2 expression in a manner independent of NF-κB, and that CCL2 produced by this pathway contributes to tumor progression.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of FOXK1-expressing and control HeLa cells were processed for gene expression array analyses using an Affymetrix platform.
