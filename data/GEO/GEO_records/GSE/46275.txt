TITLE
CCL2/CCR2-dependent recruitment of functional antigen-presenting cells into tumors post-chemotherapy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCA205 tumors developed in C57bl/6 mice on day 2, 7 and 10 after intratumoral treatment with doxorubicin (DX) or PBS solvent. DX triggers the immunogenicity of dying tumor cell and activates anti-tumor immunity. Results provided insight into molecular basis of DX induced immune response.

DESIGN
C57bl/6 mice bearing palpable MCA205 fibrosarcoma tumors (25-45mm2) were treated with DX or PBS intratumorally and tumors were recovered 2, 7 or 10 days post treatment. DX treated samples on day 7 were also divided into responder and non responder groups according to tumor shrinkage.
