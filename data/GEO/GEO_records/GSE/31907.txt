TITLE
Gene expression analysis of interspecific and intraspecific Y chromosome introgessions in Drosophila simulans

ORGANISM
Drosophila simulans

SUMMARY
These arrays measure gene expression across eight Y introgression lines in Drosophila simulans. Four lines (Ya19, Ya23, Ya24, Ya26) carry a D. simulans Y chromosome (from a Cameroon population) and four lines (Sec01, Sec03, Sec08, Sec27) carry a D. sechellia Y chromosome. All lines are otherwise identical with a D. simulans background (UCSD stock center line 14021-0251.092).

DESIGN
Four biological replicates of each of eight lines, plus two technical replicates (dye swap), for a total of 32 arrays. Full methods are described in the accompanying publication.
