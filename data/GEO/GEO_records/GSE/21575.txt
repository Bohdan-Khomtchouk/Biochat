TITLE
Transcriptome-wide identification of RNA-binding protein and microRNA target sites by PAR-CLIP: IGF2BP data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To test the influence of IGF2BPs on the stability of their interacting mRNAs, as reported previously for some targets (Yisraeli, 2005), we simultaneously depleted all three IGF2BP family members using siRNAs and compared the cellular RNA from knockdown and mock-transfected cells on microarrays. The levels of transcripts identified by PAR-CLIP decreased in IGF2BP-depleted cells, indicating that IGF2BP proteins stabilize their target mRNAs. Moreover, transcripts that yielded clusters with the highest T to C mutation frequency were most destabilized (Figure 4G of PMID 20371350), indicating that the ranking criterion that we derived based on the analysis of PUM2 and QKI data generalizes to other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs).

DESIGN
The RBPs IGF2BP1-3 were depleted by siRNAs and the expression level was compared to mock-transfected HEK 293 cells.
