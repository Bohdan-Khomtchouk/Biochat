TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of serum DNA samples of the UKCTOCS cohort

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in serum DNA samples from a total of 282 healthy postmenopausal women of which 134 developed breast cancer within a 5-year follow-up period

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the serum were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
