TITLE
Effects of dPRP (PRL8a2) on gene expression of decidual-placental-embryonic tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DPRP (PRL8a2) is critically involved in adaptations of the placentation site to physiological stressors.  DPRP (PRL8a2) restrains the expression of genes associated with ER stress.

DESIGN
We used DNA microarrays to analyze the transcriptome of wild type and dPRP null mouse decidual-placental-embryonic tissues from gestation day 7.5.
