TITLE
Chromatin state maps (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) from partially and fully reprogrammed mouse cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chromatin state maps (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) from partially and fully reprogrammed mouse cell lines obtained by ectopic expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc using constitutive retroviral infection of MEFs (MCV6, MCV8, MCV8.1) or induction of lentivirus in secondary B lymphocytes obtained from iPS-derived chimeric mice (BIV8). Keywords: High-throughput ChIP-sequencing, Illumina, cell type comparison

DESIGN
H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIP-Seq in singlicate from three partially reprogrammed cell lines (BIV1, MCV8, MCV6), one iPS cell line (MCV8.1) and MEFs (subsampled from Mikkelsen et al, Nature, 2007)) Raw sequence data files for this study are available for download from the SRA FTP site at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/Studies/SRP000/SRP000215
