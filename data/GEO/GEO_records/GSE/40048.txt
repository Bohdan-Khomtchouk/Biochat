TITLE
Agilent 244A aCGH array for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
24 SCC tumors were profiled for copy-number alterations with the high-resolution Agilent 244A aCGH Array

DESIGN
Tumor samples were assayed on Agilent Human Genome CGH 244A Microarrays for surveying genomic alterations in squamous carcinoma of the lung.  Human male or female blood genomic DNA (Promega) was used as reference. Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5.The normalized data were further analyzed using Agilent DNA Analytics Software (version 4.0) with ADM-2 algorithm, which is an aberration detection algorithm that identifies all aberrant intervals in a given sample with consistently high or low log ratios based on the statistical score.
