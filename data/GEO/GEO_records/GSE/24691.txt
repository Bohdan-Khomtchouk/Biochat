TITLE
PTEN intact and NULL prostates in intact and castrate mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed expression profiling of prostates of 3 month wild-type and PTEN NULL mice and assessed the response to 3 days of castration.

DESIGN
Seven three month old WT and PbCre x PTEN f/f (PTEN NULL) mice were used. They are in the C57B6 background. Three mice in each group were castrated. Three days after castration, the prostate were harvested and RNA isolated by standard protocols and analyzed by expression profiling.
