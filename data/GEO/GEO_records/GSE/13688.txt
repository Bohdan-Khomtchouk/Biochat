TITLE
Effect of TCPOBOP and PCN in combination with high-cholesterol diet on genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TCPOBOP (1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene) and PCN (pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile) are inducers of drug metabolism through activation of nuclear receptors CAR (constitutive androstane receptor) and PXR (pregnane X receptor), respectively. Mouse experiment was designed to study the effect of CAR and PXR activation on cholesterol homeostasis genes and other genes, which are present on the Steroltalk v2 microarray. Treatments were combined with standard and high-cholesterol diet to observe the interference of high liver cholesterol on nuclear receptor transcription regulation. All experiments were done within the European sixth Framework program “Steroltalk” (www.steroltalk.net). Results form these experiments give new knowledge about involvement of ‘xenosensors’ CAR and PXR in regulation of endogenous liver metabolism.
