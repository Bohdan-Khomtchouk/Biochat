TITLE
Expression data from mouse livers lacking STAT3 and RelA during pneumonia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A common response to physiological duress is the hepatic acute phase response, a process during which the expression of many genes is altered in the liver.  Amongst these transcripts are those encoding acute phase proteins, defined as circulating proteins with significantly changed concentrations during an acute phase response.  The goal of this study was to determine the influence of two transcription factors, STAT3 and NF-kappaB p65 (RelA), on hepatic gene changes including but not limited to acute phase proteins during bacterial pneumonia. Using the Cre-LoxP system, mice were generated with combined functional deletions of both STAT3 and RelA in hepatocytes.  In mutant mice, Cre-recombinase was expressed under transcriptional control of an albumin promoter in the presence of homozygous floxed alleles for both STAT3 and RelA.  Wild-type control mice lacked the Cre-recombinase transgene.  Microarray analysis was performed on liver RNA collected from both genotypes of mice in the absence and presence of pneumococcal pneumonia.

DESIGN
RNA from 4 separate groups of mice (3 mice per group) was analyzed: 1) Uninfected wild-type control mice; 2) Uninfected mutant mice lacking liver STAT3 and RelA; 3) Control mice infected intratracheally for 24h with 10^6 CFU of Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 3); and 4) Mutant mice infected intratracheally for 24h with 10^6 CFU of Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 3).
