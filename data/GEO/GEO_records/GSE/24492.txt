TITLE
Investigation of the gene expression profile of LYVE-1-positive macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LYVE-1-positive macrophages were observed to be closely spatially associated with the developing lymphatic vasculature. The role of this population of macrophages in the embryo is uncharacterised. We used microarray analyses to investigate which genes are differentially regulated between LYVE-1-positive and LYVE-1-negative macrophages

DESIGN
Macrophage populations were isolated from cell suspensions prepared from digested embryonic day (E) 15.5 skin and prepared for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
