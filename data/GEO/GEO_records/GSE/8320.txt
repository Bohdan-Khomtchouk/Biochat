TITLE
Transcriptional and translational gene regulation in the maize pulvinus

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Not much is known about the molecular processes involved during gravitropism in monocot plants such as maize.  A microarray based study on the expression of genes after a gravity stimulating the maize pulvinus will provide us with valuable information and a better understanding of the underlying molecular processes involved in monocot gravitropism. Objectives for this study included the identification of genes that were regulated at the transcriptional and translation level during gravitropism in the maize pulvinus.  This was achieved by microarray analysis of total RNA versus polyribosome associated RNA during a time-course of gravity stimulation of the maize pulvinus. Keywords: time course
