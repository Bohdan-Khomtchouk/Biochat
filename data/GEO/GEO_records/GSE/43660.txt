TITLE
IL-33 markedly induces murine eosinophil gene transcription via autocrine IL-4-dependent and -independent mechanisms

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Eosinophils are major effector cells in type 2 inflammatory responses and become activated in response to IL-4 and IL-33, yet the molecular mechanism remains unclear. We examined the direct effect of these cytokines on eosinophils and demonstrated that murine eosinophils respond to IL-4 and IL-33 by phosphorylation of STAT-6 and NFkB, respectively. RNA sequencing analysis of murine eosinophils indicated that IL-33 regulates 519 genes, whereas IL-4 regulates only 28 genes, including 19 IL-33-regulated genes. Interestingly, IL-33 induced eosinophil activation via two distinct mechanisms, IL-4 independent and IL-4 secretion/auto-stimulation dependent. Anti-IL-4 or anti-IL-4Ra antibody-treated eosinophils, as well as Il4- or Stat6-deficient eosinophils, had attenuated protein secretion of a subset of IL-33-induced genes, including Retnla and Ccl17. However, the induction of most IL-33-regulated transcripts (e.g. Il6 and Il13) was IL-4 independent and blocked by NFkB inhibition. Indeed, IL-33 induced the rapid release of pre-formed IL-4 protein from eosinophils by an NFkB-dependent mechanism. Thus, we have identified a novel activation pathway in murine eosinophils that is induced by IL-33 and differentially dependent upon IL-4. These data suggest that IL-4 plays a critical role in auto-amplification of IL-33-induced eosinophil activation and could be a potential target for therapeutic approaches in IL-33-related eosinophil-associated diseases.

DESIGN
Low density bone marrow derived murine eosinophils were generated in culture over the period of 14 days. Eosinophils were activated by either IL-33 or IL-4 at 10 ng/ml for 1hr and 4hr. RNA was collected and subjected to next generation sequencing.
