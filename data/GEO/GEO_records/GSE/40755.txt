TITLE
Changes in gene expression analysis of alphaCD3alpha/CD28 activated human naive and memory regulatory T cells (Treg) upon IL-7 treatment as measured by quantitative PCR array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study evaluated changes in gene expression upon IL-7 treatment in human naive and memory Treg. CD4+CD25+CD127low naïve and memory Treg were isolated from fresh PBMC and separately stimulated with αCD3α/CD28 coupled beads (Invitrogen-Dynal) at a 1:10 bead/T cell ratio, treated with or without 10 ng/ml of rhIL-7 (R & D Systems) for 16 hours.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling of CD4+CD25+CD127low naïve and memory Treg obtained from 2 separate donors. Cell lysates were prepared separately from the 2 donors and pooled prior to RNA extraction.
