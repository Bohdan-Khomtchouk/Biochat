TITLE
To detect CENP-A enrichment on Chromosome 1,5

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
ChIP Seq revealed presence of unique CEN-proximal neocentromere peaks in CEN deleted clones. Using 10 million reads generated from ChIP-seq for each sample,  chromosome wide maps for CENP-A  enrichment were generated .

DESIGN
Examination of CENP-A enrichment in Input/IP  samples of various CEN deleted C. albicans clones
