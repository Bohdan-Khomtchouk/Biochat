TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of colorectal cancer cell line (CRC) SW1116 overexpressed POLR1D

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were generated for CRC cell line SW1116 overexpressed POLR1D and empty vector to explore the effect of POLR1D on colorectal cancer cell line SW1116.

DESIGN
SW1116 cells were infected with lentivirus overexpressing POLR1D and negative control lentivirus. After 72h, the GFP-positive cells were isolated by FACS. POLR1D overexpression was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Then, the total RNA of POLR1D overexpression cells and negative control cells was extracted by Trizol reagent and sequenced using Illumina HiSeqTM4000 according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
