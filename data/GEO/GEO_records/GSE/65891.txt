TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of insecticide resistant housefly strain: insights about SNPs and regulatory elements in differentially expressed cytochrome P450 genes

ORGANISM
Musca domestica

SUMMARY
The 791spin is the spinosad-selected strain derived from 791a, a laboratory strain derived from a multi-resistant field-collected sample of houseflies. The 791a strain proved highly resistant to pyrethroids and some anticholinesterases and showed some resistance to the chitin synthesis-disrupting larvicides.In order to understand the evolution of insecticide resistance, de novo assembly of a spinosad resistant housefly strain 791spin using 454 technology was initiated

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis of insecticide resistant housefly strain compared to susceptible strain
