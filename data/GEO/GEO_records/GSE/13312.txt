TITLE
Role of p53 in mouse iPS cell generation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We observed a marked increase in efficiency of iPS cell generation when p53 is deleted.

DESIGN
Gene expression patterns were compared between p53 wt MEF and p53-null MEF cells. Gene expression patterns were also compared between ES cells and MEF.
