TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles between wild-type and Dock8-deficient CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine the effect of DOCK8 deficiency on  helper T cell differentiation, we employed microarray expression profiling and found that 850 genes were expressed at higher levels in Dock8–/– AND CD4+ T cells than Dock8+/– controls after antigen stimulation.

DESIGN
CD4+T cells  from Dock8+/– and  Dock8–/– AND Tg h mice were stimulated with cognate antigen for 24 h in vitro, and their gene expression profiles were compared.
