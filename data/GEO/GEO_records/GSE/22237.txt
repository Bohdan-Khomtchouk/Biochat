TITLE
Chromosomal aberration of malignant pleural mesothelioma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify regions that display DNA copy number alterations in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), we carried out array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis with 14 MPM cell lines. Regions of genomic aberrations observed in > 20% of individuals were 9p21.3, 13q12.11, 16p13, and 22q12.2 of losses. The most frequent alteration was 9p21.3, which include the p16INK4/p14ARF. The loss of 22q12.2 regions include the NF2 was observed in 3 out of 14 cell lines. In 3 cell lines, loss of 13q12.11 region which contains Large Tumor Suppressor, homolog 2 (LATS2) was detected.

DESIGN
Human malignant pleural mesothelioma cell lines were profiled on Agilent 244K aCGH arrays according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Pooled normal human genomic DNA was used as the reference.
