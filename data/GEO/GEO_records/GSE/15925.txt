TITLE
Mature thymic NKT and T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Invariant Natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a separate lineage of T lymphocytes with innate effector functions. They express an invariant TCR specific for lipids presented by CD1d and their development and effector differentiation rely on a unique gene expression program. We asked whether this program includes microRNAs, small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally and play key role in the control of cellular differentiation programs. We identified a miRNA profile specific for iNKT cells, which exhibits features of activated/effector T lymphocytes.
