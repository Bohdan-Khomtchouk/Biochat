TITLE
Gene Expression in induced Treg cell from CD4+ Naive T cell isolated from miR-31fl/fl/CD4Cre vs Control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A microarray study performed in iTreg of miR-31fl/fl/CD4Cre and control mice to identify genes that are regulated by the miR-31. CD4+ naïve T cells from miR-31fl/fl mice and miR-31fl/flCD4Cre mice were used to induce iTreg in vitro. Four independent experiments were performed.

DESIGN
MiR-31fl/fl/CD4Cre mice (6 wk old) and age-matched control mice were sacrificed, and the spleen were removed and teased into cell-single suspensions and filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer. Naïve CD4+CD25-Foxp3gfp-CD62Lhi T cells were sorted by FACSAria III (BD bioscience).The medium used for T cell cultures was RPMI-1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco). The CD4+ Naïve T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml) plus soluble anti-CD28 (2 μg/ml) under iTreg cell differentiation conditions (mTGF-β1, 5 ng/ml and rmIL-2, 40 ng/ml; R & D Systems). After 4 days, harvested cell ,the RNA was extracted in Trizol and then purified using the miRNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). This submission shows the data obtained from 3 individual miR-31fl/fl/CD4Cre mice mice measured against 3 control mice.
