TITLE
Differential gene expression in peripheral blood leukocytes as a function of estrogen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 45 adult females. The primary research question is whether leukocyte gene expression differs in individuals with varying levels of estrogen signaling. Keywords: Risk prediction

DESIGN
Study includes adult females, 11 of whom were pre-menopausal, 12 of whom were post-menopausal, 10 of whom were post-menopausal and receiving aromatase inhibitors, and 12 of whom were receiving tamoxifen.
