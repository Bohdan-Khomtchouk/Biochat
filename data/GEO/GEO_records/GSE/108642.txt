TITLE
Effects of Acute Aerobic Exercise on Whole Genome Nucleosome Maps in Skeletal Muscle of Lean vs Overweight/Obese Men

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute aerobic exercise has been shown to improve skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and completeness of fatty acid β-oxidation which contributes to reduction in lipid accumulation. We hypothesize that epigenetic regulation of mitochondrial genes due to exercise may lead to increased mitochondrial function in overweight/obese (Ov/Ob) individuals. 30 men, aged 19-30 years, were recruited and divided into two groups: lean (BMI < 25, 18.5- 24.1 kg/m2, n=15) and Ov/Ob (BMI≥25, 25.5- 36.9 kg/m2, n=15). Four hours after eating a standardized high-carbohydrate breakfast (7 kcal/kg; 60% carbohydrate, 25% fat, 15% protein), they performed an acute bout of cycling exercise (50% VO2max, spending ~650 kcal). Thirty minutes before eating the breakfast, vastus lateralis muscle biopsy samples were collected (Pre). Biopsy samples were also collected immediately after (Post) exercise. Mononucleosomal DNA was used in downstream MNase-seq via the Illumina platform. In MNase-seq analysis, whole genome nucleosomes maps were created. We found that exercise led the -1N nucleosome to repositioning away from the transcription start site in PGC-1α promoter in both lean and Ov/Ob in association with alterations in gene expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial adaptations.

DESIGN
Skeletal muscle samples (n=5 per group) were pooled to give one sample per group for MNase-seq
