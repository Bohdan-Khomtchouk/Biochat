TITLE
Expression data from WT and TREM2 deficient microglia in response to cuprizone mediated demyelination

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the role of TREM2 on microglia responses to demyelination

DESIGN
Microglia were FACS-purified from WT or Trem2-/- mice fed with 0.2% cuprizone diet.
