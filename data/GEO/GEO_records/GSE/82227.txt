TITLE
TLR2/1 ligand and IFN-g inducible genes in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiles for innate and adaptive immune stimuli important for host response against mycobacteria.  Human monocyte-derived macrophages were stimulated with TLR2/1 ligand and interferon-g, stimuli present during innate and adaptive immune responses, respectively.

DESIGN
Human monocyte-dervided macrophages from five healthy donors were stimulated with TLR2/1L, IFN-g, or media control for 2, 6, and 24 hours.  RNA-sequencing was performed on a total of 45 samples.
