TITLE
Set1 and MLL1/2 target distinct sets of functionally different genomic loci in vivo: An in depth RNA-seq analysis of H3K4me3 targets in vivo and upon Set1 and mll1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Schmidtea mediterranea

SUMMARY
This study identifies expression differences upon knockdown of two H3K4 methyltransferases, Set1 and MLL1/2, in both the stem cells (X1) and whole worm (WW) tissue of the planarian flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea. To test this, we looked at the RNA-seq expression profile in WW and X1 tissue types upon RNAi knockdown of set1, mll1/2 and compared to a non-targeted RNAi control, unc22.

DESIGN
Examine gene expression profiles of adult flatwormâ€™s X1 and WW tissue type upon knockdown of mll1/2 and set1. These were then compared to a non-targeted RNAi control, unc22.

PLATFORM
GPL20150 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Schmidtea mediterranea)
