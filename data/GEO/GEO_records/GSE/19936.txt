TITLE
Global gene profiling of glutamate-induced neuronal death

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Glutamate, a major neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous sytem, has been involved in the mediation of excitotoxicity commonly observed in the pathogenesis of stroke. Current study focused on gaining an insight into the molecular mechanisms of glutamate-induced neuronal death

DESIGN
A total of 15 RNA samples were analyzed. There is one treatment conditions of 250uM glutamate. 3 replicates were collected for each of the selected time-points (5h, 15h and 24h) in addition to 6 replicates of shared vehicle control.
