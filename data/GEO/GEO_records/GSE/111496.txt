TITLE
The effects of testosterone and lipopolysaccharide on gene expression in immortalized ocular surface and adnexal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Immortalized human corneal, conjunctival, and meibomian gland epithelial cells were pre-treated with dihydrotesteosterone (DHT) or vehicle, then exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ligand binding protein (LBP) or vehicle, lysed, and subjected to microarray analysis of RNA expression.

DESIGN
Cells were cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM) supplemented with bovine pituitary extract (BPE; 25 ug/mL HCEC and HCjE, 50 ug/mL HMGEC), 5 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), penicillin and streptomycin. After reaching confluence, cells were rinsed with PBS and cultured in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS, 10 ng/ml EGF, penicillin and streptomycin and either dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 10 nM) or ethanol control for 2 days. After this time period, cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM/F12 and exposed to vehicle (1% bovine serum albumin [BSA]), or LPS (15 Î¼g/ml) and LBP (150 ng/ml), for six hours. The LPS and LBP were dissolved in DMEM and the BSA in PBS.
