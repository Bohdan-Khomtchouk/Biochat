TITLE
Drug toxicology models by using hiPSC-derived alveolar organoids (AOs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed to obtain the transcriptomes of GNE7915-, amioarone- and vehicle control-treated hiPSC-derived SFTPC+ cells.

DESIGN
AOs harboring SFTPC+ cells were generated from isolated CPMhigh cells by coculturing with human fetal lung fibroblasts. SFTPC+ cells were passaged in AOs. After passaged three times every two weeks, AOs were treated with 5 µM of GNE7915, 10 µM of amiodarone, or vehicle control (DMSO) for 10 days. SFTPC+ cells in each condition were isolated on Day 77 (n = 3 biological replicates).
