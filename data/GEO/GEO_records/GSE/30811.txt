TITLE
SuperSAGE evidence for CD14++CD16+ monocytes as a third monocyte subset

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Monocytes are a heterogeneous cell population with subset-specific functions and phenotypes. The differential expression of CD14 and CD16 distinguishes classical CD14++CD16-, intermediate CD14++CD16+ and non-classical CD14+CD16++ monocytes. However, CD14++CD16+ monocytes remain the most poorly characterized subset so far. Therefore we analyzed the transcriptomes of the three monocyte subsets using SuperSAGE in combination with high-throughput sequencing. Analysis of 5,487,603 tags revealed unique identifiers of CD14++CD16+ monocytes, delineating these cells from the two other monocyte subsets. CD14++CD16+ monocytes were linked to antigen processing and presentation (e.g. CD74, HLA-DR, IFI30, CTSB), to inflammation and monocyte activation (e.g. TGFB1, AIF1, PTPN6), and to angiogenesis (e.g. TIE2, CD105). Therefore we provide genetic evidence for a distinct role of CD14++CD16+ monocytes in human immunity.

DESIGN
Human monocyte subsets (CD14++CD16-, CD14++CD16+, CD14+CD16++) were isolated from 12 healthy volunteers based on MACS technology. Total RNA from monocyte subsets was isolated and same aliquots from each donor and monocyte subset were matched for SuperSAGE. Three SuperSAGE libraries (CD14++CD16-, CD14++CD16+ and CD14+CD16++) were generated.
