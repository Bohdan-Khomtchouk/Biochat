TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of folic acid effects in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Doxorubicin (DOXO), a chemotherapeutic drug, is cardiotoxic. We hypothesized that folic acid is an effective therapeutic agent in a mouse model of DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity.  We performed genome-wide expression profiling to identify the underlying mechanisms.

DESIGN
Male C57Bl6 2-mo old mice received DOXO (1x20 mg/kg, ip) or saline (sham). FA (10 mg/d) or placebo (plac) was administered 7d before DOXO administration until the end of the experiment (10d).

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
