TITLE
Gene expression profiling in hepatic tissue of newly weaned pigs fed pharmacological zinc supplemented diets

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element for all life forms. Zn supplementation has been used to treat diarrheal disease in children, and in the U.S. swine industry at pharmacological levels to promote growth and fecal consistency, but underlying mechanisms explaining these beneficial effects remain unknown. Thus, we hypothesized that the benefits of pharmacological Zn supplementation were a result of changes in gene expression. For this study, liver RNA from newly weaned pigs fed dietary Zn as Zn oxide for 14 days at either adequate (150 Zn/kg) or pharmacological (2000 mg Zn/kg) levels was evaluated using a 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray.  Interrogation of this microarray revealed 658 annotated transcripts (FDR â‰¤ 0.05) affected by pharmacological Zn supplementation.  Relative real-time RT-PCR was used to confirm differential expression of two genes.  Results suggest that feeding pharmacological Zn (2000 mg Zn/kg) affects genes involved in reducing oxidative stress and in amino acid metabolism, which are essential for cell detoxification and proper cell function.
