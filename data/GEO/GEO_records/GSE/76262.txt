TITLE
Expression data of induced sputum from Unbiased BIOmarkers in Prediction of REspiratory Disease outcomes (U-BIOPRED) Project

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Asthma is a heterogeneous disease requiring understandings at molecular level that characterizes subgroups of patients with specific biomarkers to faciliate the development of targeted thearpies. We used Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 PM only arrays to explore the gene expression profile from induced sputum cells of 118 moderate/severe asthmatic patients and 21 healthy controls.

DESIGN
A cross-sectional study of 118 participants with moderate-to-severe asthma and 21 healthy controls from the U-BIOPRED underwent sputum induction. contributor: U-BIOPRED Consortium Project Team members
