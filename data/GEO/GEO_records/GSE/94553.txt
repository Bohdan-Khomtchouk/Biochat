SUMMARY
Artesunate shows potent anti-tumor activity in B-cell lymphoma by inducing ER-stress response

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated using MiRNeasy (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) after 4 and 12 h treatment with artesunate (5 µM) in BL-41, Oci-Ly-2 and SU-DHL-4. D1 and d3 refer to technical replicates. The microarray analyses were performed on Illumina’s HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The differential gene expression analysis was done using the limma package 26 in R (version 3.3.1). The differentially expressed genes were selected based on two criteria: a log fold change larger than the absolute value of 0.5, and an adjusted p-value (FDR) of less than 0.01. The probes were collapsed according to gene symbol, using the annotation file for the Illumina’s HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip platform. When several probes mapped to the same gene on the Microarray, the probe with lowest log fold change was selected. The pathways and networks most enriched for the differentially expressed genes were identified running by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Qiagen) with default settings.
