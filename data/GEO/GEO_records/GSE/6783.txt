TITLE
Expression data from HELA cells subject to EGF stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HELA cells derived from human cervical tumor were subjected to EGF stimulation for 0,20,40,60,120,240 and 480 minutes. We used microarrays to understand the temporal regulation of the cellular EGFR cascade. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
HELA cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. Cells were serum deprived for 24 hours. Following stimulation with 10 ng/ml EGF for 0,20,40,60,120,240 and 480 minutes.
