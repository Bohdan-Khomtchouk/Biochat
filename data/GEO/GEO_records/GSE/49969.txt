TITLE
Gene expression of the human choroid plexus epithelium (CPE)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the gene expression of the human CPE.We isolated CPE cells from healthy human donor choroid plexus tissues with laser dissection microscopy. Next, we performed RNA isolation, amplification, labeling and hybridization against 44k Agilent microarrays.

DESIGN
We performed the microarrays against a common reference sample, namely human RPE/choroid RNA. We performed 7 replicates of human CPE samples from 7 different donors.
