TITLE
Transcriptome response to gcr1 deletion in raffinose, galactose, and glucose

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
This experiment compares transcriptomic response of yeast cells to the deletion of Gcr1 to isogenic wild type strains, grown in YEP(3%)R at 23C.  The goal was to identify misregulated target genes and analyze the functional classifications of those targets. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
This experiment included biological replicates as well as technical dye-swap replicates of each biological sample.
