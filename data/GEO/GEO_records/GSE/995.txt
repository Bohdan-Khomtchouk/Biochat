TITLE
Differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed a general approach to small molecule library screening called GE-HTS (Gene Expression-Based High Throughput Screening) in which a gene expression signature is used as a surrogate for cellular states and applied it to the identification of compounds inducing the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells. In screening 1,739 compounds, we identified 8 that reliably induced the differentiation signature, and furthermore yielded functional evidence of bona fide differentiation.
