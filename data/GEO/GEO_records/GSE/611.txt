TITLE
Neurospheres of WT and BMI-1 KO

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cRNA derived from Brain and Gut neurospheres of wild type and BMI-1 knockout mice were hybridized to Affymetrix mouse ver 2 Chips A, B and C. In case of brain neurospheres, the cRNA were generated by one round RNA amplification (conventional method). In contrast, the cRNA of Gut neurospheres were generated by two round RNA amplifications. Keywords: parallel sample
