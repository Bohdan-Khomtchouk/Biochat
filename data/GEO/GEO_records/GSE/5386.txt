TITLE
Translation State Array Analysis of Serum Stimulated Human Endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Confluent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to histamine (100 mM) for 2 hours.  Ribosomal profiling via gradient centrifugation and fractionation was used to separate monosome, or under-translated, and polysome, or actively translated, mRNA species that were then used to probe cDNA arrays, a process known as Translation State Array Analysis (TSAA).  Four samples were obtained from these experiments, control monosome, control polysome, histamine monosome and histamine polysome.  Using the normalized signal intensities from the GeneFilters, we calculated a translation index, or measure of movement of an mRNA molecule from the monosome to the polysome fraction upon stimulation.  This calculation was made as follows:  (histamine polysome/histamine monosome)/(control polysome/control monosome).  Translational indices greater than 2.5 (upregulated) or lower than 0.4 (downregulated) were chosen for further study. Keywords: Translation State Array Analysis
