TITLE
Gene expression in leaf blades of the rice Os-LBD37 overexpressor line RK16331-13

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The 5th and 6th leaf blades of the rice Os-LBD37 overexpressor line RK16331-13 and the empty vector control line FOX3 were examined. LBD37 belongs to the plant- specific LOB- (Lateral Organ Boundary) domain family proteins first characterized in Arabidopsis. Results point towards an involvement of the rice LBD37 (OsLBD37) ortholog of Arabidopsis in nitrogen metabolism- and senescence- related processes.

DESIGN
Hygromycin- resistant rice Os-LBD37 overexpressor and empty vector control plants were grown in hydroponic culture system. The sampling date of the leaf blades of RK16331-13 LBD37 overexpressor plants and the empty vector control was determined according to the emergence of the 8th leaf blade. Three independent hybridizations were performed for line RK16331-13 and the empty vector control line.
