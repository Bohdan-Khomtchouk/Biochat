SUMMARY
To determine differential expression of microRNAs in placentae with severe pre-eclampsia and normal placenta. Differential expression of microRNAs in placentae (4 severe pre-eclampsia and 4 normal control) was screened by microarray platform, then some differential microRNAs were selected and validated with real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in placentae of severe pre-eclampsia (n=24) and normal control group (n=26). Results: We validated the expression of some microRNAs altered in the microarray, and found the following microRNAs were significantly increased in severe pre-eclampsia placentae: miR-16, miR-29b, miR-195, miR-26b, miR-181a, miR-335 and miR-222. Conclusion: These differential microRNAs may play an important role in pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.
