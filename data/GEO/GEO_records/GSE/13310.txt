TITLE
Cryptic Transcription in a set2âˆ† in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In cells lacking the histone methyltransferase Set2, initiation of RNA polymerase II transcription occurs inappropriately within the protein-coding regions of genes, rather than being restricted to the proximal promoter. Here, we mapped the transcripts produced in an S. cerevisiae strain lacking Set2, and applied rigorous statistical methods to identify sites of cryptic transcription at high resolution.
