TITLE
Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates: a study on cytochrome P450 gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Focused on the cytochromes P450 (CYPs), we studied gene expression changes in mice treated with acyclic nucleoside antivirals adefovir and tenofovir. Positive control group was treated by prototypic CYP inducers phenobarbital and beta-naphthoflavone. Expression profiling with Steroltalk cDNA arrays revealed major changes in CYP mRNA expression in the inducers-treated group but only minor changes in CYP expression in the adefovir and tenofovir groups.

DESIGN
3 groups representing treatments with adefovir, tenofovir and phenobarbital + beta-naphthoflavone. 4-5 animals in each group + a dye swap. Pooled samples from 10 animals treated with saline was used as a reference. Daily application of antivirals for three days, samples were collected after 24 hours from the last treatment.
