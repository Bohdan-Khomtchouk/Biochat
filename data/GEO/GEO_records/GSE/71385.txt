TITLE
Gene expression analysis of mouse intestinal cells that lack Cdk8

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNAseq is performed (50bp single end reads) on parental young adult mouse intestinal cells (YAMC) or two clones in which Cdk8 allele is ablated using CRISPR

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptomic changes after knockout of Cdk8 using CRISPR. Two clones of Cdk8 knockouts are compared to parental YAMC cells
