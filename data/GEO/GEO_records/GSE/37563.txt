TITLE
In vivo gene expression data from wild type and CTLA-4 KO 5C.C7 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CTLA-4 is thought to inhibit effector T cells both intrinsically, by competing with CD28 for B7 ligands, and extrinsically, through the action of regulatory T cells. We studied in vivo responses of normal and CTLA-4-deficient antigen-specific murine effector CD4+ T cells. In order to do these studies in a physiological model of immunity to foreign antigen, we transferred small numbers of congenically marked RAG2-deficient 5C.C7 T cells with either a normal or knockout allele of CTLA-4 into normal syngeneic B10.A recipient mice. The T cells were then activated by immunization with MCC peptide and LPS. To look for transcriptional signatures of negative regulation of T cell responses by CTLA-4, we used microarray analysis to compare transcripts in wild type and CTLA-4 KO 5C.C7 T cells four days after immunization. This is the first instance in which differences are observed in extent of accumulation of wild type and CTLA-4 KO 5C.C7 T cells.

DESIGN
To compare the gene expression profile between wild type and CTLA-4 KO adoptively transferred T cells 4 days after immunization.
