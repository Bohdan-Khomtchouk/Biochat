SUMMARY
Multiple myeloma is a fatal hematological malignancy. In order to develop effective therapeutic approaches, it is critical to understand the pathogenesis of myeloma. The Radl 5T model of multiple myeloma is a clinically relevant murine model where myeloma spontaneously occurs in aged, in-bred C57BlKalwRij mice and can be propagated by intravenous inoculation of 5T myeloma cells into mice of the same strain. Importantly inoculation of 5T myeloma cells into C57Bl6 mice does not result in myeloma, demonstrating that the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment of the C57BlKalwRij strain provides a unique and permissive milieu for myeloma development. We hypothesized that cells of the BM microenvironment may provide essential stimuli for the development of multiple myeloma in vivo. We aim to determine the differences in expression within the bone marrow of C57Bl/KalwRij mice.
