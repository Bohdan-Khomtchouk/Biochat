TITLE
ChIP-Seq of H3K9 acetylation for wildtype and ada2Δ cells in Cryptococcus neoformans

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans

SUMMARY
SAGA member Ada2 is required for the majority of H3K9 acetylation in C. neoformans. To identify specific genomic loci that exhibit Ada2-dependent H3K9 acetylation, we performed ChIP-Seq against H3K9ac in wildtype and ada2Δ cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq was performed using antibodies for H3K9ac in KN99 wildtype cells and ada2Δ cells.  Input and IPed DNA was collected in triplicate from each strain and sequenced on an Illumnina HiSeq 2000 flow cell producing 84 million reads.  Due to the lack of quality scores, raw reads are omitted from the submission.
