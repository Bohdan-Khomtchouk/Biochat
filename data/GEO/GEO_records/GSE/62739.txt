TITLE
Twist1 gain-of-function studied in 2 normal gastric fibroblast lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary human gastric normal fibroblast cultures (NL14 and NL32, repectivley) were establised from 2 gastrectomy specimens. Enforced expression (gain-of-function effect) of Twist1 in 2 gastric normal fibroblasts (NL14 and NL32) showed candidate target genes and CAF markers upregulated by Twist1.

DESIGN
Experiment design: 2 normal gastric fibroblasts (NL14 and NL32) were establised and studied for Twist1 gain-of-function.
