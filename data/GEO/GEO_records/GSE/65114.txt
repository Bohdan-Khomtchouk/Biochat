TITLE
Expression data from colonic mucosal biopsies from healthy controls and patients with active ulcerative colitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data was used to evaluate changes to the transcriptional signatures across the healthy and inflamed colon. A comparison between healthy controls and active ulcerative colitis signatures was also made.

DESIGN
Mucosal biopsy specimens were harvested at four anatomical locations within the colon from healthy volunteers and patients with active ulcerative colitis. specimens were fixed in RNA later for 24 hours at room temperature and stored at -80Â°C for a further 24 hours prior to RNA extraction and microarray analysis.
