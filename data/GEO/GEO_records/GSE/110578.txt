TITLE
Gene expression in granulosa cells from heifers rated as poor donors of competent oocytes

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to gain better understanding of the follicular conditions associated with low oocyte developmental competence in younger donors. In summary, we demonstrated that differences in follicle maturity at collection could explain differences in oocyte competence associated with individual animals.

DESIGN
Granulosa cells from 94 Holstein heifers and cows in a commercial embryo production facility were collected following ovarian stimulation and coasting, to compared gene expression from donors of mostly competent oocyte from cows versus incompetent oocyte from heifers

PLATFORM
