TITLE
Human Calu-3 cell transcriptome response to wild-type pandemic H1N1 (A/California/04/2009), natural isolate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA, miRNA, proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and histopathology analysis in human Calu-3 cells infected with wild-type pandemic H1N1 (A/California/04/2009), natural isolate.

DESIGN
Human Calu-3 cells were seeded at  1 x 10^6 cells per well on 6 well plates 2 days before infection. Cells were infected with an MOI of 3. After infection, wash and replace with 2 ml of DMEM-F12 + .3% BSA and 1 ug/ml TPCK-trypsin. Infected samples were collected in quintuplet; time-matched mocks were collected in quintuplet in parallel with infected samples. Time points: 12,  24, and 36 hr post-infection.
