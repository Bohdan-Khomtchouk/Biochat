TITLE
PSY1 responding transcripts in two plant lines of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant peptide containing sulfated tyrosine 1 (PSY1) has been reported to promote cell expansion and differentiation in the elongation zone of roots. To further understanding of PSY1 based cell elongation, a full genome microarray study was conducted on wild type and receptor (psy1r) mutant plants after PSY1 treatment. This approach led us to elucidate the components involved in PSY1 based cell elongation.

DESIGN
Two plant lines (Wild type and psy1r) were grown hydroponically for one week and following treated with 10 nM PSY1 for 4 hr before RNA extraction for micorarray. Three independent biological samples were prepared
