TITLE
Effects of rapamycin exposure on zebrafish ZF4 cells

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin is a well-known anticancer and immunosuppressant agent. Effects of rapamycin on zebrafish cells have not been previously studied using transcriptome analyses. Our microarray analysis on ZF4 cells showed that rapamycin treatment modulated a large set of genes with varying functions including protein synthesis, assembly of mitochondrial and proteosomal machinery, cell cycle, metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation.

DESIGN
Zebrafish ZF4 cells exposed to 100nM rapamycin was profiled using Zebrafish Affymetrix Gene Chips. Normalization by RMA and class comparison analyses were performed using BRB Array Tools.
