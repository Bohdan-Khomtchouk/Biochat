TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of neuron-enriched DRG cultures exposed to Wnt3a

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To test the potential of canonical Wnt signalling to modulate nociception via transcriptional regulation in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of neuron-enriched DRG cultures treated with Wnt3a or vehicle for 6 hours.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from neuron-enriched mouse DRG culture subjected to Wnt3a treatment for 6 hours was compared to a matched control (vehicle-treated) DRG culture.
