TITLE
Corrinoid salvaging and remodeling by Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195 in a defined consortium containing a corrinoid-producer Pelosinus fermentans strain R7

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio vulgaris str. Hildenborough ; Dehalococcoides mccartyi 195 ; Pelosinus fermentans DSM 17108

SUMMARY
Differental gene expression of three consortia: Dhc195/DVH with exogenous cobalamin, Dhc195/DVH/PF with exogenous cobalamin, Dhc195/DVH/PF without exogenous cobalamin Acronyms: Dhc195: Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195; DVH: Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough; PF: Pelosinus fermentans strain R7

DESIGN
The total RNA of cells in the three consortia extracted at exponential growth phase of Dhc195 was dechlorinated to VC was applied on the microarray to query the transcript levels of Dhc195 genes

PLATFORM
