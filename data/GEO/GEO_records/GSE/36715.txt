TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of miRNA expression in human melanoma MMRU cell line after Sox4 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Applied Biological Materials (ABM)â€™s miRNA profiling platform to quantitate expression of miRNAs in a human melanoma cell line (MMRU) in Sox4 siRNA treated cells (siSox4) compared with the control siRNA treated cells (siCTR) or after overexpression of Flag-Dicer in Sox4 knockdown cells (siSox4=F-Dicer) compared with control cells.

DESIGN
72 hours after transfection, Total RNA from siCTR, siCTR+empty Flag-vector (CTR), siSox4 or siSox4+-F-Dicer transfected MMRU cells was prepared with Qiazol extraction followed by Poly-A Tailing reactions and miRNA cDNA synthesis (ABM C204). Real-time qPCR reactions and instrumental analysis was performed using Roche LightCycler480.
