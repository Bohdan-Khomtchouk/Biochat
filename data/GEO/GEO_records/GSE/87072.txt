TITLE
Gene expression profiles from PBMCs collected from chronic smokers and moist snuff consumers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Data  reveal that smokers exhibit distinct gene expression profiles relative to non-smokers and moist snuff consumers. Moist snuff consumer gene expression largely resembles that of non-tobacco consumers. Gene expression profiles were used to identify the effects of combustible (smoking) and non-combustible tobacco (moist snuff) products use.

DESIGN
In a cross sectional study, smokers, moist-snuff consumers and non-tobacco consumers (aged 35-60 years, generally healthy all male study subjects) were enrolled. Following a overnight clinical confinement and fasting from tobacco and food, blood was collected and PBMCs were isolated.  Transcript levels were measured using Affymetrix U133 microarrays.
