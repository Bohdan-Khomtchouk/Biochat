TITLE
Effect of endophilin A deficiency in mouse hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We tested how complete or partial loss of endophilin A1, A2 and A3 affects gene expression in mouse hippocampus. Total loss of endophilin (triple knock-outs, TKO) was assessed in newborn mice, since the TKO mice only survive only several hours after birth. Partial loss of endophilin (endoA1,A2 double knock-out, DKO) was assessed between
