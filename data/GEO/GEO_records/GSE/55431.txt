TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis flowers under moderate drought stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We also used microarray analysis to examine transcriptomic changes under moderate drought, identifying thousends of genes that potentially mediate moderate drought responses in the flower, including genes encoding transcription factors that likely play crucial regulatory roles.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis were well-watered until after just bolting (after 24 days growth with the main stem about 1 cm high) when moderate drought treatment was started by withholding water (defined as day 0 for moderate drought treatment). The relative soil moisture content decreased rapidly and, after about 48 hours the relative soil moisture content was near 50% of the soil water-holding capacity (first moderate drough treated sample M3 were collected at day 3 (72 h after withholding water)). The soil water condition was maintained by daily watering until almost all the fruits were mature and ready to harvest (about 50 days). For well-watered (control) plants, 90% of the soil water-holding capacity was maintained until tissue harvest or after seed maturation (pots were weighed and watered twice per day). Unopened floral bud samples were collected at day 0, 3, 4, 5, 10.
