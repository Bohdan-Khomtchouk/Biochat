TITLE
Functional genomic analysis of cold acclimation in the genus Solanum

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Healthy five-weeks old S. tuberosum (Red Pontiac) and S. commersonii (Oka 5040) were subjected to cold-acclimating temperature (2oC) in the growth chamber. Control plants at identical developmental stage were also grown in growth chamber at optimum conditions for growth (28oC, 14/10, light/dark, 65% RH). Leaf tissues were collected from the control (reference) and cold-acclimating (experimental treatment, 2oC) plants for each species at 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 days after the initiation of the control and low temperature treatments. A total of two plants for each species were used for both the control and treatment experiments and tissue samples from each plant (within replicate) were pooled for RNA isolation. These experiments were performed twice in order to produce two sets of biological replicates for each species for all sampling time-points. Keywords: Reference design
