TITLE
Expression Data from 24 orthotopic tumors grown in the pancreas of mice +/- MEK inhibitor PD0325901

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of mRNA profiles after MEK1/2 inhibition in human pancreatic cancer cell lines reveals pathways involved in drug sensitivity. We used microarrays to find gene expression patterns associated with drug response and also identified genes regulated by the MAP kinase pathway

DESIGN
6 pancreatic cell lines were injected into the pancreas of nude mice and treated either with vehicle control or PD0325901 for 12 plus 12 hours.
