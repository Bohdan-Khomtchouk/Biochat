TITLE
BT474 and BT474-J4 microarray data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These data provide scientific information to understand the mechanism of action of lapatinib resistance in HER2-positive patients and to test the combination of HER2-targeted agents and GSK1363089 (foretinib) in the clinic by using an acquired lapatinib-resistant cell line.

DESIGN
Cell lines (BT474, an HER2-positive and lapatinib-sensitive cell line; BT474-J4, an acquired lapatinib-resistant cell line) were treated with lapatinib alone (1uM), foretinib (GSK1363089) alone (0.1 uM), a combination of lapatinib (1 uM) and foretinib (0.1 uM), or DMSO control for 24 hours. Triplicates were performed.
