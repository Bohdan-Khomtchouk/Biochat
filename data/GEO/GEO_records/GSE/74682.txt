TITLE
RNA-seq of Mesp1-induced cardiopharyngeal mesoderm derivatives from ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have developed a protocol to generate cardiopharyngeal mesoderm (CPM) in vitro by Mesp1 induction in ES cells.  The goal of this study is to compare the transcriptome of CPM-derived cardiac and skeletal myogenic progenitors to identify novel lineage-specific markers.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of CPM-derived D6 (early) and D12 (late), cardiac (BMP) and skeletal myogenic (control) progenitors were generated

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
