TITLE
Long non-coding RNAs from divergent transcription of protein-coding genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A remarkable number of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) species have been identified in mammalian cells, but the genomic origins of these molecules in individual cell types is poorly understood.  As a prerequisite to studying the transcriptional regulation of lncRNAs, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the genomic origins of lncRNAs expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs).

DESIGN
Polyadenylated RNA and total RNA depleted of ribosomal content was used for preparation of two independent  sequencing libraries
