TITLE
ATXN7L3 And ENY2 Coordinate Activity Of Multiple H2B Deubiquitinases Important For Cellular Proliferation And Tumor Growth [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that the H2B deubiquitinating enzymes USP22, USP27x and USP51 have both unique and overlapping target loci.

DESIGN
Comparing H2Bb1 (K120) distribution profiles of MCF7 cells stably expressing shRNA targeting ATXN7L3, USP22, USP27X or USP51 and cells expressing non-targeting shRNA.
