TITLE
Required Enhancer: Matrin-3 Structure Interactions for Homeodomain Transcription Programs

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Study of the POU-homeodomain transcription factor, has revealed that, binding of Pit1-occupied enhancers to a nuclear matrin-3-rich network/architecture is a key event in effective activation of the Pit1-regulated enhancer / coding gene transcriptional program.

DESIGN
All ChIP-seq(s) were designed to understand the unique features, associated molecular mechanisms and functions of Matrin3 in the Homeodomain transcription study. Gro-seq Samples are used to detect gene expression between knockdown control and knockdown two key factors in our study.
