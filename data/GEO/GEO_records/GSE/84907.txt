TITLE
Increased osteoblast viability at alkaline pH in vitro provides a new perspective on bone regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Developing osteoblasts undergo a sequence of three consecutive phases: cell proliferation, extracellular matrix maturation, and mineralization. We investigated pH effects on these phases using the osteoblast-like cell line MC3T3-E1.

DESIGN
MC3T3sc14 cells were cultured at pH 7.4, 7.8 or 8.4 for 14 days before gene expression analysis was run with Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse 2.0 ST Arrays (4 samples each)

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
