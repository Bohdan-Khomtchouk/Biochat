TITLE
Streptococcus agalactiae stringent response RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Streptococcus agalactiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus) grown under control conditions or coincubated with serine hydroxamate to induce the bacterial stringent response

DESIGN
Two strains of S. agalactiae (10/84 and A909) were grown to mid-log phase either in control broth or coincubated with serine hydroxamate. Each strain-condition pair was  RNA was extracted and used for RNA-seq in order to identify differentially expressed genes.
