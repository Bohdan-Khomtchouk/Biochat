TITLE
Characterization of Gene Expression At the Human Maternal-Fetal Interface

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis to globally assess gene expression at the maternal-fetal interface Keywords: age

DESIGN
27 non-labored normal preterm and 9 non-labored normal term basal plate samples were analyzed on Affymetrix U133 chips using established protocols.   The gene expression profile of preterm was compared to term.
