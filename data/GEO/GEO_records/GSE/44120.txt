TITLE
miR-223 in esophageal adenocarcinoma carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-223 is step-wise increasingly up-regulated in the normal esophagus - Barrett's esophagus -esophageal adenocarcinoma carcinoma sequence. In this study, we aimed to determine the function of miR-223 in esophageal adenocarcinoma carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
miR-223 was transfected in OE33 cells using 10nM pre-miR hsa-miR-223 miRNA precursor (Ambion, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and lipofectamin 2000 (OE33_223_1 and OE33_223_2). Mock control OE33 cells were transfected with a negative control pre-miR miRNA (OE33_NEG_1 and OE33_NEG_2). HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip arrays (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used for microarray hybridizations to examine the global gene expression of two biological replicated experiments (four samples in total). The array targets more than 25,000 annotated genes with 47,323 unique probes derived from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence (RefSeq) Release 38 and UniGene (Build 199) databases.
