TITLE
TAL1 knock down in human erythroid progenitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray profiling in erythroid cells to uncover TAL1 dependent genes in a hematopoietic differentiation context.

DESIGN
Differentiated ex vivo hematopoietic multipotential progenitors isolated from adult peripheral blood. The knockdown of TAL1 (KD) was induced in pro-erythroblasts (Days 8 and 9 of differentiation) using lentivirus-delivered shRNA. A scramble (scr) shRNA sequence was used as a negative control.
