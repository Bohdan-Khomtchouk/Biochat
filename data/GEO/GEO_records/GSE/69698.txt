TITLE
Vitamin D stimulation of primary skeletal muscle myoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of proliferating primary myoblasts obtained from vastus lateralis muscle biopsises from healthy individuals and stimulated with Vitamin D (100 nM 1,25(OH)2D3) or vehicle for 24h.

DESIGN
Myoblasts isolated from 6 healthy donors were either sitmuleted with Vitamin D (n=6) or vehcicle (n=6) for 24 h
