TITLE
GSC RT-PCR amplification of 10 cells (SP & CD8 T cells), single SP cell and single-SP-cell equivalent

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GSM48315-GSM48332: Ten cells from C57Bl/6 male mouse bone marrow (SP or CD8 T cells) were sorted into individual wells of 96-well plates. The mRNA of these cells was amplified by the global single cell RT-PCR method and biotinylated targets were generated after optimal digestion with DNAse I. GSM48333-GSM48344: Single SP cell from C57Bl/6 male mouse bone marrow were sorted into individual wells of 96-well plates. The mRNA of these single cells was amplified by the global single cell RT-PCR method and biotinylated targets were generated after optimal digestion with DNAse I. GSM48345-GSM48349: Forty bone marrow SP cells from C57Bl/6 male mouse bone marrow, Sca-1 positive and Gr-1 negative, gated on the tip of the SP tail, were sorted into 160 microliters of lysis buffer (40 times the amount used for single cells). 4-microliter aliquots (containing the mRNA equivalent to one single cell) were dispensed into individual wells of 96-well plates. The mRNA contained in each aliquot was amplified by the global single cell RT-PCR method and biotinylated targets were generated after optimal digestion with DNAse I. Detection of the microarray hybridization signals was done according to the standard Affymetrix protocol (antibody amplified).
