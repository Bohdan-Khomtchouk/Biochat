TITLE
Gene expression profiling in psoriatic lesional and non-lesional skin [brodalumab treatment]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the psoriasis phenotype and pathways involved in psoriasis, we characterized gene expression in lesional and non-lesional skin from psoriasis patients. Furthermore, we explored the effects of various doses of brodalumab on lesional skin over time.

DESIGN
From each of the 25 psoriasis patients, we obtained two pre-dose biopsies, one from a lesion and the other from non-lesional skin in the same general body geography, and two post-dose biopsies. Total RNA was extracted from 6mm punch biopsies that were split in half. A total of 99 samples were run on Affymetrix HU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. There was no paired non-lesional sample for 'T_lesional_pre-dose' (skn55789).
