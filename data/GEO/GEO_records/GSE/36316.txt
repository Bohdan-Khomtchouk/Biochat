TITLE
Murine primary dendritic cells: Control vs. Influenza-infected vs. polyI:C stimulated.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MIcroRNA expression profiling of primary murine splenic dendritic cells (Flt3L expanded) comparing untreated cells to cells infected with Influenza A or stimulated with polyI:C in vitro.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, Influenza A/PR/8/34 virus MOI=10 vs polyI:C 30 ug/mL vs. mock treated; RNA collected after 8 hours.  3 Independent biological replicates from cells prepared on different days. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
