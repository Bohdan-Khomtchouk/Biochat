TITLE
Expression Profiling of Primary Human Proerythroblasts (ProEs) After IRF2, IRF6, and MYB shRNA Knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IRF2, IRF6, and MYB are candidate regulators of human erythropoiesis. We here examine primary CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs)-derived erythroid progenitors with control, IRF2, IRF6, or MYB shRNA lentiviral transduction prior to differentiation. Gene expression microarray profiling datasets for MYB shRNA and control shRNA were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE25678. The data were analyzed together with the datasets obtained in this study.

DESIGN
Primary maturing adult erythroblasts were generated ex vivo from CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) using a serum-free two-phase liquid culture system. CD34+ HSPCs were transduced with lentiviruses containing shRNAs against IRF2 or IRF6 gene, selected and differentiated to proerythroblasts (ProEs). Cells were harvested at day 5 of differentiated and total RNA were extracted. This was used to hybridize to Affymetrix expression arrays using the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 platform.
