TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mRNA transcriptomes in dendritic cell and exosome-treated dendritic cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The present research aimed to demonstrate that pancreatic cancer related miRNAs can be transferred from exosome to dendritic cells and influence mRNA expression, inducing immune tolerance of dendritic cells .Immature dendritic cells were induced from peripheral blood monocytes and stimulated by exosomes collected from PANC-1 cell culture.Genome-wide mRNA chip were performed in iDC and exosome stimulated iDC to detect the change of mRNA expression level.

DESIGN
examination of 2 cells:Immature dendritic cell and exosome-treated dendritic cell
