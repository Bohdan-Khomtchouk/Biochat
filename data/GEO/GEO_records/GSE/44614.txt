TITLE
Comparative transcriptomics of Escherichia coli growing in complex environments

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Long-term experiment (150 days) of Escherichia coli MC1000 with daily transfers into fresh LB medium and under three different oxygen regimes.

DESIGN
An overnight culture of E coli (ancestor culture) was propagated in LB media with three different oxygen regimes during 150 days. One regime involved transfers under constant shaking (200rpm): Treatment A-Replica populations 1 and 2 , second regime consisted in a daily shift between shaking and static (no shaking) conditions: Treatment B-replica populations 3,4 and 5. The third regime involved transfers in constant static conditions: Treatment C-Populations 6 and 7. After 150 days and plating, 3 different colony types were selected by population (populations 6 and 7 only had 2 different morphologies). Morpholigies were marked as a, b, c in each population. cDNA was obtainned  from each morphology after growing separately in LB medium, under they correspondant evolving condition until late logaritmic phase (0,6-0,7 in OD600).  A total of 19 evolved forms were analyzed plus one ancestor.  Each morphology was labeled in a dye-swap design and hybridized to the ancestor into genome-wide multi-strain E. coli (8x15K) microarrays.
