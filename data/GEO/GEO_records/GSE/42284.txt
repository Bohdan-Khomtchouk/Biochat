TITLE
Full genome expression profiling of primary colorectal cancer (CRC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fresh-frozen primary tumor samples from CRC patients were analyzed from their gene expression. Full genome unsupervised clustering identified three intrinsic subtypes that are associated with tumor and clinical characteristics.

DESIGN
Primary CRC samples (188) were hybridzed against a common colon cancer reference pool (CRP).
