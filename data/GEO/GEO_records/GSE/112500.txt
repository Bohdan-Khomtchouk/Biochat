TITLE
Comparison of transcriptomic landscapes of different lamb muscles using RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Transcriptome deep sequencing is a powerful tool for exploring the genetic architecture of complex traits. Gene expression patterns may explain a high degree of the observed phenotypic differences in histochemical and metabolic parameters related to meat quality among different muscles. Utilizing RNA Sequencing, this study characterized the whole transcriptome of nine lamb muscles: Semimembranosus (SM), Semitendinosus (ST), Gluteobiceps (GB), Gluteus medius (GM), Rectus femoris (RF), Supraspinatus (SS), Longissimus lumborum (LL), Adductor (AD) and Psoas major (PS).

DESIGN
Muscle samples were collected from four unrelated Poll Dorset cross-bred lambs. After weaning, lambs received soy crop and grain sorgum supplementation until slaughter, with final live weights ranging from 67 to 72 kg at 14 months old. Tissue samples were collected immediately after slaughter from the mid superficial belly of the following nine muscles: Semimembranosus (SM), Semitendinosus (ST), Gluteobiceps (GB), Gluteus medius (GM), Rectus femoris (RF), Supraspinatus (SS), Longissimus lumborum (LL), Adductor (AD) and Psoas major (PM). Muscle tissue samples (4 lambs x 9 muscles = 36 samples) were then subjected to RNA extraction, library generation, and sequencing.
