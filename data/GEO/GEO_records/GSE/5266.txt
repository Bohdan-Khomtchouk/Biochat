TITLE
Expression data from normal atria and ventricles

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Pharmacological and gene ablation studies have demonstrated a crucial role of the cardiac natriuretic peptides (NP) hormones ANF and BNP in the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis.  In addition, hypertension and chronic congestive heart failure are  clinical entities that may be regarded as states of relative NP deficiency. Hence the study of the function of the endocrine heart is highly relevant. To identify genes that are related to the endocrine function of the heart we have conducted differential gene expression studies of the rat atria and ventricles using oligonucleotide arrays. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
