TITLE
A zebrafish melanoma model reveals emergence of neural crest identity during melanoma initiation [human cell line RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report gene expression data for human melanoma cell lines using RNAseq.

DESIGN
RNAseq was performed on 8 melanoma cell lines and one normal human melanocyte cell line.  All done as single replicates, except for two biological replicates of A375.
