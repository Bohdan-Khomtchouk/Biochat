TITLE
A gene expression profile of BRCAness that is associated with outcome in ovarian cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A gene expression profile of BRCAness was defined in publicly available expression data of 61 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (34 patients with BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 mutations and 27 patients with sporadic disease). This dataset is publicly available at http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/94/13/990/DC1 The BRCAness profile was correlated with outcome in 70 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and known outcome data.
