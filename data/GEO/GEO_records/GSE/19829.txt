TITLE
A gene expression profile of BRCAness that is associated with outcome in ovarian cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A gene expression profile of BRCAness was defined in publicly available expression data of 61 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (34 patients with BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 mutations and 27 patients with sporadic disease). This dataset is publicly available at The BRCAness profile was correlated with outcome in 70 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and known outcome data.

DESIGN
Correlation with outcome
