TITLE
Expression profiling of mouse primary prostate luminal cells from WT and T-ETV1 mice, which contains human ETV1 cDNA under the endogenous Tmprss2 promoter.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chromosomal rearrangements involving ETS factors, ERG and ETV1, occur frequently in prostate cancer. We here examine mouse prostate cells from WT mice with s with T-ETV1 mice, which contains express the truncated human ETV1 under the endogenous Tmprss2 promoter. ETV1 expression can be tracked by GFP expression.

DESIGN
Primary prostate cells were isolated and luminal prostate cells were FACS-sorted by CD49F+ Sca1- from the lineage (CD31, CD45, Ter119) negative fraction.  Total RNA was extracted from three biological replicates, and amplified using NuGEN V2cDNA amplification kit. This was used to hybridize to Affymetrix expression arrays using the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 platform.
