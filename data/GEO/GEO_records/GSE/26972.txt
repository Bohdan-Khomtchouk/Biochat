TITLE
Expression data from non-demented controls (NDCs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AD is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. However, disease etiology is still practically unknown. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease we used the Affymetrix exon arrays to profile the alternative splicing landscape of human entorhinal cortex samples from AD patients and controls. We found a few hundred events of alternative spicing that characterize the AD entorhinal cortex and may have profound effect on the pathogenesis of this disease. Expression was analyzed using Affymetrix Human Exon 1 S.T arrays

DESIGN
samples from 3 female NDCs and 3 female AD patients were included in this study
