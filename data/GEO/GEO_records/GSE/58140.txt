TITLE
Expression data from mutant p53 breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor associated mutant p53 proteins often gain new functions for tumorigenesis and tumor progression.  It has been shown that mutant p53 can transcriptionally regulate a group of genes, which in turn contributes to mutant p53 gain of function.  A mutant p53 interacting protein Pontin binds to mutant p53 and promotes its gain of function.  This experiment tests whether the interaction of Pontin with mutant p53 regulates the transcriptional activity of mutant p53. We used a breast cancer cell line containing endogenous mutant p53 (SK-BR-3) with or without knockdown of mutant p53 by shRNA to identify genes regulated by mutant p53.  We then knocked down endogenous Pontin in SK-BR-3 cells, and compared the transcriptional levels of these genes in cells with and without mutant p53 knockdown to investigate the effect of Pontin on mutant p53-dependent transcriptional regulation.

DESIGN
Four types of cells were used in this experiments: SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells transfected with control shRNA, SK-BR-3 cells transfected with p53 shRNA, SK-BR-3 cells with transfection of siRNA against Pontin, SK-BR-3 cells transfected with p53 shRNA and siRNA against Pontin.  Cells were collected to extract total RNA for Affymetrix microarray analysis.
