TITLE
Expression data from postnatal mouse brain regions of Ts1Cje and disomic C57BL/6 mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Ts1Cje mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) has partial triplication of mouse chromosome 16 (MMU16), which is partially homologous to human chromosome 21. The mouse model develops various neuropathological features identified in DS individuals. We analysed the effect of partial triplication of the MMU16 segment on global gene expression in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus of Ts1Cje mice at 4 time-points; postnatal day (P)1, P15, P30 and P84.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from thre brain regions (Cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum) for hybridization to arrays from 3 pairs of Ts1Cje and disomic C57BL/6 littermate control for each timepoints at postnatal (P) day 1, P15, P30 and P84.
