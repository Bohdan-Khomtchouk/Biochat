SUMMARY
Recombinant protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa hook protein FlgE was added to cultured human corneal epithelial cell line for 4 hours and the mRNA expression profiling was performed using Agilent 8*60K array and dual labeling.

DESIGN
Three triplicates were included for FlgE treatment and PBS control respectively, thus producing three pairs of samples for array, namely E1PBS1, E2PBS2, E3PBS3.
