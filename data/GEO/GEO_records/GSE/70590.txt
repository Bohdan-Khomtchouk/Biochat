TITLE
RNA-seq analyses of kdm5 mutant flies and wt flies under normal condition and oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Comparing the transcriptome of wildtype and kdm5 mutant flies in normal conditions revealed a total of 4787 genes that were significantly downregulated and thus require KDM5 for their activation, and 3269 upregulated genes that are normally repressed by KDM5 (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.05).  Because kdm5 mutants are sensitive to the oxidizer paraquat, we also carried out RNA-seq from wildtype and kdm5 mutant adults in oxidative stress conditions.  Paraquat treatment of wildtype flies lead to the upregulation of 2481, and downregulation of 3103 genes

DESIGN
adult mRNA profiles of 1-3-days old wild type (WT) and kdm5 mutant under normal condition and oxitative stress were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HisSeq 2000.
