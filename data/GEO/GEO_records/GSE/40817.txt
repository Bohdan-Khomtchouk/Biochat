TITLE
Expression data from S. cerevisiae after evolution under diverse conditions

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We conducted a set of lab-evolution experiments in yeast and followed the long-term dynamics of aneuploidy under diverse conditions including heat shock and high PH.

DESIGN
Each evolution experiment starts with an ancestor strain that was subjected (in several independent repetitions) to certain growth conditions such as high temperature 39째C, permissive temperature 30째C, gradually increasing temperature from 30째C to 39째C, high pH=8.6 and normal PH. In all cases the mRNA extraction was performed on a population sample that was grown for 18 generations under stress-less conditions. This is since we aimed to measure the gene expression changes that are due to stress adaptation and not the physiological response.
