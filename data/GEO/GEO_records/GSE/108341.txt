TITLE
ICAMs are not obligatory for functional immune synapses between na√Øve CD4 T cells and lymph node DCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The quantitative deep bulk MARS-seq analysis demonstrated that DCs from ICAM-1/2 double knockout (DKO) chimeric LNs  display similar transcriptomes to those of WT DCs in both their resting and CD40 mAb activated states.

DESIGN
Transciptome analysis of activated and resting classical DCs from either WT or ICAM-1/2 DKO chimeric mice was performed. DC cells were isolated from popliteal lymph nodes and sorted according to the following markers: CD45, CD11c and MHC-II

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
