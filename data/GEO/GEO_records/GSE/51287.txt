TITLE
Methylation profiles of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients and cancer-free individual in Taiwan.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of tumor and normal samples with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients. The Illumina GolodenGate methylation cancer panel I was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 1,505 CpGs in esophageal squemous cell carcinoma samples. Samples included normal, tumors and plasma samples with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, also inculding the plasma samples with cancer-free individual.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 288 samples were hybridised to the Illumina GolodenGate methylation cancer panel I
