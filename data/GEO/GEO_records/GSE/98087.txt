TITLE
Identification of symmetric methylation of histone H4 arginine 3 on KSHV genome (iSLKBac16WT ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Human gammaherpesvirus 8

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify the symmetric methylation sites on KSHV genome during latency and lytic reactivation

DESIGN
KSHV infected iSLKBac16WT cells were induced with doxycycline for 24h to trigger the lytic reactivation, cells were crosslinked and subjected for chromatin isolation and sonication. ChIP assay was performed using specific antibodies.
