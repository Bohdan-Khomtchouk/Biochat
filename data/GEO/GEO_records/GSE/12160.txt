TITLE
Expression profiling of Hyperoxia-Tolerant Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
One of the critical substances that mammals highly regulate via the respiratory, cardiovascular and neurologic systems is O2. Both low and high O2 levels can induce major morbidities as well as mortality. Indeed, O2 has been often considered as both an elixir and a poison in humans. In current study, we have used an experimental selection approach to generate Drosophila strains that are tolerant to severe hyperoxic environment.  Gene expression profiling is then applied to investigate the mechanisms underlying hyperoxia tolerance in the newly generated strains.
