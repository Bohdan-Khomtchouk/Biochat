TITLE
A zebrafish melanoma model reveals emergence of neural crest identity during melanoma initiation [zebrafish RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We report gene expression data for FACS sorted zebrafish crestin_1kb:EGFP + cells collected at 15 somite stage (SS).

DESIGN
crestin_1kb:EGFP + embryos were homogenized, filtered, and sorted using FACS into PBS, collecting ~5,500 EGFP (+) cells and 100K EGFP (-) cells with a single sample for each.

PLATFORM
GPL18413 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Danio rerio)
