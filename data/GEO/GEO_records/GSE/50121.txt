TITLE
Runx3 function in IL-2-activated splenic CD8+ T cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD8+T cells are immune cells that recognize foreign antigens on infected and tumor cells, leading to cytokine-dependent expansion and activation of cytotoxicity towards the targets.

DESIGN
To identify Runx3 regulated genes, CD8+ T cells were isolated from spleen of WT and Runx3-/- mice . Six samples (3 WT and 3 Runx3-/-)  of CD8+ T cells were separately obtained from individual mice, TCR activated and cultured for 4 days with IL-2.
