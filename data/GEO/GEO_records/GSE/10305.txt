TITLE
A method of stripping custom microarrays

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Our genome wide analyses of microRNA expression profiles involve the hybridization of fluorescently labeled RNA samples to custom made, DNA microarrays based on the GAPSII coated slides.  We describe a simple and effective method to regenerate such custom microarrays.  Our protocol entails the use of a very low concentration of sodium hydroxide in a low salt buffer to strip RNA molecules from the arrays.  The solution is also capable of removing DNA molecules hybridized to the slides, while preserving the slide coating and printed DNA probes.  Slides can be stripped and reused at least twice without significantly sacrificing data quality. Keywords: expression study, new vs. stripped array comparison
