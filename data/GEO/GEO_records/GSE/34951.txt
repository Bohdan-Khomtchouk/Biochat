TITLE
Activation of seed-specific genes in leaves and roots of the desiccation-tolerant plant, Xerophyta humilis

ORGANISM
Xerophyta humilis

SUMMARY
Measurement of changes in the mRNA transcript abundance of 1709 cDNAs in desiccated (5% RWC) and hydrated (100% RWC) Xerophyta humilis leaves and roots, and in mature seeds.

DESIGN
3105 cDNA clones (corresponding to 1709 unique cDNAs) were randomly selected from X. humilis cDNA libraries (Leaf Dehydration (LD), Leaf Rehydration (LR), Root Dehydration (RD) and Root Rehydration (RR)), amplified by PCR, and printed on each glass slide multiple times (ranging from 4 to 12X), such that each printed block contained a random unbiased mixture of cDNAs from the 4 different cDNA libraries. Total RNA extracted from each X. humilis leaf, root and seed sample was labelled with Cy3 and hybridized to the printed cDNA arrays. Data was recorded for three biological replicates for each of the samples being investigated.

PLATFORM
GPL15102 ILLING Xerophyta 1709 v1.0.
