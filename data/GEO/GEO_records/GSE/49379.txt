TITLE
Large-scale multi-species survey of metabolome and lipidome

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta ; Pan troglodytes ; Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This dataset was generated with the goal of comparative study of gene expression in three brain regions and two non-neural tissues of humans, chimpanzees, macaque monkeys and mice. Using this dataset, we performed studies of gene expression and gene splicing evolution across species and search of tissue-specific gene expression and splicing patterns. We also used the gene expression information of genes encoding metabolic enzymes in this dataset to support a larger comparative study of metabolome evolution in the same set of tissues and species.

DESIGN
120 tissue samples of prefrontal cortex (PFC), primary visual cortex (VC), cerebellar cortex (CBC), kidney and skeletal muscle of humans, chimpanzees, macaques and mice. The data accompanies a large set of metabolite measurements of the same tissue samples. Enzyme expression was used to validate metabolite measurement variation among species.
