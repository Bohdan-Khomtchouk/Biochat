TITLE
Standardized whole-blood transcriptional profiling enables the deconvolution of complex induced immune responses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study employs a standardized whole-blood stimulation systems to test the hypothesis that responses to Toll-like receptor ligands or whole microbes can be defined by the combined transcriptional signatures of key effector cytokines.

DESIGN
The study encompasses the analysis of 21 distinct whole blood stimulations from 25 healthy donors from the Milieu Interieur Cohort (www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01699893)
