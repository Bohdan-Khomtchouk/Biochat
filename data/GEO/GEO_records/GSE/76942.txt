TITLE
Assessing gene expression in Rnaseh2b null murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Assessing differential gene expression in Rnaseh2b null (p53-/-, Rnaseh2b -/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) vs control (p53-/-, Rnaseh2b +/+) .

DESIGN
Gene expression was compared between two independent p53-/- Rnaseh2b-/- MEF lines versus four independent p53-/- Rnaseh2b+/+ MEF lines grown under confluent culture conditions and passage matched. MEFs were generated from individual whole E10.5 embryos and were on a C57BL/6J background.
