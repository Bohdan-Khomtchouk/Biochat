TITLE
Microarray data of dermal cells from ventral or dorsal skin of virgin and pregnant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify genes expressed predominantly in the ventral skin dermis of pregnant mice, we performed DNA microarray analysis by using isolated dermal tissues from ventral skin at 0 and 15 dpc, PP2-injected ventral skin at 15 dpc, and dorsal skin at 15 dpc.

DESIGN
8-12-week-old C57BL/6 virgin or pregnant (at 12 dpc) female mice were intradermally injected with PP2 or control DMSO twice a day for 4 days. At 0 or 15 dpc, the dermal cells were isolated from ventral or dorsal skin. Total RNA was isolated from the dermal cells and subjected to Affymetrix microarray using GeneChip 3'IVT Expression Kit.
