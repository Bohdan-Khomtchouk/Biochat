TITLE
Effect of 10 Cigarette Smoke Condensates on Primary Human Airway Epithelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nine cigarette smoke condensates (CSCs) were produced under a standard ISO smoking machine regimen and one was produced by a more intense smoking machine regimen. These CSCs were used to treat primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells for 18 hours.

DESIGN
Primary human bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells were grown in culture and treated with 10 different sources of cigarette smoke condensates.
