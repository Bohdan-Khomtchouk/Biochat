TITLE
Synergistic effects of TRAIL and taurolidine on soft tissue sarcoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis revealed differential gene expression patterns of rhabdomyosarcoma (A-204), leiomyosarcoma (SK-LMS-1) and epithelioid cell sarcoma (VA-ES-BJ) cells treated with TRAIL and/or taurolidine. To explore new therapeutic options in the treatment of sarcomas, we tested the antibiotic taurolidine (TRD) on A-204, SK-LMS-1 and VA-ES-BJ carcinoma cell lines alone and in combination with rhTRAIL (TNF related apoptosis-inducing ligand). Gene expression was analysed by RNA microarray.

DESIGN
Cell lines were treated with Taurolidine, Trail and a combination of both and compaired to untreated cells
