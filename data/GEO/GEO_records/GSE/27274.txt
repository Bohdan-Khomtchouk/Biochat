TITLE
Fibrinogen is upregulated following kidney damage and protects it against ischemia-reperfusion injury

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
characterization of fibrinogen expression in the kidney, excretion in the urine following kidney damage and evaluating the therapeutic potential of fibrinogen in acute kidney injury.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated of renal cortex and medulla from rats subjected to 20 min of bilateral ischemia followed by 6, 24 120, hr of reperfusion compared to sham  rats.
