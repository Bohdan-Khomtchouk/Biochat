TITLE
Methylation analysis of locally advanced breast tumors treated with two drugs-doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of locally advanced breast tumors before and after treatment with doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil Mitomycin C

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 33 paired tumor samples and 9 normal samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2. After preprocessing, seven paired samples treated with doxorubicin were excluded due to low methylation levels, resulting in 26 paired tumor samples that were further analyzed.

PLATFORM
