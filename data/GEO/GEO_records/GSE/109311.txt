TITLE
Microarray-sequencing of WT and Jam3-null leukemia-initiating cells (LICs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To tease apart the downstream signaling triggered by the Jam3-mediated signaling, Microarray-sequencing analyses were conducted with WT and Jam3-null LICs.The gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that JAM3 might mainly be involved in signal transduction and phosphorylation pathways. KEGG further indicated that JAM3 was required for the Wnt signaling and hematopoietic cell lineage.

DESIGN
WT and Jam3-null YFP+Mac-1+c-Kit+ LICs were purified by flow cytometry for the extraction of total RNA and subjected to Microarray-sequencing.
