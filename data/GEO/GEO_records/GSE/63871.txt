TITLE
Smad2 and Smad3 binding sites in H345-TbRII cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta induces apoptosis of many types of cancer cells and acts as a tumor suppressor. We found lower expression of TGF-beta type II receptor (TbRII) in most of SCLC cells and tissues than in normal lung epithelial cells and normal lung tissues, respectively. In vitro cell growth and in vivo tumor formation were suppressed by TGF-beta-mediated apoptosis when the wild-type TbRII was overexpressed in SCLC cells. We therefore determined Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3) binding sites in a SCLC cell line H345 stably expressing exogenous TbRII (H345-TbRII) to identify target genes of TGF-beta.

DESIGN
Smad2 and Smad3 binding sites in H345-TbRII cells were determined by ChIP-seq (one sample analysis, without replicates).
