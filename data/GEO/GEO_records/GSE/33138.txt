TITLE
Gene expression of Tg 3×FLAG-Nanos2-deltaN10 mouse male gonad

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the biochemical function of NANOS2, we performed expression microarray analysis of the embyornic male gonad of Nanos2 hetero, Nanos2 KO, and Nanos2 KO_Tg 3×FLAG-tagged Nanos2-ΔN10, which is truncated form of Nanos2 in the N-terminal region, transgenic mice.

DESIGN
3×FLAG-tagged Nanos2-ΔN10 protein function was validated by rescue experiment in the Nanos2-null male gonad of mouse embryo at E14.5. Biological duplicates were examined at each genotype, Nanos2 hetero, Nanos2 KO, and Nanos2 KO_Tg 3×FLAG-tagged Nanos2-ΔN10 for each experiment.
