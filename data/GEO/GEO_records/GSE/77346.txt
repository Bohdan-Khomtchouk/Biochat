TITLE
Analysis of differentially expressed genes between trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant gastric cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression profiles in trastuzumab-sensitive NCI-N87 cell line versus four trastuzumab-resistant cell lines (N87-TR1, N87-TR2, N87-TR3, N87-TR4) by microarray analysis in order to identify groups of genes associated with a specific signaling pathway or biological process.

DESIGN
One trastuzumab-sensitive cell line (NCI-N87) and four trastuzumab-resistant cell lines (N87-TR1, N87-TR2, N87-TR3, N87-TR4). Total RNA was obtained from subconfluent cells using Trizol reagent.
