TITLE
Expression data from human skin biposies (lesional and uninvolved) from psoriatic patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Biopsies from uninvolved and from lesional skin of 13 patients with plaque-type psoriasis. Based on paired samples, 179 genes were more than 2-fold differentially expressed in lesional skin. Keywords: Comparison of uninvolved and lesional skin

DESIGN
Comparative RNA expression profiles from uninvolved and lesional skin of 13 patients with mild to severe plaque-type psoriasis.
