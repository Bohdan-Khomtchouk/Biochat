TITLE
Differential gene expression in the liver among crossbred beef steers with divergent gain and feed intake phenotypes

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Steer liver transcriptome Evaluation of the naturally occurring transcriptome variation in liver among beef steers with divergent gain and feed intake phenotypes.

DESIGN
The transcriptomes of liver were examined for expression differences that contribute to cattle feed efficiency.
