TITLE
Comparative genomic hybridisation data from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis lung infections

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen in the lungs of the cystic fibrosis patients.  As infection develops the organism progressively adapts to its environment and its mode of pathogenesis alters, frequently including the loss of quorum sensing (QS) regulated virulence factors. We used microarrays to determine genomic differences by comparative genome hybridisation between two P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients, one of which exhibited an active quorum sensing (QS) system (UUPA38) typical of early acute infection while the other was QS-compromised (UUPA85) typical of chronic CF-adapted infection.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was harvested from the two isolates, fragmented using DNase I and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. We aimed to identify genes not present in both isolates.
