TITLE
Expression data of miR-95 transfection in MCF-7 cells compared with scramble control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified miR-95 in a screen for miRNAs which functionally affect autophagic flux in MCF-7 cells. We over expressed miR-95 or a scramble control and isolated total RNA for microarray analysis. We identified several biological pathways and targets regulated by miR-95 including genes related to endocytosis, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and lysosomal function.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6-cm plates and independent triplicate transfections were performed the following day with 50 nM miR-95 or scramble control. Total RNA was harvested 24 h after transfection using Trizol reagent. There are a total of six arrays included in this experiment, including three biological replicates of mRNA expression after miR-95 over-expression and three scramble controls in MCF-7 cells.
