TITLE
Expression data from primary colorectal cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples were taken from colorectal cancers in surgically resected specimens from 74 patients. The expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Human Genome U133Plus 2.0 arrays. Our MSI/MSS classifer was applied to these samples. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
mRNA from 74 fresh-frozen primary colorectal tumour samples were extracted and hybridized to HG-U133Plus 2.0 expression arrays. The MAS5.0 procedure was used to make calls of expression. Data from each sample were quantile normalized with reference to a training set prior to application of our MSS/MSI classifier.
