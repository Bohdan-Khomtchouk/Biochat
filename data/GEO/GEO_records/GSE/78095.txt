TITLE
Gene expression  in amniotic menbrane-derived cells (mesenchymal stromal cells and epithelial cells) and expression  signatures of these two types of cells after IL-10 stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further cell therapy, we have investigated gene expression profile of amniotic membrane-derived, two types of cells: mesenchymal stromal cells and epithelial cells. We previously reported that amniotic membrane derived cells are immunologically privileged and produced only minimal immune reactivity and that these cells, when stimulated by immunosuppressive agent IL-10, had higher differential potential for cardiomyocyte and more immunotolerance. To analysis these phenomenons, we performed gene expression profile of two types of cells after IL10 stimulation.

DESIGN
To investigate characterization of amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cells, we have separated these cells into two types, stromal cells and epithelial cells by enzyme reaction. IL10 induced gene expression was measured at 48 hours after exposure to doses of 10ng/ml.
