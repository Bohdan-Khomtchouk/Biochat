TITLE
Runx1 deficiency effect on MLL-ENL cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the target genes of Runx1 in MLL fusion leukemia, we performed microarray analysis using control and Runx1-deficient MLL-ENL leukemia cells.

DESIGN
Runx1 intact and excised  bone marrow cells were transduced with MLL-ENL and transplanted into congenic mice. Leukemic cells were harvested from moribund mice, and gene expression was compared using 3 independent leukemia cells for each genotype.
