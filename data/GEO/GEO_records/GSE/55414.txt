TITLE
miRNA profiling in mouse peritoneal macrophages treated without or with LPS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have identified a number of miRNAs that are differentially expressed in LPS treated mouse peritoneal macrophages, as compared to untreated cells

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages treated with LPS for 0, 4, 12, 24h. RNA was isolated and miRNA array assays were performed by Exiqon (miRCURYâ„¢ LNA Array version 10.0)

PLATFORM
GPL7722 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, v.10.0 - hsa, mmu & rno
