TITLE
Clostridium difficile CD630E: growth with 10 mM cysteine in PY vs growth in PY

ORGANISM
Clostridioides difficile

SUMMARY
Comparison of Clostridium difficile transcriptome of strain CD630E grown for 10 hours in PY (supplemented with mild concentration of cysteine) versus PYC (PY supplemented with 10 mM of cysteine). Experimental procedure was designed to investigate the influence of cysteine on toxins production and the regulatory network involved.

DESIGN
two-conditions experiments, excess of cysteine vs mild concentration of cysteine, 4 biological replicates for each condition Description of the supplementary files: Main - Short description of the experiment Result_all - All significative genes Result_Gold* - High quality significative gene Result_Silver** - Medium quality significative gene All_Raw_data - All genes results significative and non significative Design_Genes-OUT - Genes not present in the platform Design_Genes-Oligos - Number of oligos design per gene * Gold : Nbr significative oligos = Nbr oligos designed for this gene ** Silver : Nbr significative oligos = Nbr oligos designed for this gene -1
