TITLE
ChIP-Seq of Myf5, MyoD, Snai1, HDAC1, HDAC2, E47 and empty vector controls in mouse skeletal myoblasts or myotubes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In skeletal myogenesis, the transcription factor MyoD activates distinct transcriptional programs in progenitors compared to terminally differentiated cells. Using ChIP-seq and gene expression analyses, we show that in primary myoblasts, Snail-HDAC1/2 repressive complex bind and exclude MyoD from its targets. Notably, Snail binds E-box motifs that are G/C-rich in their central dinucleotides, and such sites are almost exclusively associated with genes expressed during differentiation. By contrast, Snail does not bind the A/T-rich E-boxes associated with MyoD targets in myoblasts. Thus, Snai1-HDAC1/2 prevents MyoD occupancy on differentiation-specific regulatory elements and the change from Snail- to MyoD-binding often results in enhancer switching during differentiation. Furthermore, we show that a regulatory network involving Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MRFs), Snail/2, miR-30a and miR-206 acts as a molecular switch that controls entry into myogenic differentiation. Together, these results reveal a regulatory paradigm that directs distinct gene expression programs in progenitors versus terminally differentiated cells.
