TITLE
Biphasic functional regulation in hippocampus of rat with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induced by permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid artery

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We measured temporal changes of gene expression in hippocampus of rat after BCCAo using time-course microarray analysis

DESIGN
Total RNA from the hippocampus from each time point of 21, 35, 45, 55 and 70 days after the BCCAo were subject to microarray.
