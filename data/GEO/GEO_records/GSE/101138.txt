TITLE
Expression data from Zebrafish larvae at 4dpf

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) is a transmembrane receptor which belongs to the type I cytokine receptor family. Recent studies have indicated that the IL7R is involved in the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative disorders, such as multiple sclerosis. Previously, we found that the retinal neuroregenation was delayed following the targeted knockdown of IL7R, highlighting the potential role of IL7R in the development of nervous system. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression fllowing il7r knockout.

DESIGN
Zebrafish larvae of Tu and il7r-/- groups were collected at 4 days post hybridization (dpf) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. There are 3 duplicates in each group and homogeneous populations of larvae at each duplicate.
