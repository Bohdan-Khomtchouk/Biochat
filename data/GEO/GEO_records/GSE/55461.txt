TITLE
Microarray Gene Expression Analysis of control and UBF knockdown in NIH3T3 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
UBF is an essential RNA Polymerase I (Pol I)-transcription factor. Our research investigates extra roles for UBF in regulation of Pol II gene expression. Our gene expression data identifies genes that are differentially regulated following UBF knockdown by siRNA.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from NIH3T3 cells after 48 hour of transfection with two independent siRNA oligonucleotides targeting UBF, sirEGFP or Mock control. A total of 12 samples were analysed using Affymetrix arrays.We include the expression data from three  biological replicate experiments
