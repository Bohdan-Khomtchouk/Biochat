TITLE
Genes regulated by TAZ in lung cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the roles of TAZ in lung cancer cell proliferation, we compared the expression profiles of A549 and H441 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines transfected with control siRNA and siTAZ.

DESIGN
We collected RNA from A549 and H441 cell lines transfected with control siRNA and siTAZ.
