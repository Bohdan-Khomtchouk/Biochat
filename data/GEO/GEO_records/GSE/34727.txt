TITLE
Small RNA profiling in two Brassica napus cultivars identifies microRNAs with oil production and developmental correlated expressions and new small RNA classes

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs and siRNAs are important regulators of plant development and seed formation, yet their population and abundance in the oil crop Brassica napus are still less understood, especially at different developmental stages and among cultivars with varied seed oil contents. Here, we systematically analyzed the small RNA expression profiles of Brassica napus seeds at early embryonic developmental stages in a high oil content and a low oil content Brassica napus cultivars, both cultured in two environments. A total of 50 conserved miRNAs and 11 new miRNAs were identified, together with some new miRNA targets. Expression analysis revealed some miRNAs with varied expression levels in different seed oil content cultivars or at different embryonic developmental stages. A large amount of 23-nt small RNAs with specific nucleotide composition preference were also identified, which may present new classes of functional small RNAs.

DESIGN
Examination of small RNA profiles in 2 different seed oil content rapeseed culvitars at 2 locations.
