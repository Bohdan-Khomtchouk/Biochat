TITLE
Development of microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures for human glioma-initiating cells (GICs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify a novel miRNA that is aberrantly expressed in GICs, we analyzed differences in miRNA expression between the human GICs and glioma cell lines and neural stem cells by miRNA microarrays.

DESIGN
We examined the miRNA expression profiles of five human GICs that were obtained from human glioma samples and two human glioma cell lines, U87 and U251, and NSC (neural stem cells) as a control.
