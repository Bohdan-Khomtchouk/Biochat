TITLE
MicroRNA regulation and its effects on cellular transcriptome in Human Immnodeficiency Virus-1 (type-1) infected individuals with distinct viral load and CD4 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human PBMCs were isolated from donors' blood. We used Taqman low density arrays to examine the differences in microRNA expression in the PBMCs of HIV seronegative individuals and individuals infected with low and high viral load.

DESIGN
qRT PCR. PBMCs from donors were used. Equal amounts of total RNA were used for microRNA profiling.

PLATFORM
GPL11316 Applied Biosystems Human Taqman MicroRNA Array v3.0
