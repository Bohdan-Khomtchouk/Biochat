TITLE
Unirradiated vs. irradiated wounded planarians

ORGANISM
Schmidtea mediterranea

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Schmidtea mediterranea planarians that have been amputated transversely and left to regenerate for different time points (UNIRR); the same experiment was performed on irradiated - neoblast depleted animals (IRR). The purpose of this experiment was to identify transcriptional changes that are induced within the first 12h following amputation. In order to distinguish between gene expression changes in the differentiated tissue and the neoblasts, a second set of time course data was created from irradiated animals

DESIGN
Two-color experiment, 3 replicates per condition (including 10 animals/replica)

PLATFORM
GPL14150 Agilent-021750 Schmidtea mediterranea 45K Smed_WI_expression_chip_Reddien_v2 015536 (Feature Number version)
