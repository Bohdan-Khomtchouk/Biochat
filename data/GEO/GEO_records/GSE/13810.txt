TITLE
Microarray analysis of the development of proteinuria in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To get more insight in cause and consequences of proteinuria, we studied glomerular gene expression patterns before and after the onset of increased urinary albumin excretion in a proteinuric rat strain. Spontaneously proteinuric Dahl salt-sensitive rats (Dahl SS) were compared to non-proteinuric, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In Dahl SS, UAE significantly increased starting from week 5 of age. Glomerular RNA profiles of 4- and 6 week-old rats were studied by Affymetrix microarrays. Keywords: Time course analysis

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from isolated glomeruli of 4- and 6 week-old rats from both strains. At each time point, two rats were used for each strain.
