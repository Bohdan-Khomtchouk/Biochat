TITLE
Single-Cell analysis of human iPS-derived Cells Undergoing Endothelial-to-Hematopoietic Transition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to dissect Endothelial-to-Hematopoietic Transition (EHT) in human iPS differentiated cultures, at day ten of differentiation towards the hematopoietic lineage, CD34+ single cells were sorted and analysed by single-cell qRT-PCR for 91 genes selected from the publication record, related to endothelium and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, as well as to the EHT in mouse and human.

DESIGN
To ensure a good representation of both endothelial and hematopoietic fractions, each 96-well plate received equal numbers of CD43 +/- cells, using near overlapping gates. A total of 437 CD34+ single-cells sorted in 5 different plates were analysed. Following reverse transcription and pre-amplification, the samples were diluted 1:5 and run in Fluidigm 96:96 arrays on a Biomark device. 10 cell controls, no RT controls and no Template controls were run in parallel
