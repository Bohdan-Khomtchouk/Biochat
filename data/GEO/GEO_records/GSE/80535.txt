TITLE
Identification of genes regulated by HSF1-T20A mutant or doxorubicin treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine whether HSF1-PARP1-PARP13 complex regulates the expression of genes, we performed DNA microarray analysis. We also performed DNA microarray analysis to identify doxorubicin-induced genes,.

DESIGN
mRNA levels in HeLa cells with/without HSF1-shRNA and HSF1-knockdown HeLa cells with wild-type HSF1, HSF1-T20A or GFP  were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis using GeneChip human Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix). mRNA levels in HeLa cells with/without doxorubicin were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis using GeneChip human Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix).
