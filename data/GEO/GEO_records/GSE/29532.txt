TITLE
Exon-array profiling of peripheral blood cells in the first hours of acute coronary syndrome patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identifying novel candidate biomarker gene differentially expressed in the peripheral blood cells of patients with early stage acute myocardial infarction  using  microarray as a high throughput screening technology.

DESIGN
In this study, we used exon array profiling to investigate biomarker gene analyzing  49 patients samples  (six time points)  and 6 control samples. Whole-blood cell drawn from an antecubital vein at six time points following STEMI diagnosis. The first time (T0) was on patient admission to the Emergency Unit prior to receiving any medication. The second time (T2) blood collection occurred after successful mechanical reperfusion and stenting of the infarct artery within 2 h after T0.  Collections for the subsequent four time points were at 12 h (T12), 24 h (T24), 36 h (T36) and 48 h (T48). For the control group, peripheral blood was collected at one time point.
