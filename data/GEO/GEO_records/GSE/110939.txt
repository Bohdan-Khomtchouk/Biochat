TITLE
Degradome sequencing from Arabidopsis tissues non-infected and infected with Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Construction of Parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE) libraries was done as described by German et al.,  2009. Raw reads consisting of short sequences of 16 to 21 nts after MmeI digestion.

DESIGN
Degradome libraries were prepared from infected inflorescences, and from leaves of mock-inoculated and TRV-infected plants

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
