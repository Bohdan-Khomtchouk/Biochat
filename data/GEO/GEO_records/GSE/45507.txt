TITLE
Genome-wide identification of genes differentially expressed between wild-type and Prdm14-deficient ES cells grown in 2i culture conditions.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of Prdm14 function in mouse embryonic stem cells. Prdm14 null and overexpressing ES cells were generated and analyzed by microarray, immunoflurescence, flow cytometry, ELISA, qPCR in different culture conditions.

DESIGN
2 samples (wild-type control and knockout) were analyzed in biological triplicates
