TITLE
gammaH2Av ChIP-seq in Drosophila stage 10B and 13 follicle cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We analyzed gamaH2Av ChIP-seq from hand dissected stage 10B and 13 follicle cell nuclei. Egg chambers were dissected from wild-type (OrR) or H2Av[ΔCT] ovaries to assess binding at the Drosophila Follicle Cell Amplicons and across the genome.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of gammaH2Av bound to follicle cell DNA from stage 10B and 13 egg chambers, collected from wild-type (OrR) and  H2Av[ΔCT] Drosophila ovaries. Sequences analyzed by Illumina sequencing. Two replicates are included for each ChIP reaction.
