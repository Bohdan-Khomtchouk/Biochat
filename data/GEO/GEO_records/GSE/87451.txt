TITLE
microRNAome of fresh maize

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
To evaluate the miRNA characteristic in fresh maize, we used small RNA-seq to get microRNAome of fresh maize.In this study, we identified 236 miRNAs sequences, of which 19 miRNAs are aboundantly expressed in fresh maize (normalized reads > 1000 ).

DESIGN
Using high-throughput sequencing technology to reveal the microRNAome in fresh maize.
