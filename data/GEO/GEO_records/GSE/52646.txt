TITLE
Arabidopsis dark-induced senescence: wild type (Col-0) vs. pif quadruple (pif1pif3pif4pif5) mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis dark-induced senescence comparing wild type (Col-0) with pif quadruple (pif1/3/4/5) mutant. After synchronized germination, the plants were grown under continuous white light for 7 days and transferred to darkness for 2 days to induce senescence. Goal was to determine the effect of PIFs on transcriptomic regulation during dark-induced senescence.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wild type vs. pif quadruple mutant. Biological replicates: 3 wild type replicates, 3 mutant replicates.
