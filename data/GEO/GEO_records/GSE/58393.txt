TITLE
Expression data from 13 week human fetal scalp epidermis sorted for expression of alpha 6 integrin and CD133

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD133 is expressed by a subpopulation of human fetal hair follicle placode cells during early hair development. Its expression, which is gradually lost as the placode matures, correlates with early morphogenesis. We used microarrays to analyze differences in gene expression between alpha-6 integrin+CD133+ basal cells and other human fetal epidermal populations to provide candidates defining this unique hair follicle placode subpopulation.

DESIGN
13 week human fetal scalp epidermis was sorted into 3 populations based upon expression of alpha 6 integrin and CD133 and RNA analyzed for gene expression.
