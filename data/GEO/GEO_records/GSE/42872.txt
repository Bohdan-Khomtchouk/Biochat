TITLE
Expression data from BRAFV600E A375 melanoma cells treated with vehicle or vemurafenib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Vemurafenib is a BRAF inhibitor with specificity for the most common BRAF mutant encountered in melanomas (BRAFV600E). Vemurafenib suppresses the proliferation of BRAF mutant human melanoma cells by suppressing downstream activation of the MEK/ERK mitogen activated protein kinases. We used microarrays to examine the transcriptional response of a vemurafenib-sensitive BRAFV600E human melanoma cell line (A375) to vemurafenib in order to further delineate the mechanisms by which BRAFV600E drives cell proliferation and energy metabolism in human melanoma.

DESIGN
BRAFV600E A375 human melanoma cells were treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or 10 Î¼M vemurafenib for 24 h after which total RNA was extracted. Cells were prepared and RNA was extracted in 3 separate batches (three different cell stocks on three separate days) providing three independent replicates (n=3). Paired replicates (prepared from the same stock of cells on the same day) are denoted by A, B and C.
