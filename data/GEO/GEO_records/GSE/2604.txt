TITLE
Gene expression profiling of children affected by acute lymphoblastic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have examined gene expression profiling of 18 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In particular, the ALL patients are subdivided in three different subtypes by morphological, immunophenotypic and cytogenetical parameters: 10 ALL-B, 5 ALL-T and 3 ALL-B with the specific chromosomal aberration MLL/AF4. We compared the transcription profiles of the leukemic samples by microarray competitive hybridization against an arbitrary total RNA reference prepared from normal human bone marrow. Two replicates of each experiment were done using different microarray slides, in which the sample and reference RNAs labeled either with Cy3 or Cy5 fluorochromes were crossed in both combinations. ALL-B patients:	GSM49966, GSM49967, GSM49969, GSM49970, GSM49971, GSM49972, GSM49973, GSM49974, GSM49976, GSM49977, GSM49978, GSM49979, GSM49980, GSM49981, GSM49982, GSM49983, GSM49984, GSM49985, GSM49986, GSM49987 ALL-T patients:	GSM49988, GSM49989, GSM49990, GSM49991, GSM49992, GSM49993, GSM49994, GSM49995, GSM49996, GSM49997 ALL-B patients with the specific chromosomal aberration MLL/AF4:	GSM49999, GSM50001, GSM50004, GSM50005, GSM50006, GSM50007 Keywords = Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) Keywords = human bone marrow Keywords = gene expression profiling Reference: Haematologica 2005;90:890-898 Keywords: ordered
