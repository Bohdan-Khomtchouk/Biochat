TITLE
Bovine blood gamma/delta T cell stimulation study

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Blood gamma/delta T cells were purfiied from holstein calves less than six months old. Blood from 4 individual calves were pooled and gamma/delta T cells were purified by immunomagnetic separation, rested in RPMI medium for 12h, and underwent ConA & hIL-2 stimulation. Total RNAs were extracted by using Trizol reagents. 15 ug of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis and microarray hybridization. Table 1: regulated genes These genes were identified, in GeneSpring software, via filtering of genes with relative expression ratio of 1.5 and over or 0.667 or below, equivalent to up- and down-regulation by fold change 1.5 or more, in both experiments. Table 2: down-regulated genes These genes were identified, in GeneSpring software, via filtering of genes with relative expression ratio of 0.667 or below, equivalent to down-regulation by fold change 1.5 or more, in both experiments. The avergae fold change was then converted to negative value. Gene annotation was performed by using GeneSpring's " Build Simplified Ontology " constructor. Table 3: up-regulated genes These genes were identified, in GeneSpring software, via filtering of genes with relative expression ratio of 1.5 or over, equivalent to up-regulation by fold change 1.5 or more, in both samples. Gene annotation was performed by using GeneSpring's " Build Simplified Ontology " constructor. Keywords: other
