TITLE
Transcriptome data of Penicillium citrinum regulated by pH

ORGANISM
Penicillium citrinum

SUMMARY
Penicillium citrinum X9-4, which was isolated from infected grapes by our laboratory, produced the highest amount of OTA at pH 5 in culture media, and toxin-production was restrained under acidic environment (pH 3). It revealed the possible mechanism of OTA biosynthesis and metabolic regulation in P. citrinum by transcriptomics, and investigated the reason of OTA biosynthesis was restrained in P. citrinum when cultured under acidic environment.

DESIGN
Penicillium citrinum cultured at pH 3 (control, non OTA production) and pH 5 (produce highest amount of OTA)

PLATFORM
GPL23904 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Penicillium citrinum)
