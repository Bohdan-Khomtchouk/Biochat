TITLE
An orthologous epigenetic gene expression signature derived from differentiating embryonic stem cells identifies regulators of cardiogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a time course of RNA-seq data from wild-type embryonic stem cells and embryonic stem cells in which the cardiogenic transcription factors ZNF503, ZEB2 and NKX2-5 are depleted with shRNAs differentiating along the cardiac lineage.

DESIGN
Biological replicates of RNA-seq data from embryonic stem cells differentiating along the cardiac lineage.
