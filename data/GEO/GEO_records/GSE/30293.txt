TITLE
Zfp281 Functions as a Transcriptional Repressor for Pluripotency of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Zfp281 is a partner protein of Nanog. To identify potential target genes of Zfp281, we generated Zfp281 null ESCs using gene targeting, and compared transcriptomic changes between multiple lines of wildtype, heterozygous and null ESCs.

DESIGN
Total 8 ESC lines: 3 wildtype lines, 2 heterozygous lines, and 3 null lines.
