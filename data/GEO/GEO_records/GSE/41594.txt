TITLE
Comprehensive gene expression profile of mouse extrahepatic bileducts and gallbladder during a mouse model of biliary atresia.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Newborn Balb/c mice were injected with 1.5x10^6 fluorescent-forming units (ffu) of Rhesus rotavirus type-A or 0.9% NaCl (normal saline) intraperitoneally within 24 hours of birth to induce experimental model of biliary atresia. The extrahepatic bile ducts including gallbladder were microdissected en bloc at 3, 7 and 14 days after rhesus rotavirus or saline injection. GeneChipÂ® Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix, CA) were used to screen mRNAs whose expression was differently regulated after rhusus rotavirus injection compare to the normal saline controls.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling.  Each experimental conditon has 3 sets of samples . Two to six extrahepatic bileducts were pooled prior to isolating total RNA depending on the size to ensure adequate RNA quantities to perform experiments quantifying mRNA expression.
