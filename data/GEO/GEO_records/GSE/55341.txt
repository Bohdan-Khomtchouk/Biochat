TITLE
Transcript profiling of six rice cultivars with different tolerance level under high night temperatures

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group ; Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Regulation of transcript expression in different tolerance classes of rice cultivars in response to high night temperatures (HNT) is investigated. The aim was to identify marker genes which are responsible for HNT tolerance. Addiditionally gene expression data are combined with GC-MS data analysis (primary metabolites) to identify global changes in response to HNT.

DESIGN
Six rice cultivars of both subspecies, indica and japonica, are analyzed. High night temperature (HNT) sensitivity is known and 2 cultivars of each class (tolerant, intermediate, sensitive) are investigated under two different conditions (control and HNT treatment). Three independent experiments of each condition were performed to gain 3 biological replicates for each cultivar per condition, resulting in 33 samples in summary. Each samples is a pool of 5 individual replicates.
