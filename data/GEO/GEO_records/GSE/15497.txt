TITLE
Cyclin K and cyclin D1b are oncogenic in myeloma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the oncogenic potential of cyclin D1b in the context of mature B cells we generated several cell clones derived from LP-1 MM cell line expressing either cyclin D1b, Myc or cyclin K oncogenes. Transcriptomic analysis allowed us to describe several mechanisms of cyclin D1b- and K-mediated oncogenesis.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment: LP-1cl1, LP-1K and LP-1D1b. Multiple myeloma LP-1 cell lines. Biological replicates: 4 control (LP-1cl1), 4 transfected with cyclin K (Lp-1K) and 4 transfected with cyclin D1b (LP-1D1b) independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL8376 25K human oligonucleotide array
