TITLE
Cyclin K and cyclin D1b are oncogenic in myeloma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the oncogenic potential of cyclin D1b in the context of mature B cells we generated several cell clones derived from LP-1 MM cell line expressing either cyclin D1b, Myc or cyclin K oncogenes. Transcriptomic analysis allowed us to describe several mechanisms of cyclin D1b- and K-mediated oncogenesis.
