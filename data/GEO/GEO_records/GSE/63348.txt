TITLE
Expression Analysis of Normal and Neoplastic Mouse Pancreatic Ductal Organoids

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study used Illumina strand-specific, paired-end RNA-sequencing to examine gene expression differences between normal and neoplastic mouse pancreatic ductal cells grown as three-dimensional, organoid cultures. The study analyzed 19 independently derived organoid lines. These 19 lines included 7 biological replicate " mN, " or mouse normal, organoid lines, derived from the pancreatic ductal cells of wild-type C57Bl/6J or C57Bl/6N mice. In addition, the study analyzed 6 biological replicate " mP, " or mouse PanIN, organoid lines, derived from PanIN-containing mouse pancreata from the KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx1-Cre mouse model. (The presence of PanIN in the pancreata from which these organoid lines were derived was confirmed by examining histological sections from the same pancreata). The final 6 lines examined in this study were biological replicate " mT, " or mouse tumor, organoid lines, derived from mouse pancreata containing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from the KrasLSL-G12D; Trp53LSL-R162H; Pdx1-Cre mouse model. We genes differentially expressed in the PanIN- or tumor-derived mouse organoid lines, relative to the mouse normal organoids, that may reflect expression changes required for pancreatic tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Gene expression comparison of 7 mouse normal-derived, 6 mouse PanIN-derived, and 6 moues tumor-derived pancreatic ductal organoid lines.
