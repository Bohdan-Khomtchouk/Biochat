TITLE
Genetic Diversity Influences the Response of the Brain to Developmental Lead Exposure.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In this study we analyzed the effects of lead-exposure up hippocampal gene expression in males and females exposed to 0ppm, 250ppm and 750ppm lead during two different developmental periods, perinatal (in utero through to weaning at PND21) and postnatal (PND0-PND45), across three strains (Fischer, Long Evans and Sprague Dawley).  All tissue was taken at PND 55.  We used affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0ST arrays to obtain global gene expression data from each animal, with a group size of 4 for all conditions (Total number of Arrays = 119)

DESIGN
Gene expression was profiled in the hippocampus of rats at no lead exposure (0ppm), 250ppm and 750 ppm lead exposure levels during perinatal and postnatal developmental periods of both males and females of three strains of rat (Fischer, Long Evans and Sprague Dawley).
