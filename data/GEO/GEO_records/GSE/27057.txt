TITLE
Gene expression in trabecular meshwork samples from normal and glaucoma eyes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dr. Panjwani's laboratory is focusing on the mechanism by which galectins-3 and 7 mediate corneal epithelial cell migration. We are currently performing studies to: (i) identify and characterize the corneal epithelial cell surface and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules which serve as counterreceptors of galectin-3 and -7, to establish whether the lectins modulate corneal epithelial cell migration by binding to well known integrins, growth factor receptors, and/or ECM molecules and (ii) determine whether galectin-3 mediates corneal epithelial cell migration indirectly by modulating the expression of key adhesion and/or signal transduction molecules by using small interfering RNA, cDNA microarrays and glycogene arrays.

DESIGN
It is known that a carbohydrate-binding protein, ELAM, serves as a marker for glaucoma. Other preliminary studies in my lab have shown that galectin-8 plays a role in the adhesion and spreading of trabecular meshwork cells (TM;the cells which modulate ocular pressure) and galectin-3 influences phagocytic capacity of TM cells. These studies suggest that galectins as well as ELAM and their counterreceptors may contribute to the pathogenesis of glaucoma. We have RNA preparations of five each of normal and glaucoma TM samples harvested over the last year from cadavers.
