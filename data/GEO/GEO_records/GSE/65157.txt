TITLE
TpxD is a global sensor and transcriptional regulator for pneumococcal response to H2O2, and is regulated by CodY

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae D39

SUMMARY
Thiol peroxidase (TpxD) is one of the key enzymes used to cope with oxidative stress conditions in S. pneumoniae. Previously, we demonstrated that TpxD expression is modulated in response to H2O2 and is involved in the regulation of the psa operon. In the current study, we focus on TpxD function as a sensor and global regulator in the bacterial response to H2O2. By using microarray assays, we show that TpxD expression is necessary for the activation of bacterial global gene response to H2O2. The mechanism underlying TpxD regulatory function was further elucidated by replacing the catalytic cysteine (Cys58) with alanine (Ala58) in TpxD. This point mutation prevented tpxD up-regulation by H2O2, as well as the effect of H2O2 on additional genes that were affected by H2O2 in the WT but not in ∆tpxD, signifying that this cysteine is crucial for TpxD signaling activity. We then tried to identify a candidate transcription factor which regulates tpxD expression under H2O2 stress. Bioinformatics analysis identified a putative CodY 15 bp binding site in the proximal upstream region of tpxD coding sequence. Genetic engineering techniques and EMSA assays confirmed the presence of an active CodY box. Indeed, no up-regulation of TpxD was noticed in ∆codY challenged with H2O2. These data identify CodY as the transcription factor modulating tpxD expression under H2O2 stress. We propose a model of gene regulation under oxidative stress conditions which places TpxD as an intermediary between H2O2 and the global bacterial response to oxidative stress.
