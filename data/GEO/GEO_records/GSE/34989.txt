TITLE
A high-throughput screen to study the role of stem cells in hemangioma tumor formation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further the development of gene expression signatures for infantile hemangioma (IH) cells, gene expression analysis was performed of different human cell samples using Agilent whole human genome oligo microarrays. The purpose of the experiments are: a) to identify the intrinsic differences between HemSc and HemDerivatives and compare HemSc and HemDerivatives genetically; b) analyze the " stemness " genes, paracrine/endocrine associated genes ( " angiocrine " ), and genes that regulate development, vasculogenesis and immunity; c) identify involvement of the signaling pathways at various stages of differentiation; and d) provide new perspectives on the failure of anti-vasculogenic inhibitors currently in use.

DESIGN
Expression Profiles: To employ whole human genome gene expression analysis of infantile hemangioma cells by using microarray analysis followed by qPCR and microfluidic single cell analysis to: a) survey gene expression profiles and patterns between HemSc and HemDerivatives and compare HemSc and HemDerivatives genetically; Survey gene expression profiles and patterns between different populations of infantile hemangioma cells and Controls (including HemSC, Hem-Heterogeneous, HemDerivatives, BMSC, MSC, CBSC, HUVEC, and Glioblastoma CSC populations).
