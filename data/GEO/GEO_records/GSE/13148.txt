TITLE
Effect of age on the arthritis susceptibility of BALB/c mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) usually begins in females in their 4th-5th decade, suggesting that the aging of the immune system (immunosenescence) has a major impact on this disease. In the present microarray study, we set out to identify age- and arthritis-related gene expression pattern changes in proteoglycan (aggrecan)-induced arthritis (PGIA) model. Keywords: disease state analysis
