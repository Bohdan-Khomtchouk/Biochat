TITLE
Differential gene expression in lactating rats compared against age matched virgin controls

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene level analysis of lactating day 10-11 16h Sprague-Dawley dams compared against age matched virgins. Lactation is a time of significantly increased energy demands imposed by the suckling young that requires a proportional adjustment in the ability of the lactating dam to absorb nutrients and to synthesize critical biomolecules to meet the dietary needs of both the offspring and the dam.  We have shown an increase in the size and hydrophobicity of the bile acid pool during lactation [1], implying an increased absorption and disposition of lipids, sterols, nutrients, and xenobiotics.   In order to investigate changes at the level of mRNA, we utilized an exon array and calculated gene level summaries to investigate changes in gene expression in the liver, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of lactating dams when compared against age-matched virgin controls.

DESIGN
Affymetrix Rat Exon 1.0ST arrays were used to determine expression of genes in the livers and small intestines of day 10-11 lactating Sprague Dawley rats and compared against virgins of comparable age.
