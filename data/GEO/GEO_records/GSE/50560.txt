TITLE
Expression data from five independent murine BM MSC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Data collected in our laboratory show that independent murine MSC cultures react in a heterogeneous manner to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) activation. This array aims to investigate the molecular basis for the heterogeneity in the response of MSCs to TLR activation and its origin.

DESIGN
For this array, 5 MSC preparation, all from BM of female C57BL/6J 6-8 weeks old, were studied in two replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
