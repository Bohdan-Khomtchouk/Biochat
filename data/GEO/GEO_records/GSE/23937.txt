TITLE
Expression data from GNMT knockout mice cerebral cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that Gnmt-/- mice have abnormal behavior including spontaneous locomotion activity, PPI, TST and FST. Microarray analysis showed that genes expression profiles  in male Gnmt -/- mice Keywords: Gnmt knockout

DESIGN
Cerebral cortex tissues from wild-type or Gnmt knockout mice were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. For 4 weeks old mice, total RNA were mixed in equal proportion from 3 mice.
