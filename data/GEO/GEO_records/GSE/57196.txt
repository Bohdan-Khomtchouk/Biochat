TITLE
Exposure to ionizing radiation induced persistent gene expression changes in mouse mammary gland

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Six to eight week old female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 2 Gy of whole body Î³ radiation and mammary glands were surgically removed 2-month after radiation. RNA was isolated and microarray hybridization performed for gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
5 samples were analyzed: 2 controls at 2 months, 1 2 Gy at 2 months, and 2 7 Gy at 2 months
