TITLE
Gene expression comparison of human ES cells grown in different media

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts can be used to condition basis human ES cell medium to allow feeder-free growth. To investigate the impact of factors released by the MEFs on gene expression in hES cells, global gene expression was analysed in cells grown in MEF-conditioned medium as compared to cells grown in a chemically defined one. Keywords: Media comparison

DESIGN
H1 hES cells were grown in parallel in two types of media, MEF-conditioned medium and N2B27-based defined medium. Both conditions are represented by two biological replicates.
