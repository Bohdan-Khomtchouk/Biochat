TITLE
Identification of Myc-regulated microRNAs in human P493 cells

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We previously described the use of a spotted oligonucleotide array to identify the mir-17 cluster as a direct transcriptional target of Myc.  In order to determine whether Myc regulates additional miRNAs, we produced custom microarrays with an expanded set of probes capable of assaying the expression of 313 human miRNAs and 233 mouse miRNAs.  P493-6 cells which are Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized human B cells that harbor a tetracycline (tet)-repressible allele of Myc were studied.  These cells are tumorigenic in immunocompromised mice and represent a model of human B cell lymphoma.  miRNA expression profiles were examined in the high Myc (-tet) and low Myc (+tet) state. Keywords: Dose response
