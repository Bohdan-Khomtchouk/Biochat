TITLE
Hepatic expression of Sonic Hedgehog induces liver fibrosis and promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in a transgenic mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The causative role of activated Hedgehog signaling in liver fibrosis was investigated in vivo.

DESIGN
Using hydrodynamics-based transfection, a transgenic mouse model has been developed that expresses Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), a ligand for Hedgehog signaling, in the liver. Levels of hepatic fibrosis and fibrosis-related gene expression were assessed in the model.
