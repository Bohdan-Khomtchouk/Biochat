TITLE
Transcriptome profiles of brain glioma stem cells and normal neural stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A human cDNA microarray comprising 29,187 human genome probes was used to evaluate the transcriptional changes between brian glioma stem cells (GSC) and normal neural stem cells (NSC).

DESIGN
There were 6 samples that were analyzed, 3 samples were from glioma stem cells and the other 3 samples form normal neural stem cells were controls. cell type: brain glioma stem cells:GSC_H004, GSC_H005, GSC_H006 ; cell line: normal neural stem cells: NSC_H001, NSC_H002, NSC_H003 biological replicate: NSC_H001, NSC_H002, NSC_H003; biological replicate: GSC_H004, GSC_H005, GSC_H006
