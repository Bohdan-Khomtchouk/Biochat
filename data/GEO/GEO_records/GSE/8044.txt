TITLE
Brown versus white tissue adipose selective genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify genes expressed selectively in brown adipose tissue as compared to white adipose tissue from the same animals.  This analysis provides a gene set that is brown and white adipose selective. Keywords: tissue comparison from mice

DESIGN
Interscapular brown adipose tissue and epididymal white adipose tissue was carefully dissected from 3 male C57Bl/6 mice.  These samples were profiled independently using Affymetrix mouse 430_2 gene arrays, representing 3 biological replicates for each brown and white adipose tissues.
