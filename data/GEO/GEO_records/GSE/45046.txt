TITLE
Microarray analysis of MCF7 cells treated with NSC 59687 (Oxyphenisatin Acetate)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NSC 59687 (oxyphenisatin acetate) is a novel anti-cancer agent with selectivity for breast and ovarian cell lines To elucidate the transcripts differentially regulated following treatment with Oxyphenisatin acetate (NSC 59687)

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were treated with 10 microM NSC 59687 for 24 hours followed by RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and microarray analysis using Affymetrix huU133 plus 2.0 arrays
