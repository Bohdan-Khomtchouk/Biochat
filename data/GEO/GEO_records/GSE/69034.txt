TITLE
Expression data from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression profiles of CLL patients with and without MYD88 L265P mutations, taking into consideration IGHV mutation status.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from lymphocytes of CLL patients and gene expression was measured using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays.
