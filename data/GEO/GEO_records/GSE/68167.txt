TITLE
Nur77-deficiency in bone marrow-derived macrophages modulates inflammatory responses, extracellular matrix homeostasis, phagocytosis and tolerance

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The nuclear orphan receptor Nur77 (NR4A1, TR3, or NGFI-B) has been shown to exhibit an anti-inflammatory function in macrophages. To further elucidate the role of Nur77 in macrophage physiology, we compared the transcriptome of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) from wild-type (WT) and Nur77-knockout (KO) mice both before and after stimulation with IL4 or LPS.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages, isolated from 3 wild-type (control) and 3 Nur77-/- mice (case), left untreated or stimulated in triplicate for 8 hours with LPS or IL-4
