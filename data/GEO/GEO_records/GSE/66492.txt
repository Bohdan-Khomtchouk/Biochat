TITLE
Cigarette smoke silences innate lymphoid cell function in the lung, facilitating an IL-33-dependent, exacerbated Th-1 response to infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using gene expression profiling to examine how IL33 treatment affect gene expression in lung tissues of mice

DESIGN
Mice were exposure to cigarette smoke or room air and treated with intranasal IL-33 or PBS, the lung tissues then subjected to microarray analysis to examine the gene expression profiles

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
