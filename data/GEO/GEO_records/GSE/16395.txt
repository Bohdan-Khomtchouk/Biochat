TITLE
Cell-Specific Gene Expression in Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Langerhans-cell histiocytosis (LCH) is characterized by heterogeneous lesions containing CD207+ Langerhans cells (LCs) and lymphocytes.   In this study, we isolated CD207+ cells and CD3+ T cells from LCH lesions to determine cell-specific gene expression.  Compared to control epidermal CD207+ cells, the LCH CD207+ cells yielded 2113 differentially-expressed genes (FDR < 0.01).  Surprisingly, expression of many genes previously associated with LCH, including cell-cycle regulators, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were not significantly different from control LCs in our study.  However, several novel genes whose products activate and recruit T cells to sites of inflammation, including SPP1 (osteopontin), were highly over-expressed in LCH CD207+ cells.  Furthermore, several genes associated with immature myeloid dendritic cells were over-expressed in LCH CD207+ cells.  Compared to the peripheral CD3+ cells from LCH patients, the LCH lesion CD3+ cells yielded only 162 differentially-regulated genes (FDR < 0.01), and the expression profile of the LCH lesion CD3+ cells was consistent with an activated regulatory T cell phenotype with increased expression of FOXP3, CTLA4 as well as SPP1.  Based on these results, we propose a new model of LCH pathogenesis in which lesions do not arise from epidermal Langerhans cells, but from accumulation of bone-marrow derived immature myeloid dendritic cells that recruit activated lymphocytes.

DESIGN
Cell-specific gene expression from LCH biopsy specimens was evaluated by comparing hybridization signal from amplified cDNA on Affymetrix gene chips (U133A Plus 2.0) (Table1).  Three sets of comparisons were performed: 1) Thirteen LCH CD207+ samples were compared to 12 control skin LCH CD207+ samples. 2) Seven LCH lesion CD3+ samples were compared to 7 peripheral blood CD3+ samples from the same patients.  3) Twelve LCH lesion CD3+ samples were compared to 4 pooled control tonsil CD3+ samples (5 individual tonsil CD3+ samples/pool).
