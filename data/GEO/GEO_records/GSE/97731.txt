TITLE
Divergent mechanisms of EZH1 regulation of heart development and regeneration [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Through EZH1, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data in P13 EZH1 and GFP overexpressing heart (AAVEzh1 and AAVGFP respectively) suffered MI at P10, we surprisingly found that EZH1 can active the expression of regenerating relevant genes by directly binding to the promoter of targeted genes and through a mechanism independent of H3K27me3 deposition.

DESIGN
EZH1, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac occupancy in P13 mice heart suffered MI at P10 and injected with AAV9 expressing Ezh1 or GFP

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
