TITLE
Identification of genes dependent on the Ecdysone receptor (EcR) at the onset of metamorphosis in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This study identifies those genes that are dependent on EcR for their proper regulation at the onset of metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster. Keywords: Nuclear receptor gene regulation

DESIGN
hs-EcRi-11 third instar larvae were heat-treated twice at 37Â°C, each time for 1 hour, at 24 hours and 18 hours prior to pupariation, as described [29]. RNA was harvested for microarray analysis at -4, 0, and 4 hours relative to pupariation from three independent collections of animals for each time point. Data obtained from these arrays was compared to array data from control animals at the same stages of development to identify EcR-dependent genes.
