TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of tumor-specific CD8 T cells in murine solid tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNAseq analysis of CD8 T cells becoming dysfunctional in progressing tumors. The overall goal of this study was to elucidate the molecular program that mediates functional unresponsiveness in tumor-specific CD8 T cells. In comparison, we also investigated CD8 T cells differentiating to functional effector and memory T cells during an acute listeria infection.

DESIGN
T cells were sorted by flow cytometry and RNA-seq was performed.

PLATFORM
