TITLE
Hydroxychloroquine inhibits responses to group A streptococcus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Immune responses to group A streptococcus in humans can lead to the development of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. Immune pathways that are activated by group A streptococcus are potential targets for inhibiting autoimmune responses to group A streptococcus. This experiment tests the impact of the drug hydroxychloroquine on immune responses to group A streptococcus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells

DESIGN
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three healthy participants were stimulated with rheumatogenic, heat-killed group A streptococcus for 24 hours, MOI 10. The effect of hydroxychloroquine (20 ÂµM) (HCQ) was measured, both alone and in combination with group A streptococcus (GAS).

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
