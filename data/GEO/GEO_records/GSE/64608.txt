TITLE
RNA-Seq of murine GIST-like tumors after Etv1 ablation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used a mouse expressing three alleles 1) KitV558Delta/+ activating allele that develop GIST-like tumors in the cecum, 2) Etv1 flox/flox conditional knockout allele and 3) Rosa26-CreERT2 tamoxifen activated Cre allele. Mice were treated with either Tamoxifen (to delete Etv1) or corn oil (control). Cecal tumors were isolated for gene expression profiling by RNA-Seq.

DESIGN
Expression profile mouse cecal GIST tumor with or without Etv1 ablation was generated by RNA-Seq

PLATFORM
