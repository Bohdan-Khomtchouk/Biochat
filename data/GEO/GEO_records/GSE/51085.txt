TITLE
M. tuberculosis H37Rv: mutant expressing foreign peptide SL3 Vs control H37Rv

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of M.tb H37Rv cells comparing control wild type H37Rv with H37Rv cells electroporated with constitutive expression plasmid pVV16 expressing ESAT-6 binding peptide SL3. The expression of SL3 makes H37Rv less virulent during ex vivo and BalB/c mice infections, sequesters ESAT-6 inside M.tb cells and cause severe defects in mycobacterial morphology. Goal was to determine the effects of SL3 expression on global H37Rv gene expression.

DESIGN
Two color Experiment,Organism: Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, ilife Discoveries designed Custom Mycobacterium tuberculosis on  8x15k GE Microarray. Two-condition experiment, H37Rv vs. H37Rv/SL3. Biological replicates: 2 biological control H37RV replicates labelled with Cy3, 2 SL3 biological expressing replicates labelled with Cy5.
