TITLE
A novel analytical brain block tool to enable functional annotation of discriminatory transcript biomarkers among discrete regions of the fronto-limbic circuit in primate brain

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
We describe a novel method for obtaining discrete regions from the fronto-limbic circuits of a 4 year old and a 5 year old, male, intact, frozen non-human primate (NHP) brain, from which we use transcriptional profiling and a new algorithm to identify region-exclusive RNA signatures for Area 25 (NFκB and dopamine receptor signaling), the anterior cingulate cortex (LXR/RXR signaling), the amygdala (semaphorin signaling), and the hippocampus (Caþþ and retinoic acid signaling).

DESIGN
Profiling of 4 discrete brain regions in 2 individual non-human primate subjects.

PLATFORM
GPL13766 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Macaca mulatta)
