TITLE
Effects of Blnk reconstitution in BCR-ABL1 driven pre-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the function of the adapterprotein Blnk in ALL, we isolated bone marrow cells from Blnk KO mice and transformed them with BCR-ABL1. In a second transduction the BCR-ABL1 driven pre-B cells were transformed either with Blnk-GFP or empty vector control (GFP) and subjected to gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
Five days post transduction, total RNA of GFP positive sorted cells were extracted and subjected to gene expression analysis.
