TITLE
Gene expression profile of splenic CD19 cells from NTg, PTPROt Tg, TCL1 Tg and PTPROt/TCL1 double Tg mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TCL1 is an an oncogene and transgenic (Tg) mice expressing TCL1 specifically in B-cells are well-characterized models for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. On the contrary, PTPROt is a phosphatase with tumor suppressor characteristics in many cancers including leukemia. Our hypothesis was that transgenic expression of PTPROt in the B-cells of TCL1 Tg mice will alleviate disease phenotype and allow the study of the in vivo mechanism of action of PTPROt. To test this we have generated Tg mice with B-cell specific expression of PTPROt and crossed these mice with the TCL1 Tg mice.

DESIGN
Single-channel experiment. Four replicates for each of the four groups (NTg, PTPROt Tg, TCL1 Tg, PTPROt/TCL1 double Tg) of mice at 4 months of age.

PLATFORM
