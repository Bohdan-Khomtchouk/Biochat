TITLE
DNA methylation profiles of 30 tissues from a 112 year old woman

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The main goal of the study was to measure the epigenetic age (also known as DNA methylation age) of these tissues. Toward this end, we used the epigenetic clock software described in Horvath S (n=2013) DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types. Genome Biology.2013, 14:R115. DOI: 10.1186/10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115 PMID: 24138928

DESIGN
Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain n=64 Illumina DNA methylation arrays from 30 tissues. For each of the following tissues, we obtained at least 2 replicates: adipose, adrenal gland, aorta, bone, bone-marrow, breast, buccal cells, cartilage, cerebellum, colon, diaphragm, esophagus , frontal cortex, kidney, heart, hippocampus, liver, lung, lymph node, midbrain,  muscle, occipital cortex, pancreas, pericardium skin, spleen, stomach, temporal cortex, thyroid, whole blood.
