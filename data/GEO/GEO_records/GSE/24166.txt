TITLE
Chromatin enrichment of TRIM24, estrogen receptor and H3K4me2 in estrogen-treated and -untreated MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TRIM24 PHD-Bromo domains exhibit preferential binding to unmethylated H3K4 and acetylated H3K27.  TRIM24 is a co-activator of estrogen receptor (ER).  The results suggest that specific ER-binding sites are depleted of H3K4me2 with estrogen treatment.  TRIM24 binds these sites preferentially and facilitates ER-regulated gene expression, cell survival and proliferation.

DESIGN
ChIP performed on MCF7 cells +/- estrogen with antibodies against ER, TRIM24 and H3K4me2.  ChIP assays of ER, co-activator TRIM24 and H3K4me2 were performed with two concentrations of antibody, without and 6h with estrogen treatment of MCF7 cells. Antibody-enriched samples were sequenced two times, and compared to an IgG negative control and Input. Enriched DNA sequenced by Illumina Solexa.
