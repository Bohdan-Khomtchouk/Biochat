TITLE
Whole-genome nucleosome mapping in meiotic diploid S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We determined nucleosome positions throughout the genome in diploid S. cerevisiae undergoing early stages of synchronous meiosis. This study sought to assess if systematic reorganization of nucleosomes occurs during meiotic prophase at or near sites of DNA double strand break formation.

DESIGN
Six samples were sequenced, each a separate time point from either of two meiotic time courses. Dataset N1 consists of samples collected at 0, 1, 2, and 3 hr in meiosis; Dataset N2 consists of samples collected at 0 and 4 hr. Time courses, sample preparation, and sequencing were carried out in separate laboratories for the two datasets: Hochwagen lab (Whitehead Institute) for Dataset N1; Keeney lab (Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) for Dataset N2.
