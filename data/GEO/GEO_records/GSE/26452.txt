TITLE
Whole-genome nucleosome mapping in meiotic diploid S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We determined nucleosome positions throughout the genome in diploid S. cerevisiae undergoing early stages of synchronous meiosis. This study sought to assess if systematic reorganization of nucleosomes occurs during meiotic prophase at or near sites of DNA double strand break formation.
