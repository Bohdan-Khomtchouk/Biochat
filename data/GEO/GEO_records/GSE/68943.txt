TITLE
Expression data from T-bet deficient megakaryoerythroid progenitor (MEP) cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
RNA was harvested from T-bet deficient MEP cells versus " wild type " C57BL/6 control MEP cells freshly harvested from bone marrow.

DESIGN
3 samples in each group, representing MEP cells from three different T-bet deficient or control mice.

PLATFORM
