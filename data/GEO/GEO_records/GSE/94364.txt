TITLE
Poised RNA polymerase II co-localises with Polycomb repression at multi-lineage developmental regulator genes in differentiated neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Polycomb repression is tightly associated with promoter co-occupancy of poised RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs). However, it remains unclear whether poising is a specific feature of ESCs or also associated with Polycomb during cell differentiation. Here, we show that RNAPII poising at Polycomb repressed genes is found in five stages of ESC differentiation to dopaminergic neurons. We find that key transcription factor genes of non-neuronal lineages are kept silent in the neuronal lineage through Polycomb repression in co-association with poised RNAPII in the absence of DNA methylation within DNA Methylation Valleys (DMVs). This group of poised transcription factors are preferential candidate master regulators for trans-differentiation of neurons into different lineages. We conclude that RNAPII poising is a general feature of Polycomb repression and cell plasticity in pluripotent stem cells and terminally differentiated neurons.
