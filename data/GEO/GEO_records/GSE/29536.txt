TITLE
Whole Blood Transcriptional Modules generated on Illumina Hu-6 V2 Beadchips

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset was used to establish whole blood transcriptional modules (n=260) that represent groups of coordinately expressed transcripts that exhibit altered abundance within individual datasets or across multiple datasets.  This modular framework was generated to reduce the dimensionality of whole blood microarray data processed on the Illumina Beadchip platform yielding data-driven transcriptional modules with biologic meaning.
