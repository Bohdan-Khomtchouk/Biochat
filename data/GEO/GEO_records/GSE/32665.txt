TITLE
Rewiring of human lung cell lineage and mitotic networks in lung adenocarcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms influence patterns of gene expression in normal tissues, and can provide a molecular view of the component cell lineages and signaling pathways responsible for normal tissue architecture. Analysis of the coordinated changes in this architecture that take place during tumor development can help to identify the functional roles of oncogenes or tumor suppressors and provide potential new therapeutic targets. We have applied a network analysis approach to a set of 92 normal human lung samples from cancer patients and their matched adenocarcinomas. We have identified networks associated with particular cell lineages (alveolar type 2 pneumocytes and Clara cells) in normal lung and document the changes in these networks that accompany transformation to adenocarcinomas. Expression of the transcription factor NKX2-1 (TTF1) is linked to surfactant protein markers of the alveolar type 2 lineage in normal and transformed lung cells, but its network is rewired in tumors to include pathways linked to cell growth such as glutaminase (GLS2). Analysis of mitotic networks revealed the presence of novel components such as the kinase VRK1 that are preferentially linked to the mitotic cycle in tumors but not in normal lung. We show that shRNA-mediated inhibition of VRK1 cooperates with inhibition of PARP signaling to inhibit growth of lung tumor cells. Targeting of genes that are recruited into tumor mitotic networks may provide a wider therapeutic window than that seen by inhibition of integral components of the mitotic machinery such as Aurora kinases.
