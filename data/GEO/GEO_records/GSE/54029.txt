TITLE
Distinct distributions of histone marks shape cell identities of murine hepatic progenitors and adult hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The present study revealed dynamic reposition of localizations of silencing histone marks including H3K27me3 in hepatocyte differentiation, of which target genes reflect the cell identities in connection to the cellular functions. Our results shed light on the process of hepatocyte terminal differentiation regulated by epigenetic mechanisms.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression in E13.5 liver cells from WT and Ezh2 KO mice.

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
