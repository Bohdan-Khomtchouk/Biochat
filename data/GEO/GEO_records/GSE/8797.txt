TITLE
Opaque vs Transparent transcriptome of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 2 strain D39

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae

SUMMARY
Invasive pneumococcal disease is preceded by asymptomatic colonization of the human nasopharynx by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Progression from colonization to invasion is a watershed in the host-pathogen interaction, and exposes the pneumococcus to markedly different microenvironments. This in turn, requires alterations in gene expression profile to adapt to the new niche. One apparent adaptive mechanism is reversible phase variation between “transparent” and “opaque” colony opacity phenotypes. Transparent phase variants colonize the nasopharynx more efficiently than opaque variants of the same strain, while opaque variants exhibit higher systemic virulence. Previous studies have reported quantitative differences in surface components such as the capsule, teichoic acid and certain surface proteins between the two phenotypes, but the underlying regulatory mechanism is not understood. In the present study, we found no differences in expression of key surface proteins between opaque and transparent variants of S. pneumoniae strain D39, but opaque cells produced five-fold more capsular polysaccharide. Subsequent microarray and real-time RT-PCR analysis showed no differences in capsule gene expression, but several genes involved in uridine monophosphate (UMP) biosynthesis were up-regulated in the opaque phenotype.  This correlated with significant increases in the intracellular concentrations of both UMP and UDP-glucose, which are essential precursors for capsule biosynthesis. Our data suggest a novel mechanism for pneumococcal capsule regulation, in which rate-limiting precursor pathways are modulated rather than the capsule biosynthetic genes themselves.
