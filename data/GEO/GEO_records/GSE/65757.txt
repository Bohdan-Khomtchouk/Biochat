TITLE
Aberrant haematopoiesis in Dnmt2 mutant mice [HTS 2]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow primary cells from Dnmt2-/- and wildtype mice were used to identify difference in mRNA translation

DESIGN
Ribosome-protected mRNA fragments from RNAase I cleavage was sequenced in wildtype and Dnmt2-/- primary bone marrow cells. Small RNA libraries were performed according to the protocol using NEB NEXT Small RNA library Prep Set for Illumina (Multiplex Compatible) E7330, and size-selected (150 base pairs) before sequencing.

PLATFORM
