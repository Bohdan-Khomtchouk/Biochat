TITLE
Hepatitis C virus-induced expression profiling of Hepatic and non-hepatic cancer cell lines [mock-treated]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To facilitate accurate measurement of the relative expression levels in Hepatitis C virus infection, we carried out in four human cancer cell lines derived from Hepatic (Hec3B; human hepatoma and Huh7; human hepatocellular carcinoma) or nonhepatic (Hec1B; human endometrial and 293T;human embryonic kidney) cells. These experiments identified several genes , expression of which was altered in the same direction among them with real time PCR analysis.

DESIGN
Hepatic (Hec3B and Huh7) or nonhepatic (Hec1B and 293T) cells were examined after HCV infection and after mock-treatment. Each cell line was run in singlet.
