TITLE
Oxidative Stress 1-min interval

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Determine if yeast cells in stationary-phase cultures respond to oxidative stress Keywords: Time-course

DESIGN
Yeast cells in stationary-phase cultures were exposed to oxidative stress with samples harvested every 1-minute over 35 minutes, with a final time point at 60 minutes.  All experimental samples are over an common reference.  There are two replicates for each time point and six replicates of T0.
