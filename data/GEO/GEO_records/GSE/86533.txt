TITLE
Primary human Huh (human hepatocyte) cells transcriptome response to wild type Ebola Zaire (delta-VP30), EHUH003 [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for microRNA analysis in Huh (human hepatocyte) cells infected with wild type Ebola Zaire (delta-VP30).

DESIGN
Huh (human hepatocyte) cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 3 PFU per cell.  Infected samples were collected in triplet; time-matched mocks were collected in triplet in parallel with infected samples. Time points: 8h, 24h, and 48h post-infection. references the write up of the experimental procedure.
