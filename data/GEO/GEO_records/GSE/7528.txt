TITLE
Gene expression of Wt vs CYP26A1-/- murine ES cells treated with control or 100 nM RA for 8 or 72 hr.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify genes that are differentially expressed after genetic deletion of both alleles of the Cyp26a1 gene in murine embryonic stem cells.  Cyp26a1 codes for the CYP26A1 enzyme which metabolizes RA to polar RA metabolites, such as 4-oxo-RA and 4-OH-RA.  CYP26A1-/- ES cells do not metabolize RA within 48 hours of RA treatment while in Wt ES cells, polar RA metabolites are already detectable by 8 hr.  In addition, the absence of CYP26A1 enzyme increases intracellular RA levels.  By gene microarray analysis, we wanted to identify genes that would be affected by the lack of the Cyp26a1 gene.
