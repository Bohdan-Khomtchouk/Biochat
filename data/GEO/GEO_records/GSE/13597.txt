TITLE
Expression data from biopsies of Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and non-malignant controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common cancer in southern China and South East Asia where more than 50,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. We used microarrays to identify down or upregulated genes in NPC compared with non-malignant controls. Keywords: Diseased versus control

DESIGN
Snap frozen nasopharyngeal biopsies from 25 patients with histologically confirmed undifferentiated NPC were included in the microarray analysis. Controls were obtained from 3 patients with no evidence of malignancy.
