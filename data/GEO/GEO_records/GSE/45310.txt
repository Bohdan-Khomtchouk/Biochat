TITLE
Gene expression profiles of the small intestine and Peyer's patches from mice that were orally infected with Toxoplasma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Toxoplasma type I ROP16 kinase directly activates the host STAT3 and STAT6 transcription factors and when transgenically expressed in the orally virulent type II strain, promotes host resistance to oral challenge. The transcriptional profile of type II and II+ROP16I infected Peyer's patches and intestines from orally infected mice on day 5 was determined to elucidate host signaling pathways and molecular gene targets that correlate with protective immunity in the gut of orally challenged animals

DESIGN
C57BL/6 female mice were orally gavaged with 1000 tissue cysts of the type II or II+ROP16I strain.  On Day 5 of infection the Peyer's patches and intestines were analyzed for parasite burden by bioluminescence imaging. Individual Peyer's patches and intestinal sections, corresponding to the middle third of the intestine (~jejunum), that had equivalent parasite burden were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were crushed using a sterile 16 G needle in tubes on dry ice.  In the case of the intestine, the sample was resuspended in TRizol, extruded through a needle using a syringe and RNA was isolated according to manufacturer's protocol; for the Peyer's patch, the sample was suspended in cell lysis buffer and RNA isolated using the RNeasey kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacter's protocol.
