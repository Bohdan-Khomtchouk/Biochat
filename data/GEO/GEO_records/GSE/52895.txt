TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed genes against WSSV infection in Penaeus monodon by microarray

ORGANISM
Penaeus monodon

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of the gill tissues of WSSV infected shrimp (P. monodon) at different time intervals 6 hrs, 24 hrs, 48 hrs and  moribund stage of post WSSV infection was carried out to identify differentially expressed genes in response to WSSV infection. The shrimps in WSSV challenege experiment were challenged through intra muscular route with known concentration of virus. The important immune genes identified would be further characterized by sequence analysis and gene expression profile would be validated by real time PCR
