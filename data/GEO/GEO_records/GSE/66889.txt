TITLE
Genome wide 5hmC patterns in the mouse liver, embryonic fibroblasts and induced pluripontent stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We carry out hydroxymethyl DNA immunoprecipitation (hmeDIP) prior to sequencing on the Ion Proton semiconductor sequencing platform to demonstate the strategy as an alternative method to Illumina sequencing.

DESIGN
Genome 5hmC patterns were generate on the Ion Proton seqencer. 2x mouse liver, 1x MEF, 1x iPSC datasets generated

PLATFORM
GPL18635 Ion Torrent Proton (Mus musculus)
