TITLE
caArray_green-00160: Initiating oncogenic event determines gene-expression patterns of human breast cancer models

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of six well characterized mouse models of human breast cancer to determine the fundamental differences in gene expression between the normal mammary gland and mammary tumors and to define genes that are associated specifically with each oncogenic pathway.
