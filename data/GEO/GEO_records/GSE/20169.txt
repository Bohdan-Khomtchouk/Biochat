SUMMARY
affy_hexaploid_wheat - hexa - Changes upon polyploidization in hexaploid wheat - transcriptomic changes in synthetic hexaploid derived from a cross between tetraploid and natural diploid. Study aims to understand regulation of gene expression in synthetic and natural wheat allohexaploids (Triticum aestivum), that combines the AB genome of T. turgidum and the D genome of Aegilops tauschii; and which we have recently characterized as genetically stable. We conducted a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of gene expression that allowed us to compare the effect of variability of the D genome progenitor, the trans-generation stability as well as comparison to natural wheat allohexaploid. We used the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Wheat Genome Array, on which 55,049 transcripts are represented. Additive expression was shown to represent majority of expression regulation in the synthetic allohexaploids, where expression for more than 93% of transcripts was equal to the one evaluated from equal mixture of parental RNA. This leaves ~2000 (~7%) transcripts, which expression was non-additive. No global gene expression bias or dominance towards any of the progenitor genomes was observed whereas high trans-generational stability and low effect of the D genome progenitor variability were revealed. Our study suggests that gene expression regulation in wheat allohexaploids is early established upon allohexaploidization and highly conserved over generations, as demonstrated by the high similarity of expression with natural wheat allohexaploids. Keywords: genotype and ecotype comparison
