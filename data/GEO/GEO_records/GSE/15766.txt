TITLE
Gene expression profiles of European wild boar naturally infected with Anaplasma phagocytophilum.

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Anaplasma phagocytophilum infects a wide variety of host species and causes the diseases granulocytic anaplasmosis in humans, horses and dogs and tick-borne fever in ruminants. The objective of this research was to characterize differential gene expression in wild boar naturally infected with A. phagocytophilum by microarray hybridization using the GeneChip® Porcine Genome Array

DESIGN
Differential gene expression in wild boar naturally infected with A. phagocytophilum was chacarterized by microarray hybridization using the GeneChip® Porcine Genome Array and real-time RT-PCR.

PLATFORM
GPL3533 [Porcine] Affymetrix Porcine Genome Array
