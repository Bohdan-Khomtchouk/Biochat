TITLE
Ssn6 Overexpression

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We have performed a genome wide expression profile study of the essential transcriptional co-repressor protein Ssn6 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Ssn6 affected targets were identified by over expression of Ssn6 protein in a WT strain. A WT strain holding a plasmid expressing Ssn6 (pDUAL-Ssn6) was compared against the expression in a WT with the empty plasmid (pDUAL-EMPTY) strain. Keywords: Overexpression/WT
