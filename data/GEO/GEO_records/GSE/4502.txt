TITLE
Ssn6 Overexpression

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We have performed a genome wide expression profile study of the essential transcriptional co-repressor protein Ssn6 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Ssn6 affected targets were identified by over expression of Ssn6 protein in a WT strain. A WT strain holding a plasmid expressing Ssn6 (pDUAL-Ssn6) was compared against the expression in a WT with the empty plasmid (pDUAL-EMPTY) strain. Keywords: Overexpression/WT

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling experiment in which gene expression in logarithmically growing cultures of cells expressing the Ssn6 plasmid was compared to that in wt controls expressing the empty plasmid. Wt and Ssn6 overexpressing cells were grown in MM-URA media, and RNA was extracted and subjected to cDNA expression profiling analysis using the established protocols (Xue et al, 2004). Two independent RNA preparations were used to hybridise to two microarrays one on which wildtype was labelled with Cy5 and with Cy3 and the other with dye swap. Data normalized with 'Lowess' per chip per spot normalization.
