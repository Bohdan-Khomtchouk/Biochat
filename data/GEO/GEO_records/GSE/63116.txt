TITLE
H3K9me3 ChIP-seq in HeLa cells lacking TASOR, MPP8, periphilin and SETDB1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq to measure H3K9me3 levels in wild-type HeLa cells and HeLa cells lacking TASOR, MPP8, periphilin and SETDB1 generated through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption.

DESIGN
H3K9me3 ChIP-seq using the Abcam antibody ab8898
