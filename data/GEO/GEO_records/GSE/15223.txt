TITLE
Radiation effects on gene expression in rat testes (Rattus norvegicus)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of LBNF1 rat testes from controls, containing both somatic and all germ cell types and from irradiated rats in which all cells germ cells except type A spermatgogonia are eliminated.  Results provide insight into distinguishing germ and somatic cell genes and identification of somatic cell genes that are upregulated after irradiation.

DESIGN
We studied 10 Sample replicates of control rat testes and 5 Sample replicates of irradiated rat testes.
