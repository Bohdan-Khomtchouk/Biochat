TITLE
Glutaraldehyde resistance mechanisms in Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas fluorescens

SUMMARY
The objective of the current study was to understand the glutaraldehyde resistance mechanisms in P. fluorescens and P. aeruginosa biofilms. Glutaraldehyde is a common biocide used in various industries to control the microbial growth. Recent reports of emergence of glutaraldehyde resistance in several bacterial species motivated this study to understand the genetic factors responsible got glutaraldehyde resistance. Using a combination of phenotypic assays, chemical genetic assays and RNA-seq, we demonstrate that novel efflux pump, polyamine biosynthesis, lipid biosynthesis and phosphonate degradation play significant role in glutaraldehyde resistance and post-glutaraldehyde recovery of Psudomonad biofilms.

DESIGN
Examination of P. fluorescens 72 h biofilm transcriptome was elucidated upon exposure to glutaraldehyde. The results were confirmed using qRT--PCR and chemical genetic appraoches in P. fluorescens and P. aeruginosa.
