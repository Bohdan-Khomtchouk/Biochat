TITLE
Expression profile of TTHB186-deficient Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
In order to find function of TTHB186 protein from T. thermophilus HB8, we observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of the TTHB186-deficient strain grown in a rich medium at 70Â°C for 360, and 480 min.
