TITLE
Gene expression analysis in primary human renal tumors, categorized by VHL genotype and HIF-alpha expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human renal cell carcinomas (RCC) have differential expression of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, depending on VHL genotype and other events. Here, we have divided a series of RCC samples for HIF-alpha expression and VHL genotype, in order to define differentially expressed genes Keywords: Patient Sample Study
