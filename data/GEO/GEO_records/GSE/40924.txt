TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana wild type mechanical damage (MD) vs Myzus persicae wounding (Myz)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (WT) comparing mechanical damage (MD) and Myzus persicae feeding (Myz). The differences in the biochemical responses to insect feeding seen when compared to the control sample prompted us to search for less obvious differences between the treatments using gene expression profiling. Biological replicates: 4 biological replicates

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, MD vs. Myz Arabidopsis leaves of WT plants. Biological replicates:  4 biological replicates.

PLATFORM
