TITLE
LHRH Receptor Monoclonal Antibody 4F3B10 Induces Apoptosis of HeLa Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, based on microarray hybridization and the detections of RTqPCR and Western Blotting, we have shown that HeLa cells treated with LHRH receptor monoclonal antibody 4F3B10 increased protein expressions in Fas signaling pathway, which provided a novel route for the gene therapy of HeLa cells.

DESIGN
The effects of antagonist 4F3B10 on HeLa cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. Gene expression profiles were utilized to screen the differentially expressed genes in HeLa cells with the effects of antagonist 4F3B10 vs. the control, and analyze the relation among the differentially expressed genes by bioinformatics analysis.
