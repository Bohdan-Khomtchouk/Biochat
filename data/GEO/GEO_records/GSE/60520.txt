TITLE
Thymic epithelial cells induce formation of mesenchymal network structure after abrogation of thymic crosstalk

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the earliest step of thymic organogenesis, mesenchymal cells support the growth of thymic epithelial cells (TECs). It is established that TECs and thymocytes influence each other for their growth/differentiation, a process called thymic crosstalk. However, little is known about the influence of developing thymocytes or TECs on mesenchymal cells. Here, we show that during normal thymus development fibroblast ingrowth occurs towards hypoxic areas. Similar overgrowth of mesenchymal cells is seen in a fetal thymic organ culture system under low oxygen conditions. However, when thymocytes were depleted by deoxyguanosine treatment, mesenchymal cells were also induced, precluding the direct effect of hypoxia. In the fetal thymus of hCD3εTg mice, which lack T lineage cells, an overgrowth of mesenchymal cells can be seen at a very early stage of thymic organogenesis. The growth of the mesenchymal cells is due to extensive proliferation and not mere enrichment.  With RNA sequencing analysis comparing hCD3εTg with wild type TECs, we identified candidate factors that could be involved in mesenchymal network formation.

DESIGN
Comparison of thymic epithelial cells of different in vivo situations; one in presence of thymocytes, the other in the absence of thymocytes
