TITLE
Effect of PDE4 inhibition on host gene expression of Mtb-infected mouse lungs.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global gene expressions of Mtb-infected mouse lungs were compared between with and without PDE4 inhibitor treatment.  A lot of host genes are differentially expressed 21d and 28d post-Mtb infection.  PDE4 inhibitor, however, downregulate 10% of genes among those and genes differentially regulated by PDE4 inhibitor are mainly involved immune response.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from Mtb-infected mouse lungs with or without CC-3052 (25 mg/kg/day) using Trizol reagent and gene profile was analyed using Affymetrix mouse ST 1.0

PLATFORM
