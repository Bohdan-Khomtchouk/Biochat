TITLE
p53 deficiency linked to BTG2 loss enhances metastatic potential by promoting tumor growth in primary and metastatic sites in PDX models of triple negative breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed differential expression analyses from RNA-seq data derived from isogenic p53 wild-type and p53-knockdown triple negative breast tumors

DESIGN
patient-derived isogenic human tumor lines diffring only in p53 status were implanted into mouse mammary glands. RNA-Seq was performed on 4 p53-deficient and 3 p53 wild-type tumors.

PLATFORM
GPL15433 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Homo sapiens)
