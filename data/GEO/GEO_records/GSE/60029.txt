TITLE
CapStarr-seq: a high-throughput method for quantitative assessment of enhancer activity in mammals

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we developed CapStarr-Seq, a novel high-throughput strategy to quantitatively assess enhancer activity in mammals. This approach couples capture of regions of interest to previously developed Starr-seq technique. Extensive assessment of CapStarr-seq demonstrated accurate quantification of enhancer activity. Furthermore, we found that enhancer strength correlates with binding complexity of tissue-specific transcription factors and super-enhancers, while additive enhancer activity isolates key genes involved in cell identity and function.

DESIGN
CapStarr-seq analysis in P5424 cell line (2 replicates), 3T3 cell line and in the plasmid library before (Input) and after transfection

PLATFORM
GPL16331 Ion Torrent PGM (Mus musculus)
