TITLE
The effects of RED GREEN and BLUE LED light on both human diabetic fibroblast cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether LED light at different wavelength can improve wound healing in both diabetic fibroblast. In this study, both diabetic and normal fibroblast cell lines were cultured and created some artificial wounds with pipette tips. After LED irradiation and microarray analysis, we found that GPCR Class A, a rhodopsin-like-structure gene, was significantly up regulated in all treated groups. Besides, for normal cell treated groups, the expression of other genes relevant to defense response to virus became strongly higher. However, in diabetic cells, genes relating to acute inflammatory response and mitotic cell cycle were highly expressed. Researchers also found that diabetic cells significantly respond to wound healing better than normal cells because inflammatory response, cell migration, cell proliferation, cell adhesion, and regulation of mitosis pathways can be instantly activated by red and green LED light according to gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
Diabetic fibroblast cells were irradiated with different wavelength (red/green/blue) LED color and compare their gene expression with the control groups.
