TITLE
Transcriptomics of vitamin D treatment effects in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected THP-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previous reports have shown low vitamin D serum levels and polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) to be associated with increased risk for TB. Given that 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 has a role in lipid metabolism control, we tested whether the link between 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and tuberculosis involves macrophage lipid metabolism. Since formation of lipid droplets (LD) is a hallmark of lipid dysregulation in M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages, we measured LD content as a readout of altered lipid metabolism in infected THP-1 cells.  Induction of LD, which peaked by 24 hours post-infection was prevented by addition of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 at the time of infection. To investigate the mechanism of  1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3  modulation of LD formation, we analyzed the transcriptome of M. tuberculosis-infected THP-1 cells with and without 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment.

DESIGN
THP-1 cells were cultured in 24-well flat bottom plates, pre-treated with 20ng/ml PMA for 24 h, and incubated with M. tuberculosis H37Rv. After 4 hours of infection, cells were washed to remove extracellular bacteria and treated with 100 nM of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. THP-1 cells were collected and analyzed at 24h. 3 biological replicates in each of the 4 groups were prepared: Infected, Infected plus 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, Non-infected, Non-infected plus 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
