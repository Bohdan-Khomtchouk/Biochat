TITLE
Gene Profiling Male Fetal Rat Gubernaculum After Insulin-like 3 (Insl3) Exposure

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Insl3 is a testis-derived hormone that induces growth and differentiation of the fetal gubernaculum.  The goal of this study was to identify genes showing altered expression in fetal gubernaculum following Insl3 exposure.

DESIGN
The number of biological replicates processed initially were six controls, five 10 nM Insl3, and six 100 nM Insl3.  Following data collection, two 10 nM Insl3 samples (biological replicates 4 and 5) were deemed to be outliers based upon Principal Component Analysis and a relatively low yield of biotin-labeled cRNA.  The two outlier samples were not included in the statistical analysis.
