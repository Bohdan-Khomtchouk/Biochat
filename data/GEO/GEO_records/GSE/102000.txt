TITLE
SERPINA3- a novel keratinocyte differentiation promotor mediates epidermal barrier repair response in psoriatic lesion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To excavate the genes regulated by SERPINA3, We profiled SERPINA3 silenced differentiated KC versus control using a RNA-seq approach. The genes down regulated in SERPINA3 silenced cells represent targets that are positively regulated by SERPINA3.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of differentiated keratinocytes which are SERPINA3-silenced by 3 different siRNA and Scramble siRNA transfected differentiated keratinocytes were generated by deep sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
