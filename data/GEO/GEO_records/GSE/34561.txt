TITLE
Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF vs. Î”rel mutants under control or mupirocin-treated conditions

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling to define the stringent response regulon and significance of basal (p)ppGpp levels in E. faecalis OG1RF.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from four replicate samples of each strain of interest and labeled with Cy3. For each replicate, labeled RNA was hybridized to slides along with Cy5-labeled reference RNA, extracted from E. faecalis OG1RF cells grown to mid-log.

PLATFORM
