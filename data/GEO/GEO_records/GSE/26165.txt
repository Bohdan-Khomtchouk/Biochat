TITLE
mut-16 and other mutator-class genes modulate 22G and 26G siRNA pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Argonaute-associated siRNAs and Piwi-associated piRNAs have overlapping roles in silencing mobile genetic elements in animals.  In C. elegans, mutator-class (mut) genes mediate siRNA-guided repression of transposons as well as exogenous RNA-directed gene silencing (RNAi), but their roles in endogenous RNA silencing pathways are not well understood.  To characterize the endogenous small RNAs dependent on mutator-class genes, small RNA populations from a null allele of mut-16, as well as a regulatory mut-16(mg461) allele that disables only somatic RNAi, were subjected to deep sequencing.

DESIGN
Small RNA analysis in wild type and mut-16 mutant C. elegans strains
