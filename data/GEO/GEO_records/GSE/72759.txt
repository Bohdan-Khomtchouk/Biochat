TITLE
Defining the consequences of genetic variation on a proteome-wide scale

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genetic variation governs protein expression through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes.  To investigate this relationship, we combined a multiplexed, mass spectrometry-based method for protein quantification with an emerging mouse model harboring extensive genetic variation from 8 founder strains. We collected genome-wide mRNA and protein profiling measurements to link genetic variation to protein expression differences in livers from 192 Diversity Outcross mice.

DESIGN
Illumina 100bp single-end liver RNA-seq from 192 male and female Diversity Outbred 26-week old mice raised on standard chow or high fat diet. Each sample was sequenced in 2x technical replicates across multiple flowcells. Samples were randomly assigned lanes and multiplexed at 12-24x.
