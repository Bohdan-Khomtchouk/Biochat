TITLE
Expression data from chicken bursal cells treated with stem cell antigen 2

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The differentiation and proliferation of chicken B cells rely on the antigens on the cell surface of bursal stromal cells. Chicken stem cell antigen 2 (SCA2) is localized on the surface of bursal cortical and medullary epithelial cells. The signals through SCA2 may regulate the expressions critical for the B cell development. The altered expressions of bursal cells that were induced through SCA2-signaling were detailed via Affemetrix array experiments.

DESIGN
Bursa of 3 week old line 0 chickens were collected and manually teased to harvest the bursal cells. The bursal cells were spread on the monolayers of SCA2Flag-DF1 cells or control Vector-DF1 cells in triplicate. After growth in the mixture of Liebovitz’s L-15 and McCoy 5A media (1:1) supplemented with 4% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin for overnight at 37 ºC in 5% CO2, the bursal cells were recovered by washes (DF1 cells are adhesive) followed by gentle centrifugation at 1000×g for 10 min. Total RNA was isolated using the absolutely RNA microprep kit.
