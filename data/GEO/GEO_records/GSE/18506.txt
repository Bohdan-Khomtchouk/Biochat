TITLE
Expression data from chicken bursal cells treated with stem cell antigen 2

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The differentiation and proliferation of chicken B cells rely on the antigens on the cell surface of bursal stromal cells. Chicken stem cell antigen 2 (SCA2) is localized on the surface of bursal cortical and medullary epithelial cells. The signals through SCA2 may regulate the expressions critical for the B cell development. The altered expressions of bursal cells that were induced through SCA2-signaling were detailed via Affemetrix array experiments.
