TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of gene expression of normal and Tbx20 knockout adult mouse whole heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tbx20 is a transcription factor important for heart development. To assess the role of Tbx20 in the adult heart, we generated a conditional knockout for this gene, specifically in cardiomyocytes. We profiled gene expression levels using RNA-seq in both normal and knockout adult mouse hearts to identify genes and pathways regulated by Tbx20. The article describing the Tbx20 knockout mouse is under review, a reference will be added when published.

DESIGN
Analysis of triplicate mRNA samples of adult mouse, comparing normal and knockout
