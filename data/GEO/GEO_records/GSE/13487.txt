TITLE
Antitumor efficacy of RAF inhibitor GDC-0879 involving BRAFV600E mutational status and ERK/MAPK pathway suppression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed a strong similarity in gene modulation resulting from either compound treatment or BRAF ablation mediated by RNA interference relative to DMSO-treated control samples . Keywords: Expression Array

DESIGN
We have generated melanoma A375 cells stably expressing a shRNA construct for doxycycline-inducible knockdown of B-Raf (2 mg/ml Dox, 48h). Small molecule treatment was at 1000nM R341787, 24h.
