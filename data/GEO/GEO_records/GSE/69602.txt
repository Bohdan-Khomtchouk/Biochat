TITLE
Ribosome profiling analysis of Dengue Virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dengue virus is an + strand RNA virus. We have carried our infections of human cells with Dengue and analyzed the translation, replication, and localization of the Dengue RNA. This allowed for clear definition of the life cycle of the Dengue virus inside a host cell. We also assessed the host response to Dengue virus, finding that a large fraction of the translational response is due to Interferon function.

DESIGN
Translational and transcriptional analysis of the cellular response to Dengue virus infection

PLATFORM
