TITLE
Thymine starvation and limitation in Escherichia coli thyA- cells

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of responses of E. coli thymine auxotrophs to i) growth under sub-optimal thymine concentration (TLM) and ii) lethal conditions under complete thymine starvation (TLD).

DESIGN
Thymine limitation: Time series following shift to limiting thymine concentrations (15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 mins) - single replicate. Thymine starvation: Time series following shift to zero thymine medium (15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 mins) - 2 biological replicates at each time point.
