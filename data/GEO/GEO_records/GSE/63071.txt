TITLE
Gene expression profiles of the Cited4 overexpressed and downregulated cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the gene expression profiles of the Cited4 overexpressed and downregulated cells.

DESIGN
Embryoid body was formed as in vitro cardiogenesis. For comparison of gene expression profiles of the Cited4 overexpressed and downregulated cells, total RNA was extracted from the Cited4 overexpressed and downregulated cells at day 6.5.
