TITLE
Development of decidual cell polyploidy and bi-nucleation necessitates mitochondrial activity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the present study, to better define the aspects of decidual cell polyploidy, we isolated pure polyploid and non-polyploid decidual cell populations from the in vivo decidual bed. Three independent RNA pools prepared for each population were then subjected to the Affymetrix gene chip analysis for the whole mouse genome transcripts. Our data revealed up-regulation of 1015 genes and down-regulation of 1207 genes in the polyploid populations, as compared to the non-polyploid group.

DESIGN
We analyzed whole gnenome transcription from non-polyploid and polyploid cell populations using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array . 3 replicates were performed.
