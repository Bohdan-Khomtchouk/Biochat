TITLE
Expression data from murine irf4-/- and irf4+/+ mature B cells purified by magnetic cell separation and stimulated with anti-CD40 antibodies and IL-4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of murine irf4-/- and irf4+/+ splenic B cells identifies genes regulated by the transcription factor IRF4 in CD40+IL-4 activated mature B cells.

DESIGN
B cells from 12-week old irf4-/- and irf4+/+ littermate mice were isolated by magnetic depletion of non-B cells from splenic mononuclear cells and cultures with mitogens in vitro. RNA was isolated. Labeled cRNA was hybridized to microarrays and genes specifically expressed in irf4-/- vs. irf4+/+ samples.
