TITLE
ChIP-chip data of Rrm3-Flag in wild-type and rpb1-1 cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcription is a major contributor to genome instability.A main cause of transcription-associated instability relies on the capacity of transcription to stall replication. Such genome instability is increased in RNAPII mutants. ChIP-chips performed in asynchronous cultures showed an increase of the Rrm3 binding signal all over the genome in rpb1-1 compared to wild-type.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip studies were perfomed with antibody against Flag-tagged Rrm3 protein in both wild-type and rpb1-1 cells.
