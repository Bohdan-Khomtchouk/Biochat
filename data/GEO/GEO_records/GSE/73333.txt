TITLE
Melanoma cell line-induced MDSC transcriptome analysis reveals a unique gene expression profile that is largely reversed to normal monocyte level by MIF inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix microaaray analysis of healthy donor monocytes cultured for 64 hours in the absence of (culture monocytes), or presence of A375 cells (A375-MDSC) or treated with MIF inihibitor, 4-IPP (MDSC+4-IPP; 100mM, day 0 and 50mM, day 2).

DESIGN
Significantly modulated genes were clustered into a hierarchical representation. Each column represents one replicate, whereas each row corresponds to the expression of a particular gene across different replicates/experimental conditions.
