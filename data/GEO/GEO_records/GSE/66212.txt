TITLE
ChIPseq analysis of MYST5 (cg1894) in Drosophila S2 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report here the genome-wide localization of the histone acetyltransferase MYST5 (cg1984) in Drosophila. ChIP-seq analysis was performed with two anti-MYST5 antibodies in S2 cells. We found MYST5 to bind to the promoters of actively transcribed genes. MYST5 furthermore showed extensive colocalization with boundary/ insulator factors, including Chriz/ Chromator, CP190, dCTCF and BEAF-32, which mediate the organization of the genome into functionally distinct topological domains. Altogether, our data suggest a broad role for MYST5 both in gene-specific transcriptional regulation and in the organization of the genome into chromatin domains.
