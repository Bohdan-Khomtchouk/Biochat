TITLE
Expression analysis of  BCR/ABL expressing Kit+ cells derived from wild type and ROSACreERT2c-Fosfl/flDusp1-/- bone marrow cells by RNA seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed whole genome expression analysis using BCR/ABL expressing Kit+ cells derived from wild type and ROSACreERT2c-Fosfl/flDusp1-/- bone marrow cells. Wild type kit+ cells were treated with DFC+BCI and DFC+BC+Im to mimic the genetic loss of c-Fos and Dusp1.

DESIGN
The experiment was designed to test whether chemical inhibition by FOS and Dusp1 Inhibitor mimics the genetic deletion of cFOS and Dusp1 in mouse primary cells transduced with BCR-ABL. This data is part of the super series Mechanism of Oncogene addiction GSE75058.
