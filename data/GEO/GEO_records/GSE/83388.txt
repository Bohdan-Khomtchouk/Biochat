TITLE
Expression data from KSRP overexpression and knockdown lung cancer cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KSRP overexpressed CL1-0 cells and  KSRP depleted CL1-5 cells were used to identify genes regulated by KSRP We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying metastasis and identified distinct classes of KSRP-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
CL1-0 cells stablely depleted KSRP expressing and CL1-5 cells stably expressed KSRP-specific shRNA were analyzed compare to respective control cells
