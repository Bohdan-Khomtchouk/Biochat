TITLE
Genome-wide analysis between murine invariant NKT cells and CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis between two different types of T cells

DESIGN
Invariant NKT cells and CD4+ T cells were isolated from mouse lymph nodes via magenetic cell sorting or flourescence cell sorting techniques. Total RNA was isolated from each sample and used for microarray analysis
