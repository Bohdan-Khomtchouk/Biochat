TITLE
RNA-sequencing of longitudinal murine norovirus (MNV) infection in RAW264.7 mouse macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcriptome has an abundance of information about the function of individual cells, tissues and an organism in general. Characterising the transcriptome of virus infected cells can illuminate features of the viral-host relationship that are important for pathogenesis. This study broadly aimed to quantify the host gene expression changes that occur following MNV infection. Furthermore, we  aimed to identify alterations in specific biological pathways by identifying alterations in transcript abundance that increase or decrease in intensity with MNV infection over time.

DESIGN
Transcript expression profiles of RAW264.7 cells mock infected or infected with MNV for 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 hours (MOI 5) were generated by RNA-sequencing using Illumina NextSeq500.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
