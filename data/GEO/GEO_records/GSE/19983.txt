TITLE
Transcriptome profie of rice in response to temperature and oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
Here we describe stress regimes (treatment methods) that can be used in future studies. We describe global analysis of heat, cold and oxidative stress responsive transcriptome in rice.

DESIGN
10-day old rice seedlings were used for experiments. Cold stress was implied for 1 and 5h at 5°C, heat stress was given at 42°C for 10’ and 30 ‘ while oxidative stress was given by implying 10mM H202 for 1h and 4h at 28°C. Unstressed seedlings were used as control. For each condition, three biological replicates were processed in a similar manner for the microarray analysis.
