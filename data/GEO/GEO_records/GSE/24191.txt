TITLE
Gene expression profiling of dendritic cells in different physiological stages under Cordyceps sinensis treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cordyceps sinensis (CS) has been commonly used as a herbal medicine as well as a health supplement in China for over two thousand years. Although previous studies demonstrated that CS has benefit in immunoregulation and anti-inflammation, the precise mechanism by which CS affects immunomodulation is still unclear. In this study, we adopted duplicate sets of loop-design microarray experiments to examine two different batches of CS and analyzed the effects of CS on dendritic cells (DCs) in different physiology stages, naïve stage and inflammatory stage.

DESIGN
We used duplicate sets of loop-design microarray in this study. Each loop experiment consisted of 4 RNA samples, including untreated samples, CS 1μg/ml, LPS  1μg/ml, and LPS  1μg/ml+ CS 1μg/ml.
