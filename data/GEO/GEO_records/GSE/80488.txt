TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis Indicates Divergent Mechanisms in DEN-Induced Carcinogenesis in Wild Type and Bid-Deficient Livers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to better understand the Bid-regulated events during hepatic carcinogenesis. The information from this set of data indicates that wild type and bid-deficient livers express different sets of genes after diethylnitrosamine (DEN) treatment.

DESIGN
We performed gene expression analysis in wild type and bid-deficient mice treated with DEN for 4-6 months and for 10-12 months. The expression was compared among the different groups to understand the effect of deletion of Bid on gene epxression at the early (4-6 month) and the later (10-12 months) stage.
