TITLE
Assessing the developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells using Pluritest

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The International Stem Cell Initiative compared three common approaches for assessing pluripotent stem cells (PSC).  The formation of teratomas in vivo, or embryoid bodies (EB) in vitro, provide direct tests of differentiation, whereas PluriTest predicts pluripotency through bioinformatic analysis of transcriptomes of undifferentiated cells.  Here we studied the starting poulations of pluripotent stem cells  using an Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip assays

DESIGN
Undifferentiated samples from 16 pluripotent stem cell lines, consisting of 10 embryonic stem cell (ES) and six induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) lines, from four laboratories were analysed by Illumina  HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip array to asess the degree of pluripotency
