SUMMARY
Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is a regulatory system that allows preferential metabolization of one sugar over others. In Lactococcus lactis, a Gram-positive bacterium used in dairy fermentation, the carbon catabolite protein CcpA is a global transcriptional regulator of carbon catabolite repression, and the only regulator thus far described. Using aerobic respiration-permissive growth conditions we report three discoveries regarding carbon metabolism: i) expression of pfl, encoding the oxygen-sensitive Pyruvate-formate lyase (Pfl), is induced in respiration, compared to anaerobic fermentation; ii) its expression is controlled by CCR but is independent of CcpA; iii) a transcriptional regulator, LlrA, belonging to the two-component system, KinA (sensor kinase), comprises a signaling pathway leading to pfl expression. In vivo, the protein KinA and also acetyl-phosphate, a phosphate-donor molecule, can modulate the activity of LlrA. In vitro, we demonstrated that LlrA binds to the pfl promoter region, and identified its aspartic acid residue at position 54 as essential for stability of the complex DNA-LlrA. We propose that the LlrA-KinA system constitutes a second signaling pathway in CCR and is recruited during respiration growth conditions to control carbon metabolism in L. lactis.

DESIGN
Two samples are analyzed. The reference sample is at OD 2.5 (Cy3), and the two tests are at OD 5.6 and 6.4 (Cy5), respectively
