TITLE
Transcription rate analysis of W303 hog1 mutant strain subjected to osmotic stress

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcription rate (TR) analysis of W303 hog1 mutant yeast strain growing in exponential phase in YPD subjected to osmotic stress Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
Transcription rate analysis by means of GRO of three independent replicates the yeast strain growing in exponential phase. Each time point replicate has been hybridized on a different macroarray (F18-F24).
