TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of Arabidopsis Col-0 under normal and low oxygen conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Global gene expression was compared between root RNA samples from three-week-old Arabidopsis Col-0 plants subjected to 0.1% oxygen (balance nitrogen) or ambient atmospheric conditions.

DESIGN
Three-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings (4-6 leaves) of ecotype Col-0 were used. Two biological replicates were used for each treatment, and for each biological replicate, five Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the same petri dish were bulked. RNA was extracted from root tissue excised post-treatment. Treatment consisted of moving plants grown on solid MS media containing 3% sucrose to liquid MS media containing 3% sucrose for 24 hours, after which plates were placed in anaerobic cannisters covered in aluminum foil. Cannisters containing plants in the 0.1% oxygen treatment group were flushed with a 0.1% oxygen gas mixture and then sealed, while cannisters in the control group were left unsealed. Treatment lasted 5 hours before plant tissue was harvested and RNA extracted.
