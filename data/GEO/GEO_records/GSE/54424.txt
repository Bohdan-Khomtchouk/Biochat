TITLE
SOX9: a Stem Cell Transcriptional Regulator of Secreted Niche Signaling Factors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse hair follicles undergo synchronized cycles. Cyclical regeneration and hair growth is fueled by hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). We used RNA-seq to identify SOX9-dependent transcriptional changes and ChIP-seq to identify SOX9-bound genes in HF-SCs.

DESIGN
Telogen quiescent hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and intefollicular epidermal cells (IFE) were FACS-purified for ChIP-sequcencing and HFSCs for RNA-Sequencing
