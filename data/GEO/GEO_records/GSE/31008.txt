TITLE
A key role for Mbd3 in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine-dependent gene regulation in embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify functional interactions among six chromatin regulators with key roles in embryonic stem cells, we examined gene expression changes in mouse ES cells with single and pair-wise combinations of knockdowns for those factors, along with control (EGFP) KDs.

DESIGN
Effects on gene expression of RNAi-mediated knockdown of combinations of chromatin regulators. KDs were performed in duplicate for each combination for 48 hours.
