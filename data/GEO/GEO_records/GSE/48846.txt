TITLE
Transcriptome of Primitive Human Hematopoietic Cells: A New Resource to Find hHSC-Specific Genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed the transcriptome of different HSC-enriched subpopulations of cells sorted from human umbilical cord blood and isolated from several individuals with different genetic backgrounds. We aim at identifying new cell surface markers associated with human HSC and downstream mature hematopoietic cell activity.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of CD34+CD45RA- cord blood cells from 17 non-pooled individuals.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
