TITLE
Metabolic and transcriptional dynamics during the transition from carbon limitation to nitrogen limitation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Microorganisms are exposed to large variations in nutrient availability in nature. To cope with these variations and sustain growth, they maximize the utility of the available nutrients and adapt to nutritional deficiencies. We studied the transcriptional and metabolic dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to a gradual transition from glucose-limited growth to ammonia-limited growth under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Through exposing yeast to a gradual increase in glucose availability, we discovered new aspects of regulation that ensured a balanced metabolism of glucose and ammonia to sustain growth. This required tight coordination of metabolism with different cellular processes. The coordinated expression of the genes involved in key cellular processes implicated the role of signaling pathways mediated by Tor1, Pka1 and Hog1. This is in contrast to the rapid increase in glucose availability, when Snf1 appeared to be the key regulator. The results presented here provide clear insight into key cellular processes that are affected by nutrient limitation and have direct implications in further studies on genome-scale regulation of metabolism.
