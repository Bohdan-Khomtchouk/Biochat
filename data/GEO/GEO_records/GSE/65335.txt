TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling of an in vitro model for studying esophageal epithelial differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes during esophageal epithelial differentiation and in the presence of interleukin 13 using an air-liquid interface culture system.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing was performed on a human esophageal epithelial cell line (EPC2-hTERT) grown submerged (day 8) or at the air-liquid interface (ALI) (day 14, untreated or treated with interleukin 13 [100 ng/mL])

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
