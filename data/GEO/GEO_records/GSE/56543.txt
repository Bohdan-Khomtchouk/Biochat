TITLE
Genome-wide measuement of methylated cytosin in regulatory T cells (Treg) and conventional T cells (Tconv)  depleted with Uhrf1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the molecular mechanism how Uhrf1 regulate gene expression and cell cycle progression in Treg, we precipitated methylated DNA using recombinant MBD1 followed by  genome-wide analysis of methylated gene loci by next generation sequencer

DESIGN
Examination of methylated DNA in Treg and Tconv isolated from Cd4cre-Uhrf1+/+ and Cd4cre-Uhrf1flox/flox (Cd4cre-Uhrf1fl/fl)

PLATFORM
GPL15103 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Mus musculus)
