TITLE
BK virus infection induces changes of cellular gene expression in Vero cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Human polyomavirus 1

SUMMARY
The general aim of this paper is to explore a little further into molecular biology of the interaction between virus and host cell. We seek to use cDNA microarray technology, one revolutionary methodological advance, to perform a high throughput analysis of cDNA clones with the intent of identifying genes expressed in association with the infection with BKV in Vero cells (green monkey kidney cells). This technology, which can supply quantitative expression information for many thousands of genes simultaneously, has been used to classify the cellular genes at transcript levels in different physiological states of a tissue or cell. Accordingly, in this study, we have constructed a cDNA microarray containing 32448 spots (quadruplication of 7,334 human cDNAs and doping controls) to study that BKV infection of Vero cells. Our purposes were (i) to appraise whether cDNA microarrays could be employed to investigate the expression of cellular genes during the 5 time courses (5, 10, 15, 19 and 25 days post-infection (dpi)) of infection with BKV, (ii) to identify any genes that resulted in up-regulation or down-regulation of cell gene expression transcription, (iii) to determine the etiological role of BKV in nephropathy and/or neoplasia, (iv) to form a clearer picture of virus-associated pathophysiology in kidney. Keywords: BK virus, BKV, cDNA microarray, Vero cell

DESIGN
We used a loop design in this study. cDNA microarray experiment consisted of ten RNA samples, including BKV-infected samples and their corresponding uninfected controls in 5 different time points. See supplementary PDF file for additional information
