TITLE
Total blood monocyte gene expression from neovascular age-related macular degeneration patients and age-matched controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mononuclear phagocytes (MPs), including monocytes and macrophages, play complex roles in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We aimed to perform global transcriptome analysis on monocytes from AMD patients to obtain additional insight to the role of MPs in AMD. Peripheral blood was taken from treatment-na√Øve neovascular AMD (nvAMD) patients (n=14), and age-matched controls (n=15). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated and monocytes were isolated via negative selection. Gene expression was evaluated with Affymetrix Gene1.0 ST microarrays. Statistical/bioinformatics analysis was performed using open sourceware programs.

DESIGN
14 neovascular age-related macular degeneration patients, 15 age-matched controls, peripheral blood monocytes were extracted via histopaque separation and negative selection using magnetic beads. Total monocyte RNA was extracted using tri-reagent, and cleaned using columns. RIN was evaluated using Agilent Bioanalyzer
