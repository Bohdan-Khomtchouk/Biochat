TITLE
Expression data from aerial parts of 14-day-old wild-type and GFP-TIE1-15 Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
TIE1 regulates leaf development by repressing leaf differentiation because the semi-dominant mutant tie1-D by activation tagging displays small and hyponastic leaves and the differentiation of leaf epidermal cells is delayed in the tie1-D mutant, whereas disruption of TIE1 causes epinastic leaves with early differentiated epidermal cells. We used microarrays to investigate the molecular base underpinning the phenotypes of TIE1-overexpressing plants.

DESIGN
Aerial parts of 14-day-old seedlings from wild-type and GFP-TIE1-15 were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
