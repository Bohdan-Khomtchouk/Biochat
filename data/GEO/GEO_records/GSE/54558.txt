TITLE
Lipopolysaccharide modulates rhinovirus-induced chemokine secretion in monocytes and macrophages.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rhinovirus (RV) infection has been shown to exacerbate asthma. Understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which RV infections provoke airway inflammation and remodeling in asthma may offer significant insight into asthma pathogenesis and exacerbations as well as offer opportunities for improved disease management. Expression analysis of RV A16-treated primary peripheral blood monocytes from human donors was performed to determine what pattern of gene expression is associated with RV infection of monocytes in vitro.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from 5 adults. Following overnight incubation in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, the monocytes were stimulated with purified major group RV A16 at multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque forming units (pfu) per cell or with growth media alone (mock). Cells were lysed 4 hours after treatment and isolated total RNAs were pooled per treatment and analyzed using the Affymetrix GeneChip HuGeneFL Array (Hu6800, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
