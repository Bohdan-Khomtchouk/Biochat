TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of bam- vs. Phf7-,bam- mutant testes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing was used to determine the RNA profiles of the designated genotypes to identify genes with significant expression changes upon deletion of the male germline gene Phf7 in the fruit fly testis.

DESIGN
Transcriptomes of testes from newly-eclosed bam- and Phf7-bam- flies were generated by high-throughput sequencing in biological replicates on the Illumina platform.

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
