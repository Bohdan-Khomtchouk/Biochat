TITLE
Circulating let-7 levels in plasma correlate with hepatic fibrosis progression in chronic hepatitis C

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Circulating microRNAs show great promise as novel noninvasive markers for the state of disease progression in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). We performed circulating miRNA expression analysis to identify circulating miRNAs associated with disease progression in the natural course of chronic HCV infection using a prospectively followed and well-characterized HCV-infected blood donor cohort.
