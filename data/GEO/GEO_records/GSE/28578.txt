TITLE
Campylobacter jejuni gene expression in germ-free mice

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni NCTC 11168 = ATCC 700819

SUMMARY
Expression arrays comparing Campylobacter jejuni NCTC11168 during growth in the cecum of germ-free C57 BL/6 IL-10 knockout mice to C. jejuni NCTC11168 during growth in Bolton broth.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates comparing C. jejuni NCTC11168 growth in vivo to in vitro. Two biological replicates were dye swaps.

PLATFORM
GPL8707 Campylobacter jejuni 2K whole-ORF array v1.2
