TITLE
NRASG12V mediates leukemia self renewal [Microarray]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mutant RAS oncoproteins activate signaling molecules that drive oncogenesis in multiple human tumors including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). However, the specific function of these pathways in AML is unclear. To elucidate the downstream functions of activated NRAS in AML, we employed a murine model of AML harboring Mll-AF9 and NRASG12V. We found that NRASG12V enforced leukemia self-renewal gene expression signatures and was required to maintain an MLL-AF9 and MYB-dependent gene expression program. In a multiplexed analysis of RAS-dependent signaling intermediates, the leukemia stem cell compartment was preferentially sensitive to RAS withdrawal. Use of RAS-pathway inhibitors showed that NRASG12V maintained leukemia self-renewal through mTOR and MEK pathway activation, implicating these pathways as potential targets for cancer stem cell-specific therapies.

DESIGN
Mice harboring NRASG12V/Mll-AF9 AML were treated with doxycyline to abolish NRASG12V expression.  Leukemia samples were harvested at 12 hour intervals after doxycyline treatment.  RNA was extracted from these samples and submitted for gene expression microarray analysis
