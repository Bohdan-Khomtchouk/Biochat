TITLE
A tumor suppressor role for Bank1 in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate gene expression changes in BM leukemic Bank1+/- + Pax5+/- cells

DESIGN
Bone marrow leukemic cells of six Bank1+/- + Pax5+/- mice compared with bone marrow proB and preB cells of three WT mice and bone marrow leukemic cells of six Pax5+/- mice.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
