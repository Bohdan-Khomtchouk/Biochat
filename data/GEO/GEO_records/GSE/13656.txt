TITLE
5448 vs 5448R- in vivo 24h

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed on in vivo-derived RNA from the well characterized GAS strain 5448 and its derivative 5448R-, containing the mutated ropB allele from 5628.

DESIGN
We followed a cyclic design that allowed us to compare every condition to each other at least twice, and guaranteed dye swapping to eliminate effects of non-specific binding. This study consists of 4 replicates of 5448 and 3 replicates of 5448R-.
