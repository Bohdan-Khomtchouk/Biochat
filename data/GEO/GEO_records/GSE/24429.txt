TITLE
Expression profiles of CSE1L silenced ovarian cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knocking down of CSE1L made ovarian cancer cells, but not other cancer and normal cell lines, sensitized to cisplatin and triggered apoptosis. The nuclear localization in ovarian cancer cells suggested that CSE1L might primarily regulate transcription. .
