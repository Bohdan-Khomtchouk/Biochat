TITLE
Distinct epigenomes in CD4+ T cells of newborns, middle-ages and centenarians.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To reveal dynamic changes in networks of gene expression and epigenetic regulation during healthy human T cell aging.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood was obtained from 90 healthy newborn (0 y), 90 healthy middle-aged (age range from 40 to 55 years) and 90 long-lived subjects (age range from 90 to 110 years). The NB samples came from umbilical cord blood. 90 individuals from each age stage were distributed equally into 3 pools with identical male/female ratios. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the pooled blood samples using density gradient centrifugation, and CD4+ T cells were isolated by positive selection using CD4 beads.
