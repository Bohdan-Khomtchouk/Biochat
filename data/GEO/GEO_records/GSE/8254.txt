TITLE
S. mansoni gene expression 21-27d post-infection in wt and RAG-/- mice

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
RNA isolated from S. mansoni worms grown in C57BL/6 or RAG-/- mice at 21, 23, 25 and 27 days post-infection was hybridized to a S. mansoni custom microarray.  Expression was compared to a reference pool containing equal amounts of RNA from each condition and time point assayed. Keywords: Time course with two growth conditions (wt and RAG-/- mice)

DESIGN
Wild-type (C57BL/6) or RAG-/- mice were infected with S. mansoni cercariae.  Worms were isolated by liver perfusion at 21, 23, 25 and 27 days post-infection.  RNA was isolated and amplified.  A reference pool was made from equal amounts of amplified RNA from each of 8 samples.  Sample RNA was labeled with Cy5 and reference RNA was labeled with Cy3 dyes.  Labeled RNAs were hybridized to a S. mansoni microarray and analyzed for relative signal.
