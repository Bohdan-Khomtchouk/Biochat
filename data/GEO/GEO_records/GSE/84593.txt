TITLE
Regulation of KMT2D by PI(3)K/AKT signalling orchestrates oestrogen receptor mediated transcriptional activation in breast cancer [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aim to elucidate the mechanisms of how PI3K inhibition is promoting oestrogen receptor (ER) activation and ER dependency in breast cancer.

DESIGN
Genome-wide analysis of ER, FOXA1 TF upon treatment with the PI3K inhibitor (BYL719).

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
