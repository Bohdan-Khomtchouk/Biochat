SUMMARY
This study describes differential miRNA expression in small intestinal lamina propria leukocyte samples longitudinally during the course of SIV infection of rhesus macaques. Notably, the T-cell activation associated miR-15b, miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p and miR-150 expression was significantly downregulated at 90 and 180DPI. Further, reporter and overexpression assays validated IRAK1 as a direct miR-150 target. Furthermore, IRAK1 protein levels were markedly elevated in intestinal LPLs and epithelium. Finally, blockade of CD8+ T-cell activation/proliferation with delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (ÔÅÑ9-THC) significantly prevented miR-150 downregulation and IRAK1 upregulation. Our findings suggest that miR-150 downregulation during T-cell activation may disrupt the translational control of IRAK1 facilitating persistent GI inflammation.
