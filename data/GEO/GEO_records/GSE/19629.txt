TITLE
Comparative Genomic Hybridizations of Mycoplasma gallisepticum Vaccine strains and strain Rlow

ORGANISM
Mycoplasma gallisepticum

SUMMARY
Genomic content of Vaccine strains were probed against the known sequence of the virulent strain Rlow of M. gallisepticum to identify divergent or absent genes in the attenuated strains.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was extracted from in vitro grown cultures of M. gallisepticum strains Rlow, F, ts-11, and 6/85 and three samples from each were selected for hybirdization to oligonucleotide microarrays using standard methods from the Bioprime CGH kit.  All samples were labeled with Cy3 dye and scanned at a PMT gain of 700 using a GenePix 4000B scanner.  Features are duplicated on the slides and data were averaged between duplicate features on each slide.  Median signal intensities were averaged between samples of the same strain and each feature from each vaccine strain was compared to Rlow.  Features exhibiting four-fold or less hybridization in the vaccine strains were considered divergent or absent.
