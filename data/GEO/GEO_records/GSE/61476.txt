TITLE
FOXG1-dependent dysregulation of GABA/glutamate neuron differentiation in autism spectrum disorders

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a disorder of brain development believed, in most cases, to be of genetic origin. We use induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived 3-dimensional neural cultures (organoids) in patients with ASD and macrocephaly to investigate neurodevelopmental alterations that cause this form of ASD. By using transcriptome analyses, we identified modules of co-expressed genes significantly upregulated in ASD patients compared to non-ASD first-degree family members.

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from terminal differentiation day 0, 11 and 31 of iPSCs-derived neural cultures from ASD patients and non-ASD first-degree family members. A total of 4 patients and 8 controls (unaffected family members) were analyzed in replicates (two to three iPSC clones per person).
