TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression patterns in human kidney cancer [patients without metastasis]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the mechanisms of ccRCC progression and metastasis, we performed expression profiling of human kidney cancer and benign tissues.

DESIGN
mRNA microarray expression analysis was performed by using  28 matched malignant and non-malignant kidney tissue samples from 14 ccRCC patients without diagnosed metastasis.
