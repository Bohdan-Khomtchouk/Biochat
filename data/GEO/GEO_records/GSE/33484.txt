TITLE
Comparative genomic hybridization of hiPSC stem cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Purpose of this series of experiments is to identify copy number variations, duplications, and deletions in human induced pluripotent stem (hiPSC) cell lines.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA of different human induced pluripotent stem cell lines are extracted and hybridized to NimbleGen CGH microarray, using genomic DNA of hESC H1 or H9 as common reference. Difference between different stem cell lines will be revealed.
