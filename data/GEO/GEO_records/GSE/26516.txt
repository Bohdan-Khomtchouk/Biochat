TITLE
Genome-wide identification of micro-ribonucleic acids associated with human endometrial receptivity in natural and stimulated cycles by deep sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we took advantage of deep sequencing approaches to investigate the miRNA expression profiles of human endometrium on days LH+2 and LH+7 in natural cycles, and compare them with those on days hCG+4 and hCG+7 in stimulated cycles during IVF treatment.

DESIGN
Examination of miRNA expression in human endometrium during natural and stimulated cycles

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
