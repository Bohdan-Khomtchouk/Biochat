TITLE
RGA binding sites in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
DELLA proteins act as hubs that relay environmental information to the multiple transcriptional circuits that control growth and development through physical interaction with transcription factors from different families. We have analyzed the presence of one DELLA protein at the Arabidopsis genome by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to large-scale sequencing and we find that it binds at the promoters of multiple genes. Enrichment analysis shows a strong preference for cis elements recognized by specific transcription factor families. In particular, we demonstrate that DELLA proteins are recruited by type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS (ARR) to the promoters of cytokinin-regulated genes, where they act as transcriptional co-activators. The biological relevance of this mechanism is underpinned by the necessity of simultaneous presence of DELLAs and ARRs to restrict root meristem growth and to promote photomorphogenesis.

DESIGN
Provided are 3 biological replicates analysing RGA binding sites in Arabidopsis seedlings. ChIP-seq was performed on plants expressing RGA-GFP under the native RGA promoter and on non-transgenic control plants as reference
