TITLE
Expression in the dorsal telencephalon of E13.5 conditional Dicer KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the effect of miRNA depletion in the embryonic forebrain, we isolated RNA from E13.5 dorsal telencephalon of mice homozygous for a floxed Dicer allele and hemizygous for the forebrain expressed Emx1Cre (Dicer KO mice). These samples were compared to littermates heterozygous for the floxed allele and hemizygous for Emx1Cre.

DESIGN
5 Dicerko mice and 4 controls, partly littermates, no technical replicates
