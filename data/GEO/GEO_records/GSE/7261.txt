TITLE
Yeast mRNA decay analysis after addition of 3 µ/mL thiolutin

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Time course after the addition of the transcriptional inhibitor thiolutin at 3µg/mL to an exponential growing culture of S. cerevisiae in YPD. Keywords: time course, mRNA stability analysis

DESIGN
Total RNA from BQS252 yeast strain (Mat a, ura 3-52 derived from FY1679) growing in exponential phase in YPD was extracted at different times after thiolutin 3µg/mL addition. All the samples were hybridized on the same nylon array. In order to estimate mRNA stability the intensities where normalized using global poly(A) data from a RNA dot-blot and assuming a first order decaying. There is only 1 replicate.
