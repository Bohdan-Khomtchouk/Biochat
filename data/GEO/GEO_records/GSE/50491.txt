TITLE
Regulation of the KEAP1/NRF2 oxidative stress response pathway by BRD4 in prostate and colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes regulated by BRD4 and to provide insight into new mechanisms de-regulated by BRD4, such as the response to oxidative stress, we integrated BRD4-binding regions with BRD4 gene expression data. For this analysis we performed BRD4 chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments and BRD4 knock down experiments followed by RNA-Seq analyses. By integration of both gene lists we identified top candidate genes regulated by BRD4.

DESIGN
HEK cells have been investigated for genomewide BRD4 binding sites and expression changes after knock down of BRD4. Illumina sequencing was used to gather data of the type ChIP Seq and mRNA Seq.
