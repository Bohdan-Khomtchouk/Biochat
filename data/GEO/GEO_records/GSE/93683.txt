TITLE
CD8 T-cells from pSS patients and human healthy volunteers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary Sj√∂gren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of lacrimal and salivary glands, and it is often accompanied by systemic manifestations. Recent immunophenotyping result indicated that CD8 T-cells might be involved in the pathogenic process of pSS. We used microarrays to elucidate the transcriptional profiles of CD8 T-cells in pSS patients and healthy controls.

DESIGN
The peripheral CD8 T-cell subsets in four major differentiation stages, naive CD8 T-cells (TN), central memory CD8 T-cells (TCM), effector memory CD8 T-cells (TEM), terminally differentiated effector memory CD8 T-cells (TEMRA), from six pSS patients and six healthy controls were subjected to genome-wide transcriptome arrays.
