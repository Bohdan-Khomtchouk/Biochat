TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of denervation induced gene expression in mouse triceps surae muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of denervation induced regulation of muscle mass at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that the presence of MuRF1 contributes to the extent of gene expression changes observed in specific sets of genes during a challenge leading to muscle atrophy. Results provide important information on the response of triceps surae muscle to sciatic nerve resection (denervation), such as specific structural, metabolic, and neuromuscular junction associated genes, that may be influenced by MuRF1 during atrophy.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated triceps surae muscle subjected to 3 or 14 days post-denervation compared to nonsurgically treated littermate control muscles.
