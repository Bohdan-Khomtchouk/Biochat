TITLE
Expression profile of Breast Cancer tumors in Brazilian women

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
On the basis of prognostic information provided by the PAM50 predictor, we evaluated how samples grouped relative to the other breast tumor subtypes. mRNA samples from 24 patients were amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST array. After normalization and analysis of the microarray data using PartekÂ® software ( http://www.partek.com ), we clustered all samples using the PAM50 predictor.

DESIGN
We analyzed tumors from 24 patients with breast cancer using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by AffymetrixExpression Console and analysed using Partek software

PLATFORM
GPL5175 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
