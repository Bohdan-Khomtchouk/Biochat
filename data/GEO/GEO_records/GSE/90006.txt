TITLE
Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) synchronized meiotic timecourse II

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
transcriptional profiling of yeast meiotic culture

DESIGN
generate synchronized meiotic time course after Ndt80 block and take samples at certain times. Several timepoints before NDT80 block releasing is also included. RNA expression is measured by microarray

PLATFORM
