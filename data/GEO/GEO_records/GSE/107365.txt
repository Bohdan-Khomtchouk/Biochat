TITLE
Role of PhoPQ TCS plays in Shigella virulence

ORGANISM
Shigella flexneri

SUMMARY
To explore what important role of PhoPQ TCS plays in Shigella virulence, the Agilent microarray technologies was used to compare the transcriptional profiles of Shigella flexneri 2a 301 and △phoPQ mutant strains at middle-log phase (6 h) or early-stationary phase (10 h) under LB growth conditions.

DESIGN
Shigella flexneri 2a 301 and △phoPQ mutant strains were grown at middle-log phase (6 h) or early-stationary phase (10 h) under LB growth conditions with three biological replicates. In total, 12 sample were analyzed

PLATFORM
GPL24308 Agilent-059169 Shigella flexneri 4X44k array (Probe name version)
