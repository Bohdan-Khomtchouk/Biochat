TITLE
Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of Escherichia coli isolates carrying virulence factors of both enteropathogenic and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 102712

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli 102712

SUMMARY
Global transcriptional analysis of EPEC/ETEC hybrid isolates.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing was performed on seven E. coli during growth in laboratory media and conditions that have been previously demonstrated to induce expression of virulence genes.

PLATFORM
