TITLE
Expression data from Drosophila histone methyltransferase mutants

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
H3K9 methylation is a mark of inactive chromatin.  In D.melanogaster, three enzymes (SU(VAR)3-9, EGG, and dG9A) are responsible for creating the H3K9 methyl mark.  We have investigated the effects of loss of SU(VAR)3-9 and EGG on gene expression in adult heads using microarray analysis. Keywords: Expression profiling by microarray

DESIGN
Heads from adults flies were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  Four genotypes were used: yw; +/CyO,  yw; egg235/CyO,   yw; +/CyO; Su(var)3-906;   yw; egg235/CyO; Su(var)3-906.  For each genotype, three biological replicates were analyzed.  For the yw; +/CyO control, an additional technical replicate (same RNA sample processed twice) is included.  While source files for both technical replicates are included, only one was used for the final analysis.
