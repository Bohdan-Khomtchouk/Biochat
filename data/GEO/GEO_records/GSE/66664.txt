TITLE
Transcriptome analysis reveals differences in vasculature signalling between human dermal papilla cells from balding and non-balding scalp

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of hTERT-immortalized balding (BAB) and non-balding (BAN) dermal papilla cells derived from frontal and occipital scalp of male patients with androgenetic alopecia Hamilton grade IV. Interrogation of transcriptome differences between BAB and BAN after dihydrotestosterone (DHT, active metabolite of androgen) treatment revealed significant enrichment of vasculature-related genes among down-regulated genes in BAB compared to BAN.

DESIGN
RNA obtained from BAB and BAN after treatment with 1nM or 10nM of DHT, 2-3 replicates for each condition
