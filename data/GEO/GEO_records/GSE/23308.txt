TITLE
Effect of Mineralocorticoid Receptor deletion on glucocorticoid signalling in the macropahge

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inappropriate excess of the steroid hormone aldosterone, which is a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) agonist, is associated with increased inflammation and risk of cardiovascular disease. MR antagonists are cardioprotective and antiinflammatory in vivo, and evidence suggests that they mediate these effects in part by aldosterone- independent mechanisms. We used affymetrix to characterize the effect of Mineralocorticoid Receptor deletion on macrophage transcriptional profile, and identify its requirement in normal glucocorticoid signalling.

DESIGN
We isolated mouse peritoneal macrophages from Myeloid MRKO mice and Floxed Controls, cultured in the presence or absence of corticosterone. RNA was extracted for Affymetrix cDNA hybridization. Each sample was pooled from experiments performed in triplicate.
