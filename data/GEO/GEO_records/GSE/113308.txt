TITLE
DNA methylation analysis of AR24Q and AR97Q SH-SY5Y cell culture samples with dihydrotestosterone

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of AR24Q and AR97Q SH-SY5Y cell culture samples. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs. Samples included 3 normal CAG repeats (AR24Q) and 3 abnormal CAG repeats (AR97Q).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 6 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
