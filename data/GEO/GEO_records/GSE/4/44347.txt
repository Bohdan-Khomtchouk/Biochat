TITLE
Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1 : WT stationary phase vs. aqsR mutant stationary phase

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. oleivorans DR1 cells comparing wild type stationary phase cells with aqsR mutant stationary phase cells.

DESIGN
To identify genes regulated QS system in A. oleivorans DR1, the cells were grown to stationary phase (OD600 > 0=2.0).
