TITLE
Paired subcloned human large cell lung carcinoma cell lines: low-metastatic 95C vs high-metastatic 95D

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The paired low-metastatic 95C and high-metastatic 95D cell lines were subcloned from a low differentiated human large cell lung carcinomacell line PLA-801. The cells were well authenticated and published by several research groups. The cells were kindly provided by Professor Ying-Lin Lu, Department of Pathobiology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China on Dec. 5，2009. As described The 95C and 95D cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, USA) with 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin and 10% calf bovine serum, and grown at 37° C in atmosphere with 5% CO2. miRNAs differential expression between 95C and 95D was measured using a miR human_01_H10.1_080277 miRNA array (LC Sciences Houston, USA).

DESIGN
Paired subcloned human large cell lung carcinomacell line PLA-801 of low-metastatic 95C and high-metastatic 95D cell lines.  Biological replicates:1. Five replicate per array.
