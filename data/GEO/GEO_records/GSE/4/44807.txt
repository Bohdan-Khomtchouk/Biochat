TITLE
Gene expression data from primary human bronchial epithelial cells expressing EGFP or DN-GRHL2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The airways of the human lung are lined by an epithelium made up of ciliated and secretory luminal cells and undifferentiated p63+ Krt5+ progenitors. The integrity of this epithelium and its ability to act as a selective barrier are critical for normal lung function. In other epithelia there is evidence that transcription factors of the evolutionarily conserved grainyheadlike (GRHL) family play key roles in co-ordinating the expression of numerous proteins required for epithelial morphogenesis, differentiation, remodeling and repair. However, little is known about their function in the adult lung. We used Affymetrix microarray analysis to compare transcripts in lentivirus transfected primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressing either EGFP or DN-GRHL2 to help identify GRHL2 target genes and their functions in HBE cells.

DESIGN
Primary HBE cells from three donors were infected with modified TripZ lentivirus designed to express EGFP or DN-GRHL2 in response to Dox. Dox was added to cells cultured at the air-liquid interface from day 7 to 14.
