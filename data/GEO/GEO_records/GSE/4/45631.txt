TITLE
Study of extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) responses of human HaCaT keratinocytes: Control vs. ELF-EMF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Use DNA microarray technology to discover transciprtional insights of HaCaT for continuous exposure to ELF-EMF

DESIGN
We used a loop design in this study (details in the 'loop_design.tiff' supplementary file), cDNA microarray experiment consisted of ten RNA samples, including ELF-EMF exposed, UVB irradiated (positive control), and sham exposed samples.
