TITLE
Gene expression data from C.elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Numerous studies have shown that resistance to oxidative stress is crucial to stay healthy and to reduce the adverse effects of aging. Accordingly, nutritional interventions using antioxidant food-grade compounds or food products are currently an interesting option to help improve health and quality of life in the elderly. Live lactic acid bacteria (LAB) administered in food, such as probiotics, may be good antioxidant candidates. Nevertheless, information about LAB-induced oxidative stress protection is scarce. To identify and characterize new potential antioxidant probiotic strains, we have developed a new functional screening method using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as host. C. elegans were fed on different LAB strains (78 in total) and nematode viability was assessed after oxidative stress (3mM and 5mM H2O2). One strain, identified as Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690, protected worms by increasing their viability by 30% and, also, increased average worm lifespan by 20%. We performed a transcriptomic analysis of C. elegans fed with this strain and showed that increased lifespan is correlated with differential expression of the DAF-16/insulin-like pathway, which is highly conserved in humans.

DESIGN
Gene expression in C. elegans wild-type strain (N2) was analyzed in worm populations fed with E. coli OP50 (control condition) or the corresponding LAB (Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 or Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-4317) . Three days and ten days feeding period was analyzed.
