TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Enterococcus faecalis OG1 delta-EF2638 mutant

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF

SUMMARY
Analysis of changes in gene expression in Enterococcus faecalis OG1 delta-EF2638 mutant compared to wild-type OG1 strain. The deletion mutant has a growth defect when grown with aeration The mutant presented in this study is described and characterized in Vesic, D. and Kristich, C.J. 2012. A Rex-family transcriptional repressor influnces H2O2 accumulation by Enterococcus faecalis. (submitted for publication)

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was done using RNA isolated from two independent cultures of wild-type Enterococcus faecalis OG1 and two independent cultres of Enterococcus faecalis OG1 delta-EF2638 mutant; each RNA sample was subjected to triplicate hybridization (technical replicates) . Microarrays were custom designed to investigate expression of ORFs in Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF genome. The arrays were designed based on the OG1RF annotation generated with the Rapid Annotation Using Subsystem Technology (RAST) server (Aziz et. al. 2008. BMC Genomics 9:75), as described in Frank et al (2012) Infect. Immun. 80:539.  The aim was eighteen probe pairs per ORF, each of which is present in triplicate.
