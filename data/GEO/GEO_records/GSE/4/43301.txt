TITLE
IM005 - Mouse infection with PB2-627E: A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG2/2004 (H5N1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the host response (C57BL/6 mouse model) to the PB2-627E: A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG2/2004 (H5N1) virus at 10^4 PFU.

DESIGN
Groups of 20-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were infected with the PB2-627E: A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG2/2004 (H5N1) virus at 10^4 PFU or time-matched mock infected. Time points were 1, 2, 4 and 7 d.p.i. There were 5 mice/time point for infections and 3 mice/time point for time-matched mocks. Lung samples were collected for virus load, transcriptional analysis and proteomics analysis. Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.
