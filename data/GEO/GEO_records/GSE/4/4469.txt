TITLE
Genome and transcriptome divergence in Bacillus subtilis after 6,000 generations of evolution

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Ten populations were evolved for 6,000 generations. Five had strong selection for sporulation, imposed partially by their cultivation in sporulation-inducing medium, while the other five populations had relaxed selection for sporulation, by cultivating them in sporulation-repressing medium.  Batch cultures were diluted 1:100 daily for approximately 892 days. In the five populations with relaxed selection for sporulation, sporulation ability was eventually lost. Keywords: comparative genome hybridization and transcriptome divergence
