TITLE
Transcriptional and post-transcriptional analysis of CD4+ T cell clones deriving from HTLV-1 infected individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T-cell clones were obtained by limiting dilution culture of PBMC of HTLV-1 carriers. Exon expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix exon array (Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

DESIGN
The main objectives were to assess whether transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications associate with HTLV-1 infection in vivo. To this end, T-cell clones, infected or not by HTLV-1, were obtained by limiting dilution culture of PBMC derived from HTLV-1 carriers. Exon expression profiles of cloned T cells was analyzed using Affymetrix exon array (Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
