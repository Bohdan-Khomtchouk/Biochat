TITLE
Gene expression data from CD11b-positive myeloid cells infiltrating tumors after local irradiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of global gene expression in myeloid cells infiltrating tumors after irradiation. Cell death induces recruitment of myeloid cells into irradiated tumors thereby stimulating tumor recurrence. Results provide insights into molecular mechanisms regulating tumorigenic functions of myeloid cells in tumors re-growing after radiation therapy.

DESIGN
Samples were collected at day 4 from irradiated tumors in WT, TLR9KO and Stat3KO (MxCre/Stat3flox). There were total 11 samples with Â 3-4 replicates of each sample type.
