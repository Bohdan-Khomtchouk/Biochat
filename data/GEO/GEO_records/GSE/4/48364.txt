TITLE
Transcriptional profiles by deep sequencing (RNA-seq) of in vivo-generated mouse iPSCs, in vitro-generated mouse iPSCs, and mouse ESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have generated “reprogrammable” transgenic mice that ubiquitously express the four Yamanaka factors in an inducible manner. Transitory induction of the transgene results in multiple teratomas emerging from a variety of organs, thus indicating that full reprogramming into iPSCs can occur in vivo. By performing bone marrow transplant experiments, we demonstrate that both hematopoietic cells, as well as non-hematopoietic cells can be reprogrammed in vivo. Remarkably, reprogrammable mice also present circulating iPSCs in the bloodstream (in vivo-iPSCs) with all the expected properties of bona fide iPSCs. Moreover, in contrast to in vitro-iPSCs or embryonic stem cells (ESCs), in vivo-iPSCs have an increased capacity to undergo trophectoderm lineage differentiation, which suggests that in vivo-iPSCs are more plastic or primitive than in vitro-generated iPSCs or ESCs.

DESIGN
6 clones of in vivo-generated iPSCs, 5 indendent clones of in vitro-generated iPSCs, and 3 clones of established ESCs
