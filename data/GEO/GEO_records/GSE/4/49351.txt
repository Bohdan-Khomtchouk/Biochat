TITLE
Microarray gene expression profiling of transgenic mice with myocardium-specific over-expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The fatty acid synthase (FASN) is the major fat synthesizing enzyme. FASN is an indispensable enzyme because mice with genetic deletion of Fasn are not viable. Apart from its physiological function, previous studies indicated that FASN could also exert a pathophysiological role, in the heart, because patients with heart failure showed up-reguation of FASN. To investigate the in vivo function of FASN up-regulation in the heart, we generated mice with myocardium-specific expression of FASN under control of the alpha-MHC promoter. Two different founder lines were generated with high and low FASN over-expression. Microarray gene expression profiling of heart tissue was performed of heart tissue from transgenic mice with high and low FASN expression

DESIGN
Microarray gene expression profiling was performed with heart tissue isolated from three study groups: (i) Transgenic mice with high cardiac FASN expression, (ii) transgenic mice with low cardiac FASN expression, and (iii) B6 control mice.
