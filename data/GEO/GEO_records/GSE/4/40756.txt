TITLE
Transgenic Eµ-myc mouse lymphoma expression data for training dataset

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used gene expression data from Eµ-myc mouse lymphomas to perform unsupervised analyses that identified two lymphoma subgroups. We also used this data to develop a genomic signature to classify new lymphomas.

DESIGN
When Eµ-myc mice had evidence of lymphoma and/or ill appearance, they were humanely sacrificed and dissected.  Lymphoma tissue was obtained and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Later, lymphoma tissue was homogenized, and RNA was extracted.  Gene expression microarrays were performed with the isolated RNA.
