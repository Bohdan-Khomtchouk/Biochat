TITLE
Exon Level Expression Profiling: Induced adult neurogenesis  in the olfactory epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of RNA samples from mice olfactory epithelium Gene expression profiling in the olfactory epithelium was performed to obtain a better understanding of the processes mediating cell replacement.

DESIGN
We analyzed epitheliual tissue from 3 adult male mice  at 5 days following ipsilateral olfactory bulbectomy (OBX). Total RNA was isolated and anlayzed  using the Affymetrix  Mouse Exon 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool.
