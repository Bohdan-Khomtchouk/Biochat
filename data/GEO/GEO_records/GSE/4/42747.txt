TITLE
A roadmap of cell-type specific gene expression during late stages of the arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) interactions between plants and Glomeromycota fungi primarily support phosphate aquisition of most terrestrial plant species. To unravel cell-type specific gene expression during late stages of Medicago truncatula root colonization by AM fungi, we used genome-wide transcriptome profiling based on laser-microdissected cells. We used Medicago GeneChips to detail the cell-type specific programme of gene expression in late stages of colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and identified genes differentially expressed during these stages.
