TITLE
Expression analysis of LM8 osteosarcoma cells overexpressing human Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain Protein-4 (PHD4) and LM8 control cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PHD4 regulates the expression of Hypxia-inducible Factor 2 (HIF-2) alpha in LM8 osteosarcoma cells. PHD4 overexpression inhibits the growth of experimental tumor in syngenic mice but stimulates angiogenesis via Transforming Growth-Factor (TGF)-alpha. We used microarrays to investigate the gene expression of stable LM8 cell line overexpressing human PHD4 in comparison to the LM8 control line, transfected with the empty vector.

DESIGN
RNA was prepared from cultured cells and used for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
