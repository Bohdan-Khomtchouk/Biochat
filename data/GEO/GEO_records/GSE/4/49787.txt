TITLE
Expression data of leukemia samples taken from transgenic ERG mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Ets transcription factor, ERG, plays a central role in definitive hematopoiesis and its overexpression in acute myeloid leukemia is associated with a stem cell signature and bad prognosis. However, little is known about the underlying mechanism by which ERG causes leukemia. Therefore we sought to identify ERG targets that participate in development of leukemia by integration of expression arrays and Chromatin immunoprecipitation.

DESIGN
Bone marrow was collected from three transgenic ERG mice harboring a myeloid leukemia and twelve wild type mice. Nine wild type bone marrow samples were lineage depleted and pooled into 3 samples (each one consisting of three lineage negative wild type bone marrows). The resulting 9 samples were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on affymetrix microarrays.
