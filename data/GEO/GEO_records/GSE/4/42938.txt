TITLE
Abrupt scrib- vs. Abrupt and RasV12 (RasACT) scrib-, NotchICD (NACT) scrib- +/- JNK (Bsk) expression profiles

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila mosaic eye-antennal discs from the listed genotypes generated using the MARCM system were dissected from 3rd instar larvae at day 5 after egg deposition. 20 pairs of discs for the Abrupt and scrib- + Abrupt samples and 50 pairs from FRT control, NACT scrib- +/- BskDN and RasACT scrib- +/- BskDN were used to prepare RNA. Samples were prepared in triplicate, and the RNA isolated using TRIZOL, before being column purified (Qiagen). Probes were hybridized to GeneChip Drosophila 2.0 Genome Arrays (Affymetrix).

DESIGN
To compare the expression profile of Abrupt when overexpressed in the eye-antennal discs with tumours formed by Abrupt overexpression in scrib- clones, and to reveal JNK responsive genes in RasV12 (RasACT) scrib- versus NotchICD (NACT) scrib- eye-antennal mosaic discs
