TITLE
Progesterone receptor ChIP-seq within the mouse mammary gland

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Progesterone (P) acting through its cognate nuclear receptors (PRs) plays an essential role in driving pregnancy-associated branching morphogenesis of the mammary gland. However, the fundamental mechanisms, including global cistromic and acute genomic transcriptional responses that are required to elicit active branching morphogenesis in response to P, have not been elucidated. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify P-regulated genes that directly recruit PRs in the mouse mammary gland after acute P treatment.

DESIGN
Two replicate PR ChIP samples and two replicate input DNA control samples from mouse mammary glands after mice are treated subcutaneously with 17β-Estradiol for 24 hours and then 17β-Estradiol plus Progesterone for 6 hours.
