TITLE
Imprinting of the Y chromosome depending on parent of origin provides insight into chromatin-modulating mechanisms underlying the Y chromosome's ability to affect gene expression diversity

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
These arrays were done in a study to probe Y-by-parent-of-origin effects on gene expression across two geographically diverse (Ohio, USA and Republic of Congo, Africa) Y-chromosome lineages (Cs or Con), and two modes of Y chromosome transmission (paternally or maternally).

DESIGN
Males harbor one of two Y chromosomes extracted from natural populations. Y chromosomes are inherited maternally or paternally. Therefore, 4 nodes in the design matrix. Each node was competitively hybridized to each of the other three nodes in 2 dual-channel arrays, dye-swapped.
