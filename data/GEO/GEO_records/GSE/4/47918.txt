TITLE
Effect of floT and floA mutations on the global transcriptome of Bacillus subtilis NCIB3610

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
To compare the altered transcript levels in the floT, floA single and floTfloA double mutants of Bacillus subtilis, cells were grown in MSgg medium until the late exponential phase and their transcriptome was compared to the wild type, NCIB3610 strain.

DESIGN
Bacillus subtilis NCIB3610 wild type and its floT, floA, and floTfloA mutants strain were grown in MSgg medium and cells were harvested at late exponential (OD600 ~1.0-1,2) phase. 3 biological replicates were used, resulting 3 slides for each mutant strain. Dye swaps are included in both experiments.
