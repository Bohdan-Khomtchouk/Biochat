TITLE
Effect of selection on residual feed intake on gene expression in porcine skeletal muscle (115 kg body weight)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling in liver of 24 pigs of 115 kg body weight from lines divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI): low-RFI pigs fed ad libitum (RFIneg), high-RFI pigs fed ad libitum (RFIpl) and high-RFI pigs restricted at RFIneg feeding level (RFIplR) to investigate the impact of feeding independently of selection.

DESIGN
Three experimental conditions: low-RFI (RFIneg), high-RFI (RFIpl) and restricted high-RFI (RFIplR). 8 pigs per condition except for RFIneg (7 pigs). One replicate per array.
