TITLE
Gene expression in human healthy control and ISCU myopathy patient muscle biopsies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microarray analysis on ISCU myopathy patient muscle biopsies to identify transcriptional modulation of pathways involved in the cellular response to Fe-S cluster deficiency.

DESIGN
We included RNA samples from five healthy control individuals as well as three different ISCU myopathy patients.
