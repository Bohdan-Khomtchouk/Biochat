TITLE
Saturated fatty acids induced genes and ISR target genes in pancreatic beta cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the genes induced by lipotoxicity and integrated stress response in pancreatic beta cells, we have employed whole genome microarray expression in panvreatic beta cell line MIN6m9 cells.

DESIGN
First microarray analysis : Wild type MIN6m9 cells were treated with Palmitate, Oleate or negative control condition. Second microarray analysis : Wild type and Fv2E-PERK transgened MIN6m9 cells were treated with mock or artificial dimerizer AP20187(AP) in various time course.
