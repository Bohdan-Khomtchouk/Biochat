TITLE
Cytokines dominate the secretome of primary human myotubes in an in vitro exercise model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Muscle contraction during exercise is the major stimulus for the release of peptides and proteins (myokines) that are supposed to take part in the benefical adaptation to exercise. We hypothesize that application of an in vitro exercise stimulus as electric pulse stimulation (EPS) to human myotubes enables the investigation of the human muscle secretome in a clearly defined model. We applied EPS for 24 h to primary human myotubes and studied the whole genome-wide transcriptional response and as well as the release of candidate myokines. We observed 183 differentially regulated transcripts with fold-changes > 1.3. The transcriptional response resembles several properties of the in vivo situation in the skeletal muscle after endurance exercise, namely significant enrichment of pathways associated with interleukin and chemokine signaling, lipid metabolism, and anti-oxidant defense; notably without increased release of creatin kinase. Multiplex immunoassays verified the translation of the transcriptional response of several myokines into high secretion levels (IL6, IL8, CXCL1, LIF, CSF3, IL1B, TNF) and identified an increased secretion of additional cytokines (IL2, IL4, IL13, IL17A). Inhibitor studies and immunoblotting revealed the participation of ERK1/2 and AMPK dependent pathways in the upregulation of myokines. To conclude our data highlight the importance of skeletal muscle cells per se as endocrine cells. This in vitro exercise model is not only suitable to identify known and novel exercise-regulated myokines but it might be applied to primary human myotubes obtained from different muscle biopsy donors to study molecular mechanisms of the individual response to exercise.

DESIGN
We performed gene expression microarray analysis of myotubes in vitro stimulated by EPS and control myotubes
