TITLE
Gene expression in DN4 thymocytes from mice with an inducible deletion of Ikaros

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment was to visualize genes under the control of Ikaros during early T cell development. We used mice carrying floxed Ikaros alleles that were crossed with the Rosa26-CreERT2 mice, and which were injected with tamoxifen for 4 days. DN4 thymocytes were sorted from 4 mice (5-6 week-old) which are positive or not for the Rosa26-CreERT2 transgene.

DESIGN
DN4 cells were sorted from 2 Ikf/f Rosa26-CreERT2+ mice and 2 Ikf/f mice, which were all treated with tamoxifen for 4 days. Loss of Ikaros was confirmed in sorted cells from the Ikf/f Rosa26-CreERT2+ mice by western blot. Gene expression profiles were determined on total RNA from sorted cells with Affymetrix Mouse Gene arrays.
