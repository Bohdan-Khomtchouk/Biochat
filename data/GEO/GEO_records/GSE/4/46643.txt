TITLE
Profiling of lncRNA expression in human monocytic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By employing ArrayStar Human LncRNA Array V2.0, we have identified ï½ž1100 differentially expressed lncRNAs (with > 2-fold change) in LPS-treated THP-1 cells.

DESIGN
To know the differential expression of lncRNA in LPS-treated human THP-1 cells.
