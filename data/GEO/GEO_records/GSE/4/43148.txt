TITLE
Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs): Control vs. PTH-stimulated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human MSCs comparing control MSCs with parathyroid hormone (PTH)-stimulated MSCs. PTH-stimulated MSCs were treated with 0.1 nM recombinant human PTH (N-terminal fragment, amino acids 1-34) for 48 hours. Human MSCs were isolated from a bone marrow sample obtained from a healthy adult volunteer.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: control MSCs vs. PTH-stimulated MSCs. 1 control MSCs and 1 PTH-stimulated MSCs.
