TITLE
Genome-wide miRNA turnover profile in various cell types after transcription inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We measured miRNA turnover rates in 8 mammalian cell types post transcription inhibitors ActinomycinD (ActD) or 5,6-Dichlorobenzimidazole 1-Î²-D-ribofuranoside (DRB) treatment with miRNA expression profiling, generating 218 expression profiles on 528 endogenous miRNAs.
