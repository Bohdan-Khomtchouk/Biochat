TITLE
Effects of bacterium Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) induce positive effects in plants, such as increased growth or reduced stress susceptibility. The mechanisms behind PGPR/plant interaction are poorly understood, as most studies have described short- term responses on plants and only a few studies have analyzed plant molecular responses under PGPR colonization. Transcriptional profiles were determined by microarray analysis (Affymetrix ATH1 Genome Array) in Arabidopsis thaliana plants inoculated with the PGPR bacterial model Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN

DESIGN
Arabidopsis seeds were sown on square Petri dishes with half strength Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) 0.8% agar, and inoculated or not (control) with strain PsJN. To assess the effect of inactivated bacteria, an inoculum was heated at 95Â°C for 20 min and then was used at the same dilution.Three biological replicates, consisting of ten plantlets of 13 days after sowing (DAS) each, for control and strain PsJN treatments, were used for global gene expression.
