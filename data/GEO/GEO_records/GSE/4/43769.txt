TITLE
Expression data from human Th1 and Th2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T-helper cells differentiate from naïve precursors into multiple lineages, including Th1, Th2, Th17 and inducible Treg, in humans and mice. The identification of each lineage is currently determined by examination of a small number of genes encoding hallmark cytokines and/or transcription factors in both species To gain a better understanding of human T-helper cell function we have performed detailed transcriptional profiling of highly polarized Th1 and Th2 cells in both resting and activated states examining gene and miRNA expression

DESIGN
Naïve CD4 positive T-cells were isolated from peripheral blood of three different human donors. Cells were differenitated into Th1 and Th2 cells in vitro for 28 days to achieve homogeneous cell lineages. Samples were taken at resting state or activated for 4 hours with PMA/Ionomycin.
