TITLE
Longitudinal expression data from CD4+ T cells responding to LCMV-Armstrong or LCMV-Clone 13

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During acute viral infections, na√Øve CD4+ T cells differentiate into effector CD4+ T cells and, after viral control, into memory CD4+ T cells. Memory CD4+ T cells are highly functional, proliferate rapidly upon reinfection and persist long-term without antigen. In contrast, during chronic infections, CD4+ T cells become less functional. To compare the development of functional memory T cells with poorly functional T cells from chronic viral infection, we generated longitudinal transcriptional profiles for each.

DESIGN
Naive CD44Lo CD4+ T cells were isolated and sorted from uninfected C57BL/6 mice and H2-IAb GP66-specific CD4+ T cells were sorted using MHC-II tetramers at d6, 8, 15, and 30 p.i. with either LCMV Arm or LCMV clone 13. RNA from these CD4+ T cells was processed, amplified, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip MoGene 1.0 st microarrays.
