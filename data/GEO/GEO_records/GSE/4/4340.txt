TITLE
Establishing a functional response of cardiomyocytes upon prorenin stimulation.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes have been used to study the effect of (pro-) renin binding upon intracellular messenger systems, hypothesized via IGF2/mannoste 6 phosphate (M6P) -receptors and/or ATP6AP2/(pro)renin receptors, opposed to kidney cells. We have used DNA microarray technology to characterize and compare the expression of over 4800 genes in these cells. Gene expression differences were verified using RT-PCR and indicate the presence of cellular activation upon prorenin bindng, non-overlapping with AT-receptor activation. Exploration and follow-up will lead to further characterization of these pathways. Keywords: loop design
