TITLE
Structural basis of a novel Interferon b signaling axis mediated via the ifnar1 receptor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Type I interferons (IFNs) are a family of cytokines that play an important role in regulating immune responses to pathogens and tumors and are used therapeutically.  All IFNs are considered to signal via the heterodimeric IFNAR1-IFNAR2 complex, yet some subtypes such as IFN? can exhibit distinct functional properties, although the molecular basis of this is unclear.  Here we demonstrate IFN  uniquely and specifically ligates to IFNAR1 in an IFNAR2-independent manner and provide the structural basis of the IFNAR1-IFN  interaction. We show that the IFNAR1-IFN  complex transduces signals to modulate the expression of a set of genes independently of IFNAR2.  Moreover, we show the in vivo importance of the IFNAR1-IFN  signaling axis in a murine model of LPS-induced septic shock. Thus, we provide a molecular basis for understanding specific functions of IFN?.

DESIGN
Interferon b induced gene expression in peritoneal exudate cells was measured 3hr post intra-peritoneal injection of 10,000IU/ml of interferon beta or saline into wildtype and Ifnar2-/- mice.  Three independant experiments were performed for each treatment in both genotypes using different mice for each sample.
