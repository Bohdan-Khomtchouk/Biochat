TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between wild type and FUL1/2 knockdown tomato fruits

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression by microarray analysis between wild type and transgenic sibling progeny from two primary transgenic lines containing a construct for knocking down expression of both tomato fruitfull orthologs, FUL1/TDR4 and FUL2/MBP7.

DESIGN
2 replicate samples each were taken from wild type progeny of primary transformed line 1-10, transgenic progeny of line 1-10, wild type progeny of transformed line 1-30, and transgenic progeny of line 1-30.
