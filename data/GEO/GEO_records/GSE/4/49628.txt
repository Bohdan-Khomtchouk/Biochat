TITLE
Large-scale hypomethylated blocks associated with Epstein-Barr virus-induced B-cell immortalization [Expression Array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine what DNA methylation and gene expression changes occur following EBV transformation. B-cells were isolated from 3 donors.  Resting, CD40 activated and EBV transfromed cells from each donor was analyzed. Each sample was assayed using Affymetrix expression arrays and whole genome bisulfite sequenicng.  Additional time points during transformation and activation were sequenced as well, but not assayed for expression.

DESIGN
B-cells were isolated from 3 donors.  Resting, CD40 activated and EBV transfromed cells from each donor was analyzed.
