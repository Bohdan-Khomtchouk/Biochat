TITLE
Fundic mucosa gene expression in the presence/absence of gastrin and in gastrin-CCK double knockout mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fundic mucosa gene expression in wildtype vs gastrin knockout, gastrin replaced gastrin KO and gastrin-CCK double knockout mice Fundic mucosal scraping RNA were isolated from WT, Gastrin Knockout, Gastrin replaced KO and Gastrin-CCK double knockout mice.  Targets from three biological replicates of each were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix murine 430A arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes with gastrin responsiveness and Gastrin-CCK double effect . Keywords: repeat
