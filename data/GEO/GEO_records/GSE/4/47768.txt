TITLE
Effect of selection on residual feed intake on gene expression in pig skeletal muscle (20 kg body weight)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling in skeletal muscle of 15 pigs of 20 kg body weight from lines divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI): low-RFI pigs (RFIneg), high-RFI pigs (RFIpl) .

DESIGN
Two conditions experiment: low-RFI (RFIneg), high-RFI (RFIpl) . 7 pigs in RFIneg stain and 8 pigs in RFIpl stain . One replicate per array.
