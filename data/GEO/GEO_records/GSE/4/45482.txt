TITLE
Genes affected by PAD4 deficiency in LSK cells obtained from mouse bone marrow.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found PAD4, which is one of the transcriptional co-regulator by histone modification, was highly expressed in lineage-, Sca-1+, c-kit+ (termed as LSK) cells of mouse bone marrow. To find the target genes which are regulated by PAD4 in LSK cells, we analyzed gene expression in PAD4-deficient mouse as compared with wild-type mouse.

DESIGN
Gene expression in wild-type and PAD4-deficient LSK cells
