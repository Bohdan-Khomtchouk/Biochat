TITLE
Expression data from glioblastoma stem cell clones (GSC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of treatment sensitive GSC clones (TSGC) with treatment resistant GSC clones (TRGC). We used microarrays to identify molecular signatures of TRGC (upregulated genes).

DESIGN
We used radiation treatment (RT) or RT plus TMZ to select treatment resistant GSC clones (TRGC)
