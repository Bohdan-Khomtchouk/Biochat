TITLE
Regional Differences in gene expression and promoter usage in aged human brains

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) and massive parallel sequencing were used to profile the promoterome of aged human brains from five regions, namely: caudate, frontal cortex, hippocampus, putamen and temporal cortex.

DESIGN
25 RNA  libraries from post-mortem brain tissue (five caudate, five frontal, 5 hippocampus, 5 putamen, five temporal RNA libraries from seven individuals) were processed using CAGE protocol and CAGE tags derived from the 25 libraries were sequenced with Illumina.
