TITLE
Gene expression induced by Nanosecond pulsed electric fields

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We use a human whole genome microarray to analyze the effects of nanosecond pulsed electric fields on Jurkat cells with the focus on early response genes to DNA damage. Keywords: nanosecond pulsed electric fields, jurkat cells, DNA damage
