TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of a gut epithelial cell line after the depletion of selenoprotein Glutathione peroxidase 4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GPx4 is an important antioxidant gene that is derived from selenium. A ploymorphism in GPx4 has been associated with increased risk of colorectal and prostate cancer. This experiment decsribes the effect of change in GPx4 expression in human intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco-2).Depletion of GPx4 expression led to changes in mitochondrial pathways including oxidative phosphorylation and ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway and genes involved in apoptosis regulation

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from Caco-2 cells following treatment for 72hrs with GPx4 specific siRNA, or a scrambled siRNA control at 60 and 120pmol concentrations.
