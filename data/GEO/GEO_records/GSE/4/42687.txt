TITLE
Genes array from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) with knockdown EZH2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EZH2 plays an important role in stem cell renewal and maintenance by inducing gene silencing via its histone methyltransferase activity. EZH2 downregulation markedly enhances neuron differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs)chromatin at promoters of EZH2 target genes.

DESIGN
comparison of knockdown EZH2 of hMSCs vs hMSCs
