TITLE
Development of distinct gene expression signature in neurons from different regions of the brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have performed microarray expression profiling of mouse primary neurons (cortical neurons and granule cell neurons) to model molecular networks and define whether distinct antiviral IFN responses occurred in neurons corresponding to different brain regions.

DESIGN
Primary mouse cortical neurons and granule cell neurons were left untreated, treated with 100IU/mL of IFN-Î², or infected with West Nile virus (MOI of 1) and RNA was harvested after 24 hours. Three independent experiments were performed using a balanced design.
