TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of NPC_astrocytes and Olig2PC_astrocytes  gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the differences between NPC derived astrocytes and Olig2PC derived astrocytes at gene expression level. Olig2PC-Astros show differences in functions and gene expression profiles from NPC-Astros in vitro, providing clues of superior neuroprotection effect of Olig2PC-astrocytes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from cultured NPC_astrocytes and Olig2PC_astrocytes. One hundred ng total RNA was used for amplification and hybridization to Illumina Human HT12_V4 chip according to the Manufacturer's instructions (Illumina). Array data were processed using Illumina GenomeStudio software (Illumina). Background was subtracted and arrays were normalized using quantile. Gene expression levels were considered significant only when their detection p-value â‰¤0.01.
