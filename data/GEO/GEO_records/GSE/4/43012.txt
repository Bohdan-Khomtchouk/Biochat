TITLE
Gene expression profile upon IL-22 stimulation, forced expression of Hes1, or IL-22 stimulation under forced expression of Hes1, in human colon carcinoma-derived LS174T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A human colon carcinoma-derived cell line LS174T was modified to overexpress Hes1, a bHLH-type transcription factor, upon doxycycline addition (designated as LS174T-tetON-Hes1 cells), using the T-rex system (Invitrogen). We have previously shown that these cells can overexpress Hes1 under the control of CMV promoter (Zheng et al, Inflamm Bowel Dis, 17;2251-2260, 2011), and the amont of the overexpressed Hes1 protein reaches to the maximal level in early as 3 hours from doxycycline addition (100ng/ml), which persists for up to 24 hours. In the present experiment,  LS174T-tetON-Hes1 cells were treated with recombinant human IL-22 (20ng/ml) alone, doxycycline alone (100ng/ml), co-treated by both IL-22 and doxycycline, or left untreated (Control) for 24 hours, and subjected for analysis. Experiment was done using a modified sub-line of LS174T cell (LS174T-tetON-Hes1 cells), in which overexpression of Hes1 can be induced by a Doxycycline dependent manner.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment, Control vs. IL-22 stimulation, Control vs Doxycycline addition (Hes1 overexpression) and Control vs IL22 stimulation+Doxycycline addition  (Hes1 overexpression). Biological replicates: One for each condition, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
