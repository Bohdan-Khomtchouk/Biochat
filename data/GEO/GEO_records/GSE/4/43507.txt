TITLE
Genome-level Cell Responses to Digital Microfluidic Manipulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of mammalian cell responses to digital microfluidic manipulation. BA/F3 cells were manipulated on devices with 15 min continuous actuation at 400Vpp at 1 kHz or 18 kHz and compared to untreated control cells and cells heat shocked at 42C, 47C or 52C.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from Ba/F3 murine cells, untreated or exposed to digital microfludic manipulation or heat shock.
