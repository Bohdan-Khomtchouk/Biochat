TITLE
B cell-intrinsic STAT6 controls the germinal center response in type 2 immunity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By investigating the germinal center (GC) formation in STAT6ko/WT bone marrow-mixed chimera we found that GC formation in type 2 immune responses is dependent on B cell intrinsic expression of IL-4/IL-13-induced genes. We therefore used microarrays to find Stat6 dependent genes that are important for germinal center formation and/or organization after infection with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (N. brasiliensis).

DESIGN
Bone marrow of STAT6ko (CD45.2+) and WT (CD45.1+) were mixed and injected in lethaly irradiated WT (CD45.1+) mice. After 8 weeks, 5 Bone marrow-mixed chimera were infected with N. brasiliensis and draining lymph nodes were collected at day 14 after the infection and pooled. RNA was isolated from sort-purified CD45.1+ or CD45.2+ GC B cells (B220+CD38loGL-7hi).
