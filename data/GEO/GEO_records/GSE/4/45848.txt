TITLE
Gene expressioin signatures at basal level in human lymphoblastoid cell lines with different ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) genotypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human lymphoblastoid cell lines  with different ATM genotypes at basal level was compared to extract gene expression signatures that can identify ataxia telangiectasia (AT) carries from non AT carries and AT patients.

DESIGN
Biological replicates: 4;  Technical replicates: 2 with C3 and C5 dye swap.
