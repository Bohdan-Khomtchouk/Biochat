TITLE
Effect of ArhGAP30 on the gene expression profile of colorectal cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to determine the effect of ArhGAP30 on the gene expression profile of colorectal cancer cells, Lovo cells were infected with either ArhGAP30 or the control pcDNA3.1 empty vector. The differentially expressed genes caused by ArhGAP30 ectopic expression suggests the underlying mechanism for ArhGAP30-induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.

DESIGN
Total RNA from each sample was collected, amplified, labeled, and applied to Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2 arrays.
