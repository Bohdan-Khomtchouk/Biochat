TITLE
Absolute and induction TNF tolerance in primary human monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The molecular basis of TNF tolerance is poorly understood. In this experiment, primary human monocytes were used to examine TNF refractoriness. We detect absolute tolerance as  selective, dose-dependently affecting a small group of powerful effector molecules; induction tolerance represented a more general phenomenon.

DESIGN
Primary human monocytes were incubated for 48 h with Medium or different TNF-doses and subsequently short-term stimulated for two hours with TNF. Total RNA was prepared and analysed by use of Agilent microarrays. 6 different conditions were analyzed in total, corresponding to cells that were: 1) medium incubated (M+M), 2) medium incubated and short time TNF (400 U/ml) incubated (M+T), 3) low dose TNF (40 U/ml) preincubated (40+M), 4) low dose TNF preincubated and short time TNF incubated (40+T), 5) high dose TNF (400 U/ml) preincubated (400+M), 6) high dose TNF preincubated and short time TNF incubated (400+T). 3 biological replicates (corresponding to three different healthy donors) were analyzed regarding high-dose tolerance conditions (preincubation with 400 U TNF/ml), one of which was analyzed in duplicates (including cell culture, RNA preparation and a dye-swap microarray approach). 2 biological replicates (corresponding to two different healthy donors) were analyzed under low-dose tolerance conditions (preincubation with 40 U/ml). The different human donors were numbered and indicated in brackets (d1-d5).
