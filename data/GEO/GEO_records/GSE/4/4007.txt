TITLE
PLA2G2A and human gastric cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed gene expression patterns in human gastric cancers by using cDNA microarrays representing approximately 30,300 genes. Expression of PLA2G2A, a gene previously implicated as a modifier of the Apc(Min/+) (multiple intestinal neoplasia 1) mutant phenotype in the mouse, was significantly correlated with patient survival. We confirmed this observation in an independent set of patient samples by using quantitative RT-PCR. Beyond its potential diagnostic and prognostic significance, this result suggests the intriguing possibility that the activity of PLA2G2A may suppress progression or metastasis of human gastric cancer. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
