TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of T84 colorectal carcinoma cells treated with receptor guanylyl cyclace C agonist (stable toxin)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Receptor guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) is expressed in the intestinal epithelia and plays a key role in intestinal physiology. Activation of GC-C by its ligands has been shown to regulate proliferation and differentiation of enterocytes along the crypt-villus axis. This study aims to identify genes regulated by GC-C activation and elevation of cGMP in colorectal carcinoma cells. This will help understand the molecular targets and biological pathways regulated by GC-C to bring about cancer cell cytostasis.
