TITLE
RNASET2-silenced and control OVCAR3 cell clones injected into nude mice.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the molecular pathways underlying RNASET2-mediated tumor suppression in vivo, we investigated the gene expression profile of tumor samples obtained from control and  RNASET2-silenced OVCAR3  xenografts,  respectively. In order to evaluate the contribution of human cancer cells and the murine host stroma to RNASET2-mediated tumorigenesis responses, total RNA extracted from tumor xenografts derived from six independent OVCAR3 cell clones (three parental and three RNASET2-silenced clones) was fluorescently labeled and hybridized to  human Agilent whole-genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Control and  RNASET2-silenced OVCAR3 were injected subcutaneously into  nude mice. After 39 days mice were sacrified, tumors were extracted and total RNA purified.
