TITLE
Transcriptional profile of AML xenografts treated with either PBS or a combination of decitabine and cytarabine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array was used to examine the Genome wide transcriptional changes which follow the treatment of AML xenografts with either PBS control or combination of decitabine (DAC) and cytarabine (Ara-C). Animals were treated with PBS, DAC alone, Ara-C alone, DAC and Ara-C combined (D+A), DAC followed by Ara-C (D/A) or Ara-C followed by DAC (A/D).

DESIGN
PBS vs each drug combination
