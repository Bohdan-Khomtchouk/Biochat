TITLE
pH and Anaerobiosis Coregulate Metabolism, Multidrug Transporters, and Envelope Composition in Escherichia coli K-12

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
In Escherichia coli, pH-dependent gene expression varies with oxygen level.  Anaerobic pH-dependent expression ratios were analyzed and compared to the published analysis of aerated cultures (Maurer et al, 2005).  E. coli K-12 strain W3110 was cultured in closed tubes containing LBK broth buffered at pH 5.7, pH 7.0, and pH 8.5.  Gene expression profiles were obtained by cDNA hybridization to Affymetrix arrays. pH-dependent expression was seen for 1,394 genes, of which 1,002 show no pH dependence under aeration.  Four intergenic regions containing regulatory sRNAs were up-regulated by acid anaerobically (ryeA, csrB, gadY, rybC) and one sRNA (ryhA) by acid with aeration.   Acid and anaerobiosis co-regulated the gad regulon; drug transporters (mdtEF, mdtL); catabolism of sugar derivatives whose fermentation minimized acid production; and all hydrogenases (hya, hyb, hyc, hyf, hyp).  The hydrogenases however were up-regulated at high pH under aeration (observed by real-time PCR).  Acid with anaerobiosis down-regulated penicillin-binding proteins (dacACD, mreBC) and ribosome biosynthesis.  Ribosome down-regulation may be caused by restriction of anaerobic metabolism at low pH.  A core group of 236 genes showed similar pH response with or without aeration.  Core genes up-regulated by acid included fimbriae (fimAC), periplasmic chaperones (hdeAB), cyclopropane fatty acid synthase (cfa), the “constitutive” Na+/H+ antiporter (nhaB), and over thirty unidentified proteins.    Core genes at high pH included maltodextrin transport (lamB, malEFGKMPQT), ATP synthase, and DNA repair (recA and mutL). Overall, pH and anaerobiosis co-regulated metabolism and transport so as to maximize alternative catabolic options while minimizing acidification or alkalinization of the cytoplasm.
