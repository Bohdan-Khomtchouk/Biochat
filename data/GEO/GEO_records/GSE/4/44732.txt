TITLE
Interleukin-27 is a potent inhibitor of cis HIV-1 replication in Monocyte-derived Dendritic Cells via a Type I Interferon-independent pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IL-27 treated DCs were shown to be highly potent inhibitors of cis HIV-1, particularly of CCR5 tropic strains. Microarray studies of IL-27 treated DCs showed no up-regulation of Type I (IFN) gene expression. Neutralization of the Type-I IFN receptor had no impact on the HIV inhibition. Lastly, IL-27 mediated inhibition was shown to act post-viral entry and prior to completion of reverse transcription. These results show for the first time that IL-27 is a potent inhibitor of cis HIV-1 infection in DCs by a Type I IFN independent mechanism.

DESIGN
Gene expression microarrays from 3 samples of immature dendritic cells (iDCs) were compared with 3 samples of iDCs treated with IL-27
