TITLE
Expression data from E. faecalis Fsr mutants during GBAP induction

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis

SUMMARY
To rigorously characterize the Fsr regulon, we compared gene expression in V583 isogenic mutants in Fsr genes and each of the Fsr-regulated protease genes using microarrays and purified GBAP, the quorum-sensing molecule. We used microarrays to identified the genes that are regulated directly by Fsr Quorum sensing system.
