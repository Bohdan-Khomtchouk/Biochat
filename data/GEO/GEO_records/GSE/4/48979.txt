TITLE
EZH2 Overexpression in Breast Cancer is due to MicroRNA-Dependent Suppression of ZBTB4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to Sp1 and EZH2-specific gene expression pattern in breast cancer, small interfering RNA for Sp1 and EZH2 was transfected in MDA-MB-231 cells.

DESIGN
Four groups of samples are included: 1. si control (siCT_1, siCT_2, siCT_3). 2. siSp1 (siSp1_1, sisSp1_2, siSp1_3). 3. si control (siCT_A, siCT_B, siCT_C). 4. siEZH2 (siZEH2_1, siZEH2_2,siEZJ2_3). Gene expression profiles of Sp1 and EZH2 depleted cells were compared to that of siRNA controls. Experiments were performed in MDA-MB-231 cells.
