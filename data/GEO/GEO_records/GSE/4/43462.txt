TITLE
BioTile Identification of Differentially Methylated Regions in Tiling Microarray Data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This submission includes simulated data generated to test the BioTile algorithm's capability of identifying differentially methylated regions (DMR) located within an actual tiling array dataset.

DESIGN
The data submitted was generated in silico to closely resemble DNA methylation profiles using Affymetrix Mouse Promoter 1.0R Tiling arrays. This simulated dataset of 40 arrays was generated using the " rnorm " function in R to create probe-wise distributions with the same mean and variance as our previously measured dataset (GSE43460).
