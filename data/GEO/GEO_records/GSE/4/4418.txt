TITLE
Expression data from cerivastatin-treated rat skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Adverse effects of statins include skeletal muscle toxicity; Type II glycolytic fibers are more senstive to statin damage; exercise exacerbates statin muscle degeneration. We used a well-characterized rat model of statin-induced muscle degeneration, at which 1.0 mg/kg/day (high dose) cerivastatin produces mild to moderate histological degeneration. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cerivastatin effects on rat gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, as well as the effect of cerivastatin combined with treadmill exercise. We identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: dose response; exercise effect
