TITLE
Expression data from Zea mays developmental series.

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Through hierarchical clustering of transcript abundance data across a diverse set of tissues and developmental stages in maize, we have identified a number of coexpression modules which describe the transcriptional circuits of maize development.

DESIGN
We examined transcript abundance data at 50 developmental stages/tissues of maize, from embryogenesis to senescence, using a custom Affymetrix Unigene array. The VE stage is germination and emergence Vn leaf stage refers to when the collar of the nth leaf is visible.
