TITLE
Molecular responses in skeletal muscles following spinal cord injury and the effect of locomotor training

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most disabling health problems facing adults today.  Locomotor training has been shown to induce substantial recovery in muscle size and muscle function in both transected and contusion injury animal models of SCI. The overall objective of this study is to implement genome wide expression profiling of skeletal muscle to define the molecular pathways associated with muscle remodeling after SCI and during locomotor training (TM).

DESIGN
We profiled rat soleus of total 36 samples including controls;  3, 8 and 14 days after SCI;  8 and 14 days after SCI with locomotor treadmill training (TM).
