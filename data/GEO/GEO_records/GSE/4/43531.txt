TITLE
Comparative expression profiling of miRNA during anther development in genetic male sterile and wild type cotton [small RNA]

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
Genetic male sterility (GMS) in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) plays an important role in the utilization of hybrid vigor. However, the molecular mechanism of the GMS is still unclear. While numerous studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNA) regulate flower and anther development, whether different small RNA regulations exist in GMS and its wild type is unclear. To investigate the global expression and complexity of small RNAs during cotton anther development, three small RNA libraries were constructed from the anthers of three development stages each from fertile wild type (WT) and its GMS mutant cotton.

DESIGN
Examination of  different miRNA profiles in 2 lines.
