TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in LIF and LIF plus 2I in C57BL/6 mouse embryonic stem cells (B6 mESCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of genes induced by 2I condition 2i contains glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors: 3uM Chir99021 and 1uM PD0325901

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from B6 mESCs treated with LIF or LIF/2I for 12 hours.
