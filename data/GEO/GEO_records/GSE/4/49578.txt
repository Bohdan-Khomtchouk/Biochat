TITLE
Screening of a heptamer-type sgRNA library for therapeutic agents against hematological malignancies.

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
tRNase ZL-utilizing efficacious gene silencing (TRUE gene silencing) is an RNA-mediated gene expression control technology that has therapeutic potential. This technology is based on the properties of tRNase ZL that it can cleave any target RNA at any desired site under the direction of an appropriate artificial small guide RNA (sgRNA) and that cytosolic tRNase ZL can modulate gene expression by cleaving mRNA under the direction of cellular 5â€²-half-tRNA or microRNA as sgRNA. In order to estimate a number of potential therapeutic heptamer-type sgRNAs for hematological malignancies, we constructed an sgRNA library composed of 156 heptamer-type sgRNAs, and examined how the sgRNAs affect viability of leukemia and myeloma cells. And we found that 20 of the 156 sgRNAs can efficiently induce apoptosis in at least one of the cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 4 of the 20 effective sgRNAs can reduce growth rates of HL60 cells in mouse xenograft models. DNA microarray analysis for changes in an mRNA profile by these four heptamer-type sgRNAs suggested at least one candidate target mRNA that contains a potential tRNase ZL target site for each sgRNA.

DESIGN
Changes in gene expression in HL60 cells were measured after 18-hour incubation in the absence or presence of one of five different heptamer-type sgRNAs. *Heptamer sequences requested but not provided by submitter
