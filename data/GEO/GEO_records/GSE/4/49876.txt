TITLE
Liver differentially expressed genes between microsomic and control inbred mice at birth

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the processes involved in the natural development of microsomic imbred mice, a whole genome microarray expression profiling of mouse liver was performed.

DESIGN
Total RNA of liver from C57BL/6J microsomic mice of both sexes were extracted and compared with total RNA of liver from normal (control) mice of both sexes.
