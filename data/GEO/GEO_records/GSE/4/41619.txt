TITLE
A Characterization of Osteoblastic and Osteolytic Proteins in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our goal was to determine whether previously identified and novel proteins are associated with the osteoblastic or osteolytic response in clinical specimens of PCa bone metastases.

DESIGN
Custom Agilent 44K whole human genome expression oligonucleotide microarrays were used to profile 14 PCa metastases from 11 patients with highly osteoblastic and highly osteolytic bone reactions.  Total RNA was isolated and amplified prior to hybridization against a common reference pool of prostate tumor cell lines.
