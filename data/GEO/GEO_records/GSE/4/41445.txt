TITLE
Basal gene expression data of 21 cell lines (18 cancer and 3 non-tumorigenic)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled basal gene expressed levels of 21 cell lines (18 cancer and 3 non-tumorigenic) using Affymetrix HG-U133_plus2 GeneChip microarrays. Goal of the experiment was to benchmark a number of algorithms for biomarker detection all of which utilize gene expression data.

DESIGN
Cell lines were cultivated in appropriate media according to supplier recommendations. Goal was to acquire a basal gene expression profile of 21 common cell lines.
