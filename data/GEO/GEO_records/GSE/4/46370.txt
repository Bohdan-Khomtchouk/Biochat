TITLE
Expression data from maize D11 mutant

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
The expression profiling of a newly identified maize dwarf mutant Dwarf11 (D11) was investigated by Affymetrix array. Results showed that transcripts encoding GA biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO), GA 20-oxidase (GA20ox), and GA 2-oxidase (GA2ox) were up-regulated in the D11 mutant. We used microarrays to identify the difference of GA-related gene expression in D11 mutant.

DESIGN
Stems of D11 mutant and wild type were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
