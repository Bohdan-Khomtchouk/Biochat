TITLE
Comparison between classically activated and type II activated macrophages to identify novel markers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to identify novel markers for the type II activated macrophage, which is generated by classical stimulation in the presence if IgG immune complexes. These cells gererally produce high levels of IL-10 and low levels of IL-12, in comparison to classically activated macrophages. We wish to identify gene expression which is enriched in Type II activated macrophages in comparison to classically activated macrophages. Keywords: Stimulation comparison
