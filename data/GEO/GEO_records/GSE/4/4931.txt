TITLE
Expression analysis of hns mutant Salmonella

ORGANISM
Salmonella

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of two independently derived hns mutants compared to an isogenic wild-type Salmonella (strain 14028s - lab ID# WN153).  Note: both the wild-type and hns strains carry an additional mutation in the rpoS locus (encoding the stationary phase sigma factor) resulting in a deletion of amino acids 61-65 that diminish its activity. Keywords: cell type comparison
