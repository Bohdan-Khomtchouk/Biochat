TITLE
Reduced inflammatory response under candesartan pre-treatment  following transient focal ischemia in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Large clinical studies have shown that AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce the incidence of stroke in patients at risk. However, there is controversy about the underlying pathomechanisms. To get a closer insight into the effects of ARBs in stroke on molecular level, gene expression pattern was compared in the ischemic brain areas of Candesartan pre-treated (0,2 mg/kg bwt., 5 days, s.c.) versus vehicle treated, normotensive, adult rats after middle carotid artery occlusion (MCAO). Candesartan significantly improved neurological outcome (as estimated by Garcia-scale) 24 h and 48 h after stroke and reduced infarct volume by about 40% compared to vehicle.
