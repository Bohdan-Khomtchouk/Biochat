TITLE
Time dependent expression profiles of mRNAs in rat milk

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We have reported that mRNAs are present in bovine milk. But, it is unknown the roles of milk mRNAs. To clarify the roles of milk mRNAs, experimental animal such as rat study would be needed. However, it is unclear whether rat milk also contains mRNAs. Thus, we have employed microarray to show that rat milk also contains mRNAs.

DESIGN
Milk samples were obtained at day 2, 9, and 16 postpartum from 3 rats. And serum samples were obtained from dam rats (n=3) at day 21 postpartum.
