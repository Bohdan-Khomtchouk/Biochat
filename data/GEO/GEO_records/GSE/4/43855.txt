TITLE
Leukotriene D4 induces early genes in Hodgkin lymphoma cells through Cysteinyl leukotriene type I receptor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Leukotriene (LT) D4 contributes to aberrant cytokine networks of classical Hodgkin lymphonoma, This study has investigated LTD4 induced gene expression and pathway in Hodgkin lymphonma cell line L1236.

DESIGN
Human Hodgkin lymphoma cells are treated with Leukotriene (LT) D4 for 1 hour and 8 hour respectively, the expression profile are compared to non-treated control cells and methanol treated vihicle controls at the two time points.
