TITLE
Assessment of the response of aerobic and anaerobic muscle tissues of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) to caloric restriction

ORGANISM
Sparus aurata

SUMMARY
Fish were fed from May to August (11 weeks) with a commercial diet (D-2 Excel 1P, Skretting, Stavanger, Norway) twice per day at two different feeding levels: full ration until visual satiety (MAX group), and maintenance ration (30% of the satiation level) (MANT group). The effect of ration size on aerobic (red skeletal muscle, heart) and anaerobic (white skeletal muscle) muscle tissue transcriptome was addressed by means of microarray analysis.

DESIGN
The following tissues of animal from the MAX and MANT groups were analyzed: white skeletal muscle, red skeletal muscle and heart.
