TITLE
Experimental selection of long-term intracellular mycobacteria

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium bovis BCG

SUMMARY
Some intracellular bacteria are known to cause long-term infections for periods of time that last decades without compromising the viability of the host. Although of critical importance, the changes that intracellular bacteria suffer during this long process of residence in a host cell environment remain obscure. Here, we report an experimental approach to study the adaptations of intracellular mycobacteria forced by a long-term intracellular lifestyle. Long-term infection of host macrophages with mycobacteria was maintained for a period of years. Mycobacteria in the long-term infected macrophages underwent an adaptation process leading to impaired phenolic glycolipids (PGL) synthesis, preference for glucose as a carbon source and neutral lipids accumulation. These changes correlated with increased survival of mycobacteria in macrophages and mice during re-infection and specific expression of stress- and survival-related genes. Our findings identify bacterial traits implicated in the establishment of long-term cellular infections and represent a tool for understanding the physiological states of bacteria living in fluctuating intracellular environments.

DESIGN
We investigated the genes differentially expressed during re-infection that might contribute to the improved survival. Using a microarray, we identified a clear and distinct pattern of gene expression after re-infection comparing ancestral (BCGanc) and selected bacteria (BCGevo)
