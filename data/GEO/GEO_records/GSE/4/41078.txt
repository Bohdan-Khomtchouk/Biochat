TITLE
Gene Profiling of Narrow-band UVB-induced Skin Injury Defines Cellular and Molecular Innate Immune Responses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to define the cutaneous response at 24 hours following erythemogenic doses of narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB, 312 nm peak) exposure and determine the differences between irradiated and non-irradiated skin.

DESIGN
Comparison of Transcriptome between NB-UVB irradiated (2MED) and non-irradiated skin (NON IRRAD).
