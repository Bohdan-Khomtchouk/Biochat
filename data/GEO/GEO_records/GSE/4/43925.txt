TITLE
RNA-Sequencing Analysis of High Glucose Treated Monocytes Reveals Novel Transcriptome Signatures and associated Epigenetic Profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report high throughput transcriptomic profiling with RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) to uncover network responses in human THP-1 monocytes treated with high glucose (HG).

DESIGN
Examination of differential expression between normal and high glucose condition in THP1 cells.
