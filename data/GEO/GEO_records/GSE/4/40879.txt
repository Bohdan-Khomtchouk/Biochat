TITLE
The effect on gene expression of Smchd1 deletion in pre-B cells from E17.5 Eµ-Myc embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Smchd1 appears to act as a tumour suppressor in the Eµ-Myc mouse B cell lymphoma model. We find a small number of gene expression differences at E17.5 in the pre-B cells, before phenotypic differences are observed.

DESIGN
The microarrays compared Smchd1 null and Smchd1 wildtype E17.5 preB cell samples. All samples are on the C57BL/6 background and carry the Eµ-Myc transgene, and the Smchd1 null samples are additionally homozygous for a Smchd1 genetrap allele.
