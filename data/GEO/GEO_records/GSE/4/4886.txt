TITLE
FAIRE performed in human foreskin fibroblast cells

ORGANISM
Pilot ENCODE

SUMMARY
To perform FAIRE, chromatin is crosslinked with formaldehyde in vivo, sheared by sonication, and phenol-chloroform extracted. The DNA recovered in the aqueous phase is fluorescently labeled and hybridized to a DNA microarray.  FAIRE performed in human cells strongly enriches DNA coincident with the location of DNaseI hypersensitive sites, transcriptional start sites, and active promoters. Keywords: Genome wide map of active chromatin
