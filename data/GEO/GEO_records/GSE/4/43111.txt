TITLE
TP63 regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in an experimental prostate cell model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
p63 is a transcription factor central for epithelial homeostasis and development. In our model of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in a human prostate cell culture model, p63 was one of the most down-regulated transcription factors during EMT. We therefore investigated the role of p63 in EMT by a gain and loss of function approach. Over-expression of the predominant epithelial isoform DNp63a in mesenchymal EPT1B8 cells led to gain of several epithelial characteristics without resulting in a complete mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). This was corroborated by a reciprocal effect when p63 was knocked down in epithelial EP156T cells. Global gene expression analyses found that DNp63a induced gene modules involving cell adhesion genes in mesenchymal like cells. Genome-wide analysis of p63 binding sites by ChIP-seq analyses confirmed binding of p63 to regulatory areas of genes associated with cell adhesion in prostate epithelial cells.CDH1 and ZEB1 are two elemental factors in the control of EMT. Over-expression and knock-down of these factors, respectively, were not sufficient alone or in combination with DNp63a to reverse the mesenchymal phenotype in EPT1 cells. The partial reversion of epithelial to mesenchymal transition might reflect the ability of DNp63a, as a key co-ordinator of several epithelial gene expression modules, to reduce epithelial to mesenchymal plasticity (EMP). The utility of DNp63a expression and the potential of reduced EMP in order to counteract metastasis warrant further investigation.
