TITLE
Pre-leukemic Cebpa mutant myeloid progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we use pre-malignant cells from different Cebpa mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models. We have used conditional KO models (CreLoxP) and isolated hematopoietic cells shortly after induction of recombination, in order to look at pre-leukemic cells, which have acquired the first hit, but not yet undergone full malignant transformation.

DESIGN
We have sorted granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and the more immature population pre-granulocyte-macrophages (preGMs) from pre-leukemic mice. We analyzed gene-expression profiles in order to find deregulated genes, which make the cells more prone to undergo transformation.
