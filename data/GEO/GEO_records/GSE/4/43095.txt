TITLE
Investigation of the methylation changes occurring during breast cancer pathology

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment was designed to discover deferentially methylated regions between DNA extracted from breast cancer tissues and DNA samples extracted from tissue obtained form breast reduction surgeries. The study involved 20 breast cancer samples and 5 tissue samples from breast reductions. Each of the samples was processed by the arrays and collected data were used to compare the genome wide methylation pattern cancer samples (cases) and breast reduction samples (controls).

DESIGN
The methylation pattern of 5 DNA samples from breast reduction was compared with the methylation pattern of 20 DNA samples from breast cancer tumors
