TITLE
Age dependence of hematopoietic progenitor survival and chemokine family gene induction after gamma-irradiation in bone marrow tissue in C3H mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the age dependent radiation response in C3H mouse bone marrow cells.

DESIGN
Changes in gene expression in 1 week old and 8 weeks old C3H mouse (female) bone marrow after 2Gy irradiation. Bone marrow samples  were collected un-irradiated control, 6 hours and 24 hours after irradiation. Three mice were used at each time course.
