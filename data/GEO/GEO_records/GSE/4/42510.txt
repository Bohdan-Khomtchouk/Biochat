TITLE
Alterations in cardiac DNA methylation in human dilated cardiomyopathy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This project analyzes genome-wide cardiac DNA methylation in patients with idopathic DCM and control individuals

DESIGN
Given are datafiles from n = 8 controls (patients after Htx) and n = 9 patients with idopathic DCM. The datasets have been normalized together with other beadchip files not subject to this study. Methylation profiles were generated from human left ventricular myocardium DNA.
