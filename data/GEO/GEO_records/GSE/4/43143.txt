TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells reprogrammed from dental pulp

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated its suitability for disease modeling by carrying out gene expression profiling, using RNA-seq, on neurons derived from iPSCs made from dental pulp extracted from deciduous teeth (T-iPSCs) and fibroblasts (F-iPSCs).

DESIGN
Comparison of expression profiles of iPSC derived from dental pulp and skin-fibroblast
