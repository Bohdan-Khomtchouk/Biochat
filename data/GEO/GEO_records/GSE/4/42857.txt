TITLE
Transcriptome study in rhesus monkey

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq technology was widely used to study gene expression, splicing structure and RNA editing. To facilitate transcriptome study in rhesus macaque, and provide an evolutionary context to understand human biology, we performed 90bp Ã— 2, paired-end, strand-specific, polyA-postive RNA-Seq in 10 tissues of the same macaque animals. The data were deposited under accession number GSE42857 and GSE34426.

DESIGN
This submission represents RNA-Seq: cerebellum, lung, kidney, heart and spleen component of study.
