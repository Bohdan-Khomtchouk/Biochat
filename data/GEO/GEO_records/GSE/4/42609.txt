TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of exogenously supplied and transgenic of senescence-induced cytokinin for broccoli postharvest yellowing improvement

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Both exogenously supplied and transgenic induced cytokinin production can effectively delay senescence of broccoli florets during postharvest storage. However, a substantial comparison between the mechanisms of these two treatments on delaying broccoli florets senescence was absent. Here, we conduct microarray analysis on broccoli florets of N6-benzylaminopurine treated and ipt-transgenic broccoli that harbor a senescence-associated-gene promoter triggering isopentenyltransferase gene expression during postharvest storage.
