Clostridium thermocellum ATCC27405 Transcriptomic Profiles during growth on Populus and switchgrass

ORGANISM
Ruminiclostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405

SUMMARY
The thermophilic anaerobe Clostridium thermocellum is a candidate consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) biocatalyst for cellulosic ethanol production.  It expresses enzymes for both cellulose solubilization and its fermentation to produce lignocellulosic ethanol.  To gain insights into the C. thermocellum genes, using an updated version of the C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 genome annotation, that are required for specific growth on the cellulosic feedstocks of either pretreated switchgrass or Populus, duplicate fermentations were conducted with a 5 g/L solid substrate loading.  High quality RNA was extracted using a method we report for C. thermocellum grown on solid substrates. Transcriptome profiles were obtained at two time points during actively growing fermentations (12 h and 37 h post inoculation).  A comparison of two transcriptomic analytical techniques, microarray and RNAseq, was performed and the data analyzed for statistical significance. When thresholds for genes passing significance of FDR > 0.05 were applied, microarray (2351 genes) had a greater number of significant genes relative to RNA-seq (280 genes when normalized by KDMM).  When a 2-fold difference in expression threshold was applied, seventy-three genes were significantly differentially expressed in common between the two techniques.  We identified genes differentially expressed when C. thermocellum  ATC 27405 was grown on the two biomass substrates, with two putative efflux/transport systems highly differentially regulated ( > 5-fold).  This study has revealed consistency between these two transcriptomics analytical platforms that gives confidence in our switch from the DNA microarray platform to an RNAseq based platform for routine transcriptomics analyses.
