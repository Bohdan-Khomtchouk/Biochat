TITLE
Gene expression Data from Toxoplasma gondii-Infected Murine Bone Marrow-Derived STAT6 and STAT3 Deficient Macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Toxoplasma type I ROP16 kinase directly activates the host STAT3 and STAT6 transcription factors and regulates the expression of many host genes. However, many of genes lack known STAT3/6 transcription factor binding sites in their promoter regions. We wanted to understand what fraction of  host genes that are modulated by ROP16 were dependent on the STAT3 and STAT6 signaling pathways.

DESIGN
Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from mLys-Mcre Stat3fl/fl mice were infected with type II (Pru A7), type II +ROP16 I, type II Δgra15, or type II Δgra15 + ROP16I and gene expression was analyzed 18 hrs after infection. This data set was generated side by side with infections performed in B6 BMDMs, the gene expression results for that experiment were previoiusly submitted under the GEO accession number GSE29404. In addition, gene expression of wild type B6 and Stat6-/- BMDMs were infected with the II+ROP16I strain.
