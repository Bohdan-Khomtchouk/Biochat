TITLE
Gene expression during early Arabidopsis flower development

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This experiment describes gene expression during early Arabidopsis flower development. We used a 35S:AP1-GR ap1 cal line to induce synchronized flower development by specifically activating the AP1-GR fusion protein in ap1 cal inflorescence-like meristems through dexamethasone treatment. Tissue samples were collected immediately after the treatment, as well as at one-day intervals for the following five days. The expression profiles of the individual samples were then analyzed by gene expression profiling using whole-genome microarrays (Operon). Keywords: time course
