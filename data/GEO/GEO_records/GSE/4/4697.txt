SUMMARY
The experimental goals of this study were to determine the differences in hypothalamus gene expression in genetically identical mice that have variability in their susceptibility towards diet-induced obesity following 6 weeks feeding a high fat diet, 2 weeks low fat diet and 6 weeks high fat diet.
