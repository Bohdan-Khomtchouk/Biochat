TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in response to cold shock

ORGANISM
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1

SUMMARY
This study presents a global transcriptional analysis of the cold shock response of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 after a temperature downshift from 30 to 8 or 15oC based on time-series microarray experiments.  More than 700 genes were found to be significantly affected (p < 0.05) upon cold shock challenge, especially at 8oC. The temporal gene expression patterns of the classical cold-shock genes varied and only some of them, most notably so1648 and so2787, were differentially regulated in response to temperature downshift. The global response of S. oneidensis to cold shock was also characterized by the up-regulation of genes encoding membrane proteins, DNA metabolism and translation apparatus components, metabolic proteins, regulatory proteins, and hypothetical proteins. Most of the metabolic proteins affected are involved in catalytic processes that generate NADH or NADPH. Keywords: time course, stress response
