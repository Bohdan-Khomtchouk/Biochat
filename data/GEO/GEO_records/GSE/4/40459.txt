TITLE
Expression analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans Bristol N2 rsd-2 and rsd-6 single mutants at 25°C and 20°C

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in early generation Caenorhabditis elegans Bristol N2 rsd-2 and Bristol N2 rsd-6 single mutants, compared to late-generation strains at 25°C and 20°C

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from two separate alleles of Caenorhabditis elegans Bristol N2 rsd-2 and one allele Bristol N2 rsd-6 , in which the effects of transgeneration aging are studied in early generation animals and late generation animals at the restrictive temperature of 25°C and the permissive temperature, 20°C.
