TITLE
Expression data in Arabidopsis hda6 mutant axe1-5 and its parental line DR5 under drought and control conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the role of Arabidopsis histone deacetylase HDA6 in drought tolerance, we have employed transcriptional profiling of the hda6 mutant and its parental line under drought and control conditions to identify genes differentially expressed in the hda6 mutant under drought and control conditions. Aligent's Whole Arabidopsis Gene Expression Microarray (Agilent-015059, G2519F, V3, 4x44K) was used.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis hda6 mutant axe1-5 and its parental line DR5 were grown in soil for 3 weeks (16 hours light / 8 hours dark). For drought-treated sample, the plants were subjected to drought by withhelding water supply for indicated days. Then total RNA was prepared from the above-ground tissue and used for the microarray hybridization. Three replicative hybridization experiments for each array were carried out using the independent biological samples.
