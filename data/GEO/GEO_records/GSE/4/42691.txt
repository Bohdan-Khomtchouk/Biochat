TITLE
Aortic macrophages and endothelial cells of apoE KO mice aortas after plaque regression induced apoE adenoviral transfer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aortic macrophages and endothelial cells of apoE KO mice were sorted and analyzed by microarray 2 weeks after regression was induced by adenoviral transfer of apoE.

DESIGN
Aortic macrophages (CD45+ F4/80+ CD11b+) and endothelial cells (CD45- CD31+) were sorted from apoE KO mice and the RNA extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array. We pooled aortas from 5 mice for each sort.
