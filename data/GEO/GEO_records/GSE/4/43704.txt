TITLE
Comparison of isogenic lines differing in vernalization requirement

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Gene expression was assyed in seedlings of isogenic barley lines differing in vernalization requirement. Seedlings were harvested after 5 days germination in darkness at 20 degrees. Seedlings were then subjected to 1 day at 4 degrees after 5 days germination in darkness at 20. Genotypes include the winter barley parent Dairokakku, and isogenic lines carrying a deletion of VRN2, active VRN1 allleles (VRN1-10, or VRN1-8) or an active allele of FT1/VRN3.   ****[PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Ben Trevaskis.
