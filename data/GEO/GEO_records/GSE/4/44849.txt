TITLE
Genome binding profile of TFIIH helicases XPB and XPD in HT1080 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The conserved TFIIH helicases XPB and XPD play key roles in transcription initiation and DNA repair. To investigate the functions of these helicases on a genome-wide scale, we performed ChIP-seq of endogenous XPB and XPD in the HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line.

DESIGN
2 ChIP samples and 1 unenriched input control from the same crosslinked chromatin pool
