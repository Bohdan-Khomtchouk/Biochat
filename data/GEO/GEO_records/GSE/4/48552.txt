TITLE
Alteration of the microRNA network during the progression of Alzheimerâ€™s disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the high-throughput profiling of microRNAs (miRNAs) from the prefrontal cortex of controls, early and late-stages Alzheimer's disease subjects. We show miRNA expression changes between the two groups and down-regulation of miR-132-3p in the late-stages group.

DESIGN
Deep-sequencing of microiRNAs in 6 controls/early-stages and 6 late-stages Alzheimer's disease patients
