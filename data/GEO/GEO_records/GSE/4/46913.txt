TITLE
Transcripts differentially expressed in healthy blood mDCs compared to healthy monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To directly compare the SLE monocyte transcriptional program with that of blood mDC precursors, we purified lineage HLA-DRhighCD11chigh mDCs and CD14+ monocytes from the blood of five healthy donors. Their gene expression profiles were then compared to those of blood SLE monocytes. An unsupervised clustering analysis of transcripts present in > 20% of the samples classified healthy monocytes, SLE monocytes and healthy mDCs into three well defined groups. A supervised analysis was then performed to find genes: 1) differentially expressed in healthy mDCs compared to monocytes; 2) shared by healthy blood mDCs and SLE blood monocytes.
