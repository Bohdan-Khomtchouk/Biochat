TITLE
Hierarchical mechanisms for transcription factor-mediated reprogramming of fibroblasts to neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we reveal a hierarchical mechanism in the direct conversion of fibroblasts into induced neuronal (iN) cells mediated by the transcription factors Ascl1, Brn2, and Myt1l.

DESIGN
Examination of global transcriptional changes and mapping genome-wide transcription factors occupancy at distinct time points during the transdifferentiation process
