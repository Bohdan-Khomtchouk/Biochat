TITLE
Transformation of the Fallopian Tube Secretory Epithelium Leads to High-grade Serous Ovarian Cancer in BRCA/P53/PTEN Models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our study presents the first genetic models of de novo high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) that originate in fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells and recapitulate the key genetic alterations and precursor lesions characteristic of human invasive ovarian cancer.  Genomic copy number analysis, using array CGH, was performed on murine tumors in order to compare the overlap of copy number alterations between HGSC models and TCGA data.

DESIGN
Array CGH was performed on genomic DNA isolated from murine HGSC tumors. Genomic DNA from three normal mouse fallopian tubes was pooled and used as the reference.
