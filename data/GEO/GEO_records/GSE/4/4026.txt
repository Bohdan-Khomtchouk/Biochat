TITLE
A Distinct QscR Regulon in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Quorum Sensing Circuit

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
To better understand the role of QscR in P. aeruginosa gene regulation and to better understand the relationship between QscR, LasR and RhlR control of gene expression we used transcription profiling to identify a QscR-dependent regulon. Our analysis revealed that QscR activates some genes and represses others. Some of the repressed genes are not regulated by the LasR-I or RhlR-I systems while others are. The LasI-generated 3-oxododecanoyl-homoserine lactone serves as a signal molecule for QscR. Thus QscR appears to be an integral component of the P. aeruginosa quorum sensing circuitry. QscR uses the LasI-generated acyl-homoserine lactone signal and controls a specific regulon that overlaps with the already overlapping LasR and RhlR-dependent regulons. Keywords: Quorum sensing regulon, Direct activation
