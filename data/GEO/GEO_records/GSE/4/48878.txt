TITLE
In vivo transcriptional goverance of hair follicle stem cells by canonical Wnt regulators

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse hair follicles undergo synchronized cycles. Cyclical regeneration and hair growth is fueled by hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). HFSCs regenerate hair in response to canonical Wnt signalling. We used RNA-seq to unfold genome-wide chromatin landscapes of β-catenin within the native HFSC-niche.

DESIGN
β-catenin control and cKO hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) at the onset of anagen skins were FACS-purified for RNA-sequcencing. Telogen quiescent hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) were FACS-purified for ChIP-sequcencing. Telogen > anagen activated bulge hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) were FACS-purified for RNA-sequcencing.
