TITLE
Expression profiling in miR-290 6dt1 mammary tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA expression data from mammary tumors extracted 30 days after orthotopic injection of miR-290-expressing and negative control 6dt1 cells into female FVB/N mice.

DESIGN
At 6 weeks of age, FVB/N female mice were orthotopically injected with 1.0x10E5 6dt1 cells, either expressing miR-290 or a negative control RNA construct. 4 negative control tumors and 3 miR-290 tumors were analyzed.
