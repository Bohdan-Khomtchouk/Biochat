TITLE
Expression profile of colon crypts from WT and GMCSF-/- mice with or without DSS treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To discover possible molecular mechanisms mediated by GM-CSF that may be involved in regeneration of the colon epithelium after DSS-induced injury we performed whole-genome wide mRNA microchip analysis of isolated crypt epithelial cells from unchallenged and DSS-challenged WT and GM-CSF-/- mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from isolated crypts obtained from colons of GM-CSF deficient mice and WT littermates treated or untreated with 1.5%DSS for 6 days. Three biological replicates were performed for each experimental condition.
