TITLE
Expression data from ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TET2 directly interacts with OGT, which is important for the chromatin association of OGT in vivo. Although this specific interaction does not regulate the enzymatic activity of TET2, it facilitates OGT-dependent histone O-GlcNAcylation. Moreover, OGT associates with TET2 at transcription starting sites (TSS). Down-regulation of TET2 reduces the amount of H2B S112 GlcNAc marks in vivo, which are associated with gene transcription regulation. We used microarray to test the function of TET2 on gene expression.

DESIGN
Mouse ES cells infected with control knockdown(KD) or TET2 KD virus were treated with puromycin. ES cells were extracted for RNA and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
