TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of human sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatocyte

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptome human primary hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Hepatocytes were obtained from commercial sources.  LSECs were isolated based on the coexpression of Tie2 and CD32b, te strategy of purification controlled by RNA-Seq.

DESIGN
Comparison of the expression of the Tie-2, CD32b, SELP, FVIII, VWF, Alb, Fg, F7genes
