TITLE
Quantitative single-cell RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: We applied cDNA molecule counting using unique molecular identifiers combined with high-throughput sequencing to study the transcriptome of individual mouse embryonic stem cells, with spike-in controls to monitor technical performance. We further examined transcriptional noise in the embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
One 96-well plate of single-stranded cDNA libraries generated from 96 single R1 mouse embryonic stem cells sequenced on two lanes, and one 96-well plate of the same libraries further amplified by 9 PCR cycles sequenced on one lane.
