TITLE
DNA methylation dynamics during development in the rice blast fungus [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe oryzae KJ201

SUMMARY
Cytosine methylation is an important epigenetic modification of DNA that is involved in genome defense and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes. Contribution of DNA methylation to biology of microbial eukaryotes is largely unknown to date. Here we used RNA-seq to examine the impact of DNA methylation on transcriptional output in the genome of a model pathogenic fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae by comparing expression profiles of wild-type and methylation-deficient mutant strains.

DESIGN
Samples from wild type mycelia and two DNA methyltransferase absent isolates (dmt1 and dmt2)
