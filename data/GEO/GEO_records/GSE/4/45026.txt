TITLE
MicroRNA expression of mouse cochleae during aging

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
To identify which miRNAs are involved in the onset and progression of age-related hearing loss in the mammalian cochlea We used miRNA microarrays to screen miRNAs which exhibit the differential expression in the expressing levels during aging of the cochlea
