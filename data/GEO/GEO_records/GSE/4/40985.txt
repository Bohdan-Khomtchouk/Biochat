TITLE
Gene expression profiles induced by shRNA-mediated knockdown of PDEF in MCF7 mammary epithelial cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray gene expression analysis was performed in MCF7 cells transduced with a non-specific shRNA or PDEF-targeting shRNA, and both subjected to hormone depletion for 48 hours. Analyses of differentially expressed genes combined with gene ontology revealed a downregulation of cell cycle related-genes and an upregulation of apoptosis-related genes in PDEF knockdown cells. These target genes constitute potential effectors of the pro-survival role of PDEF.

DESIGN
Four samples were harvested after lentiviral infection with either non-specific shRNA control or PDEF-targetting shRNA.  All samples were subjected to hormone depletion for 48 hours.  Each condition was performed in duplicate
