TITLE
Gene expression analysis of V5 tagged Sox17 expressing ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the expression of KH2 embryonic stem cells inducibly expressing V5 tagged Sox17 protein. Results provide information on the endodermal gene expression program activated after Sox17 expression in ES cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from 48 hours doxycycline induced compaired to non-induced Sox17-V5 expressing ES cells
