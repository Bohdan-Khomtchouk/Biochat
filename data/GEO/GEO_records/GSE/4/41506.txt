TITLE
Expression data from YAP-S127A Villin-rtTA crypts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We overexpressed YAP in the intestinal epithelium by adding doxycycline to the drinking water of experimental mice. Mice were given dox for 2 days, and referred to as Tg (transgenic).

DESIGN
Mice were given dox for 2 days, sacrificed, and crypts were isolated for RNA extraction and analyzed by Affymetrix microarrays.
