TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome analysis during dehydration in leaf tissues of Boea hygrometrica

ORGANISM
Dorcoceras hygrometricum

SUMMARY
Gene transcript abundances were analyzed with samples taken from hydrated, moderate dehydration (70% RWC) and desiccated (10% RWC) leaf tissues of resurrection plant species B. hygrometrica by using RNA-Seq. Totally, 9888 genes were identified as differentially expressed genes.The results provided insight for exploring the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA transcript abundances in hydrated, dehydrating to 70% RWC and dehydrating to 10% RWC leaf tissues, for each treatment, three biological replicates were included.
