TITLE
Expression from Staphylococcus aureus strain USA300-lac during low and 2M NaCl exposure

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
S. aureus has the propensity to survive a range of NaCl challenge conditions We used commercially available Affymetrix S. aureus GeneChips (part number 900514) to compare the gene expression properties of wild type cells during growth at no or high (2M) NaCl.
