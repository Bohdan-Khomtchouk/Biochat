TITLE
Antisense exon profiling across human, mouse, and rat

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of antisense transcripts of 10 tissues each from human, mouse, and rat.

DESIGN
We profiled the antisense transcription level of 10 tissues each from human, mouse, and rat. Only Affymetrix core probesets were used. Two technical replicates per sample. Reference for protocol: Ge, X., Rubinstein, W.S., Jung, Y.C., and Wu, Q. (2008). Genome-wide analysis of antisense transcription with Affymetrix exon array. BMC Genomics 9, 27.
