TITLE
Global gene expression analysis in macrophages treated with Nutlin-3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the study is to identify p53 target genes specific to macrophages using the p53 stabilizer, Nutlin-3.

DESIGN
Macrophages were differentiated x-vivo from monocytes obtained from healthy volunteers either left untreated or treated for 2 hours with 100 ng/mL of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 0.1%v/v of DMSO (vehicle control for Nutlin-3) or 10 micromolar Nutlin-3. Three replicates were included for each treatment group.
