TITLE
Developing rice endosperm at seven days after flowering: Aleurone layers vs central starchy endosperm

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of developing rice endosperm at seven days after flowering comparing aleurone layers with central starchy endosperm. Cereal productivity is dependent on the accumulation of storage compounds in the endosperm, a nutritive tissue that is composed of aleurone cells in the outermost regions and starchy endosperm in the inner region. The transcriptional analyses provides clues to the molecular basis for different metabolic pathways in response to the spatial and nutritional differences between rice aleurone cells and starchy endosperm.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Aleurone layers vs. central starchy endosperm. 3 biological replicates with color swap for each biological replicate
