TITLE
Gene expression profiling of zebrafish embryos at 5 days post fertilization [Illumina RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We compared Agilent custom made expression microarrays with Illumina deep sequencing for RNA analysis of zebrafish embryos 5 days post fertilization, showing as expected a high degree of correlation of expression of a common set of 15,927 genes for untreated fish. The transcriptomes were also compared for fish injected in the yolk with Mycobacterium marinum

DESIGN
This RNA deep sequencing study was designed to determine the gene expression profile of zebrafish embryos 5 days post fertilization. We also have compared expression with embryos that were injected with Mycobacterium marinum in the yolk at 2 hours post fertilization. After injections embryos were transferred into fresh egg water and incubated at 28Â°C. 150 embryos of mock-injected embryos or 200 embryos injected with 12 CFU bacteria were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent.
