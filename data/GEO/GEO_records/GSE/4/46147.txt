TITLE
Expression profiles of primary cortical neurons after knocking down Cugbp1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To clarify the functional properties of Cugbp1, we established the differentially expressed alternative exons in Cugbp1-silenced primary cortical neurons by using exon-sensitive microarray technology.

DESIGN
We analyzed total RNA of primary motor neuron infected with lentivirus expressing shRNA against mouse Cugbp1 or control. RNA was harvested 11 days after transfection.
