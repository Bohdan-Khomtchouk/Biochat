TITLE
Gene expression profile of conventional T cells (Tconv) and regulatory T cells (Treg) stimulated with anti-costimulatory molecule antibodies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Co-stimulatory molecules of the CD28 family on T lymphocytes integrate cues from innate immune system sensors, and modulate activation responses in conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconv) and their FoxP3+ regulatory counterparts (Treg). To better understand how costimulatory and co-inhibitory signals might be integrated, we profiled the changes in gene expression elicited in the hours and days after engagement of Treg and Tconv by anti-CD3 and either anti-CD28, -CTLA4, -ICOS, -PD1, -BTLA or -CD80.

DESIGN
Total CD4+ T cells were stimulated by anti-CD3 and either anti-CD28, -CTLA4, -ICOS, -PD1, -BTLA or -CD80 antibodies for 1, 4, 20 and 48 hrs and Tconv and Treg were separated by flowcytometry. The 1 and 4 hr lysates were pooled [the 'early' samples] before RNA purification and profiling, as were the 20 and 48 hr samples [the 'late' samples] (note; for Treg cells, only the 20 hr sample was used). RNA was amplified, labeled and hybridized to Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays with the data generation and quality control pipeline of 19 the Immunological Genome Project (www.immgen.org), in biological triplicates (duplicates only for ICOS and CD80). Raw data were background-corrected and normalized using the RMA algorithm.
