TITLE
EBNA-2 target genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two cell lines, BL41K3 and BJABK3, were chosen to perform a comprehensive screen for EBNA-2 target genes. Both cell lines are EBV negative B-cell lines and express a chimeric EBNA-2 protein fused to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER/EBNA-2). The cells are propagated in the absence of hormone 31,36. Estrogen stimulation activates ER/EBNA-2, which in turn activates well known EBNA-2 target genes like CD21. BL41K3 and BJABK3 were cultured in estrogen supplemented medium for 24h and gene expression profiles were established for unstimulated and stimulated cells. Keywords: Transcription factor target identification
