TITLE
Microarray study using whole blood and purified leucocyte populations from healthy controls and patients with tuberculosis or sarcoidosis with tuberculosis and sarcoidosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole blood and purified leucocyte populations were compared to determine which cell types the whole blood interferon-inducible signature, found in both tuberculosis and sarcoidosis, was present in. This study agreed with previous publication that the neutrophil was the dominant cell in tuberculosis and also showed it was the dominant cell type in sarcoidosis.

DESIGN
There were 5 patients in each group of healthy controls, tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. The cell types were whole blood, PBMCs, monocytes (CD14), T cells (CD8 and CD4) and neutrophils (CD15).
