TITLE
Identification of miRNAs regulated by TGF-b in human CD8+ T cells (expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the current study was to identify miRNAs regulated by TGF-b in human CD8+ T cells and analyze the function of these miRNAs in shaping the immunomodulatory effect of TGF-b in these cells. We identified the miR-23a cluster to be upregulated and found that this cluster could target key molecules (IFN-g and LAMP1) involved in immune response by CD8+ T cells.
