TITLE
Inducing pluripotency from mouse somatic cells by small-molecule compounds [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pluripotent stem cells can be induced from somatic cells, providing an unlimited cell resource for regenerative medicine. However, genetic manipulation and difficult-to-manufacture strategies used in reprogramming limit their clinical applications. Here, we show pluripotency can be induced from mouse somatic cells by specific small-molecule compounds. The completely chemically-induced pluripotent stem cells (CiPSCs) can be stably maintained in embryonic stem cell (ESC) culture medium and resemble ESCs in terms of their gene expression profiles, epigenetic status, and potential for differentiation and germline transmission. These findings suggest that exogenous master genes are dispensable for cell fate reprogramming and pave the way for the clinical application of somatic reprogramming techniques.
