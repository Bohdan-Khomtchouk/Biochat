TITLE
Global gene expression in Moraxella catarrhalis ATCC43617 cells grown in the planktonic and in biofilm states

ORGANISM
Moraxella catarrhalis

SUMMARY
Total RNA samples were isolated from M. catarrhalis grown in the planktonic state (i.e., in broth) and in a biofilm.  Biofilms were generated by growing this strain in the continuous-flow Sorbarod filter system for three days. Total RNA samples and M. catarrhalis genome-directed primers (GDPs) were used for synthesis of Cy3- or Cy5-labeled cDNA samples.  Five independent M. catarrhalis growth experiments and total RNA isolations were used for the synthesis of cDNA samples, and a total of six DNA microarray hybridizations were performed in this study.
