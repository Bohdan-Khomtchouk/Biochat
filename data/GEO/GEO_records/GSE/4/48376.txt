TITLE
Chromatin remodeling and histone mRNA accumulation in bovine germinal vesicle oocytes

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The objective of the study was to compare the transcriptome of the bovine oocyte according to the chromatin configuration of the germinal vesicule

DESIGN
Bovine oocyte (4 biological replicates) were collected and grouped according to the different chromatin configuration of the germinal vesicule described by Lodde et al. 2007. Four GV stages corresponding to the state of chromatin condensation were used (GV0; GV1; GV2 and GV3). Multiples microarray comparison were performed. First a reference design (GV0 as a reference) were used for a total of three comparisons (GV0 vs GV1; GV0 vs GV2 and GV0 vs GV3), then another comparison was performed between the last two groups (GV2 vs GV3). Each comparison was performed using a dye-swap set-up.
