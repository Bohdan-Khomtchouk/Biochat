Earliest Changes in the Left Ventricular Transcriptome Post-Myocardial Infarction

SUMMARY
We report a genome-wide survey of early responses of the mouse heart transcriptome to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). For three regions of the left ventricle (LV), namely ischemic/infarcted tissue (IF), the surviving LV free wall (FW) and the interventricular septum (IVS), 36,899 transcripts were assayed at six time points from 15 min to 48 h post-AMI in both AMI and sham surgery mice. For each transcript, temporal expression patterns were systematically compared between AMI and sham groups, which identified 515 AMI-responsive genes in IF tissue, 35 in the FW, 7 in the IVS, with three genes induced in all three regions. Using the literature, we assigned functional annotations to all 519 nonredundant AMI-induced genes and present two testable models for central signaling pathways induced early post-AMI.  First, the early induction of 15 genes involved in assembly and activation of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors implicates AP-1 as a dominant regulator of earliest post-ischemic molecular events.  Second, dramatic increases in transcripts for arginase 1 (ARG1), the enzymes of polyamine biosynthesis and protein inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity indicates that NO production may be regulated, in part, by inhibition of NOS and coordinate depletion of the NOS substrate, L-arginine. ARG1 was the single most highly induced transcript in the database (121-fold in IF region) and its induction in heart has not been previously reported.
