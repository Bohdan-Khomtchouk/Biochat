SUMMARY
The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family of proteins participates in an underappreciated signaling pathway involved in regulating angiogensis in physiological and pathological conditions. Microarray profiles of BMP-responsive genes in the endothelium performed by our lab suggest important roles for cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox2) as a potential downstream regulator of BMP-induced angiogenesis. Cox2 is upregulated by BMP6 at both mRNA and protein levels. Inhibition of Cox2 blocks BMP6 induced endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation activity. Microvessel outgrowth stimulated by BMP6 also required Cox2 activity. These results strongly support that Cox2 is an important downstream target for BMP6, and that prostaniod synthesis is essential for BMP6 induced endothelial cell activation. This further suggests that our microarray data is a reliable tool to identify unkown BMP6 targets in angiogenesis. Keywords: BMP, angiogenesis, Cox2, MEC
