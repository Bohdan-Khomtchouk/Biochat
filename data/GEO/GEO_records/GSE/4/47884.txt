TITLE
Expression data from torpedo-stage embryos from different Arabidopsis accessions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The zll/ago10 mutant from Arabidopsis shows different expressivity of shoot stem cell defects in different Arabidopsis accessions. We used microarrays to identify changes in embryo gene expression associated with differences in zll expressivity.

DESIGN
Microarrays from ZLL-dependent (Ler-1, Fe-1, Bay-0 and Nw-0) and ZLL-independent (Col-0, Van-0, Ts-1) accessions were compared (always using a minimum of 3 arrays in each group) in different combinations to identify differentially expressed genes.
