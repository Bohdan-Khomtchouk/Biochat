TITLE
Overexpression of NEK6 Associated with Poor Prognosis of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is frequently diagnosed at advanced stage and associated with poor prognosis. This study aimed to identify differentially expressed genes for further evaluated as biomarkers for predicting survival of the patients. Five paired of cancerous and normal tissues from esophageal SCC patients were subjected to cDNA microarray analysis and one of these differentially expressed genes, NEK6, was further verified in esophageal SCC tissues. The data showed 444 up-regulated genes and 918 down-regulated genes in tumor tissues (2 folds as a cut-off value). qRT-PCR data showed that 20 of 30 (66.7%) increased levels of NEK6 mRNA in cancerous tissues compared to that of distant normal tissues, while immunohistochemical data showed that 49/94 (52.13%) of the archived esophageal SCC tissues expressed higher levels of NEK6 than that of normal tissues. NEK6 expression was associated with depth of tumor invasion (P=0.005), lymph node metastasis (P=0.018), and advanced clinical tumor stages (P=0.004) of these 94 patients. Kaplan Meier curve showed that the overall survival of NEK6-positive patients was much lower than those of NEK6-negative patients (P < 0.001). The median survival of NEK6-positive patients was 23 months, whereas the median survival of NEK6-negative patients was 64 months. The cumulative 5-year survival rate of NEK6-positive patients was 14.3% (7/49), whereas the rate of NEK6-negative patients was 64.4% (29/45). Multivariate analysis showed that N classification (P=0.002) and NEK6 expression (P < 0.001) were independent predictors for esophageal SCC patients. These data demonstrated that NEK6 expression may serve as an independent prognostic indicator for patients with esophageal SCC.

DESIGN
Gene expression in five paired of cancerous and normal tissues from esophageal SCC patients were measured using Human Genome 4x44K v2 Microarray.
