TITLE
MAQC-III/SEQC Main Study ABCD titration experiment, ERCC spike-in profiles and gene-level estimates for a selected test set

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison to RNA-Seq showed different strengths and weaknesses for different regimes of expression strength. At sufficient read-depth, both platforms seemed comparable for gene-level expression profiling. Comparison to RNA-Seq showed comparable accuracy and precision with microarrays for ERCC spike-ins at medium to high expression levels. At low expression levels, the array showed signal attenuation but better precision, while RNA-Seq maintained accuracy albeit with highly inflated variance. In summary, both platforms can be meaningfully applied in a similar range of expression strength.

DESIGN
Assessment of (precision, accuracy, reproducibility, mutual information, titration order consistency, and known mixing ratio recovery) by measurement of known-ratio mixtures of two RNA reference samples. The array probes 776 complex genes representative of the AceView gene model annotation, as well as 92 ERCC spike-in controls.
