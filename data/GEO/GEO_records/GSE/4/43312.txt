TITLE
Drug screening for Dravet syndrome using Scn1a zebrafish mutants

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), or Dravet syndrome (DS), is a catastrophic pediatric epilepsy with severe intellectual disability, impaired social development, and persistent drug-resistant seizures.  One of its primary monogenic causes is a mutation in SCN1A (Nav1.1), a type I voltage-gated sodium channel.  In mice, Nav1.1 mutation is associated with reduced sodium current, altered interneuron firing, cognitive deficits, autistic-like traits and seizures.  Here we describe a larval zebrafish Nav1.1 mutant that recapitulates salient features of the human SCN1A mutation phenotype.  Between three and seven days post-fertilization, Nav1.1 mutants exhibit spontaneous abnormal electrographic activity, hyperactivity and convulsive behaviors.  Transcriptomic analysis of Nav1.1 mutants was remarkable for the relatively small fraction of genes that were differentially expressed (~2%) and the lack of compensatory changes in expression for other SCN subunits.  Pharmacological studies confirmed an antiepileptic action for the ketogenic diet, benzodiazepine, valproate, potassium bromide and stiripentol in Nav1.1 mutants; acetazolamide, phenytoin, ethosuximide had no effect, carbamazepine and vigabatrin made seizures worse.  Using this mutant, we screened a chemical library of 320 compounds and identified four compounds that reduced spontaneous seizure-like behavior and one compound (clemizole) that inhibited convulsive behavior and electrographic seizures.  Drug-resistant scn1a zebrafish mutants described here represent a new direction in modeling pediatric epilepsy and could be used to identify novel lead compounds for DS patients

DESIGN
4 Control sibling samples (sample= 10 pooled larvae) and 4 Nav1.1 mutants (sample= 10 pooled larvae)   were collected at 6 dpf (days post fertilization). The  Nav1.1 mutants were selected based on phenotype (dark color).
