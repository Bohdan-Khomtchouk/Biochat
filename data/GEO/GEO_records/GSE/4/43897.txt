TITLE
Expression data from mouse ALDH1 positive and ALDH1 negative ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The hilum region of the mouse ovary, the transitional/junction area between OSE, mesothelium and tubal (oviductal) epithelium is identified as a previously unrecognized stem cell niche of the OSE. OSE cells with high ALDH1 activity have been predominantly detected in the hilum region by immunohistochemical staining. For additional phenotypical characterization, we used microarrays to detail the gene expression profiling between the ALDH1 positive and ALDH1 negative OSE cells.

DESIGN
Three independent pools (10 mice each) were analyzed. ALDH1 positive and ALDH negative OSE cells were isolated by FACS and their mRNA used for hybridization onto Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array. Microarray data were analyzed with GeneSifter software. To identify genes significantly altered in ALDH positive population, we performed paired two group analysis with Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) software and visualized with Treeview software.
