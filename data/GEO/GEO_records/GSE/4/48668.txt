TITLE
Expression data from HeLa cells treated with tocotrienols

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate the pattern of gene expression induced by tocotrienols treatment in HeLA cells Our study demonstrates that treatment with γ- and δ-T3 is associated to specific Ca-dependent signals

DESIGN
3 treatments vs control
