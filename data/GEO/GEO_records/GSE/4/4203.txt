TITLE
Response to plant activator in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To develop a screening system for plant activators, which are novel substances that protect plants by enhancing their inherent disease-resistance mechanisms, we performed analysis using an Arabidopsis microarray consisting of 1200 full-length cDNA clones representing putative defense-related and regulatory genes.　A total of 1.2K potential biotic and abiotic stress-related genes were selected from the genes covered by the Arabidopsis 7K array (RIKEN, Japan) and Arabidopsis oligo microarray (Agilent Technologies, USA) for this study. Arabidopsis wild-type plants (ecotype Columbia; Col-0) were grown in soil for 28 days in a growth chamber at 22｡C under a 12-h light/ 12-h dark cycle. Arabidopsis plants were applied a foliar spray with 5 mM SA, 0.1 mM MeJA, 1 mM ethephon, 0.5 mM BTH, 10 mM BABA and 1 mM INA. Benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester  and 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid activated plant defense responses via the salicylic acid (SA)-dependent signaling pathway, and _-aminobutyric acid  triggered a primed state in the plant that enables more efficient activation of the SA-, jasmonic acid- and ethylene-signaling pathway. These results suggest that this novel system can be used to screen for candidate plant activators. Keywords: time course, dose response
