TITLE
Selective degradation of the miR-17 family members of the miR-17-92 cluster by human Cytomegalovirus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA microarrays were used to investigate host miRNA expression profiles during HCMV clinical strain infection. Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were infected with the HCMV clinical strain Toledo. To mimic the attenuated strain, we used ToledoΔ15kb, which lacks the 15-kb genomic segment in the UL/b’ region.

DESIGN
Changes in miRNA expression upon HCMV infection. Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were infected with Toledo-WT or ToledoΔ15kb for miRNA microarray (5 MOI). The miRNA expression levels of virus-infected HFFs at 24 or 72 hpi have been compared with those for the noninfected control.
