TITLE
Identity of the human cancer cell DNA hypermethylome revealed by gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Altered gene expression is a hallmark of human cancers and arises in part through abnormal epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. The best characterized epigenetic alteration involves tumor suppressor gene inactivation via transcriptional repression associated with aberrant DNA hypermethylation of promoter region CpG islands1. Despite characterization of a growing number of such genes, the majority have yet to be identified.  We now describe a genome wide microarray gene expression approach for human colorectal cancer cells, which can efficiently identify hundreds of hypermethylated genes for any cancer type. We compared isogenic cells altered pharmacologically versus genetically to induce genomic demethylation, to pinpoint genes activated by DNA demethylation, but not by inhibition of class I and II histone deacetylases (HDACs).  We achieve an 82% success rate in predicting genes with densely hypermethylated CpG islands and complete gene silencing. The genes are similarly hypermethylated in primary tumors and have previously undetected tumor suppressor functions.  Our approach provides the first highly efficient, comprehensive, platform for defining the cancer â€œDNA hypermethylome " Keywords: gene expression profiling of pharmacological and genetic human cancer cells
