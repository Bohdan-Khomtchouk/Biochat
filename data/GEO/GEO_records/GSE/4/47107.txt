TITLE
Human gastric mucosa Cells: hTERT-negative para cancerous tissue (Control) vs. hTERT-positive gastric cancer tissue

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The miRNA expression profiles in one pair of  hTERT-positive gastric cancer tissue and an hTERT-negative para-cancerous tissue. The para-cancerous tissue is at least 5cm away from the cancer tisse. The expression of hTERT of identified by immunohistochemistry before RNA extraction for miRNA assay.
