TITLE
Genome-wide Analysis of Re-replication Reveals Inhibitory Controls that Target Multiple Stages of Replication Initiation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
DNA replication must be tightly controlled during each cell cycle to prevent unscheduled replication and ensure proper genome maintenance. The currently known controls that prevent re-replication act redundantly to inhibit pre-Replicative Complex (pre-RC) assembly outside of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. We have analyzed the effects of re-replication on the S. cerevisiae genome using a combination of Comparitive Genomic Hybridization (CGH) of re-replicating strains and Genome-Wide Location Analysis of pre-RC components. These data indicate which sites in the genome assemble pre-RCs under re-replication conditions, which sites undergo re-initiation and the extent of re-replication. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization, ChIP-chip, re-replication, DNA replication, pre-RC
