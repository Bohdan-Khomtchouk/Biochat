TITLE
Expression in Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL) BCBL-1 compared to BJAB (BL cell line) and  L-428 (cHD cell line)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Infection of B lymphocytes by HHV-8 is associated with the development of Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL). By microarray we identify differential expressions in three pro-inflammatory factors; LTA4H, TSP-1 and IL-16 in the BCBL-1 in comparison to BJAB (BL cell line) By microarray we identify differential expressions in three pro-inflammatory factors; LTA4H, TSP-1 and IL-16 in the BCBL-1 in comparison to L-428 a Classical Hodgkinâ€™s disease cell line (cHD) as compared to BJAB a BL cell line. Keywords: Direct cell to cell comparison
