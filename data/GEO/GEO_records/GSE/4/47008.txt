TITLE
Solanum torvum transcriptional responses to nematodes

ORGANISM
Solanum torvum

SUMMARY
Solanum torvum Sw is worldwide employed as rootstock for eggplant cultivation because of its vigour and resistance/tolerance to the most serious soil-borne diseasesas bacterial, fungal wilts and root-knot nematodes.  A 30,0000 features custom combimatrix chip was designed and microarray hybridizations were conducted for both control and 14 dpi (day post inoculation) with Meloidogyne incognita-infected roots samples. We also tested the chip with samples from the phylogenetically-related nematode-susceptible eggplant species Solanum melongena.The genes identified from S. torvum catalogue, bearing high homology to knownnematode resistance genes, were further investigated in view of their potential role in the nematode resistance mechanism.
