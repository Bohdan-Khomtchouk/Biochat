TITLE
Deletion effect of HstD in gene expression

ORGANISM
Aspergillus oryzae RIB40

SUMMARY
In eukaryotic cells , histone deactylase plays key roles in the diverse process such as genomic stabillity, differenciation, and metabolism.  These enzymes also conserved in filamentous fungi, and their functios has been started to understand some fungal biological process such as development, stress responce, and secondary metabolism.  We found deletion of HstD  homolog of yeast Hst4, affected development, secondary metabolism in aspergillyus oryzae.  To acess the global effect of gene expression by HstD deletion, we performed microarray analysis, and results showed metabolite related gene was mainly alterd in DHstD.  This result sugested the HstD will concerned golobal regulation of secondary metabolism in filmatous fungi.
