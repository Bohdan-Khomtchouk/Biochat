TITLE
Expression data from LNCaP cells treated with DHT and enzalutamide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Enzalutamide (formerly MDV3100 and available commercially as Xtandi), a novel androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitor, blocks the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in cellular model systems and was shown in a clinical study to increase survival in patients with metastatic CRPC. Enzalutamide inhibits multiple steps of AR signaling:  (1) binding of androgens to AR, (2) AR nuclear translocation, and (3) association of AR with DNA. Here we used Affymetrix human genome microarray technology to investigate the global programme of gene expression of LNCaP cells in response to enzalutamide alone and in the context of DHT-stimulated androgen receptor gene expression.

DESIGN
LNCaP cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% hormone depleted FBS and treated with vehicle (control sample) , DHT (100 nM), enzalutamide (1 or 10 µM) or DHT (100 nM) plus enzalutamide (1 or 10 µM)for 16 hours for RNA extraction and hybridization. Each condition was done in triplicate.
