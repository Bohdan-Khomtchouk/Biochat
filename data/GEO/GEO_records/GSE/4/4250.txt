TITLE
Determination of expression level of gingiva expressed genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
All experiment was done according to the Affymetrix manufacturerâ€™s protocol.  The resulting HGF gingiva expression profile(Hereditary gingival fibromatosis patient Gingiva replicate1 and replicate 2)was compared to normal gingiva control(Normal Gingiva replicate1 and replicate2). The data were collected and analyzed by GCOS 1.2 and GeneSpring 7.2 1-way T test. Keywords: tissue specific expression profile
