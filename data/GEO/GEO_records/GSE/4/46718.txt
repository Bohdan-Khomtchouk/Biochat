TITLE
WTAP is a novel oncogenic protein in Acute Myeloid Leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) continues to have the lowest survival rates of all leukemias. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to improve clinical outcomes for AML patients. Here, we report a novel role for Wilmsâ€™ tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) in pathogenesis of AML. We have performed RNA-Seq in K562 cells with knockdown of WTAP to ascertain which genes it regulates.

DESIGN
We have 2 replicates of total RNA for K562 cells and 2 replicates with WTAP knocked down
