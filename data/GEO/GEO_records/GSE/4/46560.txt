TITLE
Whole blood gene expression profiling for coronary  in-stent restenosis: A Indian pilot case study.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement is a standard treatment for coronary artery disease (CAD). Despite all medical advances, restenosis remains a challenging clinical problem. However, the molecular and biochemical pathways of restenotic process are not fully understood yet. Furthermore, as restenosis is assumed to be a multigenetic process and genetic predisposition is considered an important risk factor, analysis of the genome-wide gene expression is recommended for better insight of the phenomenon. We used microarray technology to monitor thousands of genes expression simultaneously. The whole genome expression will be analyzed with this technique to identify cluster of up-regulated and down-regulated genes which may be involved in this complex pathological condition.

DESIGN
Coronary restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention remains a challenging problem, despite all medical advances. Molecular and biochemical pathways of restenotic process are not fully understood yet. Furthermore, as restenosis is assumed to be a multigenetic process. We used microarray technology to monitor thousands of genes expression simultaneously in restenosis postive group with reference restenosis negative group, which will unravel potentially modifiable pathways, possible targets and biomarkers for coronary restenosis.
