ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Define regulated genes upon 24 hours of glucosamine treatment in KMH2 and Ramos

DESIGN
A total of 8 samples were analysed. 6 samples constitute three biological replicas of KMH2 before and after 24 hours of glucosamine treatment. 2 samples are before and after 24 hours of glucosamine treatment of Ramos cell line.
