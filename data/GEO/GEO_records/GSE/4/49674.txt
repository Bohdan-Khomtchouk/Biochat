Analysis of circulating microRNAs in adrenocortical tumours

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Differential diagnosis of adrenocortical adenoma and carcinoma is of pivotal clinical relevance, as the prognosis and clinical management of benign and malignant adrenocortical tumours is entirely different. Circulating microRNAs are promising biomarker candidates of malignancy in several tumours. In the present study we investigate circulating microRNAs in adrenocortical tumours and to evaluate their potential applicability as biomarkers of malignancy.
