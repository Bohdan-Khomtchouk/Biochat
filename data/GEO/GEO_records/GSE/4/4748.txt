TITLE
A cyanobacterial LPS antagonist prevents endotoxin shock and blocks sustained TLR4 stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A cyanobacterial LPS antagonist prevents endotoxin shock and blocks sustained TLR4 stimulation required for cytokine expression.  We report the identification and biologic characterization of an LPS-like molecule extracted from the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria Planktothrix FP1 (CyP). Keywords: different ligands
