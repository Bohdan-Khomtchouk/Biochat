TITLE
RNA-Seq of control and ELL2-depleted MPC11 plasmacytoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report RNA-Seq data from MPC11 plasmacytoma cell lines transduced with either control hairpins (shGFP) or hairpins targeting the transcriptional elongation factor ELL2.  ELL2 has been identified as regulating the alternative splicing and polyadenylation of immunoglobulin pre-mRNA, and is highly expressed by plasma cells but not other B cells.  Notably, ELL2 drives the accumulation of transcripts encoding secreted immunoglobulin at the expense of membrane-associated transcripts.  This study sought to examine the impact of ELL2 on mRNA processing at the transcriptome level, and found that ELL2 controls the alternative processing of 12% of annotated transcripts in MPC11 cells.

DESIGN
Examination of pre-mRNA  splicing patterns in either control or ELL2-depleted cells
