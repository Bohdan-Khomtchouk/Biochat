TITLE
RNA-seq in whole mouse embryos at stage E10.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An increasing number of studies, including mutant expression profiling and comparative transcriptomic analyses, require reference RNA-seq data collections in mice. Particularly, to complement previous profiling data sets based on arrays, a full RNA-seq developmental series will be required for whole embryos. E10.5 is a key reference stage as it represents the early organogenesis stage. Here, we have performed high-throughput sequencing of total RNA form whole mice embryos at embryonic stage E10.5.

DESIGN
Sequencing of the total RNA of whole embryos of mouse at embryonic stage E10.5.
