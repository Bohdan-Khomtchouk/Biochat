TITLE
Transcriptional Responses of Schistosoma japonicum Exposed in vivo to Sub-Lethal Dosages of Praziquantel

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
We have used a Schistosoma japonicum infected murine model with in vivo sub-lethal dosages of praziquantel against adult parasites. Differential gene expression of parasites was followed between 30 minutes and 24 hours post- drug administration, using a whole transcriptome microarray platform. Differential gene expression was considered separately between parasite gender.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from adult (7 week post cercarial challenge) Schistosoma japonicum male and females.  Gene expression was determined through hybridisation on an Agilent custom designed oligo microarray.
