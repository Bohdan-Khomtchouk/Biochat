TITLE
RNA sequencing of SHP -/- knockout mouse transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Goal of this study is to identify annotated and non-annotated genes transcriptionally regulated by small heterodime partner (SHP, Nrob2) expression.

DESIGN
Liver 5' capped RNA samples from three SHP -/- and three wild type mice were sequenced with Illumina GAII sequencer.
