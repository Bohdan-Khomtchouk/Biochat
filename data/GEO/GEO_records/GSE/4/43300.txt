1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D Promotes Negative Feedback Regulation of Toll-Like Receptor Signaling via Targeting MicroRNA-155-SOCS1 in Macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The negative feedback mechanism is essential to maintain effective immunity and tissue homeostasis. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) modulates innate immune response, but the mechanism remains poorly understood. Here we report that vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling attenuates Toll-like receptor-mediated inflammation by enhancing the negative feedback inhibition. VDR inactivation leads to a hyperinflammatory response in mice and macrophage cultures when challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) due to miR-155 overproduction that excessively suppresses SOCS1, a key regulator that enhances the negative feedback loop. Deletion of miR-155 attenuates vitamin D suppression of LPS-induced inflammation, confirming that 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulates SOCS1 by down-regulating miR-155. 1,25(OH)2D3 down-regulates bic transcription by inhibiting NF-kappaB activation, which is mediated by a kappaB cis-DNA element located within the first intron of the bic gene. Together these data identify a novel regulatory mechanism for vitamin D to control innate immunity.
