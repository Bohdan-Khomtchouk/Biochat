TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling of HepG2 liver cells after berberine chloride treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from many medicinal herbs such as Coptis chinensis, has a wide range of pharmacological effects including anti-cancer effects. Since xenobiotic drug-induced micoRNAs have recently emerged as key regulators in guiding their pharmacological effects and toxicity, we were interested in whether or not micoRNA expression was differentially altered by berberine treatment in HCC. Here, we used miRNA microarray to analyze microRNA expression profiles of HepG2 human hepatoma cell line after berberine chloride treatment or 0.08% DMSO as control.

DESIGN
Comparing miRNA profiles of 40 µ­M berberine-treated HepG2 human hepatoma cell line to those of control cells sampled after 2 and 4 hours treatment. A 50 mM stock solution of Berberine chloride was prepared in DMSO. Cells were treated with 40 µ­M berberine chloride or 0.08% DMSO as control.
