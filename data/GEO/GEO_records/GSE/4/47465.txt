TITLE
Global Regulation of Alternative Internal Exon Usage by mRNA 3' End Formation Factors [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of samples from Non-silencing, RBFOX2 and CPSF3 knockdown cells. Our analysis shows the role of CPSF-SYMPK in regulation of global alternative splicing.

DESIGN
We analyzed 9 samples using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool. Three techinical replicates were performed.
