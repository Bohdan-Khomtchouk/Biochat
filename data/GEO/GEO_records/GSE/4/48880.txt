TITLE
Notch and VEGF pathways play distinct but complementary roles in tumor angiogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We asked whether combining Notch and VEGF blockade would enhance suppression of tumor angiogenesis and growth, using the NGP neuroblastoma model. NGP tumors were engineered to express a Notch1 decoy construct (N1D), which restricts Notch signaling, and then treated with either the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab or vehicle. Combining Notch and VEGF blockade led to blood vessel regression, increasing endothelial cell apoptosis and disrupting pericyte coverage of endothelial cells. Combined Notch and VEGF blockade did not affect tumor weight, but did additively reduce tumor viability. Our results indicate that Notch and VEGF pathways play distinct but complementary roles in tumor angiogenesis, and show that concurrent blockade disrupts primary tumor vasculature and viability further than inhibition of either pathway alone.

DESIGN
6 neuroblastoma tumors were transfected with Notch1 decoy, 6 with Notch1 decoy and treated with bevacizumab, 6 tumors treated with bevacizumab, and 6 control tumors were profiled by human 133A 2.0 arrays
