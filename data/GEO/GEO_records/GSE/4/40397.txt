TITLE
Small non-coding RNA expression in mouse elongated spermatids

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to discover novel small RNAs expressed in elongated spermatids, we isolated elongated spermatids from mouse testis. The small RNA fraction (18-40nt) was cloned and sequenced from total RNA.

DESIGN
RNAs extracted from elongated spermatids were used for high throughput sequencing analysis
