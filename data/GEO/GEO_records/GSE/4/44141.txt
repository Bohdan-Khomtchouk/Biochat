TITLE
Whole genome mRNA analysis of wild-type and Id2-deficient virus-specific CD8+ T cells after influenza infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2) modulates T cell fate decisions but the molecular mechanism underpinning this regulation is unclear. Here, using whole genome mRNA analysis we show that loss of Id2 programs CD8+ T cells to adopt a memory fate with increased Eomesodermin and Tcf7 expression. Our findings reveal that the Id2-E2A axis orchestrates T cell differentiation through the induction or repression of downstream transcription factors essential for effector and memory T cell differentiation.

DESIGN
Wild-type and Id2fl/flLckCre+ DbNP366-specific CD8+ T cells were isolated from the spleen of  PR8-primed/HKx31-infected Ly5.2+Id2fl/flLckCre+:Ly5.1+ mixed bone marrow chimeric mice ten days after intranasal influenza infection and analysed by whole genome mRNA analysis. Three biological replicates of each genotype were subjected to microarray analysis.
