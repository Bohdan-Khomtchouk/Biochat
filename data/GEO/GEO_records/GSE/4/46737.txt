TITLE
Genome-scale reconstruction of the sigma factor network in E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of transcription start sites for Escherichia coli under different conditions. By obtaining sequence from 5' RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) followed by deep sequencing, we generated genome-wide TSS (transcription start site) maps for E. coli.  This TSS-map was integrated with ChIP-chip data generated for 6 sigma factors in E. coli, resulting in reconstruction of sigma factor network in E. coli.

DESIGN
Examination of transcription start sites by biological duplicates from E. coli for 3 different conditions
