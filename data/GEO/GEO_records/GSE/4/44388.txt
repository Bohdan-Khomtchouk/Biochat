TITLE
Gene expression changes in C57Bl/6 and CD16-/- murine bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) following overnight stimulation with OVA or OVA-immune complex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Atopic asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lungs that is commonly associated with a Th2 response. The role of allergen-specific IgG in the initiation and development of allergic airway inflammation is still poorly understood; however, a receptor of IgG-immune complexes, CD16, has been demonstrated to promote augmentation of Th2 responses. To identify what genes downstream of CD16 signaling may be contributing to development of a Th2 response, we use ovalbumin (OVA) as our model antigen and compared wildtype and CD16-/- BMDCs that were treated overnight with OVA or OVA-immune complex.

DESIGN
C57Bl/6 and CD16-/- BMDCs were treated for 24 hours with OVA or OVA-immune complex and then analyzed for gene expression changes.
