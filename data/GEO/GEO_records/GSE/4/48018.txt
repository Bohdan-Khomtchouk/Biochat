TITLE
Time series of global gene expression after trivalent influenza vaccination in humans (male cohort)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of the study was to assess the patterns of global gene expression in peripheral blood cells before and at three time points after the administration of a trivalent influenza vaccine in human male subjects, and to relate these to the antibody response to the vaccine. The antibody titer data for these subjects is provided as a supplemental file.

DESIGN
119 healthy male human volunteers ages 19 - 41 years were recruited in the study. Whole-blood RNA samples were collected in PaxGene tubes before and at three time points after administration of a trivalent influenza vaccine. Baseline samples (before vaccination) are labeled as day 0. The three additional time points are days 1, 3, and 14 after vaccination. A total of 431 arrays, corresponding to 116 individuals, passed quality control and are included in this data set. These are distributed as follows:  Day 0: 111 Samples  Day 1: 110 Samples  Day 3: 101 Samples  Day 14: 109 Samples
