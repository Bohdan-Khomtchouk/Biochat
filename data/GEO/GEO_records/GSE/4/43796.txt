TITLE
microRNA expression of pancreatic tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of pancreas (SPN), ductal adenocarcinoma (PCA), neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and non-neoplastic pancreas. comparison with gene expression of tumors and non-tumors

DESIGN
To investigate the specific microRNA expression of SPN compared to other types of pancreatic tumor, we analyzed large-scale microRNA expressioin analysis to identify the molecular signature that may affect SPN tumorigenesis with mRNA expression profiles. Differentially expressed microRNAs were analyzed on SPNs, PCAs, NETs and Non-neoplastic tissues.
