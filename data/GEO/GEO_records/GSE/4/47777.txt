SUMMARY
C/EBPβ is an important regulator of oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Here we show that C/EBPγ, a heterodimeric partner of C/EBPβ whose biological functions are not well understood, inhibits cellular senescence. Cebpg-/- MEFs proliferated poorly, entered senescence prematurely, and expressed a pro-inflammatory gene signature, including elevated levels of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes whose induction by oncogenic stress requires C/EBPβ. The senescence-suppressing activity of C/EBPγ required its ability to heterodimerize with C/EBPβ. Covalently linked C/EBPβ homodimers (β~β) inhibited the proliferation and tumorigenicity of RasV12-transformed NIH3T3 cells, activated SASP gene expression, and recruited the CBP co-activator in a Ras-dependent manner, whereas γ~β heterodimers lacked these capabilities and efficiently rescued proliferation of Cebpg-/- MEFs. C/EBPβ depletion partially restored growth of C/EBPγ-deficient cells, indicating that the increased levels of C/EBPβ homodimers in Cebpg-/- MEFs inhibit proliferation. The proliferative functions of C/EBPγ are not restricted to fibroblasts, as hematopoietic progenitors from Cebpg-/- bone marrow also displayed impaired growth. Furthermore, high CEBPG expression correlated with poorer clinical prognoses in several human cancers, and C/EBPγ depletion decreased proliferation and induced senescence in lung tumor cells. Our findings demonstrate that C/EBPγ neutralizes the cytostatic activity of C/EBPβ through heterodimerization, which prevents senescence and suppresses basal transcription of SASP genes.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were isolated at E13.5 and propagated.  At passage 3 cells were plated with equal density and collected 48 hours later.
