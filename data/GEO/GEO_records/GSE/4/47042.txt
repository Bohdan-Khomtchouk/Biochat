TITLE
Discovery of the p53 targetome in MCF7 cells from RNA-seq data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq and ChIP-seq on MCF-7 breast cancer cell line upon activation of p53 by the non-genotoxic small molecule Nutlin-3a

DESIGN
RNA-seq on MCF7 without (NS) or with Nutlin-3a stimulation (S), in duplicate, using illumina HiSeq 2000
