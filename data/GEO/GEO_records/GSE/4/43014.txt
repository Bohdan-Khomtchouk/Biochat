TITLE
Gene expression profiles in the embryonic midgut of Id2 knockout and wild-type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Id2 knockout mice develop heterotopic gastric tissues in the small intestine during development. To gain a mechanistic insight into the cell fate conversion in the Id2 knockout midgut endoderm, we performed microarray analysis using RNA samples extracted from midgut tissues at E13.5.

DESIGN
We analyzed the gene expression patterns in the midgut of E13.5 Id2KO embryos compared to that of wild-type by microarrays.
