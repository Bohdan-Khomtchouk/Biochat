TITLE
Generation of oligodendroglial cells by direct lineage conversion

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report the generation of induced oligodendrocyte precursor cells (iOPCs) by direct lineage conversion. Forced expression of the three transcription factors Sox10, Olig2 and Zfp536 was sufficient to convert mouse and rat fibroblasts into iOPCs with morphologies and gene expression signatures that resemble OPCs.

DESIGN
We compared the global gene expression pattern of iOPCs, fibroblasts, primary OPCs from the neonatal rat brain, and their differentiated progeny. We purified iOPCs by O4 immunopanning three weeks after infection and extracted total RNA. Acutely isolated rat cortical OPCs were either used directly for RNA extraction or expanded in mitogen-containing media for 24h before switching into differentiation medium, lacking PDGF/NT-3 and containing T3. Cells were harvested for microarray analysis 3 and 6 days after induction of differentiation.
