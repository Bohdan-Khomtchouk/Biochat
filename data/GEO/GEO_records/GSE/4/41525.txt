TITLE
Combinatorial treatment of DNMT inhibitor and LSD1 inhibitor results in cell growth inhibition and reexpression of epigenetically silenced genes (methylation)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A combinatorial treatment consisting of a DNMTi and a LSD1i shows synergistic effects in reactivating aberrantly silenced genes by enriching H3K4me2 and H3K4me.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 8 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HM450 Human Methylation Beadchip
