TITLE
Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1 : Wild type treated with tetracycline vs. harboring plasmid (pAST2) treated with tetracycline

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. oleivorans DR1 cells comparing tetracylcline-treated wild type cells with tetracycline-treated DR1 cell harboring pAST2.

DESIGN
To identify genes important for tetracycline stress response in A. oleivorans DR1 and A. oleivorans DR1 harboring pAST2, the cells were grown to exponential phase (OD600 ~0.4) and treated with tetracycline (1Î¼g/ml) over a period of 15 min.
