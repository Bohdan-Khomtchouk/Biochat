TITLE
Using Blood-Informative Transcripts in Geographical Genomics: Impact of Lifestyle on Gene Expression in Fijians

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study explores the impact of lifestyle and environment on gene expression through whole transcriptome profiling of peripheral blood samples in Fijian population (native Melanesians and Indians) living in the rural and urban areas.

DESIGN
41 individuals (14 urban Melanesians, 10 rural Melanesians and 17 urban Indians) of both gender were sampled under informed consents. Only healthy individuals aged between 18 and 65 were sampled. RNA from each sample was hybridized to an Illumina array. No replicates were done in this study
