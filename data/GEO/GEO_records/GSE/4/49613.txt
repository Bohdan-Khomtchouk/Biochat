TITLE
Regulatory consequences of ZNF395 knock-down in MDA-LM2-shTARBP2 cell-line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
shRNA-mediated knock-down followed by transcriptomic profiling revealed that silencing of ZNF395 resulted in a significant up-regulation in several key oncogenes.

DESIGN
ZNF395 was knocked-down, via expression of short-hairpin RNAs targeting its transcript. The cells were then subjected to transcripome profiling in comparison to mock-transfected cells.
