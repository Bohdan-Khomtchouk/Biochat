SUMMARY
Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) is a disease characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and aberrant systolic and/or diastolic function.  We previously developed two transgenic mouse models that carry FHC associated mutations in  alpha-tropomyosin (TM):  FHC  alpha-TM175 mice show patchy areas of mild ventricular disorganization and limited hypertrophy; whereas FHC  alpha-TM180 mice exhibit severe hypertrophy and fibrosis and die within 6 months.  To obtain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with the early onset of cardiac hypertrophy, we conducted a detailed comparative analysis of gene expression in 2.5-month-old control and FHC  alpha-TM175 and  alpha-TM180 ventricular tissue.  Results show that 754 genes (from a total of 22,600) were differentially expressed between the NTG and the FHC hearts.  There are 178 differentially regulated genes between NTG and the FHC  alpha-TM175 hearts, 388 genes are differentially expressed between NTG and FHC  alpha-TM180 hearts, and 266 genes are differentially expressed between FHC  alpha-TM175 and FHC  alpha-TM180 hearts.  Genes that exhibit the largest increase in expression belong to the " secreted/extracellular matrix " category, and those with the most significant decrease in expression are associated with " metabolic enzymes.
