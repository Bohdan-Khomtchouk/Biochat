TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana:goniothalamin-treated seedlings versus control seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings treated with goniothalamin, highlighting to the physiological function of phytochemicals by observing early response of gene expressions in Arabidopsis seedlings.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, goniothalamin-treated seedlings vs. control seedlings. Biological replicates:2 control replicates, 2 goniothalamin-treated.
