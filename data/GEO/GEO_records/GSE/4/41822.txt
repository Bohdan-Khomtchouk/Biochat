TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Campylobacter jejuni wild-type 81-176 and its ciprofloxacin-resistant derivative (P3) in the presence and absence of ciprofloxacin

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni 81-176

SUMMARY
Campylobacter jejuni is one of the most important zoonotic enteric bacterial pathogens able to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of various animals. The number of campylobacteriosis cases has increased worldwide and the particular concern has been the high level of fluoroquinolone resistance observed in C. jejuni isolates. In this study, we explored the effect of ciprofloxacin in Campylobacter jejuni by gene expression microarray analysis. The comparisons of transcriptional responses were performed in the absence and presence of ciprofloxacin with the wild-type strain 81-176 and its intermediate-resistant variant (P3). The resistant variant contained a single-nucleotide mutation causing amino acid change Asp-90-Asn in the gyrA gene instead of the most common Thr-86-Ile, causing a high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin. After the short-term exposure to a relatively high concentration of ciprofloxacin, the viability of C. jejuni 81-176 wild-type cells remained notably high when compared with other gram-negative bacteria. The general responses of short-term ciprofloxacin exposure were determined from both genetic backgrounds and resulted in the expression variation of genes participating in general cellular processes, e.g. , in carbon and amino-acid metabolism and protein transport.

DESIGN
Ciprofloxacin effect for gene expression was measured from both genetic backgrounds after 1 hour exposure at the level of 0 and 8 Âµg/ml ciprofloxacin in MH-broth. For RNA isolation, 5 independent experiments with and without ciprofloxacin were performed, and 4 replicates of each total RNA was applied for the gene expression study.
