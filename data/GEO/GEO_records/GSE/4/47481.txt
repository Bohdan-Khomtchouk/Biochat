TITLE
NELF-dependent transcription activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Jurkat T-cells were latently infected with a defective HIV provirus carrying a GFP reporer gene.  The cells were superinfected with a lentiviral vector expressing shRNA to NELF-E.  The impact of NELF-depletion on RNAP II distribution on cellular genes and the HIV provirus was measured by ChIP-Seq. Data sets contained between 45 and 56 million mapped reads

DESIGN
Four samples were compared: Control shRNA, NELF-E shRNA, Control shRNA plus TNF-a, NELF-E shRNA plus TNF-a.
