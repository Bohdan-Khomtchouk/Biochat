TITLE
Parallel SNP and CGH arrays of cytogenetic normal MDS patients and detection of alterations present in CD3+ T cells and bone marrow cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fifty per cent of myelodysplastic syndromes has a normal karyotype. Genomic microarray allows the detection of alterations in this subset of cases. There to different types of genomic arrays: CGH and SNP array. In this study we want to compare both platforms and check the ability

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from bone marrow or peripheral blood and, in some cases, also lymphocytes CD3 isolated from peripheral blood samples. Copy number analyses of Affymetrix 6.0 SNP arrays were performed for 22 MDS with normal karyotype. There are also 7 samples from lymphocytes CD3 isolated from peripheral blood, which were used as germ-line DNA (control).
