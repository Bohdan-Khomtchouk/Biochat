TITLE
Campylobacter jejuni Cj1000 regulon

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Transcriptional regulation mediates adaptation of pathogens to environmental stimuli and is important for host colonisation. The Campylobacter jejuni genome sequence reveals a surprisingly small set of regulators, mostly of unknown function, suggesting an intricate regulatory network. Interestingly, C. jejuni lacks the homologues of ubiquitous regulators involved in stress response found in many other Gram-negative bacteria. Nonetheless, cj1000 is predicted to code for the sole LysR-type regulator in the C. jejuni genome, and thus may be involved in major adaptation pathways. A cj1000 mutant strain was constructed and found to be attenuated in its ability to colonise 1-day old chicks. Complementation of cj1000 mutation restored the colonisation ability to that of wild type levels. The mutant strain was also outcompeted in a competitive colonisation assay of the piglet intestine. High resolution oxygraphy was carried out for the first time on C. jejuni and revealed a role for Cj1000 in controlling O2 consumption. Furthermore, microarray analysis of the cj1000 mutant revealed both direct and indirect regulatory targets, including genes involved in energy metabolism and oxidative stress defences. These results highlight the importance of Cj1000 regulation in host colonisation and in major physiological pathways.

DESIGN
Microarray data was collected from three independent biological replicates and 3-9 technical replicates for each biological replicate.
