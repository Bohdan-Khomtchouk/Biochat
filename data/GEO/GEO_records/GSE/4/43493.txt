TITLE
Noncoding RNA expression profiling of cisplatin-resistant cells derived from the A549 lung cell line (lncRNA and mRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the signaling networks that are dysregulated in cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung cancer, noncoding RNA expression data were obtained from, and compared between, the lung adenocarcinoma cell line, A549, and its cisplatin-resistant derivative, A549/CDDP.

DESIGN
Noncoding RNA expression data from a cisplatin-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell line (A549) were collected and compared to noncoding RNA expression data from a cisplatin-resistant cell line (A549/CDDP). 3 independent experiments were completed for both the sensitive and resistant cell lines.
