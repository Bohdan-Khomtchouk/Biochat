TITLE
TDP-43 Neurotoxicity in late D. melanogaster pupae

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to understand the mechanisms of TDP-43 neurotoxicity. Here, we perform a RNA-Seq analysis in  TDP-43 gain-of-fucntion (GOF) , TDP-43 loss-of-function and wild-type late pupae heads (73-90 hours APF) and perform TDP-43 GOF vs wild type and TDP-43 LOF vs wild-type differential expression analysis to show that both mechanisms presents defects in ecdysone receptor (ECR)-dependeint transcriptional program switching, and strongly deregulate expression from the neuronal microtubule associated protien Map205.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed in two wild-type D.melanogaster biological replicates (Canton S, w1118 ), four biological replicates for TDP-43 (LOF) with two distinct genotypes (dTDP-43Δ142/Df(2R)106,dTDP-43Δ23/Δ142 ) and two TDP-43 GOF biological replicates (act5c > dTDP-43 ).
