TITLE
Characterization and Comparison of the Leukocyte Transcriptomes of Three Cattle Breeds

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In this study, we use mRNA-Seq to characterize and compare the leukocyte transcriptomes of Holstein, Jersey, and Cholistani with respect to variations in sequence, expression, and splicing.

DESIGN
Poly A+ RNA are extracted from leukocytes of pools of blood drawn from cows of three different breeds, Holstein, Jersey, and Cholistani. The objective of the study is to compare sequence variation and gene expression of the three cattle breeds.
