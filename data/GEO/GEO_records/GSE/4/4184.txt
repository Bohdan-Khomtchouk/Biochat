TITLE
Toxicogenomic Response of Staphylococcus aureus to Peracetic Acid

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed Affymetrix Staphylococcus aureus GeneChip arrays to investigate the dynamics of global gene expression profiles during the cellular response of Staphylococcus aureus to peracetic acid, which involved initial growth inhibition and subsequent partial recovery. Keywords: Time course
