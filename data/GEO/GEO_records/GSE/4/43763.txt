TITLE
EBF2 determines and maintains brown adipocyte identity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared PPARg binding sites in BAT and eWAT to identify regulatory elements that contribute to BAT identity and to find an important factor that bind those elements. To this end, we performed PPARg ChIP-seq in both tissues and called each tissue-spsecific binding sites.

DESIGN
PPARg ChIP-seq in BAT and eWAT of mice
