TITLE
Gene expression profile of canine mammary malignancy

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Molecular mechanisms of the canine mammary malignancy. RNA isolated from canine mammary tumours of the 3rd grade of malignancy was pooled and hybrydized on the same microarray as RNA isolated from canine mammary tumours of the 1st grade of malignancy. Based on the results the " malignancy portrait " was assessed.

DESIGN
Dye-swap experiment, gene expression in the most malignant canine mammary tumours (the 3rd grade of malignancy) was compared to the less malignant tumours (1st grade of malignancy).
