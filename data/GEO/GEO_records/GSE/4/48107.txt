TITLE
INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) and its receptors HAE/HSL2 are  required for cell expansion and cell separation during floral organ abscission in Arabidopsis thaliana (part 2)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plants have the ability to shed organs that are no longer in use. In Arabidopsis thaliana abscission of floral organs involves cell wall remodeling and cell expansion prior to cell wall dissolution.  IDA encodes a secreted peptide that signals through the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) HAESA (HAE) (At4g28490) and HASEA-LIKE2 (HSL2) (At5g65710).

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Colombia-0)  plants were kept in growth chambers with a 16/8 h (light/dark) photoperiod at 22 Â°C, and 100 mE m-2 s-1 light intensity. 4 biological replicates were prepared from each sample, each containing abscission zone regions of siliques position 4 to 8 (when counting from the flowe at anthesis at the top of the inflorescence) from  plants with at least 20 siliques. Differences in transcriptional responses were measured by comparing genes expression in abscission zones of ida-2  plants  (SALK_133209) against abscission zones from control plants.
