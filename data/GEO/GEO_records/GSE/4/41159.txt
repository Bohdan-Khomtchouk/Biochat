TITLE
Gene expression from the rice leaf elongation zone of 7th leaf under various soil moisture treatments

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Leaf rate elongation is extremely sensitive to soil water status. Global gene expression of the leaf elongation zone was profiled at three different levels of soil moisture in two genotypes. Leaf elongation in IR64 is more sensitive to decreased soil moisture than in moroberekan.

DESIGN
2 genotypes: IR64, Moroberekan; 3 treatments: FTSW 1, FTSW 0.5, FTSW 0.2
