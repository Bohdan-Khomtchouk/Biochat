TITLE
Expression data from mouse cerebral cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression of cerebral cortex might be responsible for distinct neurovascular developments between different mouse strains We used Affymetrix microarray to explore the global gene expression patterns of mouse cerebral cortex of different mouse strains at two developmental stages

DESIGN
Cerebral cortex from two mouse strains [C57BL/6J(B6) and C3H/J (C3H)] at post-natal day 1 (p1) and post-natal 11 weeks (11 wk) were harvested for microarray experiments
