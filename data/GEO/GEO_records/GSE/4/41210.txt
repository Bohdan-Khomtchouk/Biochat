TITLE
Integrative genomic and transcriptomic characterization of matched primary and metastatic liver and colorectal carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Somatic copy number alterations of 17 paired tumor and metastasis tissue samples were measured by Agilent array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).  Seven colon adenocarcinomas with paired liver metastasis and 10 liver carcinoma with metastasis to the lymph node, adrenal gland or lung were analyzed.

DESIGN
17 paired tumor and metastasis tissue samples
