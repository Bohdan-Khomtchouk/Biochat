TITLE
Expression data from wild type and Gata6-deficient tissue resident peritoneal macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tissue resident macrophages are notoriously heterogeneous, exhibiting discrete phenotypes as a consequence of tissue- and micro-anatomical niche-specific functions, but the molecular basis for this is not understood. We resolved a restricted transcriptional profile for the self-renewing population of peritoneal resident macrophages, which is expressed during homeostasis and inflammation and distinct from other MØ. Prominent within this profile was the expression of Gata6. This study represents a characterisation of the role of Gata6 in peritoneal resident macrophage phenotype. We used microarrays to determine the patterns of gene expression in peritoneal resident MØ in the absence of GATA-6 against wild type.

DESIGN
Conditional 'floxed' Gata6 deficient sex-matched mice between 7 weeks old were compared against wild type
