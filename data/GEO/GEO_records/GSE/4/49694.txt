TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Cox4-2 knockout mice after OVA challenge

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is a 13-subunit enzyme that is a key complex of the oxidative phosphorylation system of the mitochondria, which generates the vast majority of the energy of the cell.COX subunit IV is the largest nuclear-encode subunit with important regulatory functions concerning energy metabolism. COX4-2 has been knocked out. Our study indicated strong expression of Cox4-2 in lung and therefore we test this mutant line under OVA-challenge conditions expecting a new asthma mouse model.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 1/2 lung of 4 female mice of each analysed group (widltype, wildtype challenged, mutant, mutant challenged)
