TITLE
Integrated analysis of transcript level regulation of metabolism during human adipocyte differentiation [time course]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we have focused on studying the link between metabolic changes driven by the differentiation into mature adipocytes of a human preadipocyte cell line (SGBS) and their regulation, through a combined experimental and computational approach. By collecting data on gene expression, PPARg, CEBPa, LXR and H3K4me3 genome-wide ChIP-seq profles and transcriptome-wide microRNA target identification for miR-27a, miR29a and miR-222, and using constraint-based modeling to estimate metabolic reaction activity, we obtained a comprehensive set of information highlighting how epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation impacts the metabolic network.

DESIGN
Illumina HT12 microarrays: Time series of differentiation (20 samples, 7 time points in duplicate or triplicate) This is the Illumina Gene Expression part of the study.
