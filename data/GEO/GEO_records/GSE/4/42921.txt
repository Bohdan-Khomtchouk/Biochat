TITLE
DNA methylation in a validation cohort of colon mucosa samples from individuals with Crohns' disease or ulcerative colitis and normal controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and normal colon mucosa samples. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip v1.1 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across 482,421 CpGs in colon mucosa samples. Samples came from 5 Crohn's disease affected, 5 ulcerative colitis affected, and 12 normal individuals. One ulcerative colitis sample was assayed before and after treatment with infliximab and mesalamine.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 23 samples were hybridized to the  Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip v1.1
