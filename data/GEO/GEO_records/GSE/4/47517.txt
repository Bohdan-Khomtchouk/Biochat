TITLE
Effects of Thyroxine Exposure on Osteogenesis in Mouse Calvarial Pre-Osteoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Thyroid hormone has a positive effect on endochondral bone growth. Few studies have looked at the interaction between thyroid hormone exposures and intramembranous bone derived cells. We used microarray as one tool to determine the gene expression profile of intramembranous (calvarial) derived murine pre-osteoblsts after thyroxine exposure.

DESIGN
We isolated whole RNA from MC3T3-E1 cells treated with proliferation media or proliferation media with thyroxine at a dose of 10^-6 mol./liter for 3 or 7 days in culture. We then used an Affymetrix array and compared expression profiles between control and experimental treatments.
