TITLE
Gene expression in human peripheral blood 48 hours after exposure to ionizing radiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of human peripheral blood 48 hours after irradiation ex vivo with graded doses of gamma rays.  Results have been used in building and testing classifiers to predict exposure dose for use in radiological triage, and also provide insight into immune cell responses.  Results were compared with those from earlier times and from patients exposed in vivo.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood from 5 healthy donors was exposed ex vivo to 0. 0.5, 2, 5, or 8 Gy gamma-rays and gene expression was analyzed up to 48 hours after exposure.
