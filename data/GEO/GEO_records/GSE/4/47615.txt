TITLE
The metabolic and regulatory networks of carbohydrate utilization of Thermotoga maritima

ORGANISM
Thermotoga maritima MSB8

SUMMARY
In this study, we combined a subsystem-based comparative genomic approach with experimental validation to reconstruct the metabolic and regulatory networks of carbohydrate utilization in 11 complete genomes from the Thermotogales order.

DESIGN
Exression profiling studies were performed using total RNA isolated from mid log phase cultures of T. maritima grown on minimal media with distinct carbon sources.
