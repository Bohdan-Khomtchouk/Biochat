TITLE
Gene expression in the embryonic Lrrc10 knockout heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LRRC10 is a heart-specific gene required for proper cardiac function. The effects of Lrrc10 deletion on gene expression in the embryonic mouse heart was investigated.

DESIGN
Pregnant heterozygous Lrrc10 knockout mice (Lrrc10+/-) mated to male heterozygous knockouts (Lrrc10+/-), housed in 12 hour light:12 dark, ad lib feeding and drinking conditions, were sacrificed at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) and embryonic hearts were dissected for cardiac gene expression analysis. A two color, reference design experiment in which heart RNA from 2 Lrrc10 homozygous knockout embryos (Lrrc10-/-) were pooled and labeled with Cy5 and hybridized according to Agilent protocols against a reference pool of RNA madeup from respective tissue taken from littermate E15.5 wildtype (Lrrc10+/+) hearts and labeled with Cy3.
