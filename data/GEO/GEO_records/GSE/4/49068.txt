TITLE
HepG2 treated with two Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (benzo[a]anthracene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain deeper insight into the mechanism of toxicity, it is important to identify and characterize miRNAs profiles involved in responses to specific classes of toxicants in conjunction with their impact on gene expression levels. However, few reports have described the effects of toxicants on miRNA expression profiles. Taking into account the prominent role of miRNAs in cancer development, progression, cell cycle control, and proliferation-related processes, it is likely that miRNAs are involved in the toxic response induced by carcinogens. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a well-characterized class of human carcinogens. In the present study, we documented the different expression profiles of miRNAs in environmental carcinogen-exposed HepG2 cells by miRNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
To evaluate the change in miRNA expression levels, human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells were exposed to two PAHs (benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[k]fluoranthene) for 48 h. miRNA expression analysis was conducted using a 8x16k human miRNA microarray (Agilent Technologies, USA).
