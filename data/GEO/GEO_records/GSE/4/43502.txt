TITLE
Identification of Prognosis-Relevant Subgroups in Patients with Chemoresistant Triple Negative Breast Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy generally have worse outcome; however, some patients with residual tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy do not relapse. We hypothesize that there are subgroups of chemoresistant TNBC patients with different prognosis. In this study, 25 chemoresistant samples from 47 neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated TNBC (The Methodist Hospital) are chosen for study

DESIGN
We used gene expression data of TNBC patients with residual disease and different prognosis to molecularly define the clinically relevant subgroups, and developed a 7-gene prognostic signature for chemoresistant TNBCs
