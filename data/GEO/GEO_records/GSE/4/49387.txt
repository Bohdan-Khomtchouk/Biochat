TITLE
Gene expression profiling of liver-specific NCOR knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We profiled gene expression in livers depleted of NCOR (nuclear receptor corepressor) along with wild-type livers as control.

DESIGN
NCOR floxed mice were intravenously injected with adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing Cre or GFP. Livers were harvested at 2-weeks post-injection at 5pm (ZT10). Total RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrx Mouse Gene 2.0 array.
