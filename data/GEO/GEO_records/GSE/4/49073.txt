TITLE
Gene expression from NMuMG cells overexpressing major satellite treated with TGFbeta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although heterochromatin is enriched with repressive traits, it is also actively transcribed, giving rise to large amounts of non-coding RNAs. Although these RNAs are responsible for the formation and maintenance of heterochromatin, little is known about how their transcription is regulated. Here we show that the Snail1 transcription factor represses pericentromeric transcription, acting through the H3K4 deaminase LOXL2. Since Snail1 plays a key role in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), we analyzed the regulation of mouse heterochromatin transcription in this process. At the onset of EMT, one of the major structural heterochromatin proteins, HP1a, is transiently released from heterochromatin foci in a Snail1/LOXL2â€“dependent manner during EMT, concomitantly with a down-regulation of major satellite transcription. Global transcriptome analysis indicated that ectopic expression of heterochromatin transcripts affects the transcription profile of EMT-related genes. Additionally, preventing the down-regulation of major satellite transcripts compromised the migratory and invasive behavior of mesenchymal cells. We propose that Snail1 regulates heterochromatin transcription through the histone-modifying enzyme, LOXL2, thus creating the favorable transcriptional state necessary for completing EMT.
