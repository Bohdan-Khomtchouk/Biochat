TITLE
Sub-chronic forestomach transcriptional response in adult male MutaTMMouse following oral exposure to benzo(a)pyrene

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Benzo(a)pyrene is a well-established human carcinogen in humans and rodents. In the present study, we sought to determine the dose- and time-dependent changes in gene expression upon oral exposure to benzo(a)pyrene. Adult male MutaTMMouse were exposed to three doses of benzo(a)pyrene or vehicle control (olive oil) for 28 days and sacrificed three days after the final exposure.

DESIGN
This experiment examined the forestomach transcriptional response of male mice exposed to BaP for 28 days at three different doses, including D1 (25 mg/kg BW/day), D2 (50 mg/kg BW/day), and D3 (75 mg/kg BW/day) and vehicle control.  Each dose group was examined 72 hours following the final exposure.  Each dose group and time point had 4-5 biological replicates. There were a total 17 samples (arrays) included in the final analysis using a two-colour reference design.
