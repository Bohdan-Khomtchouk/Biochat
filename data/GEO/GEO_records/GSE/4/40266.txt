TITLE
Expression data from TGF-beta-treated human ovarian fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Advanced ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in the United States. Ovarian cancer cells are known to have diminished response to TGF-beta, but it remains unclear whether TGF-beta can modulate ovarian cancer cell growth in an indirect manner through cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Using transcriptome profiling analyses on TGF-beta-treated ovarian fibroblasts, we identified a TGF-beta-responsive gene signature in ovarian fibroblasts. Identifying TGF-beta-regulated genes in the ovarian microenvironment helps in understanding the role of TGF-beta in ovarian cancer progression.

DESIGN
The human telomerase-immortalized ovarian fibroblast line NOF151 was treated with 5ng/mL of either TGF-beta-1 or TGF-beta-2. Total RNA was isolated from control samples and TGF-beta-treated fibroblasts samples at 48 hours post-treatment, followed by cDNA synthesis, IVT and biotin labeling. Samples were then hybridized onto Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. For each treatment group, three independent samples were prepared for the microarray experiment.
