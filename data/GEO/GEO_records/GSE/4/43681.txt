TITLE
miRNA 135b regulation of inflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RT-PCR analysis of inflammatory cytokines and receptors in pEGP-miR-135b over-expressing cells compard to controls (pEGP-miR-null) using pathway-specific PCR arrays for the evaluation of mouse inflammatory cytokines and receptors (#PAMM-011D).

DESIGN
qPCR array gene expression profiling. This experiment examined the transcriptional response of NIH3T3 cells over-expressing pEGP-miR-135b. Total RNA (n = 3 per group) was used with SABiosciences pathway-specific PCR arrays for inflammatory cytokines and receptors (#PAMM-011D).
