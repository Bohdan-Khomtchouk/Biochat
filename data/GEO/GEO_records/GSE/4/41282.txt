TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from human renal cell cancer subtypes

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs play a vital role in the process of tumorigenesis. To identify and characterize miRNA Expression in renal cell cancer, we performed microarray based screening of miRNA expression profiles in clear cell, papillary type 1 and papillary type 2 renal cell cancer.
