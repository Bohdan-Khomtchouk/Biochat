SUMMARY
Voltage gated calcium channels play a central role in regulating the electrical and biochemical properties of neurons and muscle cells.  Cells coordinate the expression of voltage gated calcium channels with the expression of other proteins that regulate membrane potential and calcium homeostasis.  We report that the C-terminus of CaV 1.2, an L-type calcium channel (LTC) contains a C-terminal fragment that translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription.  This calcium channel associated transcription factor (CCAT) associates with transcriptional co-regulators such as p54nrb/NonO and binds to endogenous promoters.  CCAT regulates the expression of gap junctions, sodium calcium exchangers, NMDA receptors, potassium channels and other proteins that regulate neuronal signaling.  Electrical activity and developmental processes regulate the nuclear localization of CCAT, suggesting that the CCAT integrates information about the number of LTCs with information about the developmental history and electrical activity of a cell.  These findings provide the first evidence that voltage gated calcium channels can directly activate transcription and suggest a novel mechanism linking voltage gated channels to the function and differentiation of excitable cells.
