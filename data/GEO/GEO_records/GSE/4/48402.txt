TITLE
Transcriptomic comparison of tumoric tissues induced by different c58 agrobacterium lines; Quorum-sensing in Agrobacterium-induced tumors

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs11-03_agro transcriptomic comparison of tumoric tissues induced by different c58 agrobacterium lines What are the functions and the regulatory pathways of the bacterial quorum-sensing system in the context of Agrobacterium/Arabidopsis interactions?

DESIGN
Arabidopsis WT Col0 plants were grown in greenhouse till stage 1.03-1.04 (growth conditions 1). They were then confined in short day conditions and at 22Â°C (growth conditions 2). At stage 5.10 plants were wounded at the base of the stem and part of them were inoculated with 3 different C58 Agrobacterium strains (WT, accR or traI). Eighteen days post inoculation, wounded but non-infected tissues (control) as well as tumoric tissues were collected and processed for RNA extraction. 21 dye-swap
