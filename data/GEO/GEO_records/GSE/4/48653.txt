TITLE
Mbd2 promotes Foxp3 demethylation and T-regulatory cell function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The proposed use of Foxp3+ T-regulatory (Treg) cells as potential cellular therapy in patients with autoimmune diseases, or post-hemopoietic stem cell or organ transplantation, requires a sound understanding of the transcriptional regulation of Foxp3 expression. Conserved CpG dinucleotides in the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) upstream of Foxp3 are demethylated only in stable, thymic-derived Foxp3+ Tregs. Since methyl-binding domain (Mbd) proteins recruit histone-modifying and chromatin-remodeling complexes to methylated sites, we tested whether targeting of Mbd2 might promote demethylation of Foxp3 and thereby promote Treg numbers or function. Surprisingly, while ChIP analysis showed Mbd2 binding to the Foxp3-associated TSDR site in Tregs, Mbd2 targeting by homologous recombination or siRNA decreased Treg numbers and impaired Treg suppressive function in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found complete TSDR demethylation in WT Tregs but > 75% methylation in Mbd2-/- Tregs, whereas re-introduction of Mbd2 into Mbd2-null Tregs restored TSDR demethylation, Foxp3 gene expression and Treg suppressive function. Lastly, Mbd2-/- Tregs had markedly binding of the DNA demethylase enzyme, Tet2, in the TSDR region. These data show that Mbd2 has a key role in promoting TSDR demethylation, Foxp3 expression and Treg suppressive function.

DESIGN
RNA from three independent samples from magnetically separated CD4+CD25+ Treg of MBD2–/– mice, compared to wild type control (all Balb/c background).
