TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in E12.5 mouse forelimbs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The chromatin state in developing body parts provides a zip code to cellular populations that direct their cell fates. We used antibodies for H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and Pol2, to identify the chromatin state signature of the mouse forelimb during mid-gestation, at embryonic day 12. The families of genes marked included those related to transcription, transcriptional regulation, and embryonic organ development. Transcription factors specific for muscle development were characterized by bivalent chromatin, as E12 is a transition time point from embryonic to fetal myogenesis. The identified chromatin state of muscle specific genes was in strong correlation with their observed expression profile.

DESIGN
Examination of the histone marks H3K4me3, H3k27me3, and Pol2 in whole E12.5 forelimnb tissues using the Illumina HiSeq 2000.
