TITLE
Effect of synbindin on the gene expression profile of gastric cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to determine the effect of synbindin on the gene expression profile of gastric cancer cells, MGC-803 cells were infected with adenoviruses carrying either synbindin or GFP. The differentially expressed genes caused by synbindin ectopic expression suggests the underlying mechanism for synbindin-induced cell proliferation.

DESIGN
Total RNA from each sample was amplified and transcribed into fluorescent cRNA using Agilent's Quick Amp Labeling protocol (version 5.7, Agilent Technologies). The labeled cRNAs were hybridized onto the Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray (4 x 44K, Agilent Technologies). After washing, the arrays were scanned by the Agilent Scanner G2505C. 3 replicates per treatment (GFP adenovirus, synbindin adenovirus).
