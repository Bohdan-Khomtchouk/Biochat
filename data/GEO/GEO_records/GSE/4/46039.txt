TITLE
hsa-miR-92a knock down in Flp-in T-REx 293-PTH-AGO1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
transcriptome profiling of miR-92a inhibitor treated and control cells with the aim of measuring miR-92a influence on its mRNA targets Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in gene regulation, but reliable bioinformatic or experimental identification of their targets remains difficult. To provide an unbiased view of human miRNA targets we developed a technique for ligation and sequencing of miRNA-target RNA duplexes associated with human Ago1. Here we report datasets of more than 18,000 high-confidence miRNA-mRNA interactions. The binding of most miRNAs includes the 5' seed region, but around 60% of seed interactions are noncanonical, containing bulged or mismatched nucleotides. Moreover, seed interactions are generally accompanied by specific, non-seed basepairing. 18% of miRNA-mRNA interactions involve the miRNA 3' end, with little evidence for 5' contacts, and some of these were functionally validated. Analyses of miRNA:mRNA basepairing showed that miRNA species systematically differ in their target RNA interactions, and strongly overrepresented motifs were found in the interaction sites of several miRNAs. We speculate that these affect the response of RISC to miRNA-target binding.

DESIGN
In total 10 samples were analyzed, 5 repeats for each experimental condition.
