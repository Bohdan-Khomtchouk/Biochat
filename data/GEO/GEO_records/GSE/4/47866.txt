TITLE
Analysis of miR-203 regulated genes during IFNalpha treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to determine gene expression changes during IFNα treatment as the result of expression or inhibition of miR-203 in A549 cells.

DESIGN
The gene expression profiling experiment was performed with 4 groups (mock infected, IFNα treated, IFNα treated in the presence of exogenous miR-203, and IFNα treated in the presence of miR-203 inhibitor) with 3 biological replicates for each group.  Total RNA was purified from A549 cells that were untreated of treated with IFNα (1000 units/mL) alone or in the presence of miR-203 mimic or inhibitor for 10 hours.
