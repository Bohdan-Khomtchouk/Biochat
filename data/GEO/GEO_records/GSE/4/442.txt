TITLE
Sex-biased gene expression

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Investigatation into how genes with sex-differential expression profiles are distributed among the chromosomes in Drosophila. Assayed the expression of 14,142 predicted transcripts in competitive hybridizations and found a dramatic underrepresentation of X-chromosome genes showing high relative expression in male.  This is the first report of sex-biased expression of the full (predicted) genome. Findings indicate that there is significant sex-biased expression, especially in gonads. Genes showing sex-biased gene expression profiles are likely to have sex-biased functions. Keywords: other
