TITLE
Latent enhancers unveiled by stimulation expand and adapt the available cis-regulatory repertoire (FAIRE-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
According to current models, transcription factors (TFs) activated by extracellular stimuli operate in the context of a pre-established enhancer repertoire induced and maintained by lineage-specific TFs. Here, we uncovered the existence of latent enhancers, defined as regions of the genome that in terminally differentiated cells are poorly accessible and lack the histone marks characteristic of enhancers, but readily acquire these features in response to extracellular cues. Stimulation of resting macrophages caused simultaneous binding of stimulus-activated TFs and lineage-determining TFs to these regions, enabling deposition of enhancer-specific features. Once unveiled, these enhancers did not return to a latent state even when stimulation ceased; instead, they persisted and mediated a faster and stronger response upon restimulation. We suggest that stimulus-specific expansion of the available cis-regulatory repertoire provides an epigenomic memory of the exposure to environmental agents.

DESIGN
Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation Of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE) followed by multiparallel sequencing was performed in untreated murine bone marrow-derived macrophages.
