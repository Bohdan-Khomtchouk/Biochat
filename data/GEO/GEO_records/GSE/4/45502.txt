TITLE
Influence of the two different cryopreservation methods to inflammation of dental pulp cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dental pulp cells of cryopreserved teeth (slow and rapid speed) were examined with microarray for screening which gene is involve in the inflammation process during the cryopreservation process.

DESIGN
Intact caries-free, freshly extracted premolars (n=6) were collected from 3 patients for microarray assay analysis. They were classified as control and cryopreserved groups. Cryopreserved groups were divided into rapid freezing and slow freezing group.
