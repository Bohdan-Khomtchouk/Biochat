TITLE
Gene expression in CF-vs-non CF human airway epithelial cell samples obtained by nasal brushing.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A small-scale whole genome microarray study of gene expression in human native nasal epithelial cells from F508del-CFTR homozygous CF patients and non-CF controls. We used the custom designed Affymetrix HsAirwaya520108F Arrays to compare gene expression in 5 CF and 5 non CF nasal epithelial cell samples.

DESIGN
We analysed a total of 10 samples (5 CF and 5 non CF). The CF group contained 2 males and 3 females, with an average age of 14 years and an average of 6% inflammatory cells per sample, and the non CF group  contained 3 males and 2 females with an average age of 14.8 years and an average of 4.7% inflammatory cells.
