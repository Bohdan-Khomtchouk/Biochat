TITLE
Gene profile from RND1-knock down in MDF10A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed to get gene expression profiles induced by knock-down RND1 gene in MCF10A cells

DESIGN
total RNA extracted from MCF10A cells carrying either sh-RNA targetting RND1 gene (sh-34 or sh-35) or scramble control were subjected to Microarray analysis
