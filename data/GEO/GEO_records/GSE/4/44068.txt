TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression profile of Xenograft Tumors (HT29 cells) grown in Nu/Nu Athymic Female Mice infected with Control (Ad-VP16) or LXRa (VP16hLXRa) Adenovirus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Changes in gene expression profile of Xenograft Tumors (HT29 cells) grown in Nu/Nu Athymic Female Mice infected with Control (Ad-VP16) or LXRa (VP16hLXRa) Adenovirus. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that LXRa overexpression influence cancer growth modulating lipid metabolism in cancer cells. Results provide the information that LXRa induces genes encoding proteins able to regulate cholesterol efflux thus reducing tumor growth.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from Xenograft Tumors (HT29 cells) grown in Nu/Nu Athymic Female Mice infected with LXRa (VP16hLXRa) Adenovirus was compared to total RNA extracted from Xenografted Tumors (HT29 cells) grown in Nu/Nu Athymic Female Mice infected with Control (Ad-VP16) Adenovirus.
