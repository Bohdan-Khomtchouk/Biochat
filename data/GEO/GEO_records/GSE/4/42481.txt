TITLE
miRNA expression profile from ANGPTL1 overexpression lung cancer cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ANGPTL1-overexpressed CL1-5 cells were used to identify miRNAs which regulate EMT, cancer invasion and metastasis. We used microRNA Taqman Low Density Array to identify candidate miRNAs

DESIGN
ANGPTL1-overexpressed CL1-5 cells were analyzed compare to vector control (pcDNA3.1) CL1-5 cells
