TITLE
Gene expression of PBMC of chinese nickel refinery workers when compared to the gene expression profile of PBMCs from referent subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Up to date the studies examining the gene expression profiles in response to exposure to nickel compounds have only been conducted using in vitro tissue culture systems. Here, we have compared the gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMCs) of eight nickel refinery workers in Jinchang, China to the expression profiles of referent subjects with only environmental exposure.

DESIGN
PBMC RNA was collected from eight nickel refinery workers in China and ten reference subjects with only environmental exposure to nickel. PBMC RNA was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Genechip arrays 2.0. Gene expression profiles between nickel refinery workers and referent subjects was compared.
