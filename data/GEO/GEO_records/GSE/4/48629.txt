TITLE
Murine Bone Marrow Macrophages: Control vs. RANKL Stimulated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the microRNAs that are involved in osteoclastogenesis, microRNA expression profiles in mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) stimulated with RANKL (BMOc) were compared with that of control untreated BMMs. These results provide insights into the mechanisms to regulate osteoclastogenesis and  bone resorption activities in osteoclasts by microRNA.
