TITLE
Expression data from human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) infected with type I strains of Toxoplasma gondii.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Type I strains of Toxoplasma gondii exhibit phenotypic variation, but it is uncertain how differently type I strains modulate the host cell. We determined differential host modulation by type I strains through microarray.

DESIGN
HFFs were infected with RH-ERP, RH-JSR and GT1 for 24 hours. Total RNA was isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 arrays.
