TITLE
CGH analysis of Candida albicans strains

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Aneuploidy and the evolution of aneuploid karyotypes of Candida albicans strains was identified using aCGH.  Whole chromosome and segmental aneuploidies, (specifically on the left arm of chromosome 5 - shown to be due to isochromosome formation) are associated with the appearance of resistance to the antifungal drug fluconazole. Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridization
