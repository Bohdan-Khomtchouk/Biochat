TITLE
Expression analyses of red5-2 mutant cells

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in red5-2, compared to the wild-type strain. The mutants analyzed in this study will be described in Sugiyama and Sugiyama.

DESIGN
A mRNA profiling study using total RNA recovered from wild-type culture of fission yeast and red5-2 mutant cultures of fission yeast.  Each chip measures the expression level of 4.997 genes from S.pombe with fourteen 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with seven-fold technical redundancy.
