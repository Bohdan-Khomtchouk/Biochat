TITLE
Fate changes leading to multipotency of isolated mesenchymal cells [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mesenchymal populations include a fraction of cells exhibiting multipotency as well as others with limited differentiation range. It has been assumed that the mesenchymal cellular cascade is topped by a multipotent cell, which gives rise to progeny with diminishing differentiation potentials.  Here we show that cultured mesenchymal cells, a priori exhibiting a limited differentiation potential, may gain new capacities and become multipotent following single cell isolation. These fate changes were accompanied by up-regulation of differentiation promoting genes, many of which also became H4K20me1 methylated. Early events in the process included TGFÎ² and Wnt modulation, and down-regulation of hypoxia signaling. Indeed, hypoxic conditions inhibited the observed cell changes. Overall, cell isolation from neighboring partners caused major molecular changes and particularly, a newly established epigenetic state. It is suggested that MSCs behave non-deterministically and non-hierarchically and should therefore be defined primarily by their capacity to undergo fate changes triggered by environmental cues.

DESIGN
MSC 21 population and one of its derived clones (4L.1.4) were grown to confuence, and IP of fragmented DNA using an antibody directed against H4K20ME1, or non-immune serum (control) was done. Pulled DNA was then sequenced.
