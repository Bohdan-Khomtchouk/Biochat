TITLE
Expression data from two year old shoot apex and mature xylem of Populus tomentosa

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
We take the two year old plant for sampling.Use the Affymetrix poplar gene chip to elucidate the gene functions and mechanisms in Populus tomentosa shoot apex and mature xylem. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in shoot apex and mature xylem.
