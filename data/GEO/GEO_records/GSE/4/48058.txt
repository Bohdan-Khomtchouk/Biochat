TITLE
Exploring the function of the grape regulators VvMYB5a and MYB5b by heterologous expression in anthocyanin petunia mutants

ORGANISM
Petunia axillaris

SUMMARY
To obtain insights about the roles of VvMYB5a and VvMYB5b, here we perform complementation analyses using petunia regulatory mutants impaired in pigment accumulation in flower epidermis, proven to be a valid tool for gene functional studies.
