TITLE
Functional DNA methylation is accompanied by chromatin accessibility [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of nucleosome positioning and chromatin state by using CpG methyltransferase M.SssI to methylate nuclei. Unmethylated regions that gain methylation (low to high beta value) are known to be accessible and nucleosome depleted. Method used to study changes after epigenetic drug treatments identified that majority of demethylation events are not accompanied by chromatin accessibility changes.

DESIGN
RNA harvested from cells post epigenetic drug treatment, with 5-Aza-CdR or SAHA
