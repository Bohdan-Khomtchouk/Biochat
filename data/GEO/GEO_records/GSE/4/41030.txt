TITLE
Chronic kidney disease and splicing events

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Renal failure is associated with accumulation of various solutes called Uremic toxins. Post transcriptional regulation related to Chronic kidney disease (CKD) have already been described as RNA based silencing with micro RNA or modifications of mRNA degradation. Until now, alternative splice modification was not mentioned in the course of CKD. However, CKD is associated with modification of gene expression. The aim of the study was to explore modification of the alternative splice pattern in the course in CKD.

DESIGN
The expression level of individual exons expression in human fibroblast were compared after culture to 96 hours of uremic condition or control condition. Three independant experiments were performed
