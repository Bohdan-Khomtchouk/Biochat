TITLE
Genotyping of paired samples of normal colon and colon adenocarcinoma to estimate copy-number alterations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
22 pairs of normal colon\colon adenocarcinoma samples were genotyped using Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip to estimate copy number alterations

DESIGN
Genomic DNA of 22 colon adenocarcinoma samples and 22 corresponding normal colon samples were genotyped using Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip to estimate copy number alterations.
