TITLE
CpG-mediated changes in gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The current study was designed to identify reproducible changes in gene activation over time induced by CpG DNA stimulation. Towards that end, the expression of 11,300 genes was examined at 2, 4 and 8 h after murine spleen cells were treated with CpG ODN. Results provide insight into the nature, breadth and magnitude of the response elicited by CpG DNA, and identify genes that play a central role in the up- and down-regulation of CpG mediated cellular activation. Keywords: time series design
