TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing  Analysis of Wild Type and Hypomorphic Nkx2-5 mutant heart Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptome analysis of E11.5 mouse embryonic heart presenting a reduction in Nkx2-5 expression compare to wild-type littermate.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis of 3 different E11.5 hypomorphic hearts against 3 controls littermate hearts.
