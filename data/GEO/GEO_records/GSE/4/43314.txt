TITLE
Gene expression profile analysis of normal and type 2 diabetic mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles in the liver of 9-week-old wild type and diabetic db/db mice were measured by high-throughput sequencing to detect the differentially expressed genes

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of 9-week-old wild type and diabetic db/db mice were generated by high-throughput sequencing using Illumina Genome Analyzer
