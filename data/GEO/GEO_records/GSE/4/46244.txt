TITLE
Expression data from wound skin taken at three time points post wounding

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The full complement of hair follicles is generated during embryogenesis. Normally, no new hair is created after this time. Large full thickness skin excision wounding can result in the generation of new hair in the adult. Placodes can be observed following complete reepithelialization at wound day 14.  The events leading to hair neogenesis following wounding remain poorly understood. Late healing events (from wound day 10 to wound day 14) provide a possible window of induction for hair regeneration. We used microarrays to analyse changes in gene expression during late skin healing to provide candidates for factors involved in hair neogenesis following wounding.

DESIGN
6 week old C57Bl/6 mice received large full thickness skin excisions. Healing wound tissue was excised at wound day 10, 12 or 14 and analyzed for gene expression.
