TITLE
T4_bisthiazolium effect on the malaria parasite transcriptome

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Choline analogs represent a novel class of antimalarial compounds with strong potency against drug-sensitive and resistant P. falciparum. Although, these drugs are presumed to target proteins within lipid biosynthesis pathways; their complete mechanism of action and the parasiteâ€™s compensatory response remain to be elucidated. We have applied transcriptional profiling to characterize the global response to the choline analog T4 during the P. falciparum intraerythrocytic life cycle Keywords: Trascriptome analysis of Plasmodium falciparum in response to external stimuli using the affymetrix platform GPL3575
