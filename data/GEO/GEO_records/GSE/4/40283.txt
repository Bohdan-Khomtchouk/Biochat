TITLE
Gene expression data of Lsd1fl/fl and Lsd1fl/fl EpoRCre CD71_high / c-Kit_high pro-erythroblasts.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We discovered that mice lacking Lsd1 in the erythroid lineage die in utero of a lethal anemia around embryonic day E13.5. Lsd1 knockout embryos displayed an increase in CD71_high c-Kit_high pro-erythroblasts, followed by a drastic reduction of later maturation stages. To determine the genes altered by Lsd1-loss, CD71_high c-Kit_high pro-erythroblasts from Lsd1fl/fl and Lsd1fl/fl EpoRCre mice were FACS-purified to be analyzed by gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
Primary CD71high c-Kithigh pro-erythroblasts were isolated by FACS-sorting from fetal livers of E13.5 Lsd1fl/fl and Lsd1fl/fl EpoRCre embryos. Total RNA from two biological replicates per genotype was extracted and used to hybridize to Affymetrix expression arrays using the Mouse Genome 430A array platform.
