TITLE
An integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis reveals potential targets associated with cell proliferation in Uterine Leiomyomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number alterations data and transcriptional profiling of uterine leiomyomas tumor samples for integrative analysis. Goal was to determine identify genomic gains and/or losses  associated with up and/or down expressed genes, respectively. After, it was applied GSEA and CONEXIC algorithm to integrate the data. Protein-Protein interactions also was building and the data were validated using qRT-PCR and IHC techniques.

DESIGN
Experiment condition, 51 uterine leiomyoma DNA samples obtained from patients at secretory and proliferative menstrual cycle phases were labeled with Cy5 or Cy3 and commercial reference samples (Promega) were labled with Cy5 or Cy3. Samples Cy3 and Cy5 were mixed and hybridized at slide glasses Agilent 4x44 platform. See GSE43027 for the gene expression component.
