TITLE
Biomarker genes highlight intraspecific and interspecific variations in the responses of Pinus taeda L. and Pinus radiata D. Don to Sirex noctilio F. acid gland secretions

ORGANISM
Pinus taeda

SUMMARY
Sirex noctilio F., a Eurasian horntail woodwasp recently introduced into North America, oviposits in pines and other conifers and in the process spreads a phytopathogenic fungus that serves as a food source for its larvae.  During oviposition the woodwasp also deposits a mucus produced in its acid (venom) gland that alters pine defense responses and facilitates infection by the fungus.  A 26,496-feature loblolly pine cDNA microarray was used to survey gene expression of pine tissue responding to S. noctilio venom.  Six genes were selected for further assessment by qRT-PCR, including one that encoded an apparent PR-4 protein and another that encoded a thaumatin-like protein. Expression of both was strongly induced in response to venom, while expression of an apparent actin gene (ACT1) was stable in response to the venom.  The pattern of gene response was similar in Pinus taeda L. and P. radiata D. Don, but the magnitude of response in P. radiata was significantly stronger for each of the induced genes.  The magnitude of biomarker gene response to venom also varied according to genotype within these two species.  The qRT-PCR assay was used to demonstrate that the primary bioactive component in S. noctilio venom is a polypeptide.

DESIGN
Reference design.  Two condition experiment, two time points each compared to a common reference. Two biological replicates, two technical replicates, 12 slides total, duplicate/re-scanned images submitted for each slide.
