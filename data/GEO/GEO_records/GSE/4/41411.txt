TITLE
The small RNA PsrR1 affects oligomerization of photosystem I by post-transcriptional repression of psaL in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression of WT Synechocystis cells with cells overexpressing the sRNA PsrR1 in order to detect direct targets of the sRNA PsrR1.

DESIGN
We monitored gene expression of an Synechocystis PCC6083 overexpressor strain (psrR1+) (Mitschke et al., 2011) harboring a self-replicating plasmid from which PsrR1 is transcribed under control of the copper responsive PpetJ promoter and a control strain (WT) harboring an empty plasmid 0h and 24 h after copper depletion. For the timepoint (0h) we sampled biological replicates and for timepoint (24h) we sampled biological triplicates.
