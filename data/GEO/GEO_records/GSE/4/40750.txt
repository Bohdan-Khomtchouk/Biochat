TITLE
Expression data from hiPSCs-NSCs towards 4T1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neural stem cells can migrate towards tumors of both neural and non-neural origins, which is crucial for the success in treating disseminated tumors. Although the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying NSC tumor tropism is limited, it has been noted that several cytokines, growth factors and receptors direct the migration in vitro. A proper understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms of NSC migration towards tumors, especially identification of key cellular regulators of the migration, will have important implications in improving the effectiveness of engineering and employing NSCs as tumor therapy agents. We compared gene expression profiles between migratory and non-migratory hiPSC-NSCs towards cancer cells using cDNA microarray profiling.

DESIGN
We collected human iPSCs derived NSCs migrating and not migrating towards mouse 4T1 breast cancer cells in an in vitro migration system for total RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays
