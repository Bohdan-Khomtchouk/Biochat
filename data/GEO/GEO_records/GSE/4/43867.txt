TITLE
microRNA expression for 86 chemo-treated ovarian cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profile expression in serous epithelial ovarian carcinomas to assess the possibility of an miRNA signature associated with chemoresistance. Resistance to the available therapies is one of the main causes of low survival of patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, thus representing an emergency in oncology. Here, we profiled miRNA expression in 86 na√Øve serous epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOCs) to assess the possibility of miRNAs associated with chemoresistance. We identified 23 miRNAs associated with chemoresistance, of which three (miR-484, miR-642 and miR-217) were confirmed in the validation set (112 independent patients). The study of miR-484 role demonstrated that it regulated the chemoresistance of EOC cells acting not on cancer cells but on tumor vasculature. In particular, miR-484 is produced and secreted by chemosensitive EOC, therefore regulating the production of VEGFB by cancer cells and the expression of VEGFR2 in endothelial cells. Overall, we demonstrated that a three-miR signature can classify the response to chemotherapy and that chemoresistance in EOC relays, at least in part, on the control of tumor angiogenesis, indicating new options in the treatment of these patients.

DESIGN
We analyzed tumor samples ( < 5% of normal tissue) from FFPE blocks of 86 patients with serous ovarian carcinomas.
