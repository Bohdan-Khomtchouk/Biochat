SUMMARY
Characterization of patterns of gene expression measured by cDNA microarrays to subclassify tumors  into clinically relevant subgroups. In this study, we have refined the previously defined subtypes  of breast tumors that could be distinguished by their distinct patterns of gene expression.  A total of 115 malignant breast tumors and 7 benign tissues were analyzed by hierarchical clustering based on patterns of expression of 534 " intrinsic " genes and shown to subdivide into a basal epithelial-like, an ERBB2-overexpressing, two luminal epithelial-like and a normal breast tissue-like subgroup. The genes used for classification were selected based on their similar expression levels between pairs of consecutive samples taken from the same tumor separated by 15 weeks of neoadjuvant treatment. A disease state experiment design type is where the state of some disease such as infection, pathology, syndrome, etc is studied. Keywords: disease_state_design
