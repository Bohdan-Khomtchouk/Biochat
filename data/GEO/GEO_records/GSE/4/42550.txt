TITLE
Transcription factors and glyoxylate cycle genes prominent in the transition of soybean cotyledons to the first functional leaves of the seedling

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
To understand the genetic mechanisms involved in the functional transition of cotyledons from non-photosynthetic storage tissue to metabolically active photosynthetic tissue during soybean seedling development, we constructed seven different RNA-Seq libraries using cotyledons from each developmental stage separately. Analysis of RNA-Seq data from different developmental stages revealed the differential expression of many genes including transcription factors. In this study, we focused on NAC and YABBY transcription factors which showed a conspicuous expression pattern during soybean seedling development. Their expression gradually increases from stage 1 to stage 4 of soybean germinating cotyledons. The highest level of expression was found at stage 4. Then it gradually decreased as the germinating cotyledons develop a mature seedling. We investigated the differential expression of NAC and YABBY regulated genes between stage 3 (before the functional transition) and stage 6 (after the functional transition) using our RNA-Seq data. Based on our RNA-Seq data, we found that 10 genes are up-regulated and 21 genes are down-regulated by NAC transcription factor. Similarly we found that 19 genes are up-regulated and 27 genes are down-regulated by YABBY transcription factor.

DESIGN
High-throughput sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 (RNA-Seq) was performed on seven developmental stages of soybean seedlings, with two biological replicates per stage.
