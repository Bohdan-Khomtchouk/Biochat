TITLE
Expression data from Oryza sativa 3037 (wild-type) and sd37 (mutant) seedlings

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We characterized a rice (Oryza sativa L ssp. indica cultivar 3037) semi-dwarf mutant sd37, in which CYP96B4 gene (Cytochrome P450 96B subfamily) was identified as the target gene by map-based cloning and complementation test. A point mutation in CYP96B4 leads to a substitution of Thr to Lys in the SRS2 region. The sd37 leaves, panicles and seeds are all smaller compared with those of wild-type, and histological analysis showed that the decreased cell number was the main reason for the dwarf phenotype. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up- and down- regulated genes during this process.
