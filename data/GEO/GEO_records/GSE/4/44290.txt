TITLE
In Vitro Global Gene Expression Analyses Support the Ethnopharmacological Use of Achyranthes aspera

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Examining of the global gene expression changes in cultured human pancreatic cancer cells effected by the extract of A. aspera leaves. Comparison of cells treated for 24, 48 and 72 hours with the respective controls (untreated) allowed to select key genes that may be of interest as a response markers.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, treated vs. untreated cells at 3 time points. Biological replicates: 6 control and 6 treated replicates for 24 hours time point; 4 control and 4 treated replicated for 48 hours time point; 2 control and 2 treated replicates for 72 hours time point.
