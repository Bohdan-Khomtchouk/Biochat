TITLE
A whole-blood RNA transcript based prognostic model in castration-resistant prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Peripheral blood from 62 men with castration resistant prostate cancer was collected between 8/2006 and 6/2008. A panel of 168 inflammation-related and prostate cancer related genes was assessed with quantitative PCR to assess biomarkers predictive of survival.

DESIGN
qPCR profiling of whole blood from patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.
