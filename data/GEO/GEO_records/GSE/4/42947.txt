TITLE
Feeder-Independent Derivation of Induced-Pluripotent Stem Cells From Peripheral Blood Endothelial Progenitor Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to reprogram peripheral blood-derived late-endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to a pluripotent state under feeder-free and defined culture conditions. Late-EPCs were retrovirally-transduced with OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC, and iPSC colonies were derived in feeder-free and defined media conditions. EPC-iPSCs expressed pluripotent markers, were capable of differentiating to cells from all three germ-layers, and retained a normal karyotype. Transcriptome analyses demonstrated that EPC-iPSCs exhibit a global gene expression profile similar to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We have generated iPSCs from late-EPCs under feeder-free conditions. Thus, peripheral blood-derived late-outgrowth EPCs represent an alternative cell source for generating iPSCs.

DESIGN
Six samples were analyzed. The gene expression profile of four iPS clones were compared to the H9 human embryonic stem cell line and the parent endothelial progenitor cell line.
