TITLE
Gene expression signature of subcutaneous abdominal and subcutaneous gluteal adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes differentially expressed in abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue, we determined the mRNA transcription profile of 10 abdominal and 10 gluteal female adipose tissue sections using Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarrays.

DESIGN
RNA of 10 subcutaneous abdominal and 10 subcutaneous gluteal fat depot samples was processed by Miltenyi Biotech GmbH (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and loaded on single-color Whole Human Genome 4x44K microarrays (G4112F) from Agilent Technologies.
