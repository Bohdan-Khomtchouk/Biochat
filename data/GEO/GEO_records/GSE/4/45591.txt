TITLE
Mock and stably infected rKSHV.219 cells (LEC, BEC, HUVEC, and HAEC) [Expt2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of stably infected primary endothelial cells using a custom tiling microarray. LEC, BEC, HUVEC, and HAEC were infected with rKSHV.219 and selected with puromycin for 2 weeks. Mock infected LEC, BEC, HUVEC, and HAEC served as controls for their infected counterparts. All cells were harvested after 2 weeks of stable infection.
