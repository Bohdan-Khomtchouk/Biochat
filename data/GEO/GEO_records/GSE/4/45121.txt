TITLE
Expression data from miR-203 induction in mouse skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identify numerous miR-203 in vivo targets that are highly enriched for the promotion of cell cycle and cell division. Importantly, individual targets including p63, Skp2 and Msi2 play distinct roles downstream of miR-203 to regulate the cell cycle and long-term proliferation. Together, our findings reveal rapid and widespread impact of miR-203 on the self-renewal program during the epidermal differentiation and provide mechanistic insights for the potent role of miR-203 where coordinated repression of multiple targets is required for the function of this miRNA. We used microarrays to measure transcriptome changes upon miR-203's induction in mouse skin and identified new targets of miR-203.

DESIGN
We use two pairs of biological duplicates to perform the microarray analysis from the epidermal samples harvested from K14-rtTA/TRE-miR-203/K14-H2BGFP (DP) and TRE-miR-203/K14-H2BGFP (SP) littermates at P4, 24h after the Dox injection.
