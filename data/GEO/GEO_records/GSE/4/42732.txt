TITLE
Aspergillus nidulans: Control (0 h starvation) vs. induction of starvation (12 h and 24 h) for WT, delta xprG and delta atmA

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans FGSC A4

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. nidulans comparing starvation for 0 (reference), 12 and 24 h. The main objective was to identify genes specifically regulated during starvation by atmA and xprG. The results of the experiment were further validated by real-time PCR.
