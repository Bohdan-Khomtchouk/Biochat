TITLE
Somatic copy number alterations associating with alcohol drinking and smoking in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: The most important risk factors for head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSCC) are tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption, while subgroups are caused by infection with human papillomaviruses (HPV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Here, we studied alterations of somatic copy-number in whole genome, p16 protein and TP53 mutations by alcohol drinking, smoking and viral infections. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study. DNA obtained from tumors and margin samples as well as peripheral blood was assayed by array comparative genomic hybridization using Agilent Whole Human Genome 180K. Mutations of p53 gene by direct sequencing, detection of HPV by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR), quantification of EBV by reverse transcription-PCR and p16 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were also performed.

DESIGN
prospective cohort study: 225 tumor samples were analyzed by Agilent-022060 SurePrint G3 Human CGH miroarray 4x180K. Log2 Ratio (tumor sample DNA/normal DNA) were compared among none alcohol drinkers, moderate alcohol drinkers, heavy alcohol drinkers, none smokers, moderate smokers, heavy smokers and both. Sample characteristics weres scored as following; Human Papilloma Virus Infection (gene detected by PCR in tumor sample): positive=1; negative=0 p16 protein immunohistochemistry: positive=1; negative=0 tumor grade: matured=0; moderate=1; immature=2 Radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy after operation: performed =1; not performed =0 Recurrence/relapse: rec =1; not rec =0 suvival status:death=1; survive=0 smoking status (Pack year of smoking): none smoker=0; pack-year < 20 = 1 (moderate smoker); pack-year < =20 = 2 (heavy smoker) alcohol drinking: Alcohol drinkers were divided into non-drinker or less than one drink per day =0: one and more but less than two drinks per day = moderate drinker 1:  two and more drinks per day=heavy drinker 2:  during the 20 years preceding their treatment for HNSCC. One drink was defined as containing approximately 10g of alcohol, which is considered equal to 30 ml of hard liquor, 100 ml of wine containing 12% alcohol, or 360 ml of beer.
