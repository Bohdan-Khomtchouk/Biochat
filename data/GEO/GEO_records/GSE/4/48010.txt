TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of Ewing's sarcoma cell lines after knockdown of TRIP6

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed to explore the role of the Zyxin-related protein TRIP6 (thyroid receptor interacting protein 6) in Ewing's sarcoma (ES). By interrogation of published miccroarray data, we observed that of all seven Zyxin-proteins only TRIP6 is highly overexpressed in ES compared to normal tissues. RNA interference experiments and subsequent microarray and gene-set enrichment analyses indicated that TRIP6 expression is associated wth a pro-proliferative and pro-invasive transcriptional signature. Consistently, functional assays demonstrated that TRIP6 promotes migration, invasion, long-term proliferation and clonogencity of ES cells.

DESIGN
A673 and SK-N-MC Ewing sarcoma cells were transfected with specific siRNA against TRIP6 (siTRIP6_4 or siTRIP6_5) or negative control siRNA (siControl) or Mock-transfected.
