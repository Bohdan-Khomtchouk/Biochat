TITLE
Sugarcane transcriptome - Drought response

ORGANISM
Saccharum officinarum

SUMMARY
Sugarcane one-eyed seed sets obtained from a variety sensitive to drought conditions (cv. SP90-1638, CTC, Brazil) were cultivated on moist sand for 15 days. The plants were transferred to pots containing moist sand and were irrigated with Hoaglandâ€™s solution (Hoagland and Arnon, 1950). Regular watering was maintained for 90 days and suppressed after this period for the experimental group. Leaves were collected 24 h, 72 h and 120 h after exposure to drought conditions for the control and experimental groups. Samples were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Leaves from six plantlets were used for each time point. Extraction of total RNA was performed separately on each sample pool. Keywords: time course of stress response
