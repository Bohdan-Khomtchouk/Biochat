TITLE
Expression data from long-term Ebf1-deficient, CD19+, Bcl2tg cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An assessment of a role of Ebf1 in committed B lineage cells. In this study, we adopted the strategy of deleting Ebf1 after reconstitution of Rag2-/-Il2rg-/- mice and found that committed pre-B cells could be converted into T cells and ILCs upon deletion of Ebf1.

DESIGN
We used Âµ-arrays to gain insight into changes in gene expression of CD19+ Ebf1-deficient cells. The dataset was compared with microarray data available for different hematopoietic developmental stages (GSE15907). The complete dataset is linked below as a supplementary file.
