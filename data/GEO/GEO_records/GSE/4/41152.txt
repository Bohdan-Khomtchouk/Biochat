TITLE
HPV-related methylation in Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using MCIp, we enriched highly methylated DNA from a normal mucosa control and from three OPSCC patient subgroups regarding the HPV status: group A, DNA-RNA- (Tu1-Tu5); group B, DNA+RNA- (Tu6-Tu10); group C, DNA+RNA+ (Tu11-Tu15).

DESIGN
3 groups of tumor biopsies, 5 samples each regarding HPV status: DNA-RNA-, DNA+RNA-, DNA+RNA+ and a control sample (normal mucosa from healthy individual): 15 tumor samples/ 1 control sample
