TITLE
Global analysis of transcriptional changes following genomic demethylation in chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA methylation can contribute to the stable transcriptional silencing of mammalian genes. Oftentimes, these genes are important developmental regulators, and their silencing in cell types where they are not supposed to be active is important for the phenotypic stability of the cells. To identify key developmental regulator genes whose expression in terminally differentiated cells may be inhibited by DNA methylation, mouse dermal fibroblasts were demethylated with 5-aza-2â€™-deoxycytidine, and changes in gene expression monitored by microarray analysis. Keywords: 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine; methylation; dermal fibroblast; chondrocyte; osteoblast
