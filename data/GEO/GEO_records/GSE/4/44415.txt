TITLE
Expression time-series from Streptomyces coelicolor germination

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)

SUMMARY
Transcriptome time-courses during the S. coelicolor germination were used to reveal processes that underlie the gene expression at the transcriptional level within transition from dormancy to vegetative growth.

DESIGN
Samples from 13 time points at the initial 5.5 h (30 min time intervals) of germination. 2-3 biological (and technical) replicates for each time point. Altogether 37 samples.
