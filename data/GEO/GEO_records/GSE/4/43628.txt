TITLE
Activation of beta-catenin in hepatocellular carcinoma (mouse Ctnnb1 knockout)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CTNNB1 is the most frequently mutated gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its clinical relevance remains controversial. We determined an evolutionarily conserved Î²-catenin signature by comparative analysis of gene expression data from human HCC (GSE43619) and a mouse model.

DESIGN
We generated gene expression data from 4 tumor tissues from a mouse Ctnnb1 knockout model (Ctnnb1 flox(ex3)/+) and 4 normal liver tissues from control wild-type mice.
