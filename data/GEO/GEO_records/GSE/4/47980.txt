TITLE
Cisplatin treated melanoma and melanocyte cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) orchestrates the repair of helix distorting DNA damage, induced by both ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and cisplatin. There is evidence that the global genome repair (GGR) arm of NER is dysfunctional in melanoma and it is known to have limited induction in melanoma cell lines after cisplatin treatment. The aims of this study were to examine mRNA transcript levels of regulators of GGR and to investigate the downstream effect on global transcript expression in melanoma cell lines after cisplatin treatment and in melanoma tumours.

DESIGN
One melanocyte, three primary melanoma (MM200, IgR3, Me4405) and two metastatic melanoma (Mel-RM and Sk-mel-28) cell lines were treated with cispltain and gene expression profile data collected at 0, 6 and 24 hours. Biological duplicates were treated and RNA was collected for each cell line at each timepoint. The duplicated were run sperately on the WGGEX beadarrays and the results of the duplicates averaged for publication.     The transcript expression results were cubic spline normalised using BeadStudio 2.0 software (Illumina, USA), and the remaining analyses was performed using GeneSpring GX 11.0. To account for bias or skewing of expression results all the gene expression profiles and each individual gene were normalized to the median resulting in two way normalisation. For visualisation of the results the data was log transformed.
