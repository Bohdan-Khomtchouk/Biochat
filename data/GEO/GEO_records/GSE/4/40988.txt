TITLE
Gene expression profile of Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma cells after knock-down of PRAME

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By using high-density DNA microarrays, we analyzed the gene-expression profile of Hodgkin's lymphoma cell line L-428 after knock-down of the tumor antigen PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma) Kewitz and Staege, submitted

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from established Hodgkin's lymphoma cell line L-540 and hybridized with Affymetrix HG_U133A microarrays.
