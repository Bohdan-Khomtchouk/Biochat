TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Ash1l mutant mouse embryonic stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using wild type and Ash1l deltaSET mutant embryonic stem cells, here we report differences of gene expression pattern under undifferentiated state and differentiated state. Interestingly, gene expression changes are frequently observed in a subset of gene group that is regulated by Polycomb group proteins.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 cell types in 2 different conditions.
