TITLE
The gene expression changes in darkcd4 apoptosis-deficient mutant flies

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Apoptosis is required not only for proper morphogenesis and tissue size regulation during development, but also for removing damaged or unwanted cells to maintain homeostasis. Apoptosis is mainly executed by evolutionally-conserved signaling process including caspases and its activator, dark. We performed microarray analysis of darkcd4 mutant flies to reveal the changes in gene expression. We found the elevated immune reaction, suggesting that inflammatory response was triggered by necrosis in darkcd4 .

DESIGN
We collected total RNA from day 5 adult of darkcd4 mutant flies backcrossed six generations to w1118. w1118 was used as control. N=4 for each sample.
