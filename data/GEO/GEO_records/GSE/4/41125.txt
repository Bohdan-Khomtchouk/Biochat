TITLE
Expression data from salinity treated and control soybean

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Soybean's productivity is significantly compromised by soil salinity, but, like most plants, it has evolved a variety of mechanisms to aid its survival under environmental stress. The expression of many plant genes is altered by salinity stress. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and identified distinct up or down-regulated genes between salinity stressed and non stressed soybean

DESIGN
Seedlings of the soybean cultivar Williams 82 were grown in vermiculite under a 16h photoperiod at 25 ºC for 14 days. RNA were isolated from the mock (M0, M1, M3, M6, M12, M24) and salinity treated (S0, S1, S3, S6, S12, S24) seedlings. 0.5 µg RNA that extracted from each time point of the mock and salinity-stressed seedlings were mixed respectively to obtain the mock and salinity-stressed RNA pools, and then they were used to synthesize the cDNA. The cDNA was labeled with biotin, and then hybridized to an Affymetrix soybean Genome Array.
