TITLE
Expression data from injured murine kidney

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Renal recovery following injury relies on cellular regeneration. In the mouse kidney following injury, injured epithelial cells undergoes de-differentiate, proliferate and re-differentiate into functional cells, following a a tightly controlled genetic programme where specific sets of genes are up-regulated. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellular regeneration following injury with or without a HDAC inhibitor, m4PTB, treatment and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Male BALB/c mice underwent 26 minute unilateral ischemia-reperfusion (IR) with contralateral nephrectomy treated with vehicle or 100 mg/kg m4PTB 24 h after inducing renal injury, and kidneys harvested for RNA extraction 12 h later. We sought to obtain kidneys within a similar degree of injury in order to carefully evaluate the effect of m4PTB on expression profiles. To that end, we selected kidneys according to three different criteria of injury: (1) level of serum creatinine at Day1, (2) the level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (3) Kim1 expression by qPCR at Day1.5 using haevested kidneys
