TITLE
Antiviral signaling mediates inhibition of RNAi in mammalian cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the interferon response (specifically interferon stimulated genes-ISGs) in human DLD-1 cells that have decreased microRNA expression due to a exon mutation in Dicer. The hypothesis tested in the present study is that ISGs are particularly suspectible to microRNA regulation.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from both WT and microRNA hypmorphic DLD-1 cells after 3, 8, and 24 hours post interferon treatment
