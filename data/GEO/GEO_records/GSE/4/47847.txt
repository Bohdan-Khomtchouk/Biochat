TITLE
Early life stress in fathers impairs synaptic plasticity in the offspring -  brain collected after acute swim stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We show that traumatic stress experienced by males in early postnatal life impairs memory in their offspring, blocks long-term potentiation (LTP) and favors long-term depression (LTD). These effects are accompanied by suppression of key molecular pathways involved in neuronal plasticity both at rest and after acute stress.

DESIGN
Male mice were exposed to chronic traumatic stress in early postnatal life and were later bred to na√Øve females to produce second-generation offspring. Memory performance was evaluated in the offspring, and synaptic plasticity was examined in the hippocampus and the amygdala, brain areas important for memory formation. The two groups tested were 1: offspring of fathers which were stressed (MSUS - maternal separation unpredictable stress)  and 2: offspring of non-stressed fathers (control). Genome-wide gene expression in hippocampus of these two groups was assessed at rest and after acute stress (this study).
