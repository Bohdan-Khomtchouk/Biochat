TITLE
Expression data from monocyte-derived macrophages after stimulation with mock, LPS, PolyI:C and P3C.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pre-stimulation of MDMs with LPS (signals via MyD88 and TRIF dependent pathways) and PolyI:C (signals via a TRIF dependent pathway) leads to a reduced viral infection. In contrast, pre-stimulation with P3C (signals via MyD88 dependent pathway) does not lead to a reduced viral infection. This microarray was performed to find genes that are specifically upregulated in LPS and PolyI:C stimulated MDMs but not P3C stimulated MDMs. So to give us leads into the mechanism involved in the reduction of viral infection.

DESIGN
MDMs of four different donors were stimulated for 4h with mock, LPS, PolyI:C or P3C. RNA was isolated and gene expression of these cells was assessed. Gene expression of LPS, PolyI:C and P3C stimulated MDMs was compared to mock.
