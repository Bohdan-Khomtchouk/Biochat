TITLE
ANGUSTIFOLIA 3 binds SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes to regulate transcription during Arabidopsis leaf development

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The transcriptional coactivator ANGUSTIFOLIA 3 (AN3) stimulates cell proliferation during Arabidopsis leaf development, but the molecular mechanism is largely unknown. We show here that inducible nuclear localization of AN3 during initial leaf growth results in differential expression of important transcriptional regulators, including GROWTH REGULATING FACTORs (GRFs). Chromatin purification further revealed the presence of AN3 at the loci of GRF5, GRF6, CYTOKININ RESPONSE FACTOR 2 (CRF2), CONSTANS-LIKE 5 (COL5), HECATE 1 (HEC1), and ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 4 (ARR4). Tandem affinity purification of protein complexes using AN3 as bait identified plant SWITCH/SUCROSE NONFERMENTING (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complexes formed around the ATPases BRAHMA (BRM) or SPLAYED (SYD). Moreover, SWI/SNF ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 73B (SWP73B) is recruited by AN3 to the promoter of GRF5, GRF3, COL5, and ARR4, and both SWP73B and BRM occupy the HEC1 promoter. Furthermore, we show that AN3 and BRM genetically interact. The data indicate that AN3 associates with chromatin remodelers to regulate transcription. In addition, modification of SWI3C expression levels increases leaf size, underlining the importance of chromatin dynamics for growth regulation. Our results place the SWI/SNF-AN3 module as a major player at the transition from cell proliferation to cell differentiation in a developing leaf.

DESIGN
AN3-GR and wild-type (Col-0) plants were grown in vitro for 8 days and subsequently transferred to dexamethasone-containing medium for 8 hours. Developing leaves 1 & 2 of AN3-GR and wild-type plants were micro-dissected, and RNA was extracted. RNA from three biological repeats of dexamethasone-treated AN3-GR and dexamethasone-treated wild-type leaves was hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.
