TITLE
Transcriptome comparison of the wild type strain Azoarcus sp. BH72  with that of nifLA knockout strain under nitrogen fixing condition

ORGANISM
Azoarcus sp. BH72

SUMMARY
Azoarcus sp. BH72 is known to express nitrogenase genes endophytically in  rice seedlings in gnotobiotic culture. Availability of fixed nitrogen is one of the important signals regulating the transcription of nitrogenase genes and hence nitrogen fixing activity. NifA is the essential transcription activator of nif genes. RNA isolated from the nifA knockout mutant of strain BH72 was compared with the transcriptome of  wild type under nitrogen fixing condition using a global genome wide microarray approach and the differences in the gene expression profile were monitered.
