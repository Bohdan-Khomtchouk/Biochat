TITLE
Comparative analysis from hESC from different developmental sources of derivation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome expression analysis reveals that single blastomeres from day-3 human embryos and blastocysts show unique gene signature, thus hESC derived from these two developmental sources might show differential gene expression profile.  Comparative gene expression analysis has revealed that no significant differences exist between hESCs derived from blastomeres versus those obtained from ICMs, suggesting that pluripotent hESCs involve a new developmental progression.

DESIGN
hESC derived from single blastomeres (VAL-10B and VAL-11B) and from ICM (VAL-5, -7, and -8) were compared by global gene expression
