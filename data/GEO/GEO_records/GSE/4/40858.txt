TITLE
Gene expression profiling analysis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell CNE1/MTA1-si cells and CNE1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in MTA1-silencing CNE1 cells, compared to the wild-type CNE1 cell.

DESIGN
A double chip study using total RNA recovered from two cell lines, CNE1/MTA1-si cells and CNE1 cells.  Each chip measures the expression level of 45,033 genes from human.
