TITLE
A module-based translational strategy shows a central role for S100A4 in allergy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The involvement of thousands of genes complicates the identification of clinically relevant candidate genes in common diseases. We hypothesized that genes co-regulated with a key gene in allergy, IL13, would form a module that could help to discover novel candidate genes. We identified a Th2 cell module by siRNA mediated knock down of 25 putative IL13-regulating transcription factors (TFs) followed by expression profiling.

DESIGN
Human CD4+ T cells (hBP CD4+ T cells, 2W-200, Lonza, Vallensbak Strand, Denkmark) were nucleofected either with nucleofection buffer, 1 µM human on target plus SMART pool siRNA against ELK1, GATA3, NFATC3, MAF, NFKB1, JUN, STAT3 (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) or non-targeting siRNA using the AMAXA nucleofection program U-014. Six hours after then nucleofection cells were washed, activated and polarized towards Th2. The CD4+ cells were activated with plate bound anti-CD3 (500ng / ml for coating of the plate), with soluble anti-CD28 (500ng / ml) and with IL-2 (17ng /ml, all purchased from R & D). Th2 polarization was induced with anti-IL-12 (5µg/ml) and IL-4 (10ng / ml). For RT-PCR and microarray analyisis the cells were harvested 12 hours of polarization and total RNA was extracted.
