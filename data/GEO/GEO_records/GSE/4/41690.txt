TITLE
Expression analysis of a full Lsr locus knockout in Haemophilus influenzae strain CZ4126/02

ORGANISM
Haemophilus influenzae

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression differences in a full (nine-gene) Lsr locus knockout strain compared to the wild-type strain (CZ4126/02). This Lsr mutant is unable to import the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) quorum sensing molecule nor mediate any potential LsrR-based transcriptional regulation.

DESIGN
WT and Lsr-KO strains were grown in two different media to two or three different time-points. RNA was extracted from these sampling conditions in two separate cultures (biological replicates). Each of these RNA samples was run on two different H. influenzae supragenome arrays (technical replicates). 3-13 probes represent each subcluster (gene) and two replicate probe sets are included on each custom NTHi supragenome chip. Thus, under each sampling condition, 8 separate values are obtained per strain and used for WT:Lsr-KO comparisons.
