TITLE
Gene Expression in Whole Blood of Atopic Eczema and Healthy Children at 4 years

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied genes that are related to atopic diseases [i.e., atopic eczema (AE)]. Immunological factors and principal genes involved in the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids were included. We analyzed whether expression of genes encoding key enzymes of LC-PUFA synthesis (FADS1, FADS2 and ELOVL5) is associated with circulating LC-PUFA levels and risk of AE in 4-year-old children. AE (n=20) and non-AE (n=104) children participating in the Sabadell cohort within the INfancia y Medio Ambiente (INMA) Project were included in the present study. RT-PCR with TaqMan Low-Density Array cards was used to measure the expression of these genes.

DESIGN
RT-PCR gene expression profile. The samples are described in the sumary. Each sample was measured in duplicate in the same TLDA card and we present the average of each sample.
