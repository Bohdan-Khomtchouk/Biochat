TITLE
Differentiated mouse podocytes (SVI)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptomes of differentiated cells of the conditionally immortalized mouse podocyte cell line SVI (Schiwek et al., Kidney Int. 66: 91-101, 2004) were determined as described in Kabgani et al. (PLoS One 7:e34907, 2012). The transcriptomes of the podocyte cell line were mapped on a protein-protein interaction network of the podocyte (PodNet). Together with other transcriptomes taken from GEO, we analyzed differential gene regulation and differential regulation of protein-protein interactions between cultured podocytes and differentiated in vivo podocytes.

DESIGN
Three independent batches were used.
