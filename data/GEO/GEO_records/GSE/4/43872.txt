TITLE
Expression data from one year old leaves of Populus simonii by chilling stress (4°C, 10h).

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
We take the one year old plant for chilling stress (4°C, 10h) and controls.Use the Affymetrix poplar gene chip to decrypt the gene functions and mechanisms in Populus simonii leaves. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression during chilling stress (4°C, 10h).
