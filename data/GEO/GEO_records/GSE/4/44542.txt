TITLE
Rhesus macaque model of hCoV-EMC respiratory infection

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), lungs, and lung lesions collected over the course of hCoV-EMC infection of 6 rhesus macaques.

DESIGN
6 rhesus macaques were infected intratracheally with hCoV-EMC. PBMCs were collected at days 0, 1, 3, and 6, and lungs were collected from serial sacrifices of 3 animals each at day 3 and day 6. Infection produced a mild-moderate, self-limiting respiratory infection, and was not lethal. We performed microarray analysis (using Agilent Rhesus arrays) on all lungs, lung lesions, and PBMCs collected for the study.
