TITLE
RNA-Seq of eye tissues from C57BL/6J background mice at 1.5 h and 9.0 h after light onset

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report RNA-Seq experiments of whole eye tissues from C57BL/6J background mice at 1.5 h and 9.0 h after light onset to better understand photoreceptor phagocytosis

DESIGN
Examine ocular tissue from mice at different time points
