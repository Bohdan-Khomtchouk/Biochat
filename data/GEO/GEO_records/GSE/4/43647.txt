TITLE
myb52-2 t-dna -Transcriptome analysis of atmyb52 mutant vs wild-type

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs11-11_myb52 - myb52-2 t-dna  - What are the structural and regulator genes regulated by MYB52 transcription factor? - Plants grew in short-day growth chamber until they reached 20 cm height. Ten centimeter-stem from the rosette were collected. Samples are pools of 8 wild-type (Col0) or (atmyb52) mutant plants. Two biological repeats were conducted.

DESIGN
2 dye-swap - normal vs transgenic comparaison
