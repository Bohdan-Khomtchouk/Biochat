TITLE
Effect of simulated microgravity on E. coli K12 MG1655 growth and gene expression

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
This study demonstrates simulated microgravity effects on E. coli K 12 MG1655 when grown on LB medium supplemented with glycerol. The results imply that E. coli readily reprograms itself to combat the multiple stresses imposed due to microgravity. Under these conditions it survives by upregulating oxidative stress protecting genes and simultaneously down regulating the membrane transporters and synthases to maintain cell homeostasis.
