TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from high and low invasive A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The major cause of cancer-related deaths in lung cancer patients is commonly attributed to its ability to metastasize to distant organs such as the bone, brain, liver and adrenal glands. The dysregulation in miRNA expression is believed to contribute toward the initiation and progression of metastasis through their capability to regulate target genes. In this study, two NSCLC sub-cell lines possessing opposing migration and invasion properties were established using serial transwell invasion assays, followed by miRNA microarray to obtain the overview of miRNA expression as well as identify important playes in metastasis.
