TITLE
Binding in wild type, D and SoxN mutant embryos: SoxN vs D.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Genome-wide binding of transcription factors SoxN and D in stage 12-17 wild type embryos (SoxNDam and DDam), of SoxN in D mutants (D-SoxNDam) and of D in SoxN mutants (SoxN-DDam).

DESIGN
Four DamID experiments. Three biological replicates per experiment. Two conditions: Dam (control) vs SoxNDam or DDam or D-SoxNDam or SoxN-DDam (sample)
