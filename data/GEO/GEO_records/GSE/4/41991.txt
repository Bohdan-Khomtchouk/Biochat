TITLE
Genome-Wide HDA18-Binding Sites in Arabidopsis Root Tips

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We found that histone acetylation relays positional information and that a mutant altered in the histone deacetylase (HDAC) gene family member HDA18 exhibits altered H and N epidermal cell patterning. We then performed genome-wide location (ChIP-chip) analyses by using antibody against HDA18 in transgenic HDA18 overexpression Arabidopsis plants. These analyses identified statistically significant enriched DNA associated with HDA18. A total of 286 DNA fragments were enriched as putative HDA18 protein-binding sites.

DESIGN
Root tips of P35S:HDA18 Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) ChIPed with HDA18 antibody vs. pre-immune mouse serum.
