TITLE
Genome-wide analysis reveals CLF-regulated transcripts in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
CURLY LEAF (CLF), the major histone methyltransferase of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), modifies trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and mediates dynamical chromatin repression in Arabidopsis. Here we profiled Arabidopsis transcriptomes obtained from roots, leaves, flowers and siliques of Col-0 and clf-28 plants using RNA-seq. Our analysis uncovered 3835 transcription units were up-regulated in clf-28. Compared with H3K27me3 ChIP-CHIP data, we found  at least 42% of them were associated with H3K27me3.

DESIGN
Transcriptom profiling in roots, leaves, flowers and siliques of clf-28 plants.
