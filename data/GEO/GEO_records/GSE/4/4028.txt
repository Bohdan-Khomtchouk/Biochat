TITLE
Effects of diethylstilbestrol (DES) on the anterior pituitary gland of the ACI, Copenhagen and Brown Norway Rat.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Anterior pituitary glands were isolated from 21 week old male rats either untreated or treated for 12 weeks with the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES). Three biological replicates were prepared for untreated, control animals and four biological replicates were prepared for DES-treated animals. This was done for each of 3 inbred rat strains: ACI, Copenhagen, and Brown Norway. Expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 v. 2.0 arrays. Comparisons of untreated vs. treated animals within a strain will allow identification of estrogen responsive genes. Comparisons between strains, either treated or untreated, will identify strain (i.e., genetic) differences in expression. Keywords: Estrogen Response
