TITLE
FGFR3-shRNA induced transcriptional changes in RT112 bladder cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant activation of FGFR3 via overexpression or mutation is a frequent feature of bladder cancer; however, its molecular and cellular consequences and functional relevance to carcinogenesis are not well understood.  In this study with a bladder carcinoma cell line expressing inducible FGFR3 shRNAs, we sought to identiy transcriptional targets of FGFR3 and investigate their contribution to bladder cancer development.

DESIGN
Bladder cancer cell line RT112 was transduced with a doxycycline-inducible control EGFP shRNA or three independent FGFR3 shRNAs, designated FGFR3 shRNA 2-4, FGFR3 shRNA 4-1 and FGFR3 shRNA 6-16.  These four cell lines were treated with or without doxycycline for 48 hr to deplete FGFR3 protein prior to the isolation of mRNA for microarray analysis.  Genes that were differentially expressed after doxycycline induction in all three FGFR3-depleted cell lines but not in the control cell line were considered potential FGFR3-regulated genes.  Each treatment group was run in triplcates, and there are 24 samples.
