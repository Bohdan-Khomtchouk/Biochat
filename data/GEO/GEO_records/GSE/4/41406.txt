TITLE
shoots and roots treated with methotrexate and 5-formyl-thf-Transcriptomic and metabolic changes in Arabidopsis thaliana supplemented with 5-CHO-THF and its relationship with the accumulation and transformation to THF active derivatives

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au11-02_cho-thf - shoots and roots treated with methotrexate and 5-formyl-thf - Folates and 1C metabolism - The objective of this study is to investigate the changes on the plant expression profiles due to 5-CHO-THF assimilation and transformation. Additionally, plants supplemented with methotrexate (MTX) (an inhibitor of folate biosynthesis) will complement the study. Results from this work will serve to better understand the effects of folate accumulation in plants.

DESIGN
12 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison
