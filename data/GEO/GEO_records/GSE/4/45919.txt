TITLE
Peripheral blood gene expression in human experiencing primary EBV infection (HT12)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epstein Barr virus causes linfectious mononucleosis and establishes lifelong infection associated with cancer and autoimmune disease.  To better understand immunity to EBV, we performed a prospective study of natural infection in healthy humans.  These anlyses were undertaken in order to determine what gene expression changes occur as the result of primary Epstein Barr virus infection.  Samples were taken both before and following acquisition of the virus for direct comparison of samples for single subjects.  These data provide an important first description of the response to natural herepesvirus infection in humans.

DESIGN
PBMC were taken before acquisition of EBV, during acute infection, and during latency
