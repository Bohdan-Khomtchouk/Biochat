TITLE
Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells From Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Can Recapitulate Early Developmental Stages of Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has one of the worst prognoses of any human malignancy and there are few human cellular models of disease progression. When human PDAC cells are injected into immunodeficient animals, they create tumors of the late stage from which they were derived. We hypothesized that if human pancreatic cancer cells were converted to pluripotency and then allowed to differentiate back into pancreas, the developmental progression would recapitulate early stages of the cancer. To that end, we have generated isogenic matched sets of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-like lines from epithelial cells of human pancreatic tumors and from histologically normal epithelial cells at the resected pancreatic margins. Notably, when injected into immunodeficient mice, at low or high passages, a human pancreatic cancer iPS-like line, but not the corresponding margin iPS-like line, slowly generates intra-epithelial neoplasia (PanIN) ductal structures that typically reflect the early stages of human pancreatic cancer. The PanIN-like ducts can be isolated and cultured. They secrete protein products reflective of PanINs and provide new insights into underlying regulatory networks. An additional iPS-like line from histologically normal cells at a pancreatic resection margin, but containing a mutation that predisposes to PDAC, does not generate PanIN ductal structures. These studies demonstrate that iPS technology can be exploited to recapitulate early progression events of a human epithelial cancer.

DESIGN
Study includes a single experiment (#10): a tumor-adjacent pancreatic tissue control (10N); tumor tissue (10C); IPS-transformed tissue control (10N12); and IPS-transformed tumor tissue (10C22).
