TITLE
Quartz-Seq: a simple and highly quantitative method for single-cell RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report novel single-cell RNA-Seq, called Quartz-Seq. Quartz-Seq was simplified method compared with previous methods based on poly-A tailing reaction.

DESIGN
RNA-seq by illumina TruSeq, KAPA library preparation kit, single-cell Quartz-Seq and single-cell Smart-Seq by illumina HiSeq 2000/1000
