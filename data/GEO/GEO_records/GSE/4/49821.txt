TITLE
Transcriptome analysis during seed germination of elite Chinese bread wheat cultivar Jimai 20

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Wheat seed germination is highly related to seedling survival rate and subsequent vegetative growth,and therefore directly affects the conformation of wheat yield and quality. So wheat seed germination is not only important to itself, but the whole human society. However, due to the large genome size, many studies related to wheat seed are very complex and uncompleted. Transcriptome analysis of elite Chinese bread wheat cultivar Jimai 20 may provides a comprehensive understanding of wheat seed germination. Seed germination involves in the regulation of large number of genes, whether these genes are normal activated  or not is very important to seed germination. We performed microarray analysis using the Affymetrix Gene Chip to reveal the gene expression profiles in five phases of wheat cultivar Jimai 20 seed germination. Our results provide a new insights into the thoroughly metabolic changes of seed germination as well as the relationship between some significant genes.

DESIGN
The five groups including germinating seeds were harvest at five successive phases, which were 0 (P0), 12 (P1), 24 (P2), 36 (P3), 48 (P4) hour after imbibition respectively. Three independent experiments were performed for each group.
