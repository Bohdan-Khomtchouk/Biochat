TITLE
Gene expression compare between liver cancer associated mesenchymal stem cells (LC8-MSC) and liver normal mesenchymal stem cells (LN8-MSC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of liver cancer associated mesenchymal stem cells comparing normal mesenchymal stem cells from adjacent tumor-free tissues of the same patient 8, Goal was to determine to detect the paracrine trophic factors from liver cancer mesenchymal stem cells. 8 represents liver cancer associated MSCs, N8 represents liver normal MSCs

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, 8 vs. N8 cells. Biological replicates: 1 replicate from the same patient.
