TITLE
Next generation sequencing analysis of microRNAs in brown preadipocytes and in vitro differentiated mature brown fat cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed a genome-wide deep sequencing analysis of the microRNAs abundant in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from murine brown adipose tissue and in in vitro differentiated mature brown adipocytes. Several microRNAs were identified as differentially regulated when comparing datasets from MSCs vs. mature fat cells. These microRNAs may have an implication in the regulation of adipogenesis as well as thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT).

DESIGN
Examination of BAT-derived MSCs (BAT-MSC; 1 sample) and in vitro differentiated mature brown fat cells (BAT-DIFF; 1 sample) vertis biotechnologie AG, D-85354 Freising, Germany (library construction and sequencing)
