TITLE
Hypoxia transcriptome sequencing of blind mole rat (BMR, Spalax galili) and rat (Rattus norvegicus)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Deep sequencing of mRNA from Spalax galili and Rattus norvegicus

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from the brain of female BMRs under various oxygen concentrations (3%, 6%, 10%, 14%, and 21%) for 6 hours. We also got RNAs from the brain of rats under 6%, 10%, 14%, and 21% oxygen conditions.
