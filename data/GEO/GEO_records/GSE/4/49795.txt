TITLE
Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) in Visceral Fat Depot

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Case story. A patient with massive infiltration of the visceral adipose tissue depot by BAT in a patient with a catecholamine secreting paraganglioma. BAT tissue was identified by protein expression of UCP1 (western blotting and immunostaining) The goal of the study is to identify patterns of gene expression in BAT containing visceral fat compared to the patient's own subcutanous fat which did not express BAT. For comparison a pool of mRNA isolated from visceral fat from obese subjects was used.

DESIGN
Patient Case, Gene expression array from a biopsy from the patient's visceral fat and a biopsy from the subcutaneous fat compared to one array of mRNA from the visceral depot pooled from a group of obese subjects
