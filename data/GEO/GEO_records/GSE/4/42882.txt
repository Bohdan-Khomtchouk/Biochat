ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of malignant, atypical and benign meningiomas samples. The Illumina infinium HumanMethylation450 beadchip kit was used, which assayed 450,000 potential methylation sites.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 23 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450 Human Methylation Beadchip.
