TITLE
2D and 3D Madin-Darby Canine Kidney Cell Type II cell line response to hepatocyte growth factor

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Analysis of 2D (transwell) and 3D (collagen type I) cultured MDCK cells and HGF (a MAPK activator). Traditional 2D cultures are fast and inexpensive but do no mimic natural niche/cell environment as well as the more laborious and costly 3D-cultures. 3D cultures, arguably, are better models for the study of developmental processes, such as tubulogenesis. Epithelial organs (such as kidney) develop via tubulogenesis, a process, at least in part, regulated by MAPK signaling. Therefore, 2D and 3D cells also treated with HGF plus MAPK inhibitors. Results provide insights into differential response to HGF-induced tubulogenesis depending on cell culture conditions (2D vs. 3D).

DESIGN
29 samples total: 2D and 3D control (untreated) in quadruplicate, respectively; 2D and 3D + HGF in quadruplicate, respectively; 2D + HGF + PD-98059 in quadruplicate; 3D +  HGF + PD-98059 in triplicate; 2D + HGF + U0126 in triplicate; and 3D + HGF + U0126 in triplicate.
