TITLE
DNA methylation analysis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease suggests distinct disease-specific and remodeling signatures after bariatric surgery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disorder in industrialized countries. Liver samples from morbidly obese patients with all stages of NAFLD and controls were analysed by array-based DNA methylation and mRNA expression profiling.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 85 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip
