TITLE
Global gene expression in Moraxella catarrhalis ATCC 43617 grown under iron-replete and iron-limiting conditions

ORGANISM
Moraxella catarrhalis

SUMMARY
Total RNA samples were isolated from M. catarrhalis grown in BHI (iron-replete condition, designated DF0) and in BHI containing 30 mM Desferal (iron-limiting condition, designated DF30).  Total RNA and M. catarrhalis genome-directed primers (GDPs) were used for synthesis of Cy3- or Cy5-labeled cDNA samples.  Three independent M. catarrhalis growth experiments and total RNA isolations were used for synthesis of cDNA samples, and a total of six DNA microarray hybridizations were performed in this study. Keywords: Effect of Growth Environment on Global Gene Expression by Moraxella catarrhalis
