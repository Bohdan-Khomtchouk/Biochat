TITLE
CHD chromatin remodelers regulate separate gene sets and distinct stages of Dictyostelium development

ORGANISM
Dictyostelium discoideum

SUMMARY
We utilized RNA-seq to profile expression levels in wild type AX2 cells and three mutants for the CHD family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers in Dictyostelium discoideum. Total RNA was polyA enriched and sequenced at two stages of development: in the growth stage (0H) and in 5H cAMP pulsed cells (5H). All mutants analysed were also in the AX2 background.

DESIGN
Looking at mRNA levels in AX2, chdA-, chdB- and chdC-.
