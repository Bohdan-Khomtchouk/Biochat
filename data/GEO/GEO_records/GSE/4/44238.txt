TITLE
KDM4A regulated genes in human squamous carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To establish a robust cellular model system for screening genes associated with cell invasion, we over-expressed the oncogenic translocated promoter region (Tpr)-MET proteins in SCC23 cells (SCC23/MET). Using a functional siRNA screen, we identified that the histone demethylase KDM4A played a critical role in the invasive growth and metastasis of SCC mediated by the Oncogenic MET. To investigate the molecular mechanism through which KDM4A inhibit the tumor cell invasion, we knock-down KDM4A in SCC23/MET cell and performed a gene microarray to examine which genes may be regulaged by kDM4A.

DESIGN
We generated two stable cell lines. one was infected with virus containing scramble and another infected with virus infected with virus containing KDM4A shRNA. Total RNA were extracted from these two cell lines and subject to microarray.
