TITLE
Investigation of Alterations in Gene Expression in the Retina Induced by Intravitreal Injection of gold and silicate nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated the gene expression induced by locally delivered gold and silicate nanoaprticles with the diameter of 20 and 100 nm in the retina. We injected nanoparticles into the vitreous cavity of 5-week-old male C57BL/6 mice. Au20 indicates gold nanoparticles of which diameters were 20 nm, Au100 gold nanoparticles of which diameters were 100 nm, Si20 silicate nanoparticles of which diameters were 20 nm, and Si100 silicate nanoparticles of which diameters were 100 nm.

DESIGN
We intravitreally injected PBS or nanoparticles (gold and silicate) into the right eyes of 5-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 12 per group). PBS-treated mice were regarded as negative control. Four retinal tissues were pooled into 1 test tube and prepared for further analyses.
