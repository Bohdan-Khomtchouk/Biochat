TITLE
CD109 plays a role in osteoclastogenesis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The primary aim of this project was to identify novel factors, in particular the cell-surface protein CD109, which regulate osteoclastogenesis. Microarray analysis was performed comparing two pre-osteoclast cell lines generated from the RAW 264.7 osteoclast cell line: one that has the capacity to fuse forming large multinucleated cells and one that does not fuse. It was found that CD109 was up-regulated by > 17-fold in the osteoclast forming cell line when compared to the cell line that does not fuse.

DESIGN
H10 (osteoclastogenic cell line) and C8 (non osteoclastogenic cell line) cells were plated for two days in 60 mm tissue culture dishes at a density of 0.5 x 10^6  in a culture medium consisting of 8 ml of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 10% antibiotics (164 IU/mL of penicillin G, 50 mg/ml of gentamicin, and 0.25 mg/ml of fungizone) as well as purified recombinant RANKL (60ng/ml). Following two days of culture, total RNA was extracted from the  H10 and C8 cells (Qiagen RNeasy Minikit, Germantown, MD, USA) and the concentration of extracted RNA was measured (using a nanodrop method). Experiment was done in triplicates
