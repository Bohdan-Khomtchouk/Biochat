TITLE
Expression profiling in the muscular dystrophies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is a large series human Duchenne muscular dystrophy patient muscle biopsies, in specific age groups, using all available Affymetrix arrays (including a custom MuscleChip produced by the Hoffman lab). Both mixed groups of patients (5 patient biopsies per group) and individual biopsies were done. Hypothesis: That the progression of DMD can be understood in terms of muscle molecular remodeling.
