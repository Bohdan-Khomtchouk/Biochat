TITLE
The sulfated laminarin triggers a stress transcriptome before priming the SA- and ROSdependent defenses during grapevine's induced resistance against Plasmopara viticola

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Cultivated grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is susceptible to many pathogens which cause significant losses to viticulture worldwide. Chemical control is available, but agro-ecological concerns have raised interest in alternative methods, especially in elicitation of plant immunity by bio-molecules such as Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). We have demonstrated that the beta-glucan laminarin (Lam) and its sulfated derivative (PS3) induce a PAMP-triggered immunity in grapevine against downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola). However, if Lam elicits classical grapevine defenses, PS3 triggered grapevine resistance via a poorly understood priming phenomenon. The aim of this study was to discover the mechanism of the PS3-induced resistance. On uninfected grapevine, we first investigated defense signaling and performed microarray experiments to identify early events and genes directly triggered by PS3.   Our results showed that PS3 i) was unable to elicit ROS and NO production, cytosolic Ca2+ variations, MAPK activation but triggered a long lasting plasma membrane depolarization in grapevine cells ii) up-regulated a stress-responsive transcriptome close to the one induced by Lam but only partly overlapping the ones triggered by salicylate (SA) or jasmonate (JA).  Finally, in response to P. viticola infection, PS3 specifically primed the SA- and ROS-dependent defense pathways leading to grapevine triggered immunity against this biotroph.

DESIGN
6 samples (Adj, PS3, Lam, ctrl, SA, JA) were analized with 3 biological replicates each, Adj and ctrl samples are reference samples
