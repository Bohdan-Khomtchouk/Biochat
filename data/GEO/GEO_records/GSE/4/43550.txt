TITLE
Small RNA Solexa sequencing of colorectal tumor and adjancent normal tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A pair of stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor and adjacent normal tissue were collected from a patient without Transcatheter Arterial Infusion chemotherapy (TAI) during surgical resection of CRC tumors. Another pair of stage III CRC tumor and adjancent normal tissue were collected from another patient who had been treated with TAI one week before surgical resection. Total RNA of the collected tissues were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The integrity of the RNA was checked with an ultraviolet spectrophotometry and 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Construction of small RNA libraries from size fractionated RNA was carried out by following Solexa protocol and the obtained libraries were sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer. We identified some de-regulated miRNAs in CRC tumor tissues. The expression levels of miR-142-5p were significantly reduced in tumor tissues of stage III CRC, then were increased significantly in tumor tissues receiving TAI and higher than tumor tissues without TAI. miR-142-5p is a potential tumor suppressor in CRC and is upregulated in tumor tissues after TAI, suggesting its potential clinical values for testing the functionality of TAI and predicting progress of CRC.

DESIGN
Examination of small RNA transcriptomes in colorectal tumor and adjancent normal tissues without and with Transcatheter Arterial Infusion chemotherapy using Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer.
