TITLE
Histone tail modification profiles of human renal tubule epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To annotate the regulatory elements in the renal tubule epithelial cells, we profiled 6 histone ChIP-seq in the human kidney epithelical cells (HKC8).

DESIGN
We pulled down the DNA with specific antibodies of interests against histone tail modifications in the human rebal tubule epithelial cells. The result can be interpretated with ChromHMM for different states.
