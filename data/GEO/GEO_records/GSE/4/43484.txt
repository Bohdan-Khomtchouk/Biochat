TITLE
Comparison study between Uremic patient with Healthy control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have significantly increased morbidity and mortality resulting from infections and cardiovascular diseases. Since monocytes play an essential role in host immunity, this study was directed to explore the gene expression profile and to identify differences in activated pathways in monocytes relevant to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and increased susceptibility to infections. Monocytes from CKD patients (stages 4 and 5, eGFR < 20 ml/min x 1.73 m2) and healthy donors were collected from peripheral blood. Microarray gene expression profile was done and data were interpreted by Genespring software and Panther tools website. Western blot was done to validate the pathway members. The results demonstrated that 487 and 258 genes were differentially up- and down regulated respectively in the patient group. Pathways involved in the inflammatory response were highly expressed and the Wnt/Î²- catenin signaling pathway was the most significant pathway expressed in the patient group (P=0.02). Since this pathway has been attributed to a variety of inflammatory manifestations, the current finding may contribute to dysfunctional monocytes in CKD patients. To develop strategies to interfere with this pathway may improve host immunity and prevent cardiovascular complications in CKD patients.

DESIGN
Six gene expression Affymetrix chip were used. Three for each group
