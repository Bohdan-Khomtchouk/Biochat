Cadaveric vs. live donor kidneys

SUMMARY
Recipients of live donor transplant kidneys (LIV) exhibit a significantly longer allograft half-life compared with cadaveric donor organs (CADs). The reasons are incompletely understood. Therefore this study sought to elucidate the genome-wide gene expression profiles in microdissected transplant kidney biopsies obtained from five cadaveric and five matched live donors before transplantation. cDNA microarrays were used to determine the transcripts in isolated glomeruli (G) and the tubulointerstitial (TI) compartment. Data were subjected to hierarchical clustering, maxT adjustment and a jackknife procedure to ensure robustness of reported findings; validation was performed by independent analysis of split biopsies and TaqMan-PCR. One hundred and thirteen sequences representing 62 unique genes (17 redundant features), and 34 ESTs separated G from TI. No difference in gene expression was found in G between LIV and CAD kidneys, but nine genes (two represented twice) and three ESTs were abundantly expressed in the CAD TI compared with LIV. The main biological function of these genes is counter regulation of oxidative stress. Promoter analysis of significant features suggested coregulated gene groups. These data suggest that CAD kidneys exhibit a distinctly different set of transcripts in the TI compartment but not in the G compartment when compared with LIV kidneys. An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract. Keywords: all_pairs
