TITLE
Effects on the hepatic transcriptome due to caloric restriction are not altered by milking frequency

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The ruminant liver has multiple roles in the dairy cow and many of these are crucial in nutrient supply during lactation. Reduced feed intake alters the expression of many genes and pathways in the liver, inducing a period of negative energy balance. Once-daily milking is a management strategy to reduce the effects of periods of negative energy balance so the objective of this study was to determine if once-daily milking altered hepatic gene transcription during a period of negative energy balance induce by caloric restriction. Multiparous Holstein-Friesian and Holstein-Friesian x Jersey cows (n = 120) were grazed on pasture and milked twice daily (2X) from calving until 34 ± 6 days in milk (mean ± standard deviation). Cows were then allocated to one of four treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. Treatments consisted of two milking frequencies (2X or once daily; 1X) and two feeding levels for three weeks: adequately fed (AF), consuming 14.3 kg dry matter intake/cow per d, or underfed (UF) consuming 8.3 kg dry matter intake /cow per d.  After the treatment period, all cows were fed to target grazing residuals ? 1600 kg DM/cow per d and milked 2X for 20 wk. Liver tissue was collected from 12 cows per treatment by subcutaneous biopsy at 3 wk relative to treatment start, RNA extracted and transcript abundance of genes quantified.

DESIGN
48 animals were enrolled in this study, a liver sample from 45 animals was used for microarray analysis. A reference design was used for hybridisation, whereby each of the 46 samples were hybridised to individual microarrays along with a pooled reference sample. The reference sample was generated by taking equal concentrations of each of the experimental samples.
