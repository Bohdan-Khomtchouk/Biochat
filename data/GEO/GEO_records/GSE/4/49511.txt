TITLE
Identifying Targets of DSX with ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We have used ChIP-seq on Drosophila  S2 cells to characterize genome-wide DSX occupancy.

DESIGN
We have perfomed ChIP-seq on S2 cells transfected with either V5-tagged DSXF or DSXM constructs. We performed three biological replicates for each ChIP sample and two biological replicates for the input samples.  For peak calling and analysis, the reads from all biological replicates were pooled before aligning them to the genome.
