TITLE
Expression data from rat spinal cord injury and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) or olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) transplantation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the changes in the spinal cord transcriptome after a spinal cord contusion injury and MSC or OEC transplantation. The cells were injected immediately or 7 days after the injury. The mRNA of the spinal cord injured segment was extracted and analyzed by microarray at 2 and 7 days after cell grafting.

DESIGN
52 total samples were analyzed in 13 different groups. Each group include 4 samples and each one were analyzed as a biological replica. The intact animals were used as control of injury. The vehicle (VHC) groups were used as control of transplantation procedure. The MSC or OEC graft were injected at the day of injury (acute graft) or seven days after injury (delayed graft). The samples from engrafted animals were obtained at 2 or 7 days after cell transplantation. To determine the effects of MSC or OEC transplantation, the expression value of each engrafted sample were compared with correspondent VHC group.
