TITLE
The Diagnostic Value of Salivary microRNA in Esophageal Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tissue microRNAs (miRNAs) can detect cancers and predict prognosis. Several recent studies reported that tissue, plasma, and saliva miRNAs share similar expression profiles. In this study, we investigated the diagnostic value of salivary miRNAs (including whole saliva and saliva supernatant) for detection of esophageal cancer.

DESIGN
By Agilent microarray, six deregulated miRNAs from whole saliva samples from seven patients with esophageal cancer and three healthy controls were selected. The six selected miRNAs were subjected to validation of their expression levels by RT-qPCR using both whole saliva and saliva supernatant samples from an independent set of 39 patients with esophageal cancer and 19 healthy controls.
