TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of Campylobacter jejuni macrolide resistant strain JL272 to 4mg/L erythromycin treatment

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Erythromycin is the drug of choice to treat campylobacteriosis, but resistance to this antibiotic is rising. The adaptive mechanisms employed by Campylobacter jejuni to erythromycin treatment remain unknown. The aim of this study is to determine the molecular basis underlying Campylobacterâ€™s immediate response to Ery treatment.

DESIGN
The design utilized an available two color microarray slide for the entire transcriptome of Campylobacter jejuni macrolide resistant strain JL272. One hybridizations were performed: sham-treated JL272 v.s. lethal dose erythromycin treated JL272. Samples were  independently grown and harvested.  There were three biological replicates of each sample.
