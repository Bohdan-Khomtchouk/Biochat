TITLE
Genes associated with prostate cancer are differentially expressed in African American and European American men (tumor specimens)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A total of 1,507 probes measured the expression of 517 genes on the custom Illumina DASL assay testing if select genes showed cancer-specific differential expression according to race. Genes were chosen for inclusion in the assay based on existing evidence from the literature and our own data for their importance to prostate cancer, prostate cancer aggressiveness, or cancer in general.

DESIGN
639 FFPE tumor samples (270 African American, 369 European American)
