TITLE
Verification of immunogenic nature by microarray screening

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni NCTC 11168 = ATCC 700819

SUMMARY
Screening of 22 novel proteins derived from Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 identified prior via screening of cDNA libraries. The full-length proteins were attached using a specific HaloTag to their corresponding ligand surface, HaloLink. Screening was performed using three different polyclonal antibodies to Campylobacter jejuni and detection was achieved by goat polyclonal antibody to rabbit IgG conjugated with Chromeo-546. In order to assess their potential immungenic nature and rank the proteins investigated, comparative analysis using already described antigens from C. jejuni were used in the assay.

DESIGN
Each microarray was separated into different incubation chambers using the ProPlate (Grace Biolabs) multi-well gaskets. While for two slides (2009 and 2447), three chambers were used, the remaining slides were designed to use 16 different compartments. Each compartment could be incubated with different antibodies and represent individual replicates of the slides. As positive references, hisJ and cjaA were used. For negative controls, argC and gapA were used, and the crude lysates of the expression host (Acella E. coli) and buffer were spotted as well. For slides 2009 and 2447, three-well gaskets were used allowing for seven replicates per sample, while only incubation with one antibody. Slides 416033 and 416826 used 16-well gaskets and only hisJ and argC as protein references. Samples and controls were spotted in quadruplicate. Finally, for 1000 and 1001, samples were spotted in triplicate, whereas controls were spotted in quadruplicate using hisJ, cjaA, argC and gapA as protein references.
