TITLE
Atrial Identity Is Determined by A COUP-TFII Regulatory Network (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Embryonic cardiomyocytes possess the plasticity to choose between atrial and ventricular fates. For a limited window of time, the transcription factor COUP-TFII (Nr2f2) sufficiently and essentially confers the atrial identity through direct and indirect regulation of nearly half of chamber specific genes.

DESIGN
Examination of COUP-TFII binding sites in embryonic artia
