TITLE
Novel mechanisms of galactose toxicity in human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT)-deficient cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression profiles in GALT-deficient and GALT-reconstituted cells showed that cells lacking GALT activity responded to galactose challenge by activating a set of genes characteristic of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.  This response was specific to galactose insult, as cells grown in glucose or hexose-free media did not exhibit ER stress. Keywords: GALT infected cells
