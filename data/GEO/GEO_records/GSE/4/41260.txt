TITLE
Expression Profiles of E11.5 Mouse Optic Fissure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice that are mutant for both Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 specifically in the developing retina develop coloboma. To analyze the transcripts that are affected by defective FGF signaling, we micro-dissected the optic fissure region from the control and FGFR condtional mutant mice and did microarray analysis.

DESIGN
E11.5 control and Six3Cre+; Fgfr1fx/fx;Fgfr2 fx/fx optic fissures are dissected using laser-assisted micro-dissection microscope, RNAs are extracted and labelled and hybridyzed to chips
