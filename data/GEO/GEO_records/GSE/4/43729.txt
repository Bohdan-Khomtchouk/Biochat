TITLE
Proliferation-dependent alterations of the DNA methylation landscape underlie hematopoietic stem cell aging

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene Expression profiling of HSCs isolated at different stages of ontogeny to address correlation between gene expression and changes in DNA methylation

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of hematopoietic stem cells isolated from e14.5 fetal liver (lineage- ckit+ sca1+CD150+ CD48- Mac1+), 3 month old mice (lineage- ckit+ sca1+ CD34- Flk2-) and 25 month old mice  (lineage- ckit+ sca1+ CD34- Flk2-)
