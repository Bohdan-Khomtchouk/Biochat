TITLE
Combinatory microarray and SuperSAGE analyses identify pairing-dependently transcribed genes in Schistosoma mansoni males, including follistatin [SuperSAGE]

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
Comparing the transcriptomes of pairing-experienced (EM) and pairing-unexperienced (UM) male Schistosoma mansoni (in biological triplicates) we detected 253 genes to be significantly differeantially (p < 1-10; log2ratios < -0.585 or > +0.585)  transcribed.

DESIGN
pairing-experienced (EM) and pairing-unexperienced (UM) male Schistosoma mansoni were compared by SuperSAGE (Matsumura et al., 2003; with minor changes: Molina et al., 2008), sequencing Illumina (Solexa)
