TITLE
Expression data of gene knockout Plasmodium falciparum clones

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
The variant antigen, Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), expressed on the surface of P. falciparum infected Red Blood Cells (iRBCs) is a critical virulence factor for malaria. Each parasite encodes 60 antigenically distinct var genes encoding PfEMP1s, but during infection the clonal parasite population expresses only one gene at a time before switching to the expression of a new variant antigen as an immune evasion mechanism to avoid the hostâ€™s antibody responses. The mechanism by which 59 of the 60 var genes are silenced remains largely unknown. We used microarrays to detail the global programme changes of gene expression caused by each gene knockout with a particular view towards which gene knockout results in transcriptional upregulation of the entire var gene family.
