TITLE
Time course response of Synechocystis PCC 6803 to dehydration/desiccation

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
The responses of the transcriptome were monitored in Synechocysis PCC 6803 during a linear rate of evaporation of the culture to dryness (desiccation).  For each time point, total RNA were isolated from stressed and unstressed cells, reverse-transcribed, differentially labelled (dye swapped), hybridized together (stressed versus unstressed samples) and analyzed with DNA glass microarrays (two slides per each time point) (Custom-commercial array : CyanoCHIP version 2.0, TAKARA). To identify differentially expressed genes, the median of the normalized ratio of Cy5/Cy3 intensity was calculated for each spot of the replicated dye-swap. The results of the analysis were carefully examined to exclude the dye effect between the 2 Cy-swapped arrays. Keywords: Dehydration, stress response, time course, transcription, cyanobacteria
