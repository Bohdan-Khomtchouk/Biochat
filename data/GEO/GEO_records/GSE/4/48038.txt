TITLE
Pupylated proteins in Corynebacterium glutamicum revealed by MudPIT analysis

ORGANISM
Gluconobacter oxydans

SUMMARY
In a manner similar to ubiquitin, the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) has been shown to target proteins for degradation via the proteasome in mycobacteria. However, not all actinobacteria possessing the Pup protein also harbor a proteasome, suggesting fates for pupylated proteins other than degradation via a proteasome or degradation at all. In the present study we set out to study pupylation in the proteasome-lacking non-pathogenic model microorganism and biotechnological workhorse Corynebacterium glutamicum. A defined pup deletion mutant of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 grew as the control indicating that pupylation seems to be dispensable under the conditions tested. By expression of homologous Pup carrying a poly-histidine tag in C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 we purified the first pupylome of a microorganism lacking a proteasome. Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) unraveled 54 proteins being pupylated in this organism. Similar to mycobacteria, the majority of pupylated proteins in C. glutamicum can be classified as enzymes of the metabolism or as involved in translation. These results help to elucidate the common target pathways of pupylation in bacteria.
