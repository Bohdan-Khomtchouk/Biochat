TITLE
effect of sucrose feeding to detached leaves

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The effect of sucrose feeding on gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves was investigated using affymetrix ATH1 microarrays. For this, petioles of detached leaves were put in a solution containing either sucrose or sorbitol (control). Sugars were taken up into the leaf via the respiration stream for 13 hours. After that, leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen and RNA was extracted for analysis. Keywords: sucrose feeding
