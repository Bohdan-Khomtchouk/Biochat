TITLE
Gene expression of hormone-treated U2OS cells expressing GR alleles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a hormone-activated, DNA-binding transcriptional regulatory factor, which regulates diverse aspects of physiology. GR recognizes specifically imperfect palindromic six base pair “half sites separated by thoursee base pair “spacers”, binding as an inverted dimer. In vivo, different GR target genes depend on different functional surfaces  of GR for proper regulation, but rules dictating the relationship between sequence and utilization of distinct GR functional surfaces remain unknown.In this study, we measured changes in gene expression and genomic occupancy upon glucocorticoid treatment of isogenic cultured human cell lines expressing alleles of GR bearing differences in particular functional surfaces.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isoalted from U2OS cells expressing GRalpha, GRgamma, A477T, 30iiB, or E773R after treatment with 100 nM dexamethasone for 2, 4, or 24 hours, or ethanol for 4 hours (0 hours). There are four biological replicates of each condition.
