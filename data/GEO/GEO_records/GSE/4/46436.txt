TITLE
Expression data from neonatal rat ovaries following LPS exposure

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Inflammatory processes play an important role in regulation of ovarian development, in particularly early in life. Neonatal immune challenge by administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been previously demonstrated to result in diminished ovarian reserve and altered reproductive lifespan. In this study we aimed to characterise the cellular mechanisms that may underpin impaired ovulatory capacity and reduced oocyte development, induced by LPS treatment. Rat pups were administered with LPS or saline on postnatal days 3 and 5. Ovaries were obtained on postnatal day 7 to examine the effect of LPS administration on the ovarian transcriptome.

DESIGN
Rat pups were administered intraperitoneally either 0.05mg/kg of LPS (Salmonella Enteritidis) or an equivalent volume of non-pyrogenic saline on postnatal days (PNDs) 3 and 5, and ovaries were obtained on PND 7 for RNA extraction and hybridization on an Agilent-028279 SurePrint G3 Rat GE 8x60K Array platform.
