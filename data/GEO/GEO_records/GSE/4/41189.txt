TITLE
Expression analysis of Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 WT and âˆ†fnr mutant

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 ?fnr mutant, compared to the wild-type strain. The mutations engineered into this strain produce a strain lacking the FNR protein. WT strains were grown under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions.
