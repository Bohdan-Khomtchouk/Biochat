TITLE
Tcf-1 expression in murine thymus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The DNA binding factor Tcf-1 is one of the most prominently expressed genes in thymocytes yet its global DNA binding pattern remained unknown. Here we have assessed by ChIP-seq the Tcf-1 binding pattern in murine thymocytes in WT B6 mice and in mice expressing a stabilized form of the Tcf-1 binding partner beta-Catenin (CAT mice).

DESIGN
Tcf-1 ChIP-seq of 2 samples and 2 input controls and H3K4mel3 ChIP-seq of 1 sample and 1 input control.
