TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of E. coli whole genome during heat inactivation processes related to industrial cooking

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. EDL933

SUMMARY
This study was conducted to determine the impact of extreme temperatures, aiming at controlling microorganisms by cooking, on the physiology and the transcriptome of  Escherichia coli. ABSTRACT: Because the genome of Escherichia coli K12 is well understood, this organism was used as a model to investigate physiological and molecular changes during cell adaptation and survival to cooking temperatures used in the food industry. Bacteria grown at 37°C to stationary phase in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth, were heated at 58°C or 60°C to reach a process lethality value (F) of 2 and 3, or until an internal core temperature of 71°C was reached (control cooking temperature). Both growth recovery and cell membrane integrity were evaluated immediately after heating and a global transcription analysis was performed by using gene expression microarrays. Only cells heated at 58°C F = 2 were still able to grow on liquid or solid BHI after heat treatment. However, their transcriptome did not differ significantly compared to those of bacteria heated at 58°C F = 3 (P-FDR > 0.01) where no growth recovery was observed post treatment. Genome-wide transcriptomic data obtained at 71°C were distinct from the other treatments. Quantification of heat-shock genes expression by real-time PCR revealed that dnaK and groEL mRNA levels were significantly lower at 71°C than at 58°C and 60°C (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, despite of similar cell inactivation but growth on BHI media after heating, 132 and 8 genes were differentially expressed at 71°C when compared to 58°C and 60°C at F = 3 respectively (P-FDR < 0.01). Among them, genes like aroA, citE, glyS, oppB and asd, whose expression was up-regulated at 71°C, may be considered as good biomarkers to determine more accurately the efficiency of heat treatments.
