TITLE
IM007 - Mouse infection with A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG4/2004 (H5N1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG4/2004 (H5N1) is an NS1trunc124 mutation in the wild type A/Vietman/1203/2004 (H5N1). The goal of this study was to determine the host response (C57BL/6 mouse model) to the NS1 truncation at both 10^3 PFU and 10^4 PFU.

DESIGN
Groups of 20-week-old C57BL/6 mice were infected with the A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG4/2004 (H5N1). This is an NS1trunc124 mutation in the wild type A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) virus. Infections were done at 10^3 PFU or 10^4 PFU or time-matched mock infected. Time points were 1, 2, 4 and 7 d.p.i. There were 3-5 animals/dose/time point. Lung samples were collected for virus load, transcriptional and proteomics analysis. Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.
