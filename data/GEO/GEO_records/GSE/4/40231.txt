TITLE
The Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study: Global Gene Expression data from coronary and carotid artery disease patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tissue samples have been isolated during corornary artery  by-pass grafting (CABG)surgery from the atheroscelrotic arterial wall (AAW, aortic root puncture for proxmal ligation of by-pass vessel), non-atherosclertoci arterial wall (NAAW, distal part of mammary artery used a graft for LAD), liver, skeletal muscle (Recturs m), pericardial mediastinal visceral fat) in CAD patients. Carotid lesions samples from 25 validation patients. We used microarrays to measure global gene expression in these tissues to cluster groups of functionally associated genes and then, second step clustering of patients within each cluster  to link clusters to patient phenotypes primarily coronary stenosis (CAD) and Intima media thickness (IMT) in carotid stenosis patients. .

DESIGN
All samples were taken during surgery. The time of operation was less than 3 hours in most instances. Sammon plots show strong clustering of tissue-specific arrays. Even separating AAW from NAAW and carotid lesions.
