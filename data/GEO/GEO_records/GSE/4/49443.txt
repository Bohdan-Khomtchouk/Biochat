TITLE
miRNA expression profiling of isolated populations of prepachytene spermatocytes, pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids of PWD and B6 male mice

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
MiRNA expression profiling of isolated populations of prepachytene spermatocytes (LP), pachytene spermatocytes (RP) and spermatids (ST) from PWD and B6 was performed to study the genome wide variation in miRNA expression between two mouse subspecies.
