TITLE
Studies of target genes for signal transduction pathways (using a Ras1-, a Cdc42- and a Gap1-mutant) in the basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune.

ORGANISM
Schizophyllum commune

SUMMARY
Transcriptome changes associated with signal transduction mutants were analysed in order to identify targets of the distinct pathways of Ras1, Cdc42 and Gap1. Two monokaryons (12-43 and 4-39), a dikaryon (W22 x 12-43), a constitutive active Ras1 mutant (T2G12V, monokaryon), a Cdc42 mutant (G12V, monokaryon) and a ∆gap1 x ∆gap1 dikaryon (F15 x F28, deletion of Gap1) were analyzed for that purpose.

DESIGN
With microarray analysis mRNA expression in different mutants of the basidiomycete S. commune was analyzed. Genes which show regulation in the comparison either of the two monokaryons 12-43 and 4-39 (for Ras2 and Cdc42 mutant) or the dikaryon W22 x 12-43 (for Gap1 x Gap1 dikaryon) have been eliminated from other comparisons as stage-specific (mono- or dikaryon) differences. Two biological replicate samples were analyzed for each condition.
