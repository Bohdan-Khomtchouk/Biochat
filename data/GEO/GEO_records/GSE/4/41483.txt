TITLE
The role of nitric oxide synthase activity in connection with induced resistance against low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cells harvested for microarray analysis were high-dose rate (HDR) irradiated, low-dose rate (LDR) irradiated or unirradiated T-47D cells. The HDR-irradiated cells were harvested 24h after a dose of 0.3 Gy at 35 Gy/h, a time where hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS) had returned. The HRS-deficient LDR-irradiated cells were harvested 2 months after a dose of 0.3 Gy at 0.3 Gy/h.

DESIGN
LDR-irradiated vs. Control (unirradiated) contains 4 biological replicates. HDR- vs. LDR-irradiated contains 3 biological replicates. HDR-irradiated vs. Control contains 4 biological replicates.
