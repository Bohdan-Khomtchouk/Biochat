TITLE
Effects of anti-IL13RA mAbs on IL-4 or IL-13 signalling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IL-4 and IL-13 are cytokines involved in type 2 immune responses involved in atopic asthma and other diseases. They have a partially overlapping set of cognate receptors whose roles are incompletely understood. Here we explore the effects of blocking one or both subunits of the IL-13 alpha receptor on the action of these cytokines on IMR-90 lung fibroblast cells.

DESIGN
IMR-90 lung fibroblast cells were cultured on matrigel and treated with various combinations of IL-4 (10 ng/ml), IL-13 (10ng/ml), 228 B/C (which blocks signaling from IL13RA1), and 11H4 (which blocks signaling from IL13RA1 and IL13RA2).
