TITLE
Influenza peptide reactivity within a cohort of age-stratified individuals pre and post vaccination with the 2008/2009 trivalent influenza vaccine

ORGANISM
Influenza B virus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that peptide array reactivity will reveal patterns that can be associated with poor or effective neutralization response to seasonal influenza vaccine We diluted patient sera 1:80 and incubated dilutions on a streptavidin-coated glass surface that was printed with biotinylated peptides derived from seasonal strains of influenza hemagglutinin included in the 2008/2009 trivalent influenza vaccine
