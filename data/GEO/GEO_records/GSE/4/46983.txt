TITLE
Heme regulates the development of iron-recycling macrophages from monocytes (heme-treated BMM)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Splenic red pulp macrophages (RPM) degrade senescent erythrocytes and recycle heme-associated iron. The transcription factor Spic is selectively expressed by RPM and is required for their development, but the physiologic stimulus inducing Spic is unknown. Here, we report that Spic also regulated the development of F4/80+VCAM+ bone marrow macrophages (BMM) and that Spic expression in BMM and RPM development was induced by heme, a metabolite of erythrocyte degradation. Pathologic hemolysis induced loss of RPM and BMM due to excess heme but induced Spic in monocytes to generate new RPM and BMM. Spic expression in monocytes was constitutively inhibited by the transcriptional repressor Bach1. Heme induced proteasome-dependent BACH1 degradation and rapid Spic derepression. Further, cysteine-proline dipeptide motifs in BACH1 that mediate heme-dependent degradation were necessary for Spic induction by heme. These findings are the first example of metabolite-driven differentiation of a tissue-resident macrophage subset and provide new insight into iron homeostasis. Global gene expression pattern of bone marrow-derived macrophages generated with GM-CSF in vitro and treated with heme were compared to those treated with vehicle at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours after treatment.

DESIGN
GM-CSF cultures of Spic(igfp/igfp) BM cells were treated with heme (80 Âµm) or vehicle after 6 days in culture. Adherent fraction of cells were harvested 6 hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours after treatment and RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and submitted for amplification, labeling and hybridization. Expression values were analyzed after RMA quantile normalization using ArrayStar software (DNASTAR).
