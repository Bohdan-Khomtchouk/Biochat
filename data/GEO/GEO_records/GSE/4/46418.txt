TITLE
Comparative transcriptome analysis of Brucella melitensis 16M and its hfq mutant under acidified minimum medium (GEM4.0) conditions

ORGANISM
Brucella melitensis bv. 1 str. 16M

SUMMARY
Hfq is a bacterial Sm-like protein which serves as a post-transcriptional regulator of global gene expression. It has been shown to be involved in a wide range of cellular processes and pathways. To characterize the regulation roles of Hfq in Brucella melitensis, the in vitro hfq induction conditions simulating intracellular environments were firstly defined, and then, the transcriptome of the hfq mutant was compared to that of the wild type strain. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that a total of 359 genes showed a > 2.0-fold change in transcript abundance in Î”hfq when compared to that in 16M.
