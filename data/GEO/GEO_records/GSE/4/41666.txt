TITLE
Disulphide bond inhibitors in 2 cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate which ER cargo maturation processes may be oxygen dependent, we first reasoned that the transcriptional response may be tailored specifically to counteract the mechanism of the imposed stress.  Therefore, we compared the transcriptional regulation of the ERome during anoxic conditions to ER stress caused by lack of glycosylation (tunicamycin) or chaperone inactivation by calcium depletion (thapsigargin)

DESIGN
In two cancer cell lines (colon carcinoma HCT116, and hepatocellular carcinoma Hep G2) cells were given one of 4 treatments. 24 hours of 0.0% O2 (Anoxia), 1.5 µg/ml tunicamycin or 0.3 µM thapsigargin with a control 21% O2 (Normoxia).  Cells were exposed to hypoxia and anoxia in H35 and H85 HypOxystations (Don Whitley Scientific). 3 biological replicates of each experiment were carried out. Total of 24 samples.
