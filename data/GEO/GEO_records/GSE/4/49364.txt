TITLE
Global expression analysis of differential expression of genes working under Soil Water Stress condition in different genotypes of rice in Vegetative and Grain-filling stage [set 1]

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
One of the serious constraints to realize high level of rice crop productivity in Indian agriculture has been due to soil moisture stress (SMS) situation that growing plants often face. In order to increase or maintain the crop productivity in SMS situation our initial aim is to understand the drought response mechanism in different genotypes of rice. For thorough analysis of SMS situation in rice we have taken here two wild genotypes of rice namely Oryza nivara, Oryza rufipogan and three Indian cultivar namely Oryza Nagina-22, Oryza IR20 and Oryza Vandana, where IR20 is known to be susceptible and Vandana is known to be tolerant under SMS condition. Global analysis of transcript profiling under SMS condition reveal the actual picture of genes responsive to stress situation in different genetic background of rice. Furthermore it would help us in the selection of most desirable resource for crop breeding without compromising the yield of crop. We used the 44k rice Oligoarray from Agilent technologies to study the transcript profiling from five genotypes of rice under control, soil moisture stress and after recovery conditions during vegetative and grainfilling phase.Here in case of Nagina-22 we have taken grainfilling stage.
