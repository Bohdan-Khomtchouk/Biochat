TITLE
Transcriptional changes in intraepithelial CD4 lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated transcriptional changes in CD4CD8aa and CD4 intraepthelial lymphocytes. TCRαβ thymocytes differentiate to either CD8αβ cytotoxic T lymphocytes or CD4 T helper cells. This functional dichotomy is controlled by key transcription factors, including the T helper master regulator, ThPOK, which suppresses the cytolytic-program in MHC class II restricted CD4 thymocytes. ThPOK continues to repress CD8-lineage genes in mature CD4 T cells, even as they differentiate to T helper effector subsets. Surprisingly, we show here that the T helper-fate is not fixed and that mature antigen-stimulated CD4 T cells can switch off Thpok expression and reactivate CD8-lineage genes. This unexpected plasticity results in the post-thymic termination of the T helper program and the functional differentiation of distinct MHC class II restricted CD4 cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

DESIGN
Intraepithelial_CD4_CD8a neg vs CD8a pos.  Two sample set of CD4CD8aa and CD4 intraepthelial lymphocytes (IEL) from small intestine of RAG knockout mice ( 8 weeks after transfer of naive CD4 cells, adoptive tranfer model of colitis), were prepared via  cell sorting, and RNA was prepared by TRIZol (Invitrogen, USA) . Data were analyzed in GeneSpring GX10.  For microarray analysis, RNA was labeled and hybridized to GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays according to the Affymetrix protocols. Data were analyzed in GeneSpring GX10.
