TITLE
miR expression profiling of mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor populations [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Several individual miRNAs (miRs) have been implicated as potent regulators of important processes during normal and malignant hematopoiesis.  In addition, many miRs have been shown to fine-tune intricate molecular networks, in concert with other regulatory elements.  In order to study hematopoietic networks as a whole, we first created a comprehensive map of global miR expression during early murine hematopoiesis.   Next, we determined the copy number per cell for each miR in each of the examined stem and progenitor cell types.  As data is emerging indicating that miRs function robustly mainly when they are expressed above a certain threshold (~100 copies per cell), our database provides a resource for determining which miRs are expressed at a potentially functional level in each cell type.   Finally, we combine our miR expression map with matched mRNA expression data and external prediction algorithms, using a Bayesian modeling approach to create a global landscape of predicted miR-mRNA interactions within each of these hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell subsets.  This approach identifies several interaction networks comprising a “stemness” signature in the most primitive hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations, as well as “myeloid” patterns associated with two branches of myeloid development.

DESIGN
Six populations of mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitors have been analyzed (LT-HSC, ST-HSC, MPP, CMP, GMP, MEP).  2-3 replicates are included for each sample.
