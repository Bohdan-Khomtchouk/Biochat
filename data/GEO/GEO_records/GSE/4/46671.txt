TITLE
A broad array of anticancer activities of the immunosuppressive drug mycophenolic acid (MPA) is suggested by pathway analyses of gene expression and validated by proteomic and functional assays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression microarray was performed to assess the global changes coupled to targeted validation of proteomic profiling to reveal the broad anticancer activities of the immunosuppressive drug Mycophenolic acid (MPA) and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these activities.

DESIGN
We conducted gene expression microarray experiments on AGS cancers cells treated with Mycophenolic acid (MPA). A concentration of 2ug/ml was selected to treat AGS cells and the treated cells were harvested at 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours of culture with the drug.  Gene expression analyses were carried out using Illumina Human 12 Beadchips.
