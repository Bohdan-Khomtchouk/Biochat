TITLE
Increased Neanderthal ancestry in genomic regions associated with lipid catabolism in contemporary Europeans

ORGANISM
Pan troglodytes

SUMMARY
While Neanderthals are extinct, fragments of their genome still persist in the genomes of contemporary humans. Here, we show that such Neanderthal-like sequences are not distributed randomly in contemporary human genomes. Specifically, while genome-wide frequency of Neanderthal-like sites is close to 6% in all out-of-Africa populations, genes involved in lipid catabolism contain large excess Neanderthal-like sequences in Europeans (24.3%), but not in Asians (12.4%). While lipid catabolism cannot be assayed in Neanderthals, we took advantage of genetic divergence between human populations, chimpanzees and Neanderthals to predict metabolic divergence expected from the observed excess of Neanderthal gene flow into Europeans. We confirmed predicted changes in lipid catabolism using hydrophobic metabolome measurements in the brain tissue and further linked these metabolic changes to gene expression divergence.

DESIGN
14 human and 6 chimpanzee samples were sequenced.
