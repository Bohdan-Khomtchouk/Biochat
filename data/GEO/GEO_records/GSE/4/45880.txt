TITLE
Cytokine-induced changes in the gene expression profile of human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell-line, hCMEC/D3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the current study, we aimed to investigate the gene expression pattern in hCMEC/D3 cells using mRNA microarray analysis and to establish wheather hCMEC/D3 cells are a suitable in vitro human BBB model of neuroinflammation.

DESIGN
To identify the major molecular process involved in cytokine-induced changes in brain endothelial phenotypic characteristics and subsequently function, we analysed changes in mRNA expression profile after activation of hCMEC/D3 cells by TNFa and IFNg and results were contrasted to unstimulated cells. hCMEC/D3 cells were grown on collagen-coated six-well plates and treated with 10 ng/ml of TNFa and IFNg (R & D systems, Abingdon, Oxon, UK) for 24 h
