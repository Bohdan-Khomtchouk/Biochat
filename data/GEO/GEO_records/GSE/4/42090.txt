TITLE
The innate and adaptive immune response to BCG stimulation in splenocytes taken from C57BL/6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this experiment was to investigate differential gene expression in splenocytes stimulated with BCG from naïve and BCG vaccinated mice. The differences between naïve and BCG vaccinated mice might indicate the mechanisms by which BCG vaccination confers an enhanced ability of splenocytes from BCG vaccinated mice to inhibit growth of BCG in splenocyte cultures as compared with splenocytes from naive animals.

DESIGN
Splenocytes from 4 naïve and 4 BCG vaccinated female C57bl/6 mice were cultured for 12 hours with BCG (MOI 1:1) or without (unstimulated control). Each animal had a stimulated and an unstimulated sample hybridised to a beadchip.
