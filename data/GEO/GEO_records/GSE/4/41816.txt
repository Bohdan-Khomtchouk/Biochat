TITLE
Gene expression profiling of MDA231, BT549, and SUM159PT cells after selumetinib treatment or DUSP4 siRNA knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MDA231, BT549, and SUM159PT basal-like breast cancer cell lines were transfected with non-targeting siRNA (siCONTROL), siRNA targeting DUSP4 (siDUSP4), or siCONTROL + 4 or 24 hr of 1uM selumetinib.  Cells were harvested at 96 hr post-siRNA transfection.  Data were Log2 RMA normalized.

DESIGN
We sought to identify changes in gene expression after MEK inhibition, or after loss of DUSP4 function in breast cancer cell lines.
