TITLE
Gene expression data from differentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes treated with Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitoleic Acid, or Oleic Acid

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Saturated fatty acids (SFA) are widely thought to induce inflammation in adipose tissue (AT), while monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are purported to have the opposite effect; however, it is unclear if individual SFA and MUFA behave similarly. Our goal was to examine adipocyte transcriptional networks regulated by individual SFA (palmitic acid, PA; stearic acid, SA) and MUFA (palmitoleic acid, PMA; oleic acid, OA). Global gene expression was examined in differentiated preadipocytes treated with either 250 μM PA, SA, PMA, or OA for 48 hrs. Individual fatty acid treatments had significant effects on adipocyte gene expression. Functional analyses revealed that PA induced the TLR signalling pathway, while PMA had the opposite effect. SA and OA had similar effects, with increases in key metabolic pathways including mTOR and PPAR signalling, and a reduction in TLR signalling. Ccl5 was validated as a candidate gene that may mediate the differential inflammatory effects of SFA and MUFA in AT. Individual SFA and MUFA trigger distinct transcriptional responses in differentiated preadipocytes, with inflammatory and metabolic pathways particularly sensitive to these fatty acids.

DESIGN
A total of 4 microarrays were run for each FA treatment. We experienced difficulties with the cRNA amplification for one replicate from the OA treated cells; therefore this treatment group only had an n=3. For each sample, 100 ng of total RNA was prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.1 ST array strips, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix Inc., Fremont, CA, USA).
