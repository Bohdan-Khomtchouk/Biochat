TITLE
OsJMJ705 preferentially activates stress-responsive genes

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Histone methylation is important epigenomic information for gene regulation and genome activity To evaluate genome-wide effect of OsJMJ705  on gene expression, we used the Affymetrix microarray technologies to analyze the transcriptomes of the wild type, over-expression plants and the T-DNA mutant. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that up-regulated genes were significantly enriched for the categories of stress-responsive genes.
