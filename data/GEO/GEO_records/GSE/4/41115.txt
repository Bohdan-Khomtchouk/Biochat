TITLE
Integrative genomic characterization of oral squamous cell carcinoma identifies frequent somatic drivers (microRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a disease with extensive morbidity and mortality and few useful molecular targets. Multiplatform integrated genomic analysis was performed in order to identify genomic drivers and molecularly discernible tumor subtypes. mRNA, miRNA and methylation data are all submitted to GEO

DESIGN
We measured microRNA expression of 43 OSCC cases with Agilent Human miRNA microarray rel12.0
