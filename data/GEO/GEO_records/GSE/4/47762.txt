TITLE
H4K16 acetylation marks active genes and enhancers of embryonic stem cells, but does not alter chromatin compaction [NimbleGen array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that acetylation of H4K16 is a new marker of active enhancers and that some enhancers are marked by H3K4me1, MOF and H4K16ac but not by acetylated H3K27 or p300, suggesting that they are novel p300-independent regulatory elements.

DESIGN
ChIP on chip over neuronal and control genes for H4K16ac in undifferentiated 46c (sox1-gfp) ES cells and for 5 day differentiated FACS sorted Neural Progenitor Cells differentiated with NB27 and Neuro2 medium supplements
