TITLE
Polycomb proteins link Proliferation with DNA Replication

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Polycomb proteins control proliferation and cellular transformation regulating DNA replication independently of cell cycle checkpoints

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from MEF cells (derived from Ola129 mice) transiently transfected with Ezh2 specific and control esiRNA oligos 48 hrs. post-transfection.
