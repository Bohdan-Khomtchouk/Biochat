TITLE
Apelin/APJ signaling mediated by G alpha 13 and MEF2 in endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Evaluation of gene transcripts that are downstream of apelin/APJ signaling in HUVECs

DESIGN
Duplicates per group, subjected to: 1) control siRNA, 2) MEF2A and MEF2C siRNA, 3) G alpha 13 siRNA, and 4) apelin and APJ siRNA
