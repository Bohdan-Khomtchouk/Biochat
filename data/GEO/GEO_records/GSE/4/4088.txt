TITLE
Neuronal Differentiation of Primary Myoblast Sphere Cultures

ORGANISM

Adult mouse muscle was enzymatically dissociated. Muscle derived stem cells proliferate unattached, in spheres, in the proliferation medium. Cells from spheres were also incubated in a differentiation medium. They differentiated into neurons after 7 days in culture. Keywords: neuronal differentiation
