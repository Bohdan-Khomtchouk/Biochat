TITLE
miRNA expression profiles in the serum of cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy compared to healthy cats

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs negatively regulate gene expression and may serve as biomarkers for human cardiomyopathy. In the domestic cat, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) represents the most common primary cardiomyopathy. In humans, the etiology of HCM is linked to mutations in genes of contractile muscle proteins, while in cats a clear proof for causal mutations is missing. The etiology of feline HCM is uncertain. Diagnosis is made by heart ultrasound examination and  measuring the serum level of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether microRNA profiles in the serum of cats with HCM are different from the profiles of healthy cats and whether specific miRNAs can be detected to serve as potential biomarkers for feline HCM or may help in understanding the etiology of this disease
