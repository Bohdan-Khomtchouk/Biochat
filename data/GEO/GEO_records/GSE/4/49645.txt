TITLE
ISR target genes in WAT and BAT of mAP::Fv2E-PERK

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the target genes of integrated stress reponse (ISR) in WAT and BAT, we have employed whole genome microarray expression in WAT and BAT specific Fv2E-PERK transgenic mice.

DESIGN
The mAP::Fv2E-PERK transgenic mice were injected by AP20187 or mock.
