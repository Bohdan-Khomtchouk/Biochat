TITLE
serum microRNA profile of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate whether serum microRNAs can predict survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients, we analyzed the serum microRNA expression profiles in 8 NPC patients with shorter-survival time and 8 age- and gender-matched NPC patients with longer-survival time using microarray. We identified a four-microRNA signature can predict survival of NPC patients.

DESIGN
8 serum samples from nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with shorter-survival time and 8 serum samples from nasopharyngeal carinoma patients with longer-survival time
