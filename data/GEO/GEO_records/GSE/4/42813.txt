TITLE
Microarray gene expression profiling of aortic genes of APOE-deficient mice receiving atherosclerosis treatment with the antioxidant vitamin E

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hypercholesterolemic APOE-deficient mice are a widely used experimental model of atherosclerosis and increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a prominent feature of atherosclerosis development. To study the impact of ROS on atherogenesis, we treated APOE-deficient mice for 7 months with the antioxidant vitamin E (2000 IU/kg diet) and performed whole genome microarray gene expression profiling of aortic genes. Microarray gene expression profiling was performed of whole aortas isolated from vitamin E-treated APOE-deficient relative to untreated APOE-deficient mice with overt atherosclerosis, and nontransgenic B6 control mice. Microarray gene expression profiling revealed that vitamin E treatment prevented atherosclerosis-related gene expression changes of the aortic intima and media.

DESIGN
Microarray gene expression profiling was performed of whole aortas isolated from APOE-deficient mice with atherosclerosis relative to vitamin E-treated APOE-deficient mice, and nontransgenic B6 control mice. Three study groups were analyzed, i.e. 8 months-old untreated APOE-deficient mice with overt atherosclerosis, age-matched APOE-deficient mice treated for 7 months with the antioxidant vitamin E  (2000 IU/kd diet), and nontransgenic B6 control (C57BL/6J) mice. Two biological replicates were made of each group, and total RNA of three aortas was pooled for one gene chip. The study complements microarray study GSE19286.
