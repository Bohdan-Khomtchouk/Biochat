TITLE
Cold-induced changes in gene expression in brown adipose tissue, white adipose tissue and liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cold exposure imposes a metabolic challenge to mammals that must be met by a coordinated repsonse in different tissues to prevent hypothermia. This study reports analysis of transcriptome profiles in brown adipose tissue, liver, white adipose of mice in repsonse to 24 hour cold exposure

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from brown adipose, whie adipose and liver from cold treated and control plants. 3 replicates of brown adipose and white adipose and 2 replicates of liver samples.
