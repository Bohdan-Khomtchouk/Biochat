TITLE
Expression data of spleens from chickens infected with different Newcastle Disease Viruses

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Genotype VIId NDV is characterized by severe tissue damage in chicken lymphoid organs compared to other virulent strains. However, biological basis of this unusual pathological phenotype is unknown. Host response is associated with pathogenicity of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV). We aim to determine the contribution of host response to the severe tissue destruction in the lymphoid system caused by genotype VIId NDV. We used microarray analysis to evaluate the global transcriptional response in the spleen of chickens infected with genotype VIId NDV strain JS5/05 and genotype IV NDV Herts/33.

DESIGN
Chickens were inoculated with JS5/05 or Herts/33 or mock-infected. At day 2 post infection, spleens were isolated from three chickens per group for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Samples were named as follows: JS5/05 (I4_1_NS,I4_2_NS,I4_3_NS), Herts/33 (H1_NS,H2_NS, H3_NS), control (C1_NS, C2_NS, C3_NS).
