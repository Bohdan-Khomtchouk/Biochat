TITLE
Testing rescue of AR signaling by ectopic expression of mutant AR allele in the presence of MDV-3100

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genetically engineered LNCaPs overexpressing various AR alleles were treated with 0.1% DMSO or 10uM MDV3100 for 24h prior to collection This experiment is designed to see if expressing the F876L/T877A mutant AR can rescue AR signaling in the presence of MDV3100

DESIGN
Engineered lines were seeded in 6-well plates for 3d with 100ng/ml doxycycline prior to treatment with 0.1% DMSO or 10uM MDV3100 for 24h
