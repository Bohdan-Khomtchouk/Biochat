TITLE
Induction of LHY expression from an alcohol-inducible promoter

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment was to identify transcripts that are regulated by LHY, a MYB transcription factor that functions as part of the Arabidopsis circadian clock. Transgenic plants carrying an ethanol-inducible copy ot the LHY gene (Alc::LHY) were irrigated with 6% ethanol  at ZT 17 (17 hours after dawn). Their transcriptome was compared to that of wild-type plants exposed to the same treatment at times 0, 2, 4 and 8 hours after ethanol addition.

DESIGN
Duplicate experiments were carried out for both Alc::LHY and wild-type plants.
