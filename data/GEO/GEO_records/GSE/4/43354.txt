TITLE
Cell- and tissue-specific transcriptome analyses of Medicago truncatula root nodules

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
We used laser-capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate specific cells from the Medicago truncatula nodule meristem (M), the distal infection (DIZ), the proximal infection zone (PIZ), infected cells (IC) and uninfected cells (UIC) from the fixation zone. Based on Medicago GeneChips, we identified the cell- and tissue-specific programm of gene expression in  Medicago truncatula root nodules.
