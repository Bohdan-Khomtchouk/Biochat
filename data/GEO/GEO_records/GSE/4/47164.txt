TITLE
Identification of several potential chromatin binding sites of HOXB7 and its downstream target genes in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the chromatin binding sites of HOXB7 transcription factor in BT-474 breast cancer cell line using ChIP-sequencing. We validated the chromatin binding sites in BT-474, MDA-MB-361, MCF7 and T-47D breast cancer cell lines using ChIP-qPCR. The ChIP experiments have been performed using HOXB7 antibody and IgG non-specific antibody as a negative control. The direct downstream target genes of HOXB7 were identified by analyzing the expression of genes located nearby HOXB7 binding sites in HOXB7 knockdown versus control cells using qRT-PCR.

DESIGN
Examination of chromatin binding sites of HOXB7 in BT-474 breast cancer cell line using ChIP-seq. Four parallel IgG samples were sequenced, merged together and used as a control data set. Two parallel HOXB7 ChIP samples were sequenced and merged for each replicate, AF1 and AF2. Both HOXB7 ChIP replicates (AF1 and AF2) contained approximately the same amount of reads as the merged IgG control data set.
