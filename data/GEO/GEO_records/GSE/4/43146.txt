TITLE
ERβ activation by genistein promotes metastatic progression in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Androgen signalling through the androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role in prostate cancer (PCa) initiation and progression. Estrogen and the estrogen receptor, in synergy with androgen, are essential for cell growth of the normal and malignant prostate. However, the exact role that estrogen plays in prostate carcinogenesis, and the precise mechanisms involved, remain unclear.   We have previously demonstrated the metastasis-promoting effect of an estrogen receptor Beta (ERβ) agonist (genistein) and the inhibitory action of an anti-estrogen (ICI 182, 780) in patient-derived PCa xenograft models mimicking localized and metastatic disease. In this study, we compared the gene expression profiles of treated and untreated PCa xenografts using microarrays to identify a unique set of genes that were both up-regulated by genistein treatment and down-regulated by the anti-estrogen, ICI 182,780. Five of the six genes identified from this comparison belonged to the metallothionein (MT) gene family. Knock-down of ERβ led to a reduction in MT gene expression, confirming its role in regulating these genes. Using qRT-PCR, the differences in expression levels were validated in the metastatic and non-metastatic LTL313 PCa xenograft tumour lines, both of which were originally derived from the same PCa patient. Together our data provides evidence for the role of ERβ signalling in PCa metastasis and implicates estrogen-stimulated MT gene expression in this process.

DESIGN
Three samples each (total RNA extracted from three tumours of three different animals from each group) for control, genistein and ICI were used for the array.
