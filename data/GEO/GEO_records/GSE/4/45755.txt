TITLE
Deletion of the NF-κB subunit p65/RelA in the hematopoietic compartment leads to defects in hematopoietic stem cell function.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Deletion of the NF-κB subunit p65/RelA in the hematopoietic compartment results in gene expression changes in lineage-Flk2-c-kit+Sca-1+ cells from mouse bone marrow.

DESIGN
We analyzed lineage-Flk2-c-kit+Sca-1+ cells from the bone marrow of p65 wild-type or knockout mice using the Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool. No technical replicates were performed.
