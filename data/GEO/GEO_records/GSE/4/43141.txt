TITLE
Epigenome analysis of Rett syndrome monozygotic twins samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of  Rett syndrome monozygotic twins. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles in primary skin fibroblast cells from Rett syndrome monozygotic twins.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 2 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip
