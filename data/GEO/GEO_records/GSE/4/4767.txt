TITLE
Genomic aberrations in MMTV-cdc25a;MMTV-neu murine cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CDC25A is a critical target of checkpoint, and its overexpression is observed in various cancers.  Here we demonstrate that in vivo levels of Cdc25A expression determine the efficiency of transformation and tumorigenesis. Transgenic expression of CDC25A in murine mammary glands cooperates with tumorigenesis induced by expression of ras or neu.  CDC25A- overexpressing tumors display aggressiveness and genomic instability with changes in fragile chromosomal regions, including the region orthologous to human 1p32-36. Keywords: genetic modification, aCGH
