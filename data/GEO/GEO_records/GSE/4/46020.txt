TITLE
Expression data from Drosophila S2* cells treated with the steroid hormone 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (20E)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Previously we and other teams have found that 20E modulates the induction and expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in immune-challenged Drosophila cell culture or whole animals. To identify potential downstream targets of 20E involved in modulating the immune response we used Affymetrix gene chips (microarrays) to compare the transcriptomes of Drosophila S2* cells treated or not with 20E for 24 hours.

DESIGN
Affymetrix Drosophila 2.0 Chips were probed in triplicate with RNA isolated from untreated S2* cells or cells treated with 1 microMolar 20E (Sigma) for 24 hours. cDNA products were hybridized at the Brown University Genomics Core Facility to Affymetrix GeneChip Drosophila_2.0 Genome Arrays (3 replicate chips per treatment).
