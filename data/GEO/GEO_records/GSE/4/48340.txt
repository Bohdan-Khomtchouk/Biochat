TITLE
Expression profiling of the uteri of progesterone induced uterine gland knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify genes differentially expressed in the glandless uterus, whole uteri were collected from control (uterine glands present) and PUGKO (no uterine glands) mice at day of pseudopregnancy (DOPP) 3.5 (day DOPP 0.5= vaginal plug). Microarray analysis identified differentially expressed genes in the glandless uteri of PUGKO mice as compared to control mice.

DESIGN
Whole uteri (control wild type  n=4;  PUGKO  n=4) were analyzed for differences in their transcriptome using a mouse microarray.
