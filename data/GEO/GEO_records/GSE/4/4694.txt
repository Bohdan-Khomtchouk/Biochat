TITLE
Expression data from myogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During muscle differentiation, myogenesis sepcific genes are differentially regulated, including Lamins that function at least in maintenance of nuclear architecture and regulation of gene expression. We used microarrays to detail the global changes of gene expression in lamins and nuclear envelope assoicated proteins during myogenesis. Keywords: comparative, myogenesis
