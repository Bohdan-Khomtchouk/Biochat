TITLE
Effects of DP1 knockdown on E2F target gene expression in normal human diploid fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of normal human diploid fibroblasts(TIG-3) infected with retrovirous encoding DP1-shRNA or control-shRNA.

DESIGN
TIG-3 cells were subjected to infection with retrovirus encoding DP1-shRNA or control-shRNA. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent and were analyzed using the human 3D-Gene DNA chip (Toray) that contains 25000 genes. The genome wide transcriptional
