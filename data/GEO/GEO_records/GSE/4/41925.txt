TITLE
Transcription factor AP-2 gamma is a core regulator of tight junction biogenesis and cavity formation during mouse early embryogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We characterzised global changes in gene expresseion between 8 cell embryos and blastocysts to identify potential genes required for blastocyst formation.

DESIGN
Expression data from mouse 8-cell embryos and blastocysts.  Eight-cell embryos and blastocysts were obatained from B6D2F1 female X B6D2F1 male. We  analyzed a total of four samples at both stages.
