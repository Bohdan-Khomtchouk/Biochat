TITLE
microRNA Dysregulation in Human Prostate Cancer Cell Model (M12 and P69)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An isogenic prostate cancer cell model was used to profile miRNA changes that contribute to the tumorigenic state of prostate cancer. P69 cells are an SV40 large T antigen immortalized cell line that is poorly tumorigenic and non-metastatic. The M12 derivative was derived from an in vivo selection process using nude, athymic mice. Immortalized cells were cultured and used to extract RNA and probed against the human miRNA panel from Exiqon. There were a total of 186 miRNAs that were at least two fold differentially regulated .

DESIGN
Two human prostate cancer cell lines were used to evaluate miRNA expression differences contributing to oncogenesis. Two replicates were performed and the data presented as the mean fold difference between P69 and M12.
