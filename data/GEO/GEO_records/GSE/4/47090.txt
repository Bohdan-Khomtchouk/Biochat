TITLE
Pale-green durum wheat mutant under terminal drought stress condition

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Two durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) genotypes, the variety Borgia (derived from the cross IRTA-1004 x Bidi 17) and a pale-green mutant (MD-597) derived from it, were used for the measurement of physiological traits and gene expression. Mutant plants used for this study were the stable eight generation (M8) derived from the isolated original mutant plant. Terminal water stress: irrigation was drastically reduced from the booting stage until maturity by watering the pots with the amount of water necessary to maintain the pots at 1/3 of field capacity. The drought treatment was started by withholding water at the anthesis stage.  ****[PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Alessio Aprile.
