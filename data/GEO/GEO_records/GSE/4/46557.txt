Interactions of wheat aleurine and plant omega-3 fatty acids on the rat gut microbiota

ORGANISM
human gut metagenome

SUMMARY
Microbiota from rats fed with wheat aleurone and plant omega fatty acids In this study we investigated how an AX-rich WA and ALA from linseed oil (LO) modulate the gut microbiota of rats. Wistar rats were fed a standard diet and received either an iso-energetic control oil (PO), control oil + aleurone (A+PO), linseed oil (LO) or linseed oil + aleurone (A+LO) during 12 weeks. Feacal samples were recovered after the 12 week treatments. DNA extractions were performed using using the Qiagen's DNA Stool Kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK). 10ng of DNA template were amplified by PCR (16S gene) and purified using Qiagen's Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK). 1ug of purified PCR product were labelled with either Cy3 or Cy5 using Genomic DNA ULS Labelling kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). 250ng of labelled DNA were hybridized on the microarray for 24h at 65°C. Washings were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Microarray scanning was performed on a Surescan Microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Data were extracted using the Feature extraction software (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The retained intensity value for each probe was the ratio between the spot’s median intensity signals and the median of background signals.
