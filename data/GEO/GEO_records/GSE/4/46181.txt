TITLE
Genes involved in plucking induced hair regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Intra-follicular signals are thought to be important in plucking induced hair regenration. We hypothesize that extra-follicular macro-environment (including adipose and dermal tissue) also participates in this process. By using microarray, we want to identify the activating signals emit from extra-follicular macro-environment.

DESIGN
First, we used traditional wax stripping to synchronize growth cycles in all dorsal pelage hair follicles. After synchronize, we wax the dorsal pelage hair follicles of mice again then collect the samples from  extra-follicular macro-environment (including adipose and dermal tissue) at different time points after waxing, including 12 hour, 1 day, 2 day, 4 day, 6 day, 10 day and 50 day. Finally we extrat the RNA from each samples and sent these RNA samples for microarray.
