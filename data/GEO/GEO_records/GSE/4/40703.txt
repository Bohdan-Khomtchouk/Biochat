TITLE
Differentiating i-Mixl1 mESCs cultured in the presence or absence of Doxycycline

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We profiled gene expression changes in differentiating i-Mixl1 ES cells(Willey, Ayuso-Sacido et al., 2006, Blood 107(8): 3122-3130)  cultured in the presence or absence of Doxycycline (DOX, 0.1 ug/ml, 3 replicates per treatment/time point).  Total RNA was isolated from EBs harvested at day 2, 3 and 4 (DOX added 1 day after plating of ES cells).  RNA (1 ug) was subjected to one round of linear amplification (RiboAmp System) to yield 10 ug of RNA.  The RNA was indirectly labeled using amino allyl-dUTP('t Hoen, de Kort et al., 2003, Nucleic Acids Res. 31: e20), then conjugated with Cy3 or Cy5.  The labeled RNAs were used to screen a 15K mouse developmental cDNA microarray(Tanaka, Jaradat et al., 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 97: 9127-9132). Pairwise analysis of hybridization results for EBs cultured with or without DOX was performed for samples harvested on each day.  Spotfire(R) software was used for data management and filtering.  Gene expression ratios were normalized after filtering the data to remove low-intensity and poor quality spots.  Data obtained for replicate samples were in excellent agreement.

DESIGN
Six experiments total: three time points (day 2, day 3, day 4); for each time point mRNA was collected in the presence or absence of Doxycycline. Three biological replicas were collected for each of the six experiments
