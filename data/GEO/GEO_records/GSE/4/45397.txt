TITLE
NcRNA profiling after Influenza A/WSN/33 infection I

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A growing body of evidence suggests gene regulatory functions for the majority of non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Besides small RNAs (sRNAs), the diverse class of long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) recently came into focus of research. So far, the relevance of lncRNAs in infection processes remains elusive. Here, we report the differential expression of several classes of lncRNAs during influenza A virus (IAV) infection in human lung epithelial cells.

DESIGN
2 biological replicates of each condition were hybridzed in an independent color-swap; A549 cells were washed with PBS and then infected with viruses at MOI 1 in infection buffer for for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated for the indicated time periods at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 4 mM l-glutamine and antibiotics. Supernatants of A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus infected A549 cells (MOI 5, 4hpi) were exposed to UV light for 5 min and then used to stimulate A549 cells for 4 h Supernatants of A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus infected A549 cells (MOI 5, 8hpi) were exposed to UV light for 5 min and then used to stimulate A549 cells for 8 h
