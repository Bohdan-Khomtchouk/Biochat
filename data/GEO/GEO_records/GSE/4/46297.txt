TITLE
Expression profiling of lung T cell subsets from wild-type and Serpinb1a-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify differential gene expression in lung T cell subsets upon germline Serpinb1a ablation.

DESIGN
CD8-CD19- lymphocytes enriched by negative selection from digested lungs of na√Øve, 9-12 week old wild-type 129S6 mice or Serpinb1a homozygous null mice were FACS sorted into CD4+ CCR6+ effector/ memory T cells, gd T cells, or CD4+ CD25hiCD127low regulatory T cells. FACS sorted cells were collected into RLT buffer (Qiagen) directly, lysed, and total mRNA was isolated using Quiagen's RNeasy mini kit. Wild-type vs. Serpinb1a-/- gd+ T cells, CD4+ CCR6+ effector/ memory T cells, or CD4+ CD25hiCD127low regulatory T cells
