TITLE
Identification of a specific reprogramming-associated epigenetic signature in human induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this work, we characterized the epigenomic integrity of 17 hiPSC lines derived from six different cell types with varied reprogramming efficiencies. We demonstrate that epigenetic aberrations are a general feature of the hiPSC state and are independent of the somatic cell source. Additionally, we determine that both shared and line-specific epigenetic aberrations in hiPSCs can directly translate into changes in gene expression in both the pluripotent and differentiated states.

DESIGN
Examination of differential methylation between iPSC and ESCs through differentiated states. Examination of differential methylation between iPSC and somatic cell source and iPSC and ESCs.
