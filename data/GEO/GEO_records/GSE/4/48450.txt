TITLE
Dendritic cell subtypes from lymph nodes and blood show contrasted gene expression programs upon Bluetongue Virus infection

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
The gene expression in conventional and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (cDC and pDC respectively) during Bluetongue virus (BTV) infection in sheep depends on the lymphoid compartment and suggest that these cell types have a role in the physiopathology

DESIGN
We analyzed the gene expression in  lymph node pDC and cDC from 3 control and 3 BTV infected sheep at day 6 post infection, in blood pDC from 2 control and 2 BTV infected sheep at day 6 post infection, and in spleen cDC from 3 control and 2 BTV infected sheep at day 6 post infection.
