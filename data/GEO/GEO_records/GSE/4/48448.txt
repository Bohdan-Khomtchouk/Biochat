TITLE
Expression data from LoVo and GP5d CRC cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TF binding clusters in promoter correlate well with gene expression. We used ChIP-seq to map binding sites of the majority of highly expressed TFs in the cell. The size of clusters of TFs in the promoters of genes were found to correlate well with gene expression.

DESIGN
CRC cell lines were grown on plastic This submission reprsents transcriptome component of study.
