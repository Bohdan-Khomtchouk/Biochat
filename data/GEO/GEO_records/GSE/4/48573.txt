TITLE
Identification of gene expression changes induced by ligands for RXR and its partners in differentiating human monocyte-derived dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differentiating human dendritic cells were stimulated for 12 hours with RXR agonists (LG268, 9CRA, R- and S-9CDHRA) or agonists for RXR partners including GW3965 (LXRα/β panagonist), RSG (PPARγ agonist), and GW1516 (PPARδ agonist) and AM580 (RARa agonist). The gene expression changes were detected globally by Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.

DESIGN
Human monocytes were obtained by Ficoll gradient centrifugation followed by immunomagnetic cell separation, and were cultured in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4. Differentiating DCs were stimulated 18 h after plating by various nuclear receptor agonists or vehicle (DMSO:EtOH) for 12h. The ligands were used in the following concentrations: 10 μM R-9CDHRA, 10 μM S-9CDHRA, 1 μM 9cisRA, 100 nM LG100268 (LG268), 1 μM GW3965, 1 μM Rosiglitazone (RSG), 1 μM GW1516, 100 nM AM580. Experiments were performed in biological triplicates.
