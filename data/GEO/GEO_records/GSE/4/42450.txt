TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Azospirillum lipoferum 4B during its interaction with rice roots

ORGANISM
Azospirillum lipoferum 4B

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Azospirillum lipoferum 4B associated to artificial roots, Oryza sativa japonica cv. Cigalon roots and Oryza sativa japonica cv. Nipponbare roots, compared to the strain grown in liquid culture.

DESIGN
For each of the four condition, two replicates were analysed on an A. lipoferum 4B whole genome expression array designed by Roche Nimblegen, Inc. (Madison, WI, USA), based on the genome sequence (Wisniewski-Dy√© et al. 2011), as follows: two replicates of 5 probes (length, 60 nucleotides) per gene, covering 6,242 genes and using a total of 62,178 probes.
