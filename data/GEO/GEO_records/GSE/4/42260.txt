TITLE
Notch Pathway Activation Targets AML Cell Homeostasis and Differentiation: MLL-AF9 transformed LGMP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine role of Notch signaling in AML leukemia initiating cells we used a conditional mouse knock-in model of Notch1-IC to induce Notch1-IC expression in MLL-AF9 transformed LGMP. WT and Notch1-IC+ LGMP were analyzed to determined genes controlled by Notch signaling.

DESIGN
12 weeks old wt lethaly irradiated mice were transplanted with 50000 cKit+ MLL-AF9-IRES-YFP infected cells from MLL-AF9 EF1 wt/wt ROSAwt/CreERT2 or MLL-AF9 EF1 wt/lsl-N1-IC ROSAwt/CreERT2 mice + 250000 support wt total bone marrow cells. 4 weeks after transplant mice were injected 2 times with tamoxifen (0.2mg/g body weight) every other day. Mice were sacrificed and analyzed 6 days after last injection. LGMP were flow purified for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
