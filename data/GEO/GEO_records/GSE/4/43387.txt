TITLE
The protomap is propagated to cortical plate neurons through an Eomes-dependent intermediate map

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cortical area map is initially patterned by transcription factor (TF) gradients in the neocortical primordium, which define a protomap in the embryonic ventricular zone (VZ). However, mechanisms that propagate regional identity from VZ progenitors to cortical plate (CP) neurons are unknown. Here we show that the VZ, subventricular zone (SVZ), and CP contain distinct molecular maps of regional identity, reflecting different gene expression gradients in radial glia progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and projection neurons, respectively. The intermediate map in SVZ is modulated by Eomes (also known as Tbr2), a T-box TF. Eomes inactivation caused rostrocaudal shifts in SVZ and CP gene expression, with loss of corticospinal axons and gain of corticotectal projections. These findings suggest that cortical areas and connections are shaped by sequential maps of regional identity, propagated by the Pax6 → Eomes → Tbr1 TF cascade. In humans, PAX6, EOMES, and TBR1 have been linked to intellectual disability and autism.

DESIGN
To determine the role of Eomes in the propagation of the protomap to cortical plate neurons, used microarray analysis of E14.5 cortex from five wild type and three Eomes knockout mice.
