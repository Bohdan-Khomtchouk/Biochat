TITLE
ChIP-chip of DSB factors in the presence and absence of S phase checkpoint induction

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
ChIP-chip was used to compare DSB factor localization in wild-type and checkpoint mutant strains under S phase checkpoint inducing and uninducing conditions.

DESIGN
We analyzed the DNA binding of factors associated with meiotic DNA replication and DSB formation by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), including; the replicative helicase Mcm2-7 and the meiotic DSB factors Mer2, Rec114 and Mre11. Immunoprecipitated and input DNA samples were differentially labeled and cohybridized to a single microarray. We have included 2-3 biological replicates of each experiment, including one dye swap experiment.
