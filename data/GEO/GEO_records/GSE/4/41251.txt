TITLE
Murine Adult Cortex: Gtf2i (+/Δex2 ) VS WT (+/+)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse cortex tissue comparing control animals with Gtf2i-mutated mouse (Gtf2i+/Δex2 ).  Goal was to determine the specific deregulated genes in the cortex of mutated animals.

DESIGN
Pools of total RNA derived from five-three mice of each genotype were subjected to microarray analysis. We compared pools instead of single individuals in order to minimize individual and technically-related variation. The original raw data file (i.e. Agilent feature extraction files) are not available. The modified raw data files are provided along with the file contents description (raw_data_readme.txt available on Series records).
