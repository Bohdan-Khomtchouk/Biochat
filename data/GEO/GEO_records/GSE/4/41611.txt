TITLE
GRO-seq of Drosophila embryos at 2-2.5 hours and 3-3.5 hours after egg laying (AEL)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The transition in developmental control from maternal to zygotic gene products marks a critical step in early embryogenesis. Here, we use GRO-seq analysis to map the genome-wide RNA polymerase distribution during the Drosophila maternal to zygotic transition. This analysis unambiguously identifies the zygotic transcriptome, and provides insight into its mechanisms of regulation.

DESIGN
Two replicates of GRO-seq at each time point.
