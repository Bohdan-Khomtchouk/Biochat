TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Sox/Oct partnerships pluripotent and lineage-committed cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We show here by using genome-wide ChIP-sequencing that lineage segregation involves multiple Sox/Oct partnership. In undifferentiated ES cells Oct4 interacts with Sox2 and both TFs bind on the 'canonical' motif, whereas in cells commited to PrE lineage Oct4 switches from Sox2 to Sox17 interaction and this complex bind to a unique " compressed " motif.

DESIGN
ChIP-sequencing has been done for Sox2, Sox17 and Oct4 in the pluripotent context or PrE context
