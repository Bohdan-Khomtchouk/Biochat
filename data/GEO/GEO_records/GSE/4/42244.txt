TITLE
Rhodobacter sphaeroides WT 2.4.1 under singlet oxygen stress

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1

SUMMARY
Transcriptional and translational profiling of R. sphaeroides WT 2.4.1 under singlet oxygen stress compared to control (no stress) conditions

DESIGN
RNA samples collected at time-point zero and at different time-points after singlet oxygen stress were analyzed by two-color microarrays
