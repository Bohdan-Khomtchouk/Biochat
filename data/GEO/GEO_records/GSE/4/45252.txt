TITLE
Diel growth of Thalassiosira pseudonana

ORGANISM
Thalassiosira pseudonana

SUMMARY
Transcript levels of all T. pseudonana genes was measured every twelve hours throughout the batch (non-chemostatic) growth of axenic cells grown in large glass bioreactors on a 12hr:12hr dark:light cycle for five days. The data were analyzed to reveal the physiological and regulatory changes that recurred in this diatom when transitioning between dark and light conditions, as well as from exponential phase to stationary, nutrient limited conditions. The longitudinal experiment was performed with two replicates, at 400 and 800ppm CO2.
