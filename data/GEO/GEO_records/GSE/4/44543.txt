TITLE
Expression data from mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptome of ß-catenin flox/- mES cells in comparison with ß-catenin null mES cells or ß-catenin null mES cells stably transfected with an E-cadherin-α-catenin fusion protein. Expression assay was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array.

DESIGN
The experiment includes ß-catenin flox/-, ß-catenin null and ß-catenin null Eα mouse embryonic stem cells with three biological replicates for each sample.
