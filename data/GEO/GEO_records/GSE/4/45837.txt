TITLE
GFI deficiency in plasmacytoid dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Growth factor independence genes (Gfi1 and Gfi1b) repress recombination activating genes (Rag) transcription in developing B lymphocytes. Because all blood lineages originate from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and different lineage progenitors have been shown to share transcription factor networks prior to cell fate commitment, we hypothesized that GFI family proteins may also play a role in repressing Rag transcription or a global lymphoid transcriptional program in other blood lineages. We tested the level of Rag transcription in various blood cells when Gfi1 and Gfi1b were deleted, and observed an upregulation of Rag expression in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Using microarray analysis, we observed that Gfi1 and Gfi1b regulate a broad spectrum of cellular processes in pDCs, but not a lymphoid specific transcriptional program. This study establishes a role for Gfi1 and Gfi1b in Rag regulation in a non-B lineage cell type

DESIGN
Gfi1f/f; Gfi1bf/f; ERCre bone marrow progenitors were untreated and treated with tamoxifen (4OHT) to delete floxed alleles during pDC differentiation in culture. Cells from three individual mouse constitute triplicates of untreated (-4OHT) and treated (+4OHT) conditions, corresponding to wildtype or knockout genotypes.
