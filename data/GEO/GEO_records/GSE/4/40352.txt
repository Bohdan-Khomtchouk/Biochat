TITLE
The effects of NAC on gene expression in Nkx3.1-/- mouse prostate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We tested the effects of the antioxidant NAC (N-Acetyl-Cysteine) on gene expression in Nkx3.1-deficient mouse prostate.

DESIGN
Mice that were homozygous null for Nkx3.1 were given NAC or plain water ad libidum for 13 weeks after weaning. Prostates were collected, RNA was harvested and reverse transcribed, and cDNA was hybridized to Affy Mouse Gene 1.0 ST microarrays.
