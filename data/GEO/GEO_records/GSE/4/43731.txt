TITLE
Gene Expression of F. tularensis LVS in hepatocytic cell line FL83B vs LVS cultured in MH broth

ORGANISM
Francisella tularensis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of LVS grown in hepatocytic cell line FL83B was compared to that of LVS cultued in MH broth to discover genes important for intracellular growth.
