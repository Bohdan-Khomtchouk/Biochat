TITLE
Gene expression analysis in  macrophages stimulated 18 h with Adiponectin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) generated from c57bl/6j mice bone marrow cells were stimulated for 18 h with 12 microgram/ml  adiponectin, RNA from non-stimulated or 18 h adiponectin-stimulated BMDM subjected to a agilent microarray analysis

DESIGN
Three  different non-stimulated  and 3 different  18 h adiponectin (12 microgram/ml) RNA samples were subjected to a micrrorray analysis
