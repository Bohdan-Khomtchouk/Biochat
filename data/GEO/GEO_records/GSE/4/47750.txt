TITLE
Gene expression profiling of prostate cancer cells upon JMJD2A or ETV1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of LNCaP prostate cancer cells that have JMJD2A knockdown (JMJD2A shRNA #3; JMJD2A shRNA #5) or ETV knockdown (ETV shRNA #1; ETC shRNA #5) were compared to non-targeted control (sh-cm) cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from transformed LNCaP human prostate cancer cells containing a non-trageting control vector (sh-cm), vectors containing shRNA sequences for JMJD2A or ETV1 genes.
