TITLE
Gene expression profiling and functional analysis in cerebral artery after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanisms of cerebral vasopasm after SAH are not totally understood. In the present study, we analyzed gene expression profile in rabbit basilar artery after SAH using cDNA microarrays.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from rabbit basilar arteries (12 samples: day0 n=3, day3  n=3, day5 n=3, and day7 n=3). They  were analyzed by microarray.
