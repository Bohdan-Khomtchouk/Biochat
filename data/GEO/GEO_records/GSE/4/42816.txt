TITLE
Gene expression propionic patients, carriers, and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression in LCLs from PA patients, their parents, and HapMap sex and age match controls at low glucose (9 mg/dL) and normal glucose growth conditions.

DESIGN
12 LCLs from Pa patients (coriell samples) 15 LCLs from parents of PA patient, 16 controls (HapMAp) who grown at low glucose (9mg/dL) and normal glucose for 24 hours.  Then  harvested for gene expression
