TITLE
Distribution, functional impact and origin mechanisms of copy number variation in the barley genome

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare

SUMMARY
There is growing evidence for the prevalence of DNA copy number variation (CNV) and its role in phenotypic variation in recent years. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used to explore the extent of this type of structural variation in the barley genome. In a panel of 14 genotypes including domesticated cultivars and wild barleys, we found that 14.9% of all the sequences on the array are affected by CNV. Higher levels of CNV diversity are present in the wild accessions relative to cultivated barley. A substantial portion (37%) of the CNV events are present in both wild and domesticated barley. CNVs are enriched in telomeric regions for all chromosomes except 4H, which is also the barley chromosome with the lowest proportion of CNVs. CNV affected 9.5% of the coding sequences represented on the array. The genes affected by CNV are enriched for sequences annotated as disease-resistance proteins and protein kinases, suggesting the potential for CNV to influence variation for responses to biotic and abiotic stress. The analysis of CNV breakpoints indicated that DNA repair mechanisms of double-strand breaks (DSBs) via single-stranded annealing (SSA) and synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) play an important role in the origin of many structural changes in barley. Here we present the first catalog of CNVs in a diploid Triticeae species, which opens the door for future genome diversity research in a tribe that comprises the economically important cereal species wheat, barley and rye. Our findings constitute a valuable resource for the identification of CNV affecting genes of agronomic importance.

DESIGN
1-2 replications of 8 barley cultivars and 6 wild barley accessions were hybridized to an array designed from 115,003 whole genome shotgun (WGS) contigs of the ‘reference’ genome of cv. Morex
