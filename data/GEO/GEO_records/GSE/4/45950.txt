TITLE
Comparison between a first and a last run of industrial serial repitching

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify differently expressed genes between first and last runs of serial repitchings from four different German breweries. In the breweries the number of successive runs varied from 4 to 22. A run describes the industrial fermentation of brewery wort. By the end of fermentation the yeast slurry is cropped. These cells are reused for inoculation of another cylindro-conical vessel (CCVs).

DESIGN
Results from eight microarrays are summarized in this study. The samples were taken from four German breweries. Microarrays were hybridized in a dye swap approach: Dye-swap 1: brewery A runs 1 vs. 22; Dye-swap 2: brewery B runs 1 vs. 5; Dye-swap 3: brewery C runs 1 vs. 4; Dye-swap 4: brewery D runs 1 vs. 8
