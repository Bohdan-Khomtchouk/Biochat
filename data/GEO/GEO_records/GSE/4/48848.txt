TITLE
KBM7 genetrap mutant cells stimulated with TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional response of KBM7 cells to IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha was investigated in control or cells with genetrap insertions in JAK2 or TNFRS1A, respectively. The experiment shows that, as expected, cells lacking JAK2 or TNFRS1A expression display a severly blunted response to the tested cytokines.

DESIGN
KBM7 genetrap mutant cells stimulated with TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma Sample WT_1 corresponds with the control sample for the IFN-gamma stimulation; Sample WT_2 corresponds with the control sample for the TNF-alpha stimulation. As the expected differences between the samples was large, only single replicates were performed for each condition
