TITLE
Lipid metabolism genes in contralateral unaffected breast and estrogen receptor status of breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The contralateral unaffected breast of women with unilateral breast cancer (cases) is a good model for defining subtype-specific risk since women with ER-negative index primaries are at high risk for subsequent ER-negative primary cancers. We performed random fine needle aspiration (rFNA) of the unaffected breasts of cases; samples from 30 subjects (15 ER-positive and 15 ER-negative cases matched for age, race and menopausal status), were used for Illumina expression array analysis.

DESIGN
In this study, we have examined gene expression profiles in random fine needle aspirate (rFNA) samples from the contralateral breasts of women with new unilateral breast cancer (cases) to seek candidate panels of ER-specific risk biomarkers.  On a discovery set of 30 women, we have identified gene expression differences in the contralateral breast that associate with ER+ or ER- index primary tumors.
