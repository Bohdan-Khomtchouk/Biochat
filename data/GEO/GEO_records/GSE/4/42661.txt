TITLE
Identification of microRNA targets in tomato fruit development using high-throughput sequencing and degradome analysis

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
By using parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE) for global identification of miRNA targets and comparing four different stages of tomato fruit development we identified a large number of target genes of miRNAs.

DESIGN
PARE libraries were produced, one each, for tomato fruits at 5 days after pollination, mature green fruit, Breaker fruit, and 7 days after Breaker stge fruits
