TITLE
FKBP5 expression in human adipose tissue increases following dexamethasone exposure and is associated with insulin resistance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glucocorticoid excess is linked to central obesity, adipose tissue insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of dexamethasone on gene expression in human subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue, in order to identify potential novel mechanisms and biomarkers for glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance in adipose tissue. Dexamethasone changed the expression of 527 genes in both subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue. FKBP5 and CNR1 were the most responsive genes in both depots (~7-fold increase). Dexamethasone increased FKBP5 gene and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner in both depots, but FKBP5 protein levels were 10-fold higher in omental than subcutaneous adipose tissue. FKBP5 gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue was positively correlated with serum insulin, HOMA-IR and subcutaneous adipocyte diameter, while fold change in gene expression by dexamethasone was negatively correlated with clinical markers of insulin resistance, i.e. HbA1c, BMI, HOMA-IR and serum insulin. Only one gene, SERTM1, clearly differed in response to dexamethasone between the two depots. Dexamethasone at high concentrations, influences gene expression in both subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue in a similar pattern and promotes gene expression of FKBP5, a gene that may be implicated in glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance.

DESIGN
Paired human subcutaneous (sc) and omental (om) adipose tissue samples obtained from 4 non-diabetic adipose tissue donors (4 M; BMI: 20.8-27.5 Kg/m2)  were incubated without (Ctr) or with dexamethasone (Dex, 3 Î¼M) for 24 h.
