TITLE
Indel array-based genotyping of pupariation site preference among Drosophila sechellia backcross progeny

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We identified 6,975 insertion/deletion events of between 10 and 100 bp in length from the Drosophila simulans and Drosophila sechellia Mercator/MAVID genomic sequence alignment. Replicate pure samples of Drosophila simulans and Drosophila sechellia gDNA were competitively hybridized to measure the expected relative hybridization intensity of alleles from each species. We used these measured intensities to assess the likelihood that the hybridization signal at each probe in an experimental animal reflected homozygosity or heterozygosity at that locus.
