TITLE
Aspergillus nidulans : Control (Wt) vs. ΔcnaA or alcApkcAΔcnaA

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans FGSC A4

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. nidulans comparing the mutant strain alcApkcA ΔcnaA and ΔcnaA grown on alcA inducing conditions. The main objective was to identifiy genes related to ΔcnaA phenotype supression by pkcA overexpression. The experiment was further validated by real-time PCR.
