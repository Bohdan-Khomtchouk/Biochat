TITLE
Expression data from thalamus or parietal lobe of FFI patients and normal human.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a special subtype of genetic human prion diseases that is caused by the D178N mutation of the prion protein gene (PRNP). In this study, global expression patterns of the thalamus and parietal cortex from three patients with FFI were analyzed by Affymetrix Human Genome U133+ 2.0 chip. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression in tissues from normal human and FFI patients thalamus, or parietal lobe.

DESIGN
Tissues from normal human and FFI patients' thalamus, or parietal lobe were for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
