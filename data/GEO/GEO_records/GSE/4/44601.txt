TITLE
Expression data from SND1 knockdown clones of human HCC cell line QGY-7703

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1 (SND1) is overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and positively regulates development and progression of HCC. We established stable clones expressing SND1 shRNA in QGY-7703 cells and analyzed the gene expression profiles of a control clone and two SND1 knockdown clones to check what genes are regulated by SND1.

DESIGN
Steady-state proliferating cells were collected for RNA extraction and Affymetrix microarray hybridization. Three biological replicates each of a control clone and 2 SND1 knockdown clones.
