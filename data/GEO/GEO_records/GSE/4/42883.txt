TITLE
Gene expression data following Neurogenin 1 expression in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the early gene expression events involved in neurogenesis, we expressed the bHLH neural determination factor neurogenin 1 in mouse embryonic stem cells. We used microarray to examine the program of gene expression at 24, 48, 72 hours of transgene expression.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic stem cells were engineered to express neurogenin 1 using a tet-sensitive expression system. RNAs from uninduced and induced cells were isolated at 24, 48, and 72 hours of differentiation and subjected to microarray analysis.
