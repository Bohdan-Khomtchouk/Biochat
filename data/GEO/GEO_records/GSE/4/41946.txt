TITLE
Decidual Endothelial Cells (DEC) and endothelial cells from human skin (ADMEC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BACKGROUND: endothelial cells (ECs) form a continuous barrier between blood and tissues and gate the traffic of molecules and cells across the vessel wall playing an active role in hemostasis, inflammation and immunity. Decidual endothelial cells (DECs) are located in a very special district from the immunological and inflammatory point of view since decidua has immunoregulatory and pro-angiogenic functions. The aim of this study was to compare the phenotype of microvascular ECs isolated from decidua with microvascular ECs isolated from other vascular districts. METHOD: we analyzed the differences in molecules involved in angiogenesis and leukocyte recruitment between DECs and endothelial cells from human skin (ADMECs) which are normally involved in inflammatory response by microarray analysis.   RESULTS: our results showed that DECs are able to produce high amount of the growth factors HGF, VEGF-A and IGFBP3, important for the control of angiogenesis and express the adhesion molecules ICAM2 and ICAM3 in basal condition, important molecules for the control of leukocyte recruitment and function. We demonstrated also that DECs do not up-regulate the expression of ICAM1 in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines and produce high amount of the chemokines CXCL9/MIG and CXCL10/IP-10 in response to IFN-a. CONCLUSION: we conclude that the phenotype of these cells strongly differs from that of other endothelial cells such as ADMECs which have to be quickly able to response to infections and other pro-inflammatory stimuli. These data suggest that endothelial cells may play an active in the control of local immune response at foeto-maternal interface.

DESIGN
Single color gene expression in human endothelial cells. Six independent experiments (3 DEC vs 3 ADMEC) were performed using different donors for each experiment.
