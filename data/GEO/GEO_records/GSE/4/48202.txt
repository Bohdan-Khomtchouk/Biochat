TITLE
The genes upregulated in WRKY45-ox rice relative to Nipponbare

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
WRKY45-overexpressing (WRKY45-ox) rice plants are extremely resistant to rice blast and bacterial leaf-blight diseases. To search for the genes that are potentially responsible for the strong resistance, we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis in WRKY45-ox rice. A microarray analysis using Agilent rice oligo microarray for approximately 42,000 rice genes identified 1,664 genes that are upregulated in WRKY45-ox rice compared with non-transformant rice cv. Nipponbare (NB). Analysis of the genes with altered expression in WRKY45-ox rice by a Gene ontology program (Agri GO; ) revealed that several genes in the biosynthetic pathway for diterpenoid phytoalexins, for which anti-blast fungus activities have been reported, were upregulated in WRKY45-ox rice.

DESIGN
Nipponbare rice (Oryza sativa) and WRKY45-ox rice were analyzed in three biological replicates.
