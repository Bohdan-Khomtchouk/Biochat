TITLE
EID1 knochdown by small RNA induces the large-scale conversion of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells into hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of expression profiles in adipose derived MSCs (AD-MSCs) without or with transfection of siR-EID1 and shR-EID1 and cord blood-derived HSCs (CB-HSCs). After MSCs were transfected with sRNA-EID1, they could be converted into HSCs. The goal was to determine possible molecular mechanisms of MSC transdetermination.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiments: AD-MSCs vs CB-HSCs, and AD-MSCs transfected with the combination of siR-EID1 and shR-EID1 vs AD-MSCs transfected with shR-EID1.
