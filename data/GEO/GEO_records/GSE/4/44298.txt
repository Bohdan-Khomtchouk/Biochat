TITLE
Hippo Signaling Regulates Differentiation and Maintenance in the Exocrine Pancreas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Hippo signaling pathway has become recognized as a context-dependent regulator of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in species ranging from Drosophila to human. In this study, we sought to understand whether Hippo signaling plays a role in pancreatic development and organ homeostasis.

DESIGN
We analyzed mRNA from 5 samples each from control and DKO mouse pancreas using Affymetrix MouseGene 1.0 ST Array platfrom. Array data was processed by Affymetrix array computational tools.
