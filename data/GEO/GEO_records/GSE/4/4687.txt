TITLE
EScell data, composed of normalized log ratio of the differentiated compared to the undifferentiated at 5 points

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study of embryonic stem cell mediated neuronal differentiation allows for improved understanding of the mechanisms involved in embryonic neuronal development. We investigated expression profile changes using time course cDNA microarray to identify clues for the signaling network of neuronal differentiation. Keywords: time course, embryonic stem cell
