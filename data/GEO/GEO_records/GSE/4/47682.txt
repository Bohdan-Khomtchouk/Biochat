TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We recently identified recurrent mutations of cohesin complex in myeloid neoplasms through whole-exome sequencing analysis. In this study, we performed SNP array analysis to detect abnormal copy number of the cohesin genes.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis by Affymetrix 50K or 250K SNP arrays was performed for 93 AML and 70 MDS tumor samples.
