TITLE
Gene expression data of  brown-like adipocytes from Lgr4 homozygous mutant SVF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Obesity has become a global health problem. Brown adipose tissue (BAT), specialized for energy expenditure through thermogenesis, potently counteracts obesity. Recently, BAT is also identified in human adults. We found that Lgr4 homozygous mutant (Lgr4m/m) mice display reduced adiposity and exhibit brown-like adipocytes in their WAT depots with higher expression of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1). Furthermore, Lgr4 ablation potentiates brown adipocyte differentiation from stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of epididymal WAT (eWAT) in vitro. We used microarrays to emxamine the gene expression profiles of the brown-like adipocytes differentiated from SVF of wild-type and Lgr4 mutant mice. We identified distinct gene expression profiles of these two groups.

DESIGN
To demonstrate Lgr4 ablation can potentiate the differentiation of SVF from eWAT toward brown-like adipocytes in vitro, we isolated SVF from epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) of  wild-type (WT) and Lgr4 mutant mice. We then plated SVF cells in 12-well plate, and  differentiated them to brown adipocytes, followed by RNA extraction and hybridization with Affymetrix microarrays.
