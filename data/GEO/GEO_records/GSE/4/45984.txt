TITLE
ChIP-Seq for cofactors in cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Critical drivers of cancer progression are likely controlled through the actions of transcription factors and cofactors that bind to the genome and form enhancers that stimulate gene expression.  We present ChIP-seq analysis of key transcriptional regulators, cofactors and histone modifications that indicate transcriptional activity across a range of different cancer cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq was performed against the cofactors Med1, Brd4 and CDK7 in MM1.S multiple myeloma cells; Brd4 in Sk-MEL-5 melanoma cells; and H3K9/K14 acetylation in MV4;11 leukemia cells,
