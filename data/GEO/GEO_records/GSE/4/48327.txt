TITLE
Global assessment of Antrodia cinnamomea induced microRNA and mRNA transcriptomic alterations in hepatocarcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Antrodia cinnamomea (Ac), a traditional medicine and an endemic fungus in Taiwan, has been used in cancer research. Recent research has revealed decreased cell proliferation after treatment of Ac on tumor. In this study, we profiled the 2 hours and 4 hours genome-wide miRNA and mRNA transcriptome by next-generation sequencing techniques to report the early apoptotic effect on Ac fruiting body extract treated human hepatocarcinoma cells, SK-HEP-1, instead of prolonged treatment. Results showed that miRNAs were globally downregulated during the first 2-4 hours in, and solely in, AcFBE-treated SK cells. The inhibition of miRNAs imposed no discrimination against any particular miRNA species, but oncogenic miR-21, miR-191 and two oncogenic clusters miR-17-92 and miR-106b-25 were among the most significantly inhibited miRNAs. In addition to miRNA expression, mRNA transcriptome data indicated the association of apoptosis mechanism with AcFBE treatment. Western blotting indicated a decrease in key proteins Drosha and Dicer required for miRNA biogenesis, and an increase of XRN2 involved in miRNA degradation. Our results suggest that miRNAs appeared to be the prime targets of Ac in disrupting multiple miRNA regulatory pathways and global disruption of miRNA transcriptome resulting in activation of extrinsic and intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathways.

DESIGN
Human liver SK-Hep-1 cells with or without Antrodia cinnamomea treatment at 2 hours and 4 hours were sequenced by SOLiD 3 and SOLiD 5500xl to obtain miRNA profiles; mRNA profiles also were profiled by SOLID 3. Mouse liver BNL CL.2 cells with or without Antrodia cinnamomea treatment at 2 hours and 4 hours were sequenced by SOLiD 3 to obtain miRNA profiles.
