TITLE
Expression data from sexual flocculation cells of S. pombe

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The h+ and h- haploid cells of S. pombe mixtures flocculated and formed diploid cells when cultured in carbon limited YEPME medium. We first cultured S. pombe h+ YHL6381 and h- SPQ-01 cells respectively in YEPD medium and then mixed them at an 1:1 ratio and further cultured in YEPME medium. Sexual flocculation occured. We used microarrays to detail the the global programme of gene expression of flocculated YHL6381 and SPQ-01 mixtures cultured in YEPME, compared with the non flocculated cells mixtures cultured in YEPD, and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.
