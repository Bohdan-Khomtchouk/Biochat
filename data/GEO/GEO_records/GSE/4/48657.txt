TITLE
Tet2-mediated DNA demethylation controls T cell cytokine expression [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by ten-eleven translocation (Tet) family has recently been identified as a key process for active DNA demethylation, whose effects in the immune response is currently unknown. We used microarrays to characterize the regulation of Tet2 in T cells. We found that deletion of the Tet2 gene in T cells decreased expression of effector cytokines such as IFN-Î³, IL-17, and IL-10.

DESIGN
To analyze the regulation of Tet2 in Th subset differentation, CD2(Cre)Tet2(f/f) mice were used to derive Tet2-deficient Th1 and Th17 cells, and Tet2(f/f) mice were used for Tet2-enriched Th1 and Th17 cells.
