TITLE
linc-UBC1 physically associates with polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and acts as a negative prognostic factor for lymph node metastasis and survival in bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify aberrantly expressed long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) in bladder cancer tissues compared with normal adjacent tissues, we have employed microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify lincRNAs that may play important roles in bladder cancer origin and progression. Samples of fresh frozen cancer tissues, together with normal adjacent tissues (3 cm away from the tumor), were obtained during surgical resection, and total RNA was extracted for microarray analysis. Expression of six mRNAs and lincRNAs (E2F1, CCNE2, CCNB1, lincRNA:chr1:205404014-205407007, lincRNA:chr7:130723313-130727663, lincRNA:chr4:15669186-15683175) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming good quality of the microarray analysis. Data in the matrix are log2 transformed.

DESIGN
Gene expression signatures for bladder cancer tissues and normal adjacent tissues. Three pairs of fresh frozen bladder cancer tissues and corresponding normal adjacent tissues were used in the microarray analysis.
