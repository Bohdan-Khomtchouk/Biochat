TITLE
Classifying distinct grades of human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease employing a systems biology approach

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
With an estimated prevalence of about 30% in western countries non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major public health issue [PMID: 18956290]. NAFLD is associated with the metabolic syndrome of insulin resistance, obesity, glucose intolerance. Although many studies are pointing to an induction of insulin resistance by NAFLD causality between both phenotypes is not fully clarified. Furthermore, mechanisms leading to strongly differing progression of NAFLD have to be elucidated which range from mild steatosis up to severe steatohepatitis. Steatohepatitis might even result in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional complexity is introduced into the understanding of the disease by recent studies providing evidence for a direct development of carcinoma from steatosis without the formerly assumed intermediary phase of cirrhosis. Here, we investigate liver samples from patients with varying severities of steatosis in an integrative approach employing transcriptomics, serum biomarker profling, metabolomics data and systems biology models.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from hepatocytes derived from nine obese patients with distinct grades of steatosis.
