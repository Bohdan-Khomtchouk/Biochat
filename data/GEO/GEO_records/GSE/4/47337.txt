TITLE
Binding in wild type embryos: SoxN.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Genome-wide binding of SoxN in wild type embryos: SoxNDam (DamID, stage 8-11), SoxND1 (ChIP, stage 8-11), SoxND2 (ChIP, stage 8-11), SoxNPA179 Early (ChIP, stage 7-10), and SoxNPA179 Late (ChIP, stage 11-13).

DESIGN
One DamID experiment, four ChIP experiments. Three biological replicates per experiment. Two conditions: Dam (control) vs SoxNDam (sample) for DamID, anti-Î²gal (control, 40-1a antibody from DSHB) vs anti-SoxN (sample, either SoxND1, SoxND2 or SoxNPA179 antibody) for ChIP. The only commercially available antibody is the anti-BetaGal. All the anti-SoxN antibodies are home-made. anti-BetaGal: Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB), 40-1a, mouse, monoclonal ( ) SoxND1: polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbit immunized with a protein fragment corresponding to amino acids 2-92 of SoxN. Produced by the modENCODE consortium ( ). SoxND2: polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbit immunized with a protein fragment corresponding to amino acids 317-417 of SoxN. Produced by the modENCODE consortium ( ). SoxNPA179: affinity purified polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit immunized with a small peptide corresponding to amino acids 506-521 of SoxN. Commisioned by our lab and produced by Eurogentec ( ).
