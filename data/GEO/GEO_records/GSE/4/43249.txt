TITLE
Noncoding RNA expression profiling of cisplatin-resistant cells derived from the A549 lung cell line (miRNA)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
To determine the signaling networks that are dysregulated in cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung cancer, noncoding RNA expression data were obtained from, and compared between, the lung adenocarcinoma cell line, A549, and its cisplatin-resistant derivative, A549/CDDP.
