TITLE
Medicago truncatula seed development at 21-19°C

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of seeds of Medicago truncatula during maturation. To identify genes that are regulated during seed maturation in the model legume Medicago truncatula, plants at flowering stage were grown at controlled temperature of 21-19°C, 16h light. Seeds were then collected at different stages of development. Using the Medicago NimbleGen chip, a transcriptomic analysis was performed to follow the differential expression of genes during seed maturation.

DESIGN
Seeds of Medicago truncatula grown at 21-19°C were collected at different developmental stages, 15 developmental stages were analysed. Two replicates from each developmental stage were used for dye switch, each time the control was considered as the earlier developmental stage vs the treatment, corresponding to the later developmental stage. For each repetition 8 hybridisation were made: 8DAP vs 11DAP, 14DAP vs 17DAP, 20DAP vs 23DAP, 26DAP vs 29DAP,32DAP vs 35DAP, 38DAP vs 41DAP, 44DAP vs Abs, DS (Rep1 and Rep2) vs 8DAP (Rep3 and Rep4). For each biological replicates, RNA was extracted from 50 seeds collected from 5 different plants, grown in the same conditions. One replicate per array.
