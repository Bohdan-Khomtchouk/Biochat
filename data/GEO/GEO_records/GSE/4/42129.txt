TITLE
Expression data from zebrafish pigment cells at adult stage

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In zebrafish, there are interactions between black pigment cells (melanophores) and yellow pigment cells (xanthophores) for pigment-pattern formation. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of these interactions remains largely unknown. We used microarray for identifying the molecular basis of these interactions by comparing gene expression between melanophores and xanthophores.

DESIGN
Zebrafish pigment cells were collected from adult-fish fins by centrifugal separation or using cell sorter. melanophores vs. xanthophores
