TITLE
Global gene expression profiling using newly synthesized RNA [mock and LPS]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Innate stimulation with TLR ligands leads to the activation of various genes  in macrophages and various populations of these cells may exhibit different responses. Here wanted to delineate and characterize these transcriptional responses in newly established, self-renewing, in vitro grown non-transformed lines (MPI cells) and bone marrow derived macrophages We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression

DESIGN
Newly synthesized RNA from independently established MPI lines and bone marrow derived macrophages was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays
