TITLE
Microarray gene expression profiles of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells from LEW and PVG rats upon 24h and 48h LPS stimulation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We have extended our investigation to differential immunogenicity between tolerogenic PVG rats and immunogenic LEW rats by analyzing gene expression in adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) with LPS stimulation. Furthermore, to establish a direct link between gene expression and immunogenic functional annotation, ASCs from LEW and PVG rats were obtained, and the effects of inherent difference and LPS treatment on global gene expression were evaluated using microarray analyses.

DESIGN
We analyzed microarray gene expression profiles of ASCs from 3 LEW and 3 PVG rats of 8-week age and separated ASCs from each individual into four conditions, 24h and 48h control, 24h and 48h with 1 Î¼g/ml LPS stimulation. The total RNA samples of triplicate ASCs isolated from LEW and PVG with and without LPS treatment were pooled in each condition and the global gene expression profiles were analyzed using microarray.
