TITLE
Foxo1 knockout vAbl transformed cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Foxo1 is required for proper developmental progression due to distinct functions at different stages of B cell development, but specific gene targets in pro-B cells are not identified. We performed a microarray analysis in v-Abl transformed pro-B cells to compare the gene expression pattern between wildtype and Foxo1 knockout cells.

DESIGN
Foxo1f/f-ERCre vAbl transformed pro-B cells were treated with Tamoxifen to delete floxed alleles for 2 days.
