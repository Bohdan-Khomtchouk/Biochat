TITLE
Expression data for Paramecium sexually reactive cells from type 7 and type 8

ORGANISM
Paramecium tetraurelia

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to find differentially expressed genes between reactive cells of mating type 7 and 8

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from sexually reactive cells of both mating types.
