TITLE
Gene expression profiles of E11.5 metanephric mesenchyme and Adult Juxtaglomerular Complex cells or renal cortex from the kidneys of Crym-GFP or Ren1c-YFP transgenic mice using FACS or single-cell isolation techniques (GUDMAP Series ID:47).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing kidney.  The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in FACS isolated components of the developing kidney. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone.

DESIGN
YFP & GFP transgenic lines have been used to isolate several cell types including the metanephric mesenchyme, Juxtaglomerular Complex cells or renal cortex from the kidneys of either E11.5 embryos or adult mice.  The various cell types were isolated from the kidney using microdissection and single-cell isolation techniques.  RNA was isolated from cells and the gene expression profiles were determined by microarrays.
