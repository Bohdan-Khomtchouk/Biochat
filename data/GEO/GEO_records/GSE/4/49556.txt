TITLE
The effect of miR-294 and miR-181 on the transcriptome during OSK reprogramming of MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Study designed to determine the immediate effects of supplementing OSK reprogramming with miR-294 or miR-181. MEFs were infected on day 0, and transfected with miR-294, miR-181 or control mimic on day 1. On day 3 RNA was extracted. OSK infected MEFs samples were compared to non-infected MEFs and to fully reprogrammed iPSCs.

DESIGN
Performed in biological triplicate, with each sample containing different OSK viral stocks, different preparations of MEFs and independent transfections. Biological triplicate iPSCs represent three independent and clonally expanded iPSC lines. Total RNA collected with Trizol. All processing conducted at the UCLA Neuroscience Genomics Core.
