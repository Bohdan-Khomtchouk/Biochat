TITLE
A comprehensive gene expression analysis of resistance formation upon metronomic cyclophosphamide therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Resistance formation is one of the major hurdles in cancer therapy. Metronomic anti-angiogenic treatment of xenografted prostate cancer tumors in SCID mice with cyclophosphamide (CPA) results in the appearance of resistant tumors. To investigate the complex molecular changes occurring during resistance formation, we performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis of the resistant tumors in vivo. We observed a multitude of differentially expressed genes, e.g., PASD1, ANXA3, NTS or PLAT, when comparing resistant to in vivo passaged tumor samples. Furthermore, tumor cells from in vivo and in vitro conditions showed a significant difference in target gene expression. We assigned the differentially expressed genes to functional pathways like axon guidance, steroid biosynthesis and complement and coagulation cascades. Most of the genes were involved in anti-coagulation, indicating its possible importance. Upregulation of anti-coagulatory ANXA3 and PLAT and downregulation of PLAT inhibitor SERPINA were validated by qPCR. In contrast, coagulation factor F3 was upregulated, accompanied by the expression of an altered gene product. These findings give insights into the resistance mechanisms of metronomical CPA treatment suggesting an important role of anti-coagulation in resistance formation.

DESIGN
4 cell lines * 2 treatments * 4 replicates = 32 arrays. One sample (C3-T) was identified as an outlier and was omitted from further analysis; it is not included here.
