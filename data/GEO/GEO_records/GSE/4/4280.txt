HU treated cells vs wildtype untreated cells (asynchronized cells)

Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
DNA replication checkpiont kinase rad3 (human ATM/ATR-like kinase) and cds1 (human CHK2-like kinase) are known to restore stalled replication forks and prevent subsequent cell cycle progression during a replication block imposed by HU-treatment in fission yeast. In order to identify cell cycle-specific exression which are modulated by replication checkpoint kinase rad3 and cds1, microarray approach was used to profile asynchronous and synchronous cells of wildtype and mutants treated and untreated with HU Keywords: HU treated cells vs wildtype untreated cells
