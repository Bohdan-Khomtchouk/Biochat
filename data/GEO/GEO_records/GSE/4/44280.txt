TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of human astrocytomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pediatric astrocytomas, a leading cause of death associated with cancer, are the most common primary central nervous system tumors found in children. Most studies of these tumors focus on adults, not children. We examined the global protein and microRNAs expression pattern by 2D SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and RT2 miRNA PCR Array System. MicroRNAs analysis revealed for the first time novel microRNAs involved in astrocytomas biology. Interestingly, miR-138 and miR-145 down-regulation appear to be associated with protein over-expression of vimentin and Bax, respectively. In conclusion, our results show that novel proteins and microRNAs altered on pediatric astrocytoma could serve as biomarkers to distinguish between astrocytoma grades. Astrocytoma samples were colected from patients and total RNA isolation (30 mg of tissue) was performed using the TRIzol® protocol (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer′s instructions. Samples were analyzed using SA Biosciences RT2 miRNA PCRArray System  to determied the miRNA expression between control samples and tumors

DESIGN
RT2 miRNA PCR Array. Eigth tumor samples and two control tissue (including two control tissue replicates) were used as indicated in the sumary. A total of 3ug of RNA from each tumr samples and control tissue were placed in the PCR Array
