TITLE
microRNA expression profiles in androgenetic, parthenogenetically activated and fertilized embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, miRNA expression profiles were examined by Illumina microarray in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from androgenetic (aESC), parthenogenetic (pESC) and fertilized (fESC) blastocysts. Results showed that 125, 42 and 99 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the aESCs vs. fESCs, pESCs vs. fESCs and aESCs vs. pESCs, respectively.

DESIGN
Androgenetic, parthenogenetically activated and fertilized embryonic stem cell lines were established from androgenetic and fertilized blasotocyst. microRNA microarrays were repeated three times using passages 6, 7 and 8.
