TITLE
Response of Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 to different Au-species

ORGANISM
Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34

SUMMARY
Response of Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 to NaAuCl4, Au(I)-thiomalate, Au(I)-thiosulfate, KAuCN, (KCN as control)

DESIGN
In this study 10 different treatments were performed (first 7 as 3 replicates) to acquire expression profiles of the total genome of Cupriavidus metallidurans
