TITLE
Expression data from blood and biopsies of BKV viremia and nephropathy transplant patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We study the global gene expression profiles of BKV viremia and nephropathy patients using microarrays in order to better understand the immunologic response to polyomavirus BK (BKV). BKV has become increasingly prevalent since the introduction of more potent immunosuppressive agents. It has been shown that as many as 30% of renal transplant recipients develop asymptomatic viral shedding in the urine shortly after transplant, 10-20% have viremia, and as many as 1-10% can go on to develop overt nephropathy (BKVN) that might lead to graft loss. To date, the genomics of BKV viremia and BKVN have not been investigated thoroughly by microarray.

DESIGN
Patients who were enrolled in the IRB-approved Immune Monitoring Study had blood PAXGene samples taken at post-transplant visits and had clinically indicated biopsy samples were used for analysis. A total of 17 biopsy samples were used for gene expression profiling microarrays, three with histopathologic diagnosis of BKVN, 3 patients with evidence of BK viral replication in peripheral blood, but normal biopsy and 11 patients with normal biopsies or mild IFTA, and stable graft function. Blood PAXGene samples from 40 patients were used for gene expression profiling by microarrays, 14 patients with stable graft function and without BK viremia, 19 patients' blood samples at the time of BKV viremia, and 7 patients blood samples taken 1-2 months prior to development of BK viremia.
