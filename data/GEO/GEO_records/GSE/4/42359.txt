TITLE
Genome instability of the segmentally aneuploidy progeny

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
Array-based comparative genome hybridization. The aneuploid progeny could return to euploid state.

DESIGN
We determined genome-wide gene copy number in the genomes of aneuploid progeny after 14, 24 and 34 days vegetative propagation in dextrose-containing rich medim.
