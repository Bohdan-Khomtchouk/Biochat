TITLE
Microarray analysis of colon tissue of DSS colitis STAP-2 KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify STAP-2 regulating genes modulated intestine inflammation, we conducted microarray analyses using colon tissue from pooled WT (n=3) or STAP-2-/- mice (n=3) treated with DSS for 3 days. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that STAP-2 deletion mediates insufficient immune and inflammatory reaction through altering a series of associated gene expression.

DESIGN
The DSS-treated colons derived from WT (n=3) and STAP-2 KO (n=3) mice were examined. Each strain was run in biological duplicate.
