TITLE
epithelia and fibroblasts gene profile in 4NQO induced tongue carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Nine groups of rat tongue epithelia and submucosal fibroblasts RNA samples respectively, including three from normal control, three from dysplasia, and three from carcinoma (3 rats per group) were collected for gene microarray hybridization.

DESIGN
Significant fold changes among genes were determined by taking the ratio of the expression between dysplasia group and carcinoma group versus normal group in epithelia and fibroblasts cells
