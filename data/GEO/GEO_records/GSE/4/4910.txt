TITLE
Skin layer-specific transcriptional profiles in normal and recessive yellow (Mc1r/Mc1r) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total RNA was extracted from three partially overlapping dorsal skin layers derived from P2.5 normal (E+/E+) and recessive yellow (e/e) mice, as well as from an immortalized mouse melanocyte cell line (melan-a). Replicate samples (cy5) were labelled and co-hybridized with a reference RNA sample (cy3) to a 26K mouse cDNA microarray. A reference experiment design type is where all samples are compared to a common reference. Keywords: reference_design
