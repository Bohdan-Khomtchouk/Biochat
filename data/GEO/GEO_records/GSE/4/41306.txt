TITLE
Expression Profiles of miRNAs in brown fat of mice at room temperature and cold exposure (8C)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
microRNAs levels were measured in brown adipose tissue of male C57Bl6N mice that were kept at RT or during cold exposure (8°C) for 24 hrs. Several miRNAs including myomirs were identified to be regulated in response to cold.

DESIGN
Brown adipose tissue from 2 groups of 8 weeks old male C57Bl6N mice at room temperature (n=3) or after cold exposure n=3) at 8°C for 24 hrs were excised and RNA was extracted using Trizol and the manufactureres recommended procedure. miRNA expression levels were determined using Agilent microRNA expression analysis platform.
