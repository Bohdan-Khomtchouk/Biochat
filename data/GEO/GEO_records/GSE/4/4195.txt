TITLE
TGFbeta Induction in Tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TGFb1 has both tumor suppressive and pro-oncogenic functions in cancer pathogenesis but the underlying basis of this not well understood. We have developed a transgenic conditional epidermal expression model for TGFb1 in order to examine its immediate effects in benign and malignant chemically induced squamous cancers. The microarray study is an attempt to elucidate those genetic changes contributing to this behavior. Keywords: compound treatment design
