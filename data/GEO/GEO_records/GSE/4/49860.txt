TITLE
Gene expression profile of replicative senescence in normal human diploid fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of normal human diploid fibroblasts(TIG-3) comparing late passage with early passage.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent and were analyzed using the human 3D-Gene DNA chip (Toray) that contains 25000 genes. The genome wide transcriptional response of senescent cells(more than 70 population doublings)(Replicative) were compared to that of proliferating cells(less than 40 population doublings)(Young).
