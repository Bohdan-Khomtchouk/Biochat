TITLE
A systems biology approach to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of cardiac pathological hypertrophy associated with rosiglitazone

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cardiac pathological hypertrophy is associated with a significantly increased risk of coronary heart disease and has been observed in diabetic patients treated with rosiglitazone, whereas most published studies do not suggest a similar increase in risk of cardiovascular events in pioglitazone-treated diabetic subjects. This study sought to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disparate cardiovascular effects of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone and yield knowledge as to the causative nature of rosiglitazone-associated cardiac hypertrophy.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from mouse Apex from LDLr-/- mice treated with High Fat diet (HF) diet as control (n=6) or HF+Pio (n=5) or HF+Rosi (n=5).
