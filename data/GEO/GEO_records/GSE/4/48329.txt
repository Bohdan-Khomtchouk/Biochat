TITLE
Interleukin-17 mediated paracrine network promote tumor resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
While angiogenesis inhibitors have provided significant clinical benefit as cancer therapeutics, the mechanisms of anti-VEGF resistance remain incompletely understood. We uncovered an interleukin-17 mediated paracrine network of signaling between the adaptive and innate immune system associated with resistance to anti-VEGF treatment in multiple tumor models.

DESIGN
The expression of tumor-associated fibroblasts and tumor-associated granulocytes (defined as CD11b+Gr1+) and tumor-associated monocytic cells (defined as CD11b+Gr1-) were compared between wildtype and IL-17RC knockout tumor bearing mice.
