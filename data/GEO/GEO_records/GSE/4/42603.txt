TITLE
The data of differentially regulated exons from mouse testes - wild-type and Dazap1 mutant

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The binding of Deleted in Azoospermia Associated Protein 1 (DAZAP1) to splicing mutations in the BRCA1 and NF1 genes that caused exon exclusion suggest a role for DAZAP1 in RNA splicing. To elucidate the biological functions of DAZAP1 and to search for its natural RNA substrates, we compared the exon usages of wild-type and Dazap1 mutant testes by exon microarrays.

DESIGN
We used wild-type and Dazap1 mutant mouse testes. Each genotype has three replicates. 6 total samples were analyzed.
