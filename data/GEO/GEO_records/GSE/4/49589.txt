TITLE
Genome-wide cDNA screening of IFIT1 promoter activation factors in human hepato cellarlar carcinoma cell line Huh-7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify novel ghost factors regulating the expression of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs), we conducted genome-wide cDNA screening in Huh-7 IFIT-1 Luc cells
