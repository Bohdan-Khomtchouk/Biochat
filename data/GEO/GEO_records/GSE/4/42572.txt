TITLE
Gene expression analysis of mesenchymal stromal cells obtained from healthy donors and osteosarcoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of cultured mesenchymal stromal cells obtained from osteosarcoma patients at diagnosis and healthy donors were compared.

DESIGN
Mesenchymal stromal cells were harvested from the iliac crest of 5 healthy donors and 7 osteosarcoma patients at diagnosis and cultured until passage 2-5, after which cells were harvested and total RNA was isolated. Gene expression profiles osteosarcoma patient derived MSCs were compared with healthy donor derived MSCs.
