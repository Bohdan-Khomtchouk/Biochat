TITLE
Experiment 2: Klf2a, Klf2b and FoxD3 overexpression experiments at 30% epiboly MZspg and WT embryos with or without protein synthesis inhibition

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Overexpression experiments with or without protein synthesis inhibition were performed to investigate transcriptional targets of Klf2a, Klf2b and FoxD3 in the blastula stage embryos (4,7 hours postfertilization) of wild type or MZspg backgroumd

DESIGN
Experiments were performed in biological duplicates. Cy3 and Cy5 channels were splitted in Genedata Analyst software, quantile normalised and used for independent comparisons.
