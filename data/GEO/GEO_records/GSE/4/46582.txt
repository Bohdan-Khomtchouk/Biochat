TITLE
Determine the effects of mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin on mouse liver transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver from RICTOR knockout mice show normal levels of mTORC1 signaling in response to refeeding.  With this experiment we sought to compare the effects of Rictor depletion to the effects of mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin in liver from mice that were fasted and refed.

DESIGN
Mice were either fasted for 24hr (n=5), or fasted for 22hr then treated with either 10mg/kg rapamycin suspended in 0.9% NaCl and 2% ethanol at a concentration of 1mg/ml (547mM), or vehicle only.  After an additional 2 hr, one group of mice (0 hr time, n=3) was sacrificed, the liver immediately removed, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.  The remaining mice were given ad libitum access to food and sacrificed after 3hr (n=3), 6hr (n=3), or 12 hr (n=3). Two other nonfasted groups of mice (n=2) were injected with either vehicle or rapamycin and sacrificed after 24hr. Submitter cannot locate the CEL files.
