TITLE
Quantitative analysis of proliferative and Ras-induced senescent human primary fibroblasts transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goals of this study is to analyse transcriptionnal changes  in senescent cells and to compare them with ChIPseq data for several histones marks and proteins of the SUMO machinery

DESIGN
mRNA profiling of proliferative versus Ras-induced senescent humain primary fibroblasts 5 days post-infection
