TITLE
miR-146a-5p expression effect on human mesenchymal stem cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from bone marrow and the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord after manupulating miR-146a-5p expression. miR-146a-5p is involved in controlling the proliferation and migration of MSCs. Results provide miR-146a-5p-regulating genes in MSCs.

DESIGN
In this study, BM-MSCs transduced with miR-146a-5p expression vector or pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP vector only, as well as two WJ-MSCs transfected with short interfering RNAs targeting miR-146a or a GFP control.
