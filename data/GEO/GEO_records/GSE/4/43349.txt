TITLE
Geometric control of the coronary artery endothelial cell transcriptome following standard growth condition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effects of cell shape on human coronary artery endothelial cell transcription.  The hypothesis is that defined alterations in endothelial cell shape uniquely affect the endothelial transcriptome. Human coronary artery endothelial cells were plated onto spatially defined micropatterns (Cytoo) forcing them to conform to Disc, Crossbow, H, Y, or L shapes.  As a control, human coronary artery endothelial cells were plated on non-restrictive areas of the Cytoo growth plate.

DESIGN
RNA was collected after 24 hours growth on the restricted or non-restricted growth patterns and subjected to whole genome microarray analysis.
