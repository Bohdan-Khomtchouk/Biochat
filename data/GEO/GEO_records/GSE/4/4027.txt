SUMMARY
Time series of the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, treated for 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours with the synthetic androgen R1881. As control, the cells were cultured for 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours in the presence of the same concentration of solvent (ethanol). With this short treatment time, we aimed to identify mainly direct targets of the androgen receptor. LNCaP has a very low growth rate in steroid stripped medium and resumes growth on addition of androgens. Keywords: Time course
