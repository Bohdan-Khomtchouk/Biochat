TITLE
Microarray analysis of U87 glioma cells after transient knockdown of FOXM1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FOXM1 plays a key role in M phase in normal cells and is overexpressed in human glioma. We found that FOXM1 deprivation could sensitize the glioma cells to TMZ chemotherapy. To find out the mechanistic regulation of FOXM1 in chemo-resistant genes, we used microarrays to select the potential genes regulated by FOXM1 which dominates in glioma chemo-resistance.

DESIGN
U87 glioma cells were transiently transfected with none-target siRNA or FOXM1 siRNA. Total RNA were extracted after 48 hours and subjected to the microarray.
