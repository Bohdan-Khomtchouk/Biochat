TITLE
Control of Reproductive Floral Organ Identity Specification in Arabidopsis by the C Function Regulator AGAMOUS (ChIP)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Characterization of the activities of the transcription factor that AG encodes throughout flower development using perturbation assays and ChIP-Seq in combination with a floral induction system (FIS) that allows a stage-specific analysis of flower development.

DESIGN
Examination of genomic regions bound by fully functional AG-GFP protein at approx floral stage 4-5 as compared to a negative control sample.
