TITLE
Gene expression profiles during seed development and maturation in Brassica napus

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
Time course of gene expression profiles during seed development and maturation in Brassica napus were studied using Combimatrix Brassica microarray.

DESIGN
The time course expression of 90K Brassica napus EST contigs were measured at 8 developing seed stages of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 DAF (days after flowering) using single color microarray
