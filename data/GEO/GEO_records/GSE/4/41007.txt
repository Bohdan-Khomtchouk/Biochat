TITLE
Sequencing of small RNA libraries prepared from Invertebrate Iridescent Virus 6 (IIV6)-infected S2 cells or adult flies.

ORGANISM
Invertebrate iridescent virus 6

SUMMARY
We observed several hundreds of thousand reads matching the IIV6 genome in IIV6 infected S2 and wild-type flies. The large majority of these reads have a size of 21 nt. This peak was absent from the library prepared from S2 non-infected and infected Dcr-2-/- mutant flies. The virus-derived siRNAs were not uniformally distributed along the viral genome, but rather several hotspots were observed, revealing that specific regions of the viral genome generate the siRNAs.

DESIGN
Small RNA profiles of IIV6 infected S2 cells and adult flies were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina 2G Analyzer.
