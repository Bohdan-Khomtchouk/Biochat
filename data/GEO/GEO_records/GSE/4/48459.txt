TITLE
Sarcoptes scabiei Mites Modulate Gene Expression In Human Skin Equivalents

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to identify genes in keratinocytes and fibroblasts in human skin equivalents that changed expression in response to the burrowing of live scabies mites.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates for the uninfested control condition and five biological replicates for the treatment conditions (live mites, mite extract) were processed for gene expression analysis using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
