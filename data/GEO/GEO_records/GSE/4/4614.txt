TITLE
The Influence of Human Respiratory Epithelia on Pseudomonas aeruginosa Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
To gain insights into the initial phases of P. aeruginosa infections and to identify P. aeruginosa genes regulated in response to respiratory epithelia we exposed P. aeruginosa to cultured primary differentiated human airway epithelia. We used a P. aeruginosa strain (PAO1) that causes acute damage to the epithelia and a mutant (PAOSC11) with defects in Type III secretion and in rhamnolipid synthesis. The mutant did not cause rapid damage to epithelia as did the wildtype. Keywords: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and respiratory epithelia
