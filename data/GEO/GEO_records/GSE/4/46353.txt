TITLE
Isolation and Characterization of a Novel Population of Pluripotent Stem Cells Derived from Human Adipose Tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional comparison of two subpopulations of stem cells isolated from lipoaspirated human adipose tissue, profiling Adipose Stem Cells (ASCs) and Multilineage Differentiating Stress-Enduring Adipose Tissue cells (MUSE-ATs). Experiments focused in the isolation and characterization of a new population of adipose tissue (AT) derived pluripotent stem cells, termed MUSE-ATs, which are isolated using severe cellular stress conditions, including long-term exposure to the proteolytic enzyme collagenase, serum deprivation, low temperatures and hypoxia. Under these conditions, a homogenous, highly purified population of Muse-AT cells is isolated without the utilization of cell sorting methods. The goal of this experiment was to characterize MUSE-ATs, as well as compare them to the endogenous subpopulation of ASCs for reference.

DESIGN
Single condition experiment, MUSE-ATs vs. ASCs. Biological replicates: 3 MUSE-ATs replicates, 3 ASCs replicates for reference.
