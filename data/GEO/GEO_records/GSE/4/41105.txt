TITLE
cMyc and Max ChIP-seq analysis in small cell lung carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
cMyc and Max ChIP-seq analysis in a high MYC expressing small cell lung carcinoma cell line (H2171) and a low MYC expressing small cell lung carcinoma cell line (H128).

DESIGN
H2171 cells (expressing high levels of cMyc protein) and H128 cells (expressing low levels of cMyc protein) were used to analyze how cMyc overexpression influences its genome-wide occupancy.
