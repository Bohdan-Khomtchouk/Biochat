TITLE
Expression data from uninfected and VSV-infected Drosophila cells at 4 hours post-infection

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of rapidly-induced genes upon VSV infection at 4 hours post-infection in Drosophila cells

DESIGN
Drosophila cells were treated with Bgal dsRNA and either treated as uninfected or infected with VSV (MOI 10) for 4 hours, in two independent biological replicates. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol and microarray experiments were performed at the University of Pennsylvania Microarray Facility (U. Penn MF) following directions according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Affymetrix). In brief, 100 ng RNA were amplified with the Ovation RNA Amplification System v2 (NuGen), the Encore Biotin Module (NuGen) was used for fragmentation and labeling, Protocol FS450 002 was used for hybridization, washing, and staining. Images were scanned using the GeneChip® Scanner 3000 and image analysis was performed using the Affymetrix® GeneChip® Command Console® Software (AGCC).
