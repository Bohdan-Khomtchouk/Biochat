TITLE
Transcription factors OVOL1 and OVOL2 induce the mesenchymal to epithelial transition in human cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This paper shows, for the first time, a novel function of the OVO-like proteins (OVOL1and OVOL2) as critical inducers of mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) in human cancer.

DESIGN
Examination of the effects of OVOL1 and OVOL2 overexpression in a prostate cancer model.
