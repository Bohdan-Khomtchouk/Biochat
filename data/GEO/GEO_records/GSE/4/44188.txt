TITLE
DamID of Dam::LMN-1 and Dam::EMR-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans adult worms

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Laminopathies are caused by mutations in components of the nuclear envelope (NE). While most NE components are widely expressed, laminopathies affect only a subset of tissues. However, the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that explain this phenomenon is still elusive. Here we have performed a genome wide DamID analysis in adult C. elegans nematodes comparing the DNA association profile of two components of the NE, Lamin/LMN-1 and Emerin/EMR-1. Although both proteins were associated to silent DNA, EMR-1 showed a predominant role in the anchoring of muscle and neuronal promoters to the nuclear periphery. Deletion of either EMR-1 or LEM-2, another integral NE protein, caused local changes in nuclear architecture with both increased and decreased LMN-1 association.

DESIGN
Comparison of Dam::LMN-1 and Dam::EMR-1 DNA assotiation in wild type strains and Dam::LMN-1 DNA association in wild type, lem-2(tm1582) and emr-1(gk119) mutant backgrounds.
