TITLE
Tumor-infiltrating monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells mediate CCR5-dependent recruitment of regulatory T cells favoring tumor growth

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of MDSC subsets from naive blood and RMA-S blood and RMA-S tumor, respectively. Tumor-infiltrating MO-MDSCs changed their expression pattern compared to blood and exhibited high levels of chemokines

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from PMN-MDSCs and MO-MDSCs from naive blood or from blood and tumor of RMA-S bearing mice
