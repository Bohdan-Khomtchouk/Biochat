SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Ross Hardison ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). Rationale for the Mouse ENCODE project: Knowledge of the function of genomic DNA sequences comes from three basic approaches. Genetics uses changes in behavior or structure of a cell or organism in response to changes in DNA sequence to infer function of the altered sequence. Biochemical approaches monitor states of histone modification, binding of specific transcription factors, accessibility to DNases and other epigenetic features along genomic DNA. In general, these features are associated with gene activity, but the precise relationships remain to be established. The third approach is evolutionary, using comparisons among homologous DNA sequences to find segments that are evolving more slowly or more rapidly than expected given the local rate of neutral change. Such changes are inferred to be under negative or positive selection, respectively, and interpreted as DNA sequences needed for a preserved (negative selection) or adaptive (positive selection) function. The ENCODE project aims to discover all the DNA sequences associated with various epigenetic features, with the reasonable expectation that these will also be functional (best tested by genetic methods). However, it is not clear how to relate these results with those from evolutionary analyses. The mouse ENCODE project aims to make this connection explicitly and with a moderate breadth. Assays identical to those being used in the ENCODE project are performed in cell types in mouse that are similar or homologous to those studied in the human project. The comparison will be used to discover which epigenetic features are conserved between mouse and human, and examine the extent to which these overlap with the DNA sequences under negative selection. The contribution of functional DNA preserved in mammals versus function in only one species will be discovered. The results will have a significant impact on the understanding of the evolution of gene regulation. Maps of DNaseI Sensitivity: DNaseI has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility, and DNaseI hypersensitivity is a universal feature of active cis-regulatory sequences. Maps of DNaseI sensitivity measured genome-wide are generated through DNaseI digestion, addition of linkers at the sites of cleavage, and library prep followed by massively parallel short read sequencing on the Illumina GAIIx and HiSeq platforms. The sequence tags are mapped back to the mouse genome, and a graph of the smoothed kernel density of DNaseI cleavage sites is displayed as the " Signal " track. This provides a quantitative estimate of the frequency of cleavage by DNaseI in the initial digest, which in turn is related to the accessibility of the DNA in the chromatin. Segments of greatest cleavage site density represent DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs) and are identified as peaks by the F-seq program (Boyle et al. 2008). DHSs are candidates for any cis-regulatory module, including promoters, enhancers, insulators, and novel elements.
