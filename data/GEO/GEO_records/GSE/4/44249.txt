TITLE
Visual automated fluorescence electrophoresis provides simultaneous quality, quantity, and molecular weight spectra for genomic DNA from archived neonatal blood spots

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Guthrie 903 card archived dried blood spots (DBS) are a unique but terminal resource amenable for individual and population wide genomic profiling. The limited amounts of DBS-derived genomic DNA (gDNA) can be whole-genome amplified (WGA) producing sufficient gDNA for genomic applications, albeit with variable success, and optimizing the isolation of high-quality DNA from these finite, low-yield specimens is essential. Visual automated fluorescence electrophoresis (VAFE) is a novel QC technology affording precise quality, quantity and molecular weight of double-stranded DNA from a single microliter of sample. The VAFE QC data were correlated with subsequent sample performance in PCR, sequencing, and high-density comparative genome hybridization array.

DESIGN
The Swedish Repository of DBS samples collected on Guthrie 903 cards for neonatal screening of inborn diseases provided deidentified 3mm blood spot punches. There were total of eight (8) samples representing two (2) decades; 1970s: 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978; 1980s: 1980, 1982, 1984, 1986. gDNA was extracted and whole genome amplified prior to aCGH experiments using control female reference genomic DNA. The objective was to show that large rearrangements (e.g. loss of chrX in male samples) can be detected in WGA gDNA from blood spots > 30 years old.
