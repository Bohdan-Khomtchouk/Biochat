TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of genes regulated in primary human B cell and PBMC co-cultures stimulated with anti-IgM and superantigens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina microarray analysis of primary human B cell and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) co-cultures stimulated with anti-IgM and superantigens for 3 days (BT) compared to the same co-cultures without stimualtion (BTNo).

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from co-cultures after 3 days in the presence or absence of stimulation with anti-IgM and superantigens.
