TITLE
Myeloid cells or lung fibroblasts treated with IL-4 or IL-13

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IL-4 and IL-13 are cytokines involved in type 2 immune responses involved in atopic asthma and other diseases. They have a partially overlapping set of cognate receptors whose roles are incompletely understood. Here we explore the effects of these cytokines on various cells related to human lung disease in order to assess the global similarities and contrasts in the genes whose expression their ligation modulates.

DESIGN
Monocytes, monocyte-differentiated (6 days, then 24h rest) macrophages, or normal primary lung fibroblasts were cultured on matrigel and treated for 6 or 24 hours with IL-4 (10 ng/ml), IL-13 (10ng/ml), IL-10 (20 ng/ml), TGFb (10 ng/ml), or dexamethasone (0.5 uM) before harvest.
