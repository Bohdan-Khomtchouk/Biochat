TITLE
Genetic diversity of propagating/stem cells in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal malignancy whose clinical intransigence has been linked to extensive intra-clonal genetic and phenotypic diversity and therapeutic resistance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). This interpretation embodies an implicit assumption that CSCs are themselves genetically diverse. To test this, we screened neurosphere cultures by SNP arrays to identify copy number alterations (CNA) (minimum of three) that could be visualised in single cells by multi-colour FISH. Interrogation of neurosphere-derived cells (from four patients) and cells derived from secondary transplants of these same cells in Nod/Scid mice allowed us to infer clonal phylogenic architecture and the likely derivation of functional CSCs. This proof-of-principle experiment revealed that more than one sub-clone (but not all) in each GBM had functionally defined, genetically distinct stem cells.

DESIGN
Diagnostic and germ line DNA from 12 patients with GBM was investigated for LOH/CNA using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays. Neurosphere cultures were established from these primary tumors, and intracranially injected into Nod/Scid mice. Clonal architecture of primary neurospheres and secondary transplants was investigated by multicolour FISH, guided by the LOH/CNA analysis of the primary GBM tumors.
