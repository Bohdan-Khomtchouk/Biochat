TITLE
Gene expression in primary erythroid cells and in bone marrow stromal cells following treatment with Sotatercept (ACE-011)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression in primary erythroid cells and in bone marrow stromal cells following treatment with Sotatercept (ACE-011)

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of erythroid cells derived from human CD34+ cells generated under standard conditions and in cultures containing conditioned media from bone marrow stromal cells treated in vitro with ACE-011; Gene expression profiles of untreated bone marrow stromal cells and of stromal cells treated with ACE-011.
