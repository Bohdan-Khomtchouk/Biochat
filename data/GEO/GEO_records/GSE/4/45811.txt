TITLE
A validated microarray platform for Mycobacterium tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
The new microarray described for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in our study has a more complete reprensentation of the genome than any other array design reported till date. Further, protocols for sample preparation, labelling and hybridisation for accurate gene expression profiling of M.tuberculosis have been optimised.

DESIGN
Whole genome expression profiling on Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (OD600 0.4-0.5) was performed using exponential phase cultures after 0 and 6 Hrs in presence and absence of drug (Isoniazid) by using PolyA-dT and WT method. The exponential culture after 24 and 72 Hrs were used for validating the specific hybridization with or without formamide. All time points had two biological replicates with two technical replicates.
