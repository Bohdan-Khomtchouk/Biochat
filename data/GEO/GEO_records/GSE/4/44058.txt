TITLE
Transcriptome dynamics of the dormancy - growth transition in Douglas-fir needles

ORGANISM
Pseudotsuga menziesii

SUMMARY
We report sequencing the transcriptome of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) during spring bud burst.

DESIGN
Samples from needle tissue of two half-sibs from two families each, nested within three seed sources, were sequenced (total of six families and 12 individuals).  Samples were taken at seven time points with the failure of one library, resulting in 83 total sequenced samples.  Three time points were used for transcriptome assembly and 4 time point were analyzed for differential expression across time and within seed sources.
