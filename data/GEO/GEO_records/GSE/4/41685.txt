TITLE
WHIM Gene Expression Data_Update Through WHIM 26

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this microarray study was to obtain whole genome gene expression data from breast cancer, human to mouse xenograft models and from the primary cancer used for the xenograft, when possible.  We also profiled these xenograft breast cancer tumors as they were passaged into additional mice.  Whole Genome expression data allows us to monitor gene expression conservation and/or changes that occur from human to mouse, and from the initial mouse graft through subsequent passages.  PAM50 molecular subtypes are also processed using the expression data.  The xenografts provide in-vivo models for  functional and therapeutic studies.
