TITLE
VEGF-A stimulated gene expression in human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analysis of VEGF-A stimulated liver sinusoidal endothelial cell gene expression.  Untreated cells were compared to those treated with VEGF-A.  VEGF-A stimulation is critical for normal LSEC phenotype, and the response to liver injury

DESIGN
Two conditions: untreated vs. VEGF-A treated.  LSEC from 2 donors were pooled.  4 technical repeats.
