TITLE
P38 signaling underlies a cell-autonomous loss of stem cell self-renewal in aged muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle aging results in a gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass, skeletal muscle function and decreased regenerative capacity, which can lead to sarcopenia and increased mortality. While the mechanisms underlying sarcopenia remain unclear, the skeletal muscle stem cell, or satellite cell, is required for muscle regeneration. Therefore, identification of signaling pathways affecting satellite cell function during aging may provide insights into therapeutic targets for combating sarcopenia. Here, we show that a cell-autonomous loss in self-renewal occurs via novel alterations in FGF and p38αβ MAPK signaling in old satellite cells. We further demonstrate that pharmacological manipulation of these pathways can ameliorate age-associated self-renewal defects. Thus, our data highlight an age-associated deregulation of a satellite cell homeostatic network and reveals potential therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of progressive muscle wasting.

DESIGN
Satellite cells were isolated from young (3-6mo) and aged (20-25mo) adult mice; individual date files represent 2 independent pools of RNA from 4-8 mice at each timepoint.
