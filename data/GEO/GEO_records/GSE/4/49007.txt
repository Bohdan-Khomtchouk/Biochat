TITLE
Gene expression profiles of dental follicle cells after seven days of ostoeogenic differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed gene expression profiles in dental follicle cells after seven days of ostoeogenic differentiation

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from dental stem cells at day 0 (before differentiation) and after 7 days of differentiation)
