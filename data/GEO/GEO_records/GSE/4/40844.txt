TITLE
ICL010 - Infection of Calu-3 cells with H1N1 influenza virus A/Netherlands/602/2009

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential expression was determined in Calu-3 cells between mock infected and infected with H1N1 influenza virus A/Netherlands/602/2009 at nine time points post-infection. As a comparison, cells were also infected with A/CA/04/2009 H1N1 influenza virus at 4 time points post-infection.

DESIGN
Cells were infected at an MOI of 3.0. For the A/Netherlands/602/09-infected and mock-infected cells, samples were collected at 0, 3, 7, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 48 hours post-infection (h.p.i.). For the A/California/04/2009-infected cells, samples were collected at 0, 12, 24, and 48 h.p.i. Samples were collected in triplicate.
