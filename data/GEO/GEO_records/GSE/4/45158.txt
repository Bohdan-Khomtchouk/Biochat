TITLE
Searching for human genes whose expression is controlled by nuclear paraspeckle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify  human genes whose expression is controled by nuclear paraspeckle, the microarray was carried out using the RNA samples prepared from the control and NEAT1 lncRNA knockdown HeLa cells where the nucelar paraspckels were disintegrated. NEAT1 lncRNA was eliminated by administration of antisense oligogapmer.

DESIGN
Either NEAT1 ASO (#12) or control ASO (GFP) was ademnistered into HeLa cells to knockdown NEAT1 lncRNA. Total RNAs were prepared after 6, 12 and 24 hours after ASO administration.
