TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis on tibialis anterior muscle from nebulin SH3 domain deleted (Neb∆SH3) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide gene expression analysis on tibialis anterior muscle from 2-month-old nebulin SH3 domain deleted (Neb∆SH3) mice compared to wildtype.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from biological triplicates of tibialis anterior muscle from 2-month-old nebulin SH3 domain deleted (Neb∆SH3) mice compared to wildtype.
