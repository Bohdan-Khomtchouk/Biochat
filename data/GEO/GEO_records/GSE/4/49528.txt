TITLE
Comparative transcriptional analysis of Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20, a choline utilization regulator and LysX

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20

SUMMARY
Expression data for Desulfovibrio alaskensis strain G20 and mutants in regulator proteins grown on lactate sulfate media and then pelleted and transferred to another media when they reached stationary phase. The Choline mutant was transferred to lacte/sulfate minimal media and choline/sulfate minimal media. The LysX mutant was transferred to minimal media with lysine and rich media. G20 was transferred to minimal media, choline/sulfate minimal media, lactate/choline/sulfate minimal media, minimal media with lysine, and rich media. We aimed to confirm or expand the regulons of each of the transposon interupted regulator mutants and compare gene expression responses of the regulators in different growth conditions.

DESIGN
10 samples were collected: 2 regulator mutants (2 conditions each), Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 (5 conditions), 2 replicates for G20 minimal media condition. Control sample -G20 rich media.
