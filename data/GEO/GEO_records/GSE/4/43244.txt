TITLE
miRNA profiling in cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) and its maintainer fertile (MF) lines of Brassica juncea by deep sequencing

ORGANISM
Brassica juncea

SUMMARY
Here, we employed high-throughput sequencing to identify microRNAs in CMS and its maintainer fertile (MF) lines of Brassica juncea. We identified 197 known and 78 new candidate microRNAs during reproductive development of B. juncea. A total of 47 differentially expressed microRNAs between CMS and its maintainer fertile lines were discovered, according to their sequencing read number.

DESIGN
Two samples from floral buds of CMS and MF lines.
