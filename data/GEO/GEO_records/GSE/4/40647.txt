TITLE
Microarray analysis of WT and Batf3-/- CD8alpha dendritic cells from C57BL/6 spleen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Batf3 regulates key CD8alpha DC-specific genes.

DESIGN
WT and KO cells were isolated from pooled spleens of C57BL/6 genetic background mice, that were either untreated, or injected with recombinant murine IL-12 in pyrogen-free saline at 2.5 ug/mL. Mice were injected i.p. with 0.5 ug of IL-12 once and sorted after 3 days.  CD8alpha+ dendritic cells were sorted as B220- NK1.1- CD172a- CD11c+ MHCII+ CD24+ DEC205+ CD8alpha+ cells.
