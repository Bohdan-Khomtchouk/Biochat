TITLE
MicroRNA expression pattern in lung cancer and COPD

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective is to establish robust transcriptional regulation differences between lung cancer (LC) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by studying miRNA and concurrent transcriptional profiles

DESIGN
To define miRNA signature of bronchoalveolar cell fraction, samples were obtained from 87 patients from Virgen del Rocío Hospital who had required flexible bronchoscopy for diagnostic reasons. PAtients were divided into COPD group, COPD-LC group, LC group and un control group neither COPD nor LC according to the pathological results. Mature human miRNA expression was detected and quantified using the TaqMan® Low Density Arrays (TLDA). The TaqMAn Human MicroRNA A Array v2.0 containing a total of 384 TaqMan® MicroRNA Assaysto enable accurate quantity of 381 human microRNAs, all catalogued in the miRBase database.Expression of target miRNAs was normalized in relation to the expression of MammU6.  Cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated using the SDS software v.2.3 using automatic baseline settings and a threshold of 0.2. Relative quantification of miRNA expression was calculated by the 2−ΔCt method (Applied Biosystems user bulletin no. 2 (P/N 4303859)).
