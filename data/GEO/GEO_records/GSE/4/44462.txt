SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_3016 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Gary Karpen. For full list of modENCODE projects, see Project Goal: We aim to determine the locations of 125 chromosomal proteins across the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The proteins under study are involved in basic chromosomal functions such as DNA replication, gene expression, gene silencing, and inheritance. We will perform Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) using genomic tiling arrays. We will initially assay localizations using chromatin from three cell lines and two embryonic stages, and will then extend the analysis of a subset of proteins to four additional animal tissues/stages For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
