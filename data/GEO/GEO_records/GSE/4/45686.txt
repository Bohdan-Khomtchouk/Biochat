TITLE
An extracellular matrix-driven positive feedback loop regulates translation in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression of lung fibroblasts seeded onto decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM). Experiment had 2x2 design where fibroblasts from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or control patients were seeded onto decelluarized lung tissue from IPF or control patients allowing for determination of gene expression differences that were driven by IPF ECM and which differences were driven by the IPF fibroblast.

DESIGN
Lung fibroblasts from 5 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 5 control patients were cultured on decellularized ECM from IPF or control lung. Total RNA and polyribosome RNA were isolated after the cells were cultured on the decellularized ECM for 18 hours. When possible, a control cell line and a diseased cell line were cultured (and processed) simultaneously to minimize the effect of experimental variance induced by running the experiment at different times.Samples with the same batch number (provied in the sample 'characteristics' field) were cultured and processed at the same time.
