TITLE
Gene x environment effect of serotonin transporter genotype and acute stressor on amygdala gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The amygdala is a prominent region of the brain processing stress-related emotion and vigilance. Additionally it is known that the serotonergic system is strongly involved in stress response and adaptation. The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) as key regulator of serotonergic activity in the brain is associated with stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders as well as heightened trait anxiety/dysphoria and exaggerated response to fear and environmental stress in humans. Also 5-HTT knockout mice display increased anxiety- and depression-related behaviors, altered stress reactivity and stress-coping abilities, gene expression differences and altered dendritic morphology. We measured immediate reactions to an acute stressor in 5-HTT knockout mice vs. wildtypes using microarrays for genome wide gene expression profiling in the amygdala and identified different functional clusters dependent on condition and genotype.

DESIGN
Global amygdalar gene expression profiles were compared between 5-HTT knockout vs. wildtype mice in the conditions control vs. acute stressor in a total sample of 20 (5 biological replicates per genotype and condition).
