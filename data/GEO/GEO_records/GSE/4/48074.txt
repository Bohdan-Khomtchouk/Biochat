TITLE
Different miRNA expression profiles of CRC with or without lymph node metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identifying the exact molecules associated with CRC metastasis may be crucial to understand the process, which might also be translated to the diagnosis and treatment of CRC. In this study, we investigate the association of microRNA expression patterns with the lymph node metastasis of colorectal cancer.

DESIGN
To investigate the association of microRNA expression patterns with the lymph node metastasis of colorectal cancer, eight primary colorectal cancer tissues derived from stage IIâ€“III colorectal cancer patients with (n = 4) or without (n = 4) lymph node metastasis were collected and the miRNA expression profiles of them were determined using Agilent miRNA microarray.  Different miRNA expression profiles were identified in CRC tissues between lymph node metastasis positive and negative group.
