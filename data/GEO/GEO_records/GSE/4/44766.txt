TITLE
Human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line SAS-Control vs. SAS-LYRIC knockdown stable clones global gene profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of SAS cells transfected with pLKO.1-LYRIC shRNA-B expression vector (desinaged as B) and control SAS cells (transfected with pLKO.1 vector, designated as CTL). Goal was to determine the effects of LYRIC knockdown on global SAS cells gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, SAS cells transfected with pLKO.1-LYRIC shRNA-B expression vector (desinaged as B) v.s. control SAS cells (transfected with pLKO.1 vector, designated as CTL). Biological replicates: 4 control replicates, 4 transfected replicates.
