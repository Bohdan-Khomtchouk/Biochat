TITLE
Unique microRNA profiles in EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have examined the microRNA expression in 154 lung adenocarcinoma samples and 20 paired normal lung tissue samples and investigated the microRNA expression to clinical variables, EGFR- and KRAS- mutational status and time to progression.

DESIGN
174 samples are analyzed. 154 from lung adenocarcinoma tumor tissue and 20 from paired normal lung tissue samples. No replicates or control samples included.
