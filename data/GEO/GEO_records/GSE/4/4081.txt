TITLE
Expression QTL (eQTL) mapping in the anterior pituitary gland using DES-treated COPxACI F2 rats.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Anterior pituitary glands were isolated from 21 week old male rats treated for 12 weeks with the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES). 43 COPxACI F2 animals were selected based on pituitary weight phenotypic extremes: 22 highest and 21 lowest pituitary weights in our F2 population. Expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 v. 2.0 arrays. In conjunction with genomewide genotypes available for these 43 animals, linkage analysis was done using mRNA abundance of each transcript on the array as a separate quantitative phenotype. These arrays provide a resource for expression QTL (eQTL) mapping on a genomewide level in the pituitary gland. Keywords: Estrogen Response
