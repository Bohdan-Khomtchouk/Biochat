TITLE
Hepatic gene expression of HCV related Hepatocellular carcinoma and non-cancerous tissue with Il28B rs8099917 TT genotype and TG/GG genotype

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IL28B genotype was shown to be associated with treatment outcome of antiviral thearpy for HCV infection. We tried to clarify the molecular feature that was asocciated with IL2B genotype by comparing Hepatic gene expression of HCV related Hepatocellular carcinoma and non-cancerous tissue with Il28B rs8099917 TT genotype and TG/GG genotype.

DESIGN
We tried to clarify the molecular feature that was asocciated with IL2B genotype by comparing Hepatic gene expression of HCV related Hepatocellular carcinoma and non-cancerous tissue with Il28B rs8099917 TT genotype and TG/GG genotype. We analyzed ten HCC patients were selected from each IL28B genotype, and their gene expression was determined using Affymetrix genechip analysis.
