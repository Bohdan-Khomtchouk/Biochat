TITLE
Analysis of conditional loss of Geminin in neural tube and paraxial tissues at E10.5 by laser capture microdissection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To better understand the role of Geminin during germ layer specification, we bred floxed Geminin mice to Mox2-Cre mice. Mutants (fl/fl; cre/o) had spinal neural tube defects with complete penetrance.  We obtained neural tube and paraxial tissue by laser capture microdissection and analyzed total RNA by microarray.

DESIGN
Spinal neural tube and paraxial tissue were obtained separately by laser capture microdissection from wild-type and mutant E10.5 embryos. There were 2 replicates of each sample.
