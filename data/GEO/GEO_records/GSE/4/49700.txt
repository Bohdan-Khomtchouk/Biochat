TITLE
Bisulfite-Seq and RNA-seq profiling of truffle (Tuber melanosporum)

ORGANISM
Tuber melanosporum

SUMMARY
We investigated the ascomycete truffle Tuber melanosporum exploits DNA methylation and transcription to cope with the more than 45,000 repeated elements that are present in its genome. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA-sequencing, were performed on different developmental stages of this symbiotic hypogeous fungus -fruitbody (FB), free-living mycelium (FLM), and ectomycorrhiza.

DESIGN
Examination of DNA methylation and transcription of truffle in its free living mycelium (FLM), fruit body (FB), and ectomycorrhizal root tips (ECM)
