TITLE
Mouse fetal liver cells: treated with nanosilver particles (nAg)  vs control.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the differently expressed genes upon the nanosilver particle (nAg) exposure.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from E14.5 fetal livers in embryos from nAg-treated mice and the control mice. Gene-expression profiling was performed on the CapitalBio 32k mouse Genome Array microchips  (Beijing, China).
