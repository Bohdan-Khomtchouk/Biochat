TITLE
Expression data from myelo-dendritic progenitors as well as from mature myeloid and dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DCs) are essential regulators of immune responses; however, transcriptional mechanisms establishing DC lineage commitment are poorly defined. Here we report that the PU.1 transcription factor induces specific remodeling of the higher-order chromatin structure at the Interferon Regulatory Factor-8 (Irf8) gene to initiate DC fate choice. Generation of an Irf8 reporter mouse enabled us to pinpoint an initial progenitor stage at which DCs separate from other myeloid lineages in the bone marrow. In the absence of Irf8, this progenitor undergoes DC-to-neutrophil reprogramming, indicating that DC commitment requires an active, Irf8-dependent escape from alternative myeloid lineage potential. Mechanistically, myeloid Irf8 expression depends on high PU.1 levels, resulting in local chromosomal looping and activation of a lineage- and developmental stage-specific cis-enhancer. These data delineate PU.1 as a concentration-dependent rheostat of myeloid lineage selection by controlling long-distance contacts between regulatory elements, and suggest that specific higher-order chromatin remodeling at the Irf8 gene determines DC differentiation.

DESIGN
Mature macrophages, Granulocytes and DCs were isolated from wildtype mouse spleens for successive RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. 3 different pools, each consisting of splenic cells from 5 mice were prepared. Cell populations were isolated by flow cytometry. MDPs were isolated from Wildtype and IRF8 deficient bonemarrow by flowcytometry, again creating 3 biological replicates, each consisting of pooled cells from 5 mice. Differential gene expression between wildtype and IRF8 deficient MDPs was subgrouped into macrophage, granuloctic and DC signatures, derived from expression data of these cell populations.
