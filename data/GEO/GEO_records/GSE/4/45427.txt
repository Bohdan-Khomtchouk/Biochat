TITLE
ChIP-DSL H20K promoter array from human gastric cancer cells MKN28 with Sox2 overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Sox2 inhibits human gastric cancer growth and activates Sox2-related tumor surpressive genes in human gastric cancer cells. Conditional Sox2-overexpression in cells with a low Sox2 level demonstrated that the Sox2-regulated tumor surpressive genes demand on an enhanced Sox2 activity for better expression to work in human gastric cancer. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of Sox2 together with chromatin profiling by ChIP-on-chip analysis demonstrated that Sox2 directly activates the chromatin at promoters or putative enhancers of Sox2 target genes.

DESIGN
Transcription factor Sox2 promoter array in MKN28 cells with Sox2 overexpression.
