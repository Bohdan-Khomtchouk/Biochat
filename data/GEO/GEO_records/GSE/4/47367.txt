TITLE
The transcriptomic changes affected by BDF2 and SIR2 under salt stress

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The strain bdf1∆bdf2∆[BDF2 L][SIR2 H] improved salt resistance of bdf1∆. To gain further insight into the mechanism of BDF1 in suppressing bdf1∆ salt sensitivity, DNA microarray analysis was performed to determine the reason for the salt sensitivity of bdf1∆ cells and the process of how coexpression of SIR2 and BDF2 improves salt resistance. Transcriptomic analysis under salt treatment (0.6 mol.L-1 NaCl for 45 min) was performed using three different strains: bdf1∆bdf2∆[BDF2 L][SIR2 H],  bdf1∆bdf2∆[BDF2 L][pYX242] and bdf1∆[pRS316][pYX242]. The transcription of 3244 genes were significantly changed( > 2-fold) in bdf1∆bdf2∆[BDF2 L][SIR2 H] compared with bdf1∆[pRS316][pYX242] upon NaCl stress (0.6 mol.L-1 NaCl for 45 min). Only 281 genes were significantly changed ( > 2-fold) in bdf1∆bdf2∆[BDF2 L][pYX242]  compared with bdf1∆[pRS316][pYX242] upon NaCl stress (0.6 mol∙L-1 NaCl for 45 min). BF2:bdf1∆[pRS316][pYX242]. BF2B: bdf1∆bdf2∆[BDF2 L][pYX242]. BF2S:bdf1∆bdf2∆[BDF2 L][SIR2 H].

DESIGN
BF2B vs BF2 under salt treatment (0.6 mol.L-1 NaCl for 45 min); BF2S vs BF2 under salt treatment (0.6 mol.L-1 NaCl for 45 min).
