TITLE
Gene expression of the colonic epithelial cells in CRB mice fed with HFD and LFD

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the mechamisms of colonic Treg cell induction by microbial metabolite(s), chroloform-resistant bacteria (CRB)-associated mice was developed and given low-fiber diet (LFD) and high-fiber diet (HFD). The colonic epithelial cells were isolated and gene expression profiles were analyzed by GeneChip.

DESIGN
Clonic epithelial cells in CRB mice fed with HFD and LFD were isolated for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
