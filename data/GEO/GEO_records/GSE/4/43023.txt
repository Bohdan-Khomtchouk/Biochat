TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 to 4mg/L erythromycin treatment

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Erythromycin is the drug of choice to treat campylobacteriosis, but resistance to this antibiotic is rising. The adaptive mechanisms employed by Campylobacter jejuni to erythromycin treatment remain unknown. The aim of this study is to determine the molecular basis underlying Campylobacterâ€™s immediate response to Ery treatment.
