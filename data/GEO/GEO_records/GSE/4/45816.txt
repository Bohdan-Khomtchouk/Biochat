TITLE
miRNA profiling in HEV71-infected SH-SY5Y cells

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
MicroRNA (miRNA) has been highlighted in pathogen-host interactions, however, little is known about roles of miRNAs in neurological pathogenesis of human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) infections. In this study, the comprehensive miRNA expression profiling in HEV71-infected human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were performed to identify cellular miRNAs response to HEV71. A total of 69 miRNAs were differentially expressed in HEV71-infected SH-SY5Y cells compared to non-infected cells. These findings provide new information on the miRNA and mRNA profiles in HEV71 infection, which may serve as a basis for further investigation into the biological functions of miRNAs in the neurological pathogenesis of HEV71 infections.
