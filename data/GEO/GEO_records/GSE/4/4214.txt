TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the four human tissues by two microarray platforms and TaqMan real-time PCR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study provides one of the largest “reference” data set of gene expression measurements using TaqMan® Gene Expression Assay based real-time PCR technology.  This data set allowed us to use an orthogonal gene expression technology to evaluate the performance of different microarray platforms.    We conclude that microarrays are indeed invaluable discovery tools with acceptable reliability for genome-wide gene expression screening, though validation of putative changes in gene expression remains advisable.   Our study also characterizes the limitations of microarrays; understanding these limitations will enable researchers to more effectively evaluate microarray results in a more cautious and appropriate manner Keywords: cross-platform comparison of gene expression measurements
