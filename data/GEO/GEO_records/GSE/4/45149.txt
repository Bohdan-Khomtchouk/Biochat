TITLE
The MLH1 c.-27C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lynch syndrome, caused by germline heterozygous mutations of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2, or deletions affecting the EPCAM gene upstream of MSH2, is characterized by a predisposition to early-onset colorectal and additional extracolonic cancers. An alternative but rare cause of Lynch syndrome is a constitutional epimutation of MLH1, which is characterized by promoter methylation and transcriptional silencing of a single allele in normal tissues. Worldwide, five families with autosomal dominant transmission of a constitutional MLH1 epimutation linked to an MLH1 haplotype with two single nucleotide variants (c.-27C > A and c.85G > T) have been identified. Array-based genotyping using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 data in four of these families revealed a shared haplotype extending across a â‰¤2.6 Mb region of chromosome 3p22 encompassing MLH1 and additional flanking genes, indicating common ancestry.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from 5 carriers of the c.-27C > A and c.85G > T variants was hybridized on Affymetrix SNP6.0 array according to manufacturer's procedures
