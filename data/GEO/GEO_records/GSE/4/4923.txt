TITLE
Analysis of the trithorax Group (trxG) genes ash2 and ash1 wing imaginal disc transcriptomes.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The absent, small or homeotic discs 2 (ash2) gene, a member of the trithorax Group (trxG) of transcriptional regulators, is functionally related to ash1. However, ASH2 and ASH1 belong to distinct multimeric complexes of unknown composition and it is unclear how they act to regulate transcription. In this study, examination of gene expression profiles in wing imaginal discs from ash2 and ash1 mutants revealed their transcriptomes are very similar and correlate with wing phenotypes. Keywords: loss of function analysis
