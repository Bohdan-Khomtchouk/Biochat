TITLE
Lung conventional dendritic cells promote mucosal adjuvant activity of flagellin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The activity of the potent nasal adjuvant flagellin depends on initial activation of airway epithelilal cells. This study aims at investigating the immune cells involved in the antigen presentation within the respiratory tract. First, microarrays characterized that activation/recruitment of immune cells was the main signature of flagellin activation in lung. Neutrophils and classical monocytes were strongly recruited into the lungs and take up antigen upon nasal administration of flagellin. In contrast, the numbers of lung CD11b+ or CD103+ DC and alveolar macrophages were not enhanced although these cells were very efficient in antigen uptake. Our experiments showed that CD11b+ DC but not monocytes, PMN, CD103+ DC are not essential for the adjuvant effect. Flagellin signaling enhanced the functional activation of lung CD11b+ conventional DC and their migration to the lymph nodes. Using Cd11c-DTR mice, CD11b+ DC from lymph nodes were identified as the major stimulators of CD4 T cell activation. Finally, the migration and maturation of mucosal DC was independent of direct signaling, highlighting the contribution of epithelial factors in the mucosal adjuvant effect of flagellin. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that adjuvant activity can be dissociated from inflammatory cell recruitment an open new perpectives for improvement of vaccines.

DESIGN
Female C57BL/6J (6 weeks old) mice were immunized with the TLR5 agonist Flagellin (1Î¼g diluted in PBS) by intranasal (i.n.) administration. Blood samples of four time points post immunization were taken at 2h, 4h, 18h and 48h. Microarray experiments were performed as single-color hybridizations.
