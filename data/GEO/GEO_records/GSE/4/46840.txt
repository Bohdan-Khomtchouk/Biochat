TITLE
CGH mesurement of DNA replication in wild-type and cdc6-mn replication deficient strains.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Comparative genome hybridization (CGH) was used to measure relative DNA replication after 8 hours in meiosis for wild-type and cdc6-mn cells.

DESIGN
We measured DNA replication after 8 hours in meiosis for wild-type and cdc6-mn cells on microarrays using CGH.
