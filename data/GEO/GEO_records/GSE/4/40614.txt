TITLE
Id1 knockdown in primary human glioma stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Abnormal activation of stemness factors is a crucial signature of cancer stem cells (CSCs), a highly tumorigenic subpopulation in malignant tumors. However, it is unclear whether multi-signaling pathways are activated in CSCs, as like normal stem cells. I would like to report that an inhibitor of differentiation 1 (ID1) activates intracellular multi-signaling involved in proliferation,  genesis, and maintenance of glioma stem cells (GSCs) by suppression of Cullin3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that degrades Cyclin E and components of SHH and WNT signaling. ID1 inhibits BMP-dependent differentiation of GSCs by activation of BMPR2-targeting miR17/20a. ID1HIGH-Cullin3LOW signature correlates with a poor prognosis of GBM patients with a significant association to gene signatures enriched in EGF, WNT, SHH, and BMP signaling. Combinational inhibition of GSC intracellular multi-signaling network increases tumor-bearing mice survival. These results provide insights on molecular and cellular basis of GSC biology, and also suggest necessity of multi-signaling inhibition for GSCs therapy.

DESIGN
Two human primary glioma stem cells (GSCs) such as GSC2 and GSC8 were isolated from two individual primary human glioma specimens.  The GSCs were directly transfected with pSuper-GFP-ID1-shRNA and pSuper-GFP-Scrambled-shRNA using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche). The RNA extraction in these cells was used to analyze gene expression.
