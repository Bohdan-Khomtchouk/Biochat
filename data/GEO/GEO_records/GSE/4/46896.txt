TITLE
Developmentally regulated lncRNAs expression in male germline

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To decipher the roles of non-coding RNAs during male germline development, we use the lncRNAs microarray to profile the genome-wide lncRNAs expression pattern in the male germline

DESIGN
Testes samples from 6 time points were collected for lncRNAs and mRNAs microarray profiling
