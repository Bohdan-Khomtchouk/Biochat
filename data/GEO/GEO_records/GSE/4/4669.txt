TITLE
Response of yeast to saponin treatment

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression profiling was used to identify genes that showed altered expression in response to treatment with the saponins tomatidine, tomatine and the sterol biosynthesis inhibitory compound fenpropimorph Growth inhibition by the compounds was monitored by measuring the OD600nm. Cells were pelleted and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Acid-washed glass beads (0.5 mm diameter; Sigma) were added and the cells disrupted using two 20 s cycles at speed setting 6 in the Savant Bio 101 Fast Prep FP120. Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). Microarray hybridisation was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Yeast genome S98 array using protocols described by Affymetrix, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA, USA) (as previously described (Zhu et al., 2001). Data were analyzed using the RMA algorithm using Expressionist Pro (GeneData Inc., Switzerland). Keywords: response to abiotic stress
