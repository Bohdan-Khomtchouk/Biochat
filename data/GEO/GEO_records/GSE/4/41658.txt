TITLE
Methylomic analysis identifies the involvement of migration and adhesion genes in the ageing of primary haematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we utilize Nano-MeDIP-seq for the analysis of the LT-HSC methylome and, for the first time, simultaneously interrogate the methylome and transcriptome of a homogeneous population of primary murine HSCs, in order to define the underlying causes of changes in HSC functionality during normal ageing.

DESIGN
We isolated and phenotyped primary LT-HSCs from young, middle-aged and old mice and subjected them to comprehensive methylome (MeDIP-seq) and transcriptome (RNA-seq) analysis.
