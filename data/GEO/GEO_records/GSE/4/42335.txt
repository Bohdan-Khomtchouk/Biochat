TITLE
Expression data for MALT1-responsive genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In lymphocyte lineages, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (MALT1) mediates the nuclear factor-κB activation signal that stimulates progression of malignant tumors.  However, its expression is inactivated in oral carcinoma patients with worse prognosis.  Unveiling genes under the control of MALT1 will provide valuable information for understanding of the mechanism of carcinoma progression. We profiled gene datasets altered in response to MALT1 in oral carcinoma cells by the microarray analysis.  Totally, 2,933 genes with a fold change ≥ ±2.0 and P < 0.05 were identified.

DESIGN
HSC2 oral carcinoma cells  were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affimetrix microarrays.  We sought to obtain homogenous populations of MALT1-resonsive genes in order to increase the resolution of expression profiles.  To this end, we used HSC2 cells stably expressing MALT1 (n=3) and vector alone (n=3) for the analysis.
