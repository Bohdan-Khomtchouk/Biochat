UV timecourse

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of ultraviolet-radiation time course with paired treatment and control measurements provided groups of coordinately regulated genes and Gene Ontology processes.  A set of genes significantly affected by UV was selected by linear modeling plus order-restricted inference profile matches; this gene list was used to find upstream sequence motifs that predict UV regulation of gene expression. Keywords: time course dose response stress response
