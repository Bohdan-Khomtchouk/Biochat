TITLE
Taqman Low Density Arrays (TLDA) based microRNAs expression profile of mouse extrahepatic bileducts and gallbladders during a mouse model of biliary atresia.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Newborn Balb/c mice were injected with 1.5x10^6 fluorescent-forming units (ffu) of Rhesus rotavirus type-A or 0.9% NaCl (normal saline) intraperitoneally within 24 hours of birth to induce experimental model of biliary atresia. The extrahepatic bile ducts including gallbladder were microdissected en bloc at 3, 7 and 14 days after rhesus rotavirus or saline injection. TaqManÂ® Array Rodent MicroRNA Card v2.0 (A and B) were used to screen microRNAs whose expression was differently regulated after rhusus rotavirus injection compare to the normal saline controls.

DESIGN
microRNA expression profiling.  Each experimental conditon has 3 sets samples . Two to six extrahepatic bileducts were pooled prior to total RNA isolation depending on the size to ensure adequate RNA quantities to perform experiments quantifying microRNA expression.
