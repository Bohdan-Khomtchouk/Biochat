TITLE
Gene expression changes in FORKO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand consequences of loss of FSH receptor, we used genetically altered mouse mutants with deletion of this receptor. Follitropin Receptor Knockout (FORKO) mice present various developmental and age-dependent abnormalities such as infertility, senescence and increased tumor incidences in addition to other phenotypes. To explore why the atrophic ovaries of FORKO mice develop ovarian anomalies later in life, we used expression profiling studies to gain a more comprehensive view of genes that are misregulated. Keywords: Comparison of  Wildtype and FSH-Receptor Knock out Ovaries at 8 months of age.
