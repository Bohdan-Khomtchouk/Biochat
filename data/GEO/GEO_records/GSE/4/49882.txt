TITLE
Transcription analysis of the porcine alveolar macrophage （PAM） response to co-infection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and M. hyopneumoniae (Mhp)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in porcine alveolar macrophage response to co-infection of PRRSV and M. hyopneumoniae The results in this study will be further described in Bin li et al., 2013. BMC genomics.

DESIGN
A 24 chip study using total RNA recovered from four separate group include control, PRRSV, M. hyopneumoniae and PRRSV+M. hyopneumoniae.
