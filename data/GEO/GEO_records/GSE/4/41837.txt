TITLE
Circulating microRNA Signatures in Mice Exposed to Lipoteichoic acid

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To profile the expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) of mice in exposure to intraperitoneal lipoteichoic acid (LTA) injection and compare that with those with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice received intraperitoneal injections of 100 Î¼g of LTA originated from Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus were killed 6 h and the whole blood samples were obtained for miRNA expression analysis using a miRNA array
