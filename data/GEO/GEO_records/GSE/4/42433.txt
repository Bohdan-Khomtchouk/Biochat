TITLE
Yeast transcriptomics in sugarcane-based ethanol fermentation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The present work aimed to compare the transcriptome of three major ethanol-producer Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains in Brazil when fermenting sugarcane juice for fuel ethanol production. This was motivated by the reports presenting physiological and genomics differences among them, and by the attempt to identify genes that could be related to their fermentation capacity and adaptation for different industrial processes.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, T0h vs. T6h fermetations assay. Biological replicates: 3 T0h replicates, 5 T6h replicates.
