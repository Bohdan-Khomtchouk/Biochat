TITLE
Gene expression signature of colorectal cancer with microsatellite instability.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples were taken from colorectal cancers in surgically resected specimens in 84 colorectal cancer patients. The expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Comparison between the sample groups allow to identify a set of discriminating genes between MSI and MSS cancers and, furthermore, to determine the distinct characteristics of proximal and distal MSI cancers. Keywords: repeat
