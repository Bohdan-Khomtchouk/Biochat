TITLE
Interrogating translating RNAs and cell-type specific gene expression using Cre-activated translating ribosome affinity purification

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We characterize a Cre-activated TRAP allele (Rosa26fsTRAP) to show that endothelium-specific activation of Rosa26fsTRAP identifies endothelial cell enriched transcripts, and that cardiomyocyte-restricted TRAP is a useful means to identify genes that are differentially expressed in cardiomyocytes in a disease model. We also show that TRAP is an effective means to study translational regulation, and we several nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes are under strong translational control. These RNA-seq data show that the TRAP strategy and the Rosa26fsTRAP allele will be useful tools to probe cell type specific transcriptomes, and to study translational regulation.

DESIGN
Study TRAP RNA and total RNA in two cases: heart specific tissues, Banding or Sham, using RNA-seq technology.
