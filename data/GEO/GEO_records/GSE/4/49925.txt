TITLE
Gene expression profiles associated with acute myocardial infarction and risk of cardiovascular death

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole peripheral blood samples collected into Paxgene tubes from 338 adult participants in the Emory University Cardiovascular Biobank, in Midtown Atlanta.  The sample is of mixed cardiovascular function diversity, and is part of a survey of the impact of status of cardiovascular disease on gene expression and clinical attributes. Sample annotations only include gender and proofed ethnicity for purposes of IRB, as well as technical features of the study (plate, phase of study, and RNA quality RIN score).

DESIGN
338 individuals in the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank in Midtown Atlanta., 219 men and 119 women. The age of individulas were between 26 and 85 (mean 62). 333 Caucasian (CAU), 4 African American (AFA), 1 South Asian (SAS).
