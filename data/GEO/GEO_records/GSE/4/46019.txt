TITLE
Long-term culture associated gene expression changes in MSC (TGFb treatment)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) were isolated from human bone marrow. Here, we have compared gene expression profiles of MSC at early and late passages and upon stimulation with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-b1). Stimulation was performed with 1ng/mL TGF-b1 for 1, 4, or 12 hours as indicated. The goal of this study was to determine if senescence-associated gene expression changes and TGF-b1 induced gene expression changes are related.

DESIGN
24 samples were hybridized GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix)
