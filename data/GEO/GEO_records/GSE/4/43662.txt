TITLE
Gene expression in response to fluconazole vs. the combination of  fluconazole and berberine

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Candida albicans comparing fluconazole treated cells with fluconazole- and berberine-treated cells, as well untreated cells with berberine treated cells

DESIGN
Three different clinical FLC-resistant strains (0304103, 01010 and 632) were selected to carry out the expression profile microarray. Two-condition experiment, fluconazole-treated vs. fluconazole- and berberine-treated cells, and untreated cells vs. berberine-treated cells. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 transfected, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
