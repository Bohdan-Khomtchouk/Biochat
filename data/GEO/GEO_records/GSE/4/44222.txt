TITLE
Single-cell derived clones from human adipose stem cells present different immunomodulatory properties.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human adipose mesenchymal stem cells are a heterogeneous population, where cell cultures derived from single cell-expanded clones present varying degrees of differential plasticity. This work focuses on the immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory properties of these cells. To this end, 5 single cell clones were isolated (1.X and 3.X) from 2 volunteers. Regarding the expression level of the lineage-characteristic surface antigens, clones 1.10 and 1.22 expressed the lowest amounts, while clones 3.10 and 3.5 expressed more CD105 than the rest and clone 1.7 expressed higher amounts of CD73 and CD44. Regarding cytokine secretion, all clones were capable of spontaneously releasing high levels of IL-6 and low to moderate levels of IL-8. Furthermore, clone 3.X produced the highest amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1Î², while clones 1.10 and 1.22 highly expressed IL-4 and IL-5. These differences can be explained in part by the distinct DNA promoter methylation profile exhibited by the clones. The results of this work indicates that this stem cell population is heterogeneous in its secretion profile, and that isolation, characterization and selection of the appropriate cell clone is a more exact method for the possible treatment of different patients or pathologies.

DESIGN
Total DNA isolated by standard procedures from different clones of human dipose mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC)
