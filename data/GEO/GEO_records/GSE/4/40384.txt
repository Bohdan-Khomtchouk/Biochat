TITLE
siRNA Knockdown of SWI/SNF complex proteins in prostate cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we performed transcriptional profiling of the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and 22Rv1 comparing non-targeting siRNA treatment versus siRNAs targeting SWI/SNF complex proteins (SMARCA2, SMARCA4, and SMARCB1). Goal was to determine the effect of SWI/SNF knockdown on gene expression in prostate cancer.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: non-targeting siRNA versus SWI/SNF-siRNA treated cells. Three SWI/SNF proteins were targeted: SMARCA2, SMARCA4, and SMARB1. Biological replicates: 1 control replicate, 2 treatment replicates per SWI/SNF protein.  Technical replicates: 1 replicate per SWI/SNF protein. Cell lines: 22Rv1 and LNCaP.
