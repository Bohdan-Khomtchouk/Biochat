TITLE
Expression data of Schizosaccharomyces pombe deletions involved in DNA damage response

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
DNA damage response (DDR) plays pivotal roles in maintaining genome integrity and stability. An effective DDR requires the involvement of hundreds of genes that compose a complicated network. To identify novel genes involved in DDR, we screened a genome-wide Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe) haploid deletion library against six different DNA damage reagents. We identified 52 genes that were actively involved in DDR. Among the 52 genes, 20 genes were linked to DDR for the first time. For a better understanding of DDR genes function, we performed a DNA microarray assay to analyze the gene expression profiles of eight deletions.
