TITLE
Analysis of genome-wide copy number variations in Oryza sativa L.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We describe a more detailed survey undertaken to detect candidate CNVs in a panel of 20 Asian cultivated rice and the genome-wide characteristics of CNVs in subspecies and groups. These resources allowed us to analyze genetic structure as indicated by CNVs, to implicate the biological roles of CNVs, and to identify candidate CNVs that are likely to occur independently in groups and contribute to differences between the subspecies.
