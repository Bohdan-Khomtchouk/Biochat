TITLE
trkB.T1 WT versus trkB.T1 KO expression data following spinal cord injury (SCI)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We profiled spinal cord tissue at the site of a moderate contusion injury at the level of the thoracic spinal cord We examined several timepoints following injury, including sham and days 1,3 and 7 following injury and compared differential expression of genes within a genotype and across genotypes (trkB.T1KO/trkB.T1WT) at each timepoint.

DESIGN
Tissue was profiled at baseline (sham) condition and then 1, 3 and 7 days after thoracic moderate contusion injury
