TITLE
GeneChip expression profiling of Glud1 (glutamate dehydrogenase 1) transgenic mice across age

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Glud1 (Glutamate dehydrogenase 1) transgenic mice release more excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate to synaptic cleft throughout lifespan. Here we compared transcriptomic profiles of these animals to their wild-type counterparts across 5 ages. The hippocampus was used for the analysis.

DESIGN
Longitudinal studies of Glud1 transgenic and wide-type mice across 5 age points: 10 days post birth,  4.5 mo, 9 mo, 14.5 mo, and 20 mo.
