TITLE
Role of omega-3 fatty acids regulating the brain functions and associated disorders: Transcriptomic analysis of the effect of a fish oil enriched diet on murine brains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Based on the comprehensive inhibition of a pool of inflamamsome and apoptosome networks, FD likely reduces the amyloidal burden, attenuates oxidative stress and assist somatostatin activation. Thus FD is a potential therapeutic agent for Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and affective disorder

DESIGN
A total of 10 mice were  randomly chosen from a strain of  C57BL/6j.Those  mice consumed  two diets  customized n-3 PUFA enriched diet (FD)  and standard lab diet (SD )from weaning age until 5 month. Hemi brain samples were harvested from these mice and Transcriptomic Expression Analysis, Cluster and Functional analysis, Real time polymerized chain reaction and assay to validate microarray results were done to collect data. A comparative analysis of the diet compositions reveals relatively comparable amount of major nutrients and consumable calories derived from both diets .The major difference between the two diet types emerges from the percentage of n-3 PUFA and n-6 PUFA present in each type .
