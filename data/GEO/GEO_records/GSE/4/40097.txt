TITLE
DNA methylation analysis of pancreatic cancer and non-malignant pancreas cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of 20 PDAC cell lines and an immortalized non-malignant pancreatic duct cell line (HPDE) to facilitate identification of novel tumor suppressor genes using an integrative genomics approach Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of 20 PDAC cell lines and an immortalized non-malignant pancreatic duct cell line (HPDE) to identify novel tumor suppressor genes

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 21 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip
