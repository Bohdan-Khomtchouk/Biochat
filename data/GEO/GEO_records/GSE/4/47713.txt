TITLE
Expression data from polysomal, nonpolysomal, and total RNAs in the S. cerevisiae tRNA trafficking mutants, msn5 and mtr10

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
tRNAs are transcribed and partially processed in the nucleus before they are exported to the cytoplasm where they have an essential role in protein synthesis. Surprisingly, mature cytoplasmic tRNAs shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm and its distribution is nutrient-dependent. At least three members of β-importin family, Los1, Mtr10, and Msn5, function in tRNA nuclear-cytoplasmic intracellular movement. To test the hypothesis that the tRNA retrograde pathway regulates translation of particular transcripts We compared individual translation activity index (P/NP), obtained from the ratio of polysome-associated (P) to not associated (non-polysomal, NP) mRNAs, in the msn5Δ, mtr10Δ, and wild-type cells under fed or acute amino acid depletion conditions
