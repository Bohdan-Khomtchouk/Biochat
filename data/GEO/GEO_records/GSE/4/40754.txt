TITLE
Comparison of transcriptome of high differentiation-inducible murine erythroleukemia cells and low differentiation-inducible murine erythroleukemia cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells are differentiated by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO）, hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA） or trichostatin A (TSA） treatment. We selsected  high differentiation-inducible (HD) and low differentiation-inducible (LD)-MEL cells by recloning of original MEL cells. We screened erythroid differentiation related-genes to compare transcriptome of HD and LD-MEL cells.

DESIGN
HD-MEL cells and LD-MEL cells were cultured 6, 12, 24, or 36 hours with 1.0% DMSO, 3.0 mM HMBA, or 15 nM TSA. The RNA of HD-MEL cells and LD-MEL cells were compare same time points of each drug treatment. The expression ratio (HD/LD) was calculated by average of technical quadruplicate microarray experiments includes two dye-swaps.
