TITLE
Monopolar attachment of sister kinetochores at meiosis I requires casein kinase 1.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The segregation of maternal centromeres away from the paternal ones during the first division of meiosis depends on the attachment of sister kinetochores to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole. In budding yeast monopolar attachment requires the recruitment to kinetochores of a protein complex called monopolin. The biochemical function of monopolin was unknown. Here, we have identified the casein kinase I Hrr25 as a hitherto unknown subunit of monopolin. Hrr25 differs from other monopolin components by its enzymatic activity and strong evolutionary conservation. We demonstrate that Hrr25â€™s kinase activity and its interaction with monopolin are both required for monopolar attachment. Accordingly, Hrr25 is associated with centromeres in meiosis I. Our results revealed a surprising new role for casein kinases and provide a hypothesis for the mechanism of monopolar attachment during meiosis I in sexually reproducing organisms: casein kinase I-dependent phosphorylation of kinetochore proteins.
