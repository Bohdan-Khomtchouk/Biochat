TITLE
Expression data of growth plate chondrocytes isolated from control or conditional Lkb1 mutant mice at postnatal day 30

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have shown that removal of Lkb1 in chondorcytes results in enchondroma-like structure in postnatal mouse long bones. To furhter understand the role of Lkb1 in this process, we performed microarrrays to compare the transcriptional profile between control and conditional Lkb1 mutant (Col2a1-Cre; Lkb1c/c) chondrocytes.

DESIGN
Postnatal day 30 mouse growth plate chondorcytes from control and mutant mouse femurs and tibiae were isolated for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
