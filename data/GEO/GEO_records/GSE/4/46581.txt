Yale Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cohort

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by high proliferation, poor differentiation and a poor prognosis due to high rates of recurrence. Despite lower overall incidence African American (AA) patients suffer from higher breast cancer mortality in part due to the higher proportion of TNBC cases among AA patients compared to European Americans (EA). It was recently shown that the clinical heterogeneity of TNBC is reflected by distinct transcriptional programs with distinct drug response profiles in preclinical models. In this study, we used gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry to eluicidate potential differences between TNBC tumors of EA and AA patients on a molecular level.

DESIGN
WG-DASL experiment of 90 FFPE samples of ER, PR and HER2 (triple) negative breast cancer samples diagnosed between 1987 and 2007. Invasive disease was identified on H & E sections by the study pathologist and one to three 1.5 mm cores were punched from the top down in the designated tumor areas of each FFPE block. The cores were deparaffinized with xylene at 50Â°C for 3 minutes. RNA was extracted using the RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's protocol. The isolated RNA was hybridized to Whole-Genome DASL (HumanRef8 V 3.0, Illumina) at the Yale Center for Genome Analysis. 90 primary tumor RNA samples from 90 patients were adequate for analysis and passed Quality control.
