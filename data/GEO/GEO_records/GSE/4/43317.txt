TITLE
Gene expression changes in HEK293T cells upon overexpression of ING1b and GADD45a

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ING1b and GADD45a are nuclear proteins involved in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis and DNA repair. We found that ING1b and GADD45a physically and functionally interact in the epigenetic regulation of specific target genes. In order to characterise the functional ING1b-GADD45a interaction, we performed a gain-of-function experiment in HEK293T cells by individual and combinatorial plasmid transfections and then analysed the transcriptional response via expression microarray profiling.

DESIGN
HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding human GADD45a and/or human ING1b (full-length or without its PHD-domain) and harvested 48h post-transfection for Illumina microarray profiling. Two independently transfected replicate samples of each condition were analysed. Empty vector (control) transfections served as reference samples.
