ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A secreted factor in bone marrow associated with metastatic gastric cancer was indentified through expression profiling in bone marrow of stage III and stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, bone marrow samples from patients with stage III or stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma were used to acquire expression profiles.
