TITLE
Treatment of established mouse AA with topical JAK inhibitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our goal was to identify gene expression patterns that correlated with treatment of established autoimmune alopecia in C3H/HeJ mice following alopecic graft transplantation skin from 3 mice were taken at 6, 12 and, in some cases, 24 weeks of topical drug administration following grafting; mice were treated with ruxolitinib (jak1i), tofacitinib (jak3i), or control pbs

DESIGN
3 biological replicates were taken at each time point for each treatment modality
