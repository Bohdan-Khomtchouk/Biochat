TITLE
Depolarization induced gene from primary cortical neuron

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Activation of neurons is one of the fundamental events for the functioning of nervous system. Neuronal activation relays information to next neurons. On the other hand, the activated neurons themselves are also influenced by neuronal activation. Depending on the type and condition of neuronal activation, these activated neurons change their gene expressions, thereby being able to process information more or less efficiently. We applied the microarray technology to identify hither-to-uncharacterized as activity-dependent genes. Especially, we screened the transcription factors, because early changes in the transcription factors should result in alterations of gene expression profiles and subsequent neuronal properties. Keywords: duplicated control, duplicated treatment
