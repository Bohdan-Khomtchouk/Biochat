TITLE
Translatome of floral buds, in vivo pollinated pollen tubes, and in vitro cultured pollen grains/tubes from LAT52-HF-RPL18 Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Little is known of the transcriptome of in vivo-grown pollen tubes, due to the difficulty of collection of pollen tubes elongating within the maternal gynoecium.We obtained the mRNAs undergoing translation (the translatome) of in vivo-grown pollen tubes from self-pollinated gynoecia of Arabidopsis thaliana(Col-0).

DESIGN
Transgenic Arabidopsis plants (LAT52-HF-RPL18) harboring an epitope tagged ribosomal protein L18 driven by the pollen specific promoter (ProLAT52) were used for mRNA-ribosome complex isolation. After collection of polyribosomal (polysomal) complexes from self-pollinated (in vivo), unpollinated styles (buds), and in vitro-cultured pollen tubes, the actively translated mRNAs (the translatome) were purified, amplified to antisense RNA (aRNA). These aRNAs were hybridized to microarrays.Three independent biological replicates samples of aRNA from Bud, in vivo, and in vitro polysomal mRNA (translatomes) were hybridized to GeneChips to produce CEL files.
