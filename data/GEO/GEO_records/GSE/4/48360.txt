TITLE
Expression of Sodalis glossinidius genes derived from self-cleared and control Glossina palpalis gambiensis flies

ORGANISM
Sodalis glossinidius

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of Sodalis glossinidius derived from uninfected (controls) and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection self cleared Glossina palpalis gambiensis. 10 days after infectived blood meal, flies anal drop were analysed by PCR to isolate the infected self cleared flies. Then, uninfected  (controls) and infection self cleared 10 days-flies midgut were dissected for RNA extraction.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from 8 samples including: 4 control and 4 infection self-cleared flies.
