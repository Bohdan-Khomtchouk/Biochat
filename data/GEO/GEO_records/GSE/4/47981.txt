TITLE
Expression profile pAP1-AP1-GR ap1cal inflorescences - time series (days)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This experiment describes gene expression after the activation of APETALA1-GR, to study and identify AP1 target genes. We used a pAP1:AP1-GR ap1 cal line to induce a synchronized response  activating the AP1-GR fusion protein in ap1 cal inflorescence-like meristems through dexamethasone treatment. Tissue samples were collected immediately after the treatment, as well as subsequent timepoints. The expression profiles of the individual samples were then analyzed by gene expression profiling using whole-genome oligonucleotide arrays (Agilent, custom-commercial)

DESIGN
Four sets of biologically independent tissue samples were collect before DEX-induction (day 0, 0d), as well as at 2 days, 4 days and 8 days after the treatment. Samples for each timepoint and biological replicate were co-hybridized as indicated; one sample was labeled with Cy3 and the other with Cy5. The dyes used for labeling RNA from a given timepoint were switched for two of the replicate experiments, to reduce dye-related artifacts. This experimental setup resulted in a total of 3 hybridizations per set (0days vs 2days, 2days vs 4days, and 4days vs 8days), and an even number (2) of hybridizations of each dye polarity per comparison.
