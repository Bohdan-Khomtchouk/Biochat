High-Throughput Targeted Repeat Element Bisulfite Sequencing (HT-TREBS)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In vertebrates, DNA methylation-mediated repression of retrotransposons is essential for the maintenance of genomic integrity.  In the current study, we developed a technique termed HT-TREBS (High-Throughput Targeted Repeat Element Bisulfite Sequencing).  This technique is designed to measure the DNA methylation levels of individual loci of any repeat families with next-generation sequencing approaches.  To test the feasibility of HT-TREBS, we analyzed the DNA methylation levels of the IAPLTR family using a set of 12 different genomic DNA isolated from the brain, liver and kidney of 4 one-week-old littermates of the mouse strain C57BL/6N.  This technique has successfully generated the CpG methylation data of 5,233 loci common in all the samples, representing more than 80% of the individual loci of the five targeted subtypes of the IAPLTR family.  According to the results, approximately 5% of the IAPLTR loci have less than 80% average CpG methylation levels with no genomic position preference.  Further analyses of the IAPLTR loci also revealed the presence of extensive DNA methylation variations between different tissues and individuals.  Overall, these data demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the new technique, HT-TREBS, and also provide new insights regarding the genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of the IAPLTR repeat elements.

DESIGN
High-throughput, single-base resolution, singlicate DNA methylation profiles of IAPLTR retrotransposons in the brain, liver , and kidney of four 1-week-old mouse littemates using the developed technique, HT-TREBS.
