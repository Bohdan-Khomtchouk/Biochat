TITLE
Budding yeast Wapl controls sister chromatid cohesion maintenance and the chromosome condensation status [PK-ChIP]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Cohesin acetylation by Eco1 during DNA replication establishes sister chromatid cohesion. We show that acetylation makes cohesin resistant to Wapl activity from S-phase until mitosis. Wapl turns out to be a key regulator of cohesin dynamics on chromosomes by controling cohesin maintenance following its establishment in S-phase and its role in chromosome condensation.

DESIGN
The Affymetrix Saccharomyces cerevisiae Chip Tiling 1.0R Arrays were used to analyze the binding pattern of Scc1 along the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in late G1 and metaphase arrested cells.
