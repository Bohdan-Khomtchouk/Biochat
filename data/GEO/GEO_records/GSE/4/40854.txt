TITLE
Synchronization of flowering transition by the tomato TERMINATING FLOWER gene

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from late vegetative meristems of tomato mutant TERMINARING FLOWER as well as the wild type progenitor to see genome-wide expression changes affected by the mutation.

DESIGN
Meristems from multiple plants at the same developmental stages were collected for both mutants and wild types. The meristems were pooled together for mRNA extractions. Two biological replicates for each genotypes were prepared for mRNA extraction and sequencing library construction.
