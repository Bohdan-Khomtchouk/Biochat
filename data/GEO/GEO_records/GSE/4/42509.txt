TITLE
Transcriptome-profiling (RNA-seq) and Ribosome-profiling (Ribo-seq) in proliferation, quiescence, senescence and transformed states.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied in parallel RNA-Seq and Ribosome-profiling analyses to immortalized human primary BJ fibroblast cells under the following conditions: normal proliferation, quiescence (induced by serum depletion), senescence (induced by activation of the oncogenic RASG12V gene, and examined at early (5 days; pre-senescent state) and late (14 days; fully senescent state) time points), and neoplastic transformation (induced by RASG12V in the background of stable p53 and p16INK4A knockdowns and SV40 small-T expression.

DESIGN
RNA-seq, using Illumina HiSeq 2000, was applied to BJ cells under 5 conditions: proliferation, quiescence, pre-senescence, full-senescence, and transfomed. Ribosome profiling, using Illumina HiSeq 2000, was applied to BJ cells under 5 conditions: proliferation, quiescence, pre-senescence, full-senescence, and transfomed.
