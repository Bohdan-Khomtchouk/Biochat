TITLE
Relationship between Differential Hepatic microRNA Expression and Decreased Hepatic Cytochrome P450 3A Activity in Cirrhosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background and Aim: Liver cirrhosis is associated with decreased hepatic cytochrome  P4503A (CYP3A) activity but the pathogenesis of this phenomenon is not well  elucidated. In this study, we examined if certain microRNAs (miRNA) are associated  with decreased hepatic CYP3A activity in cirrhosis. Hepatic CYP3A activity and miRNA microarray expression profiles were  measured in cirrhotic (n=22) and normal (n=12) liver tissue. Hepatic CYP3A activity  was measured via midazolam hydroxylation in human liver microsomes. Additionally,  hepatic CYP3A4 protein concentration and the expression of CYP3A4 mRNA were  measured. Analyses were conducted to identify miRNAs which were differentially  expressed between two groups but also were significantly associated with lower  hepatic CYP3A activity.

DESIGN
Liver tissue was collected from individuals with established cirrhosis who were awaiting liver transplantation (n=22) at the time of their liver transplantation procedure in the operating room. Normal liver tissue (n=12) was obtained from patients undergoing liver resection for metastatic/benign liver lesions with no underlying chronic liver disease
