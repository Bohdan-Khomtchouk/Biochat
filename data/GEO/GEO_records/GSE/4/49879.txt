TITLE
Expression data from vegetative tissues of grain, sweet and bioenergy sorghums

ORGANISM
Sorghum bicolor

SUMMARY
We developed a commercially available whole-transcriptome sorghum microarray (Sorgh-WTa520972F) and generated this dataset to identify tissue and genotype-specific expression patterns for all identified Sorghum bicolor exons and UTRs. The genechip contains 1,026,373 probes covering 149,182 exons (27,577 genes) across the Sorghum bicolor nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes.  Specific probesets were also included for putative non-coding RNAs that may play a role in gene regulation (e.g., microRNAs), and confirmed functional small RNAs in related species (corn and sugarcane) were also included in our array design.
