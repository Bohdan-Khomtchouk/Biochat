TITLE
A framework for identification of actionable cancer genome dependencies in small cell lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed copy numbers of 60 SCLC cell lines using 6.0 SNP-arrays. For a subgroup of 36 cell lines, previously published copy number data was utilized. CEL and SEG files are included for all cell lines, for which copy number data were not publicly available.

DESIGN
DNA was extracted from SCLC cell lines and copy number data was generated for all samples
