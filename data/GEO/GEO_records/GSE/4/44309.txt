TITLE
Whole-genome landscape of histone H2AX and γ-H2AX along with related factors in activated cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX forms γ-H2AX, which serves as a marker of DNA repair response. Here we provide ChIP-seq-based maps of histone H2AX, γ-H2AX, H2AZ, INO80, SRCAP, and RNA polymerase II in activated T cells. Matched data for H2AX and γ-H2AX in resting T cells and Jurkat cancer T cells are available in GSE25577.

DESIGN
CD4+ T cells were stimulated in two different ways (IL-2 alone or IL-2 plus anti-CD3 and anti-CD28), and H2AX, γ-H2AX, H2AZ, INO80, and SRCAP profiles were examined by ChIP-seq
