TITLE
Macro histone variants preserve cell identity by preventing the gain of H3K4me2 during reprogramming

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription factor-induced reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency is a very inefficient process, probably due to the existence of important epigenetic barriers that are imposed during differentiation and that contribute to preserve cell identity. In an effort to decipher the molecular nature of these barriers, we followed a genome-wide approach, in which we identified macro histone variants (macroH2A) as highly expressed in human somatic cells but downregulated after reprogramming to pluripotency, as well as strongly induced during differentiation. Knock down of macro histone variants in human keratinocytes increased the efficiency of reprogramming to pluripotency, while overexpression had opposite effects. Genome-wide occupancy profiles show that in human keratinocytes macroH2A.1 preferentially occupies genes that are expressed at low levels and are marked with H3K27me3, including pluripotency-related genes and bivalent developmental regulators, at which its presence prevents the regain of H3K4me2 during reprogramming, over imposing an additional layer of repression that preserves cell identity.
