TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Ewing's sarcoma derived exosomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exosomes are small RNA and protein containing vesicles that can mediate hetero- and homotypic intercellular communication between normal and malignant cells. Especially, tumor-derived exosomes are believed to mediate reprogramming of the tumor-associated stroma to favor tumor growth and metastasis. In this study we isolated exosomes from three different Ewingâ€™s sarcoma (ES) cell lines by ultracentrifugation. Microarray analysis of ES-derived exosomes and their parental cells was performed to gain insight into the spectrum of transcripts they contain and the functions in which these transcripts might be involved in.

DESIGN
In total we analyzed six different samples consisting of three pairs of exosomal and cellular RNA of different Ewing's sarcoma cell lines.
