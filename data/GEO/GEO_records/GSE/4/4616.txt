TITLE
Time series of diabetes and exercise training induced expression changes in cardiac muscle of mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of diabetes, physical training, and their combination on the gene expression of cardiac muscle. Mice were divided to control (C), training (T), streptozotocin-induced diabetic (D), and diabetic training (DT) groups. Training groups performed 1, 3, or 5 weeks of endurance training on a motor-driven treadmill. Muscle samples from T and DT groups together with respective controls were collected 24 hours after the last training session. Gene expression of cardiac muscles were analyzed using Affymetrix Gene chip MG U74Av2 (Affymetrix , Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Keywords: time course
