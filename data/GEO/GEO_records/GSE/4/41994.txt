ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Fresh-frozen primary cancer specimens of 107 breast cancer patients whose metastases were treated with first-line aromatase inhibitors were evaluated for their whole genome mRNA expression profiles.

DESIGN
Primary breast tumors (107) were analyzed against a common breast cancer reference pool (BRP).
