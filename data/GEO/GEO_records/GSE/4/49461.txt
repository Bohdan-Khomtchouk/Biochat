TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for LGR5hi and LGR5lo ISCs in response to gamma-irradiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To check gene expression signatures for LGR5hi and LGR5lo ISCs in response to gamma-irradiation, we performed whole genome microarray on  LGR5hi and LGR5lo ISCs purified from irradiated mice or non-irradiated mice

DESIGN
Radiation induced gene expression in LGR5hi and LGR5lo ISCs of LGR5-GFPki mice was measured at 3 hours after exposure to 12Gy Î³-irradiation or non-irradiation.
