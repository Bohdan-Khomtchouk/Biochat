Gene Expression Profiles Predict Postpartum-onset Depression  Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression    Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify early predictive biomarkers for postpartum depression using peripheral blood gene expression profiles

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from peripheral blood collected in Tempus RNA tubes (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) at all three investigated time points for each woman in the discovery sample. RNA was isolated using the Versagene kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, U.S.A.), quantified using the Nanophotometer and quality checks were performed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer.
