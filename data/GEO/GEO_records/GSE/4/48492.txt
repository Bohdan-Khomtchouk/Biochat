TITLE
Effect of treatment for three months with chemical carcinogen and non-carcinogens on liver miRNAome

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Here, we examined the liver microRNA profile of male Fischer rats exposed through their diet to genotoxic (2-acetylaminofluorene) and epigenetic (phenobarbital, diethylhexylphthalate, methapyrilene HCL, monuron, and chlorendic acid) chemical hepatocarcinogens, as well as to non-hepatocarcinogenic treatments (benzophenone, and diethylthiourea) for three months. The aim of the study was to investigate how liver miRNA profiles relate to mode of action and carcinogenic potential of chemicals.

DESIGN
In total miRNA profiles from 38 liver samples were examined. These included 3-5 samples for animal fed control diets or diet supplemented with designated chemicals. For each chemical a carcinogenic or a maximum tolerated dose was chosen  based on published literature. The treatments were Diethylthiourea (DETU) 2500 ppm; Benzophenone (BP) 1250 ppm ; Monuron (MON) 1500 ppm ; Diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) 12000 ppm ; Phenobarbital (PB) 1000 ppm; Chlorendic acid (CA) 1250 ppm; Methapyrilene HCl (MP) 250 ppm; 2-Acetyl aminofluorene (2-AAF) 40 ppm.
