TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of dexamethasone-responsive gene expression in mouse triceps surae muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of dexamethasone-regulation of muscle mass at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that the presence of MuRF1 contributes to the extent of gene expression changes observed in specific sets of genes during a challenge leading to muscle atrophy. Results provide important information on the response of triceps surae muscle to synthetic glucocorticoid treatment, such as specific cell signaling and metabolic enzyme genes, that may be influenced by MuRF1 during atrophy.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated triceps surae muscle subjected to 3 or 14 days dexamethasone treatment compated to untreated littermate control muscles.
