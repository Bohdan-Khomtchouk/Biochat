TITLE
Expression analysis of MDA-MD-231 cells that express lysine racemase (lyr) when grown on D-Lysine versus L-Lysine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment aimed to investigate whether cells that express the L-Lysine-producing enzyme lyr exhibit any mRNA changes when grown on precursor D-Lysine relative to L-Lysine.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from lyr-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells after 3 days in culture with amino acid precursor D-Lysine, L-Lysine, or starved of both.
