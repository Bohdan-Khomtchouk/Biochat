TITLE
Expression data from pre-iPSCs with a control, histone methyltransferase or Cbx3 (HP1g) knockdown

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transition from  a partially reprogrammed pre-iPSC state to iPSC state can be achieved by modulating levels of histone modifying enzymes or proteins that can bind to histone modifications We used microarrays to determine the gene expression profile of pre-iPSCs depleted for either 3 histone methyltransferases together or the HP1gamma protein

DESIGN
pre-iPSCs were subjected to simultaneous siRNA mediated knockdown of Ehmt1, Ehmt2 and Setdb1- which is the 3XHMT sample  that mediate H3k9me2/me3 or Cbx3( HP1gamma) or control siRNA to luciferase
