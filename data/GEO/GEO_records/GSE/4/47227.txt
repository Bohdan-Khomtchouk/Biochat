TITLE
Gene expression timecourse: SoxN homozygous mutant embryos vs SoxN heterozygous mutant embryos.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Timecourse of gene expression changes in Drosophila SoxN homozygous mutant embryos compared with their heterozygous siblings, from stage 7 to 13 of embryonic development.

DESIGN
Five time points: stage 7-8, stage 9, stage 10, stage 11 and stage 12-13. Four biological replicates per time point. Two conditions: SoxN homoxygous vs SoxN heterozygous mutant embryos.
