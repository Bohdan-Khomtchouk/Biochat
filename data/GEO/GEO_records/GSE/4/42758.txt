TITLE
Expression data from wild type and ttk^twk mutant whole ovaries

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Epithelial tube  morphogenesis requires precise orchestration of cell signaling, shape, migration, and adhesion. Follicle cells in the Drosophila ovary form  epithelial tubes, the lumens of which act as molds for the eggshell respiratory filaments, or dorsal appendages (DAs).  The Tramtrack69 (TTK69) transcription factor controls DA lumen volume and shape by promoting tube expansion; the tramtrack mutation twin peaks (ttk^twk) reduces TTK69 levels late in oogenesis, inhibiting DA tube expansion. We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes in the ttk^twk mutant that are downstream of TTK69 and that play a functional role in DA tube expansion.

DESIGN
Ovaries were dissected from female flies at 36 hours of age, to maximize the proportion of developing egg chambers undergoing DA tube expansion.  Flies were raised at a constant temperature of 25C in the presence of wet yeast, to maximize the rate of egg chamber production.
