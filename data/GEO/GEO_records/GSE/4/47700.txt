TITLE
Expression data for hematopoietic stem cells (lin- sca1+ ckit+) isolated from the bone marrow of Ercc1-deficient and proficient littermates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify cellular and genetic abnormalities involved in interstrand cross link repair-deficient bone marrow failure and its transformation to leukemia, we used an Ercc1 hypomorphic mouse model (Ercc1 -/d). Gene expression profiling was done to determine which genes are differentially expressed

DESIGN
LSK cells from the bone marrow of ~20 week-old  Ercc1-deficient (one knockout allele and one truncated allele (d)) and wt littermates (at least one normal Ercc1 allele) were sorted by FACS. RNA was isolated and linearly amplified before hybridisation onto the array. Gene expression in Ercc1-deficient LSK cells was compared to that of wt littermates
