TITLE
Gene expression profiling of lung adenocarcinomas and normal lung tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US and worldwide. Understanding the global molecular profiles or transcriptome of lung cancers would strengthen our understanding of the biology of this malignancy. We performed gene expression profiling using the Human Gene 1.0 ST platform of 80 lung adenocarcinomas and 30 normal lung tissues to better understand the biology of this significant fraction of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs)

DESIGN
Lung adenocarcinomas were comrpised of never-smoker (n=40) and smoker (n=40) adenocarcinomas. Normal lung tissue (n=30) were paired to 30 of the never-smoker cases. Gene expression profiling was performed on the samples to identify differentially expressed profiles between lung adenocarcinomas and normal lung tissues.
