TITLE
Expression data from C33-A cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
C33-A is a Homo sapiens cervix carcinoma cell line. In this experiment we determine the level of gene expression under exponentially growing conditions. The final goal of the experiment is to correlate other epigenetic characteristics from other experiments with gene expression levels.

DESIGN
C33-A cells from three independent exponentially growing cultures were recovered and processed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
