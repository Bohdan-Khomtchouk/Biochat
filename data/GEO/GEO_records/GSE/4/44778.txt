TITLE
Lhx2-regulated genes in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-like cells differentiated from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We previously demonstrated that hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-like cells are robustly expanded from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by enforced expression of Lhx2, a LIM-homeobox domain (LIM-HD) transcription factor. Here we established an ES cell line which conditionally expressed Lhx2 by Tet-On system. The ES cells were differentiated into HSC-like cells by Lhx2 expression. Lhx2-regulated genes were identified by comparing the HSC-like cells with those cultured in the absence of Lhx2 expression.

DESIGN
Mouse ES with inducible Lhx2 were differentiated on OP9 stromal cells into hematopoietic lineage. On day 5 of the differentiation induction,Lhx2 expression was started by the addition of doxycycline (dox) and the cells were cultured on OP9 stromal cells in the presence of IL-6 and SCF. On day 20, HSC-like cells were harvested and re-seeded onto OP9 stromal cells in the absence of Lhx2 expression by dox-removal for 3 days. these cells were compared with the original HSC-like cells.
