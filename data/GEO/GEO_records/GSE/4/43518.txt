TITLE
Identification of genes regulated by L-lactate and by DL-lactate in Lactobacillus plantarum

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

SUMMARY
L. plantarum is known to possess an L-lactate inducible lactate racemase activity (Goffin et al. 2005. J. Bacteriol. 187:6750). In the present study, microarrays were used in order to identify all genes that are up-regulated by L-lactate, but not by a racemic mixture of D- and L-lactate.
