TITLE
Polysomes

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Translational profiles of wild type yeast strains were identified by microarray analysis by isolating polysomes using sucrose gradients to recover polysome-associated RNA and comparing polysome-associated RNA vs total RNA

DESIGN
Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments
