TITLE
Expression profiling in early onset colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Causative genes for autosomal dominantly inherited familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) have been well characterized. There is, however, another 10-15 % early onset colorectal cancer (CRC) whose genetic components are currently unknown.  In this study, we used DNA chip technology to systematically search for genes differentially expressed in early onset CRC. Keywords: disease state analysis
