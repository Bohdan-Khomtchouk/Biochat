TITLE
Transcript analyses of cisplatin and Sky1 effects in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Sky1 is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae rich serine-arginine (SR) protein-specific kinase and its enzymatic activity is essential in the cytotoxicity caused by cisplatin, although the molecular mechanisms supporting this function are not understood. We present a transcriptome analysis discriminating between RNA changes induced by cisplatin which are dependent or independent of the Sky1 function.
