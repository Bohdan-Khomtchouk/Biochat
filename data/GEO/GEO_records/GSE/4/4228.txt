Nitric Oxide Activation of Erk Regulates the Stability and Translation of mRNA Transcripts Containing CU-Rich Elements

SUMMARY
Nitric oxide (NO) can stabilize mRNA by activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Here, transcript stabilization by NO was investigated in human THP-1 cells using microarrays. After LPS pre-stimulation, cells were treated with actinomycin D and then exposed to NO without or with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190. The decay of 220 mRNAs was affected; most were stabilized by NO. Unexpectedly, SB202190 often enhanced rather than antagonized transcript stability. NO activated p38 MAPK and Erk1/2; SB202190 blocked p38 MAPK, but further activated Erk1/2. PCR confirmed that NO and SB202190 could additively stabilize mRNA, an effect abolished by Erk1/2 inhibition. In affected genes, these responses were associated with CU-rich elements (CURE) in 3' un-translated regions. NO stabilized the mRNA of a CURE-containing reporter gene, while repressing translation. Dominant-negative Mek1, an Erk1/2 inhibitor, abolished this effect. NO similarly stabilized, but blocked translation of MAP3K7IP2, a natural CURE-containing gene. NO increased hnRNP translocation to the cytoplasm and binding to CURE. Over-expression of hnRNP K, like NO, repressed translation of CURE-containing mRNA. These findings define a sequence-specific mechanism of NO-triggered gene regulation that stabilizes mRNA, but represses translation. Keywords: time course and dose response
