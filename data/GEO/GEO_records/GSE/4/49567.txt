TITLE
Gene expression profile of ATF6a and ATF6b overexpression in LS174T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further development of our mRNA expression approach to ER stress, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify ER stress-responsible genes. LS174T cells were overexpressed with ER stress mediators, ATF6a or ATF6b. Genes responsible for each mediator were extracted and categorized by Gene Ontology.

DESIGN
ATF6a and ATF6b were overexpressed in LS174T. Subsequently, cells were treated with 2 mM sodium butyrate, which induces LS174T cells to differentiate to mature goblet cells. Genes responsible for each mediator were extracted and categorized by Gene Ontology in GeneRanker program of Genomatix platform.
