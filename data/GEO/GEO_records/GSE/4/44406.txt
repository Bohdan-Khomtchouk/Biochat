TITLE
Srf is essential for mesodermal cell migration during elongation of the embryonic body axis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Timecourse analysis of SRF dependent genes in the nascent mesoderm of mouse embryos. Srf was conditionally deleted by a T::cre driver and the three embryonic stages analyzed represent embryos before onset of the phenotype (E8.5) and progressive appearance of the phenotype (E8.75 and E9.0).

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from dissected caudal ends of SRF(flex/flex); T:cre and control littermate embryos at three different stages.
