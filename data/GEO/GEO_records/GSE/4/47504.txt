TITLE
Gene expresssion changes in pancreatic islets of 11 weeks old IKK2-CApdx-1 mice compared to control and Pdx-1+/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Canonical IKK/NF-κB signaling is a master regulator of inflammation and innate immunity and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of T1D. To investigate the impact of NF-κB activation on β-cell homeostasis and diabetes development, we generated a transgenic gain-of-function mouse model allowing conditional NF-κB activation via expression of IKK2-CA  (constitutively active IKK2 allele) in β-cells using the tetracycline-regulated gene expression system. Pdx-1-tTA (knockin model generating Pdx-1 haploinsufficiency) driver mice were used for β-cell specific transgene expression. Double transgenic IKK2-CA-pdx-1 mice develop a full-blown immune-mediated diabetes.To identify gene expression changes underlying this diabetes development pancreatic islets of diabetic IKK2-CA-Pdx-1, PDX-1 +/- and control mice were prepared and isolated total RNA was used for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Pancreatic islets were isolated from 11 weeks old control (n=5), Pdx-1+/- (n=4) and  IKK2-CApdx-1 (n=5) mice, total RNA was extracted with RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). Microarray analyses were performed using 200 ng total RNA as starting material and 5.5 µg ssDNA per hybridization (GeneChip Fluidics Station 450; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The total RNAs were amplified and labeled following the Whole Transcript (WT) Sense Target Labeling Assay ( ). Labeled ssDNA was hybridized to Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Affymetrix GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The chips were scanned with a Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and subsequent images analyzed using Affymetrix® Expression Console Software (Affymetrix). Probe level data were obtained using the robust multichip average (RMA) normalization algorithm.
