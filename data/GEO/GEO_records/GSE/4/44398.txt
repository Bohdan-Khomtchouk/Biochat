TITLE
Analysis of Drosophila salivary glands and Kc cells with depleted levels of linker histone H1 [Affymetrix Expression]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Indicated cells were subjected to RNAi against linker histone H1, Nautilus (control), or GFP (control).  RNA was isolated and subjected to Affymetrix GeneChIP Drosophila Genome 2.0 arrays

DESIGN
RNA was compared from cells treated with RNAi against control (Nautilus in the case of salivary glands or GFP in the case of Kc cells) and linker histone H1.  Kc cells were treated once with RNAi and RNA was collected 6 days later.
