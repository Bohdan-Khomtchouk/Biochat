TITLE
Expression data from adult mouse ovaries exposed to cigarette smoke in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammalian females are born with a finite number of non-renewing primordial follicles, the majority of which remain in a quiescent state for many years. Due to their non-renewing nature, these “resting” oocytes are particularly vulnerable to xenobiotic insult, resulting in premature ovarian senescence and the formation of dysfunctional oocytes.  In this study we characterised the mechanisms behind cigarette smoke induced ovotoxicity, which is characterised by primordial follicle depletion. C57BL/6 5 week old female mice were exposed to cigarette smoke five times per week, for 12-18 weeks using a custom-designed and purpose-built nose-only, directed flow inhalation and smoke-exposure system. This was done in the hopes of gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms underpinning cigarette smoke induced ovotoxicity.

DESIGN
C57BL/6 5 week old female mice were exposed to cigarette smoke (twelve 3R4F reference cigarettes (University of Kentucky, USA) twice/day, 2.7 mg particulate matter) five times per week, for 12-18 weeks using a custom-designed and purpose-built nose-only, directed flow inhalation and smoke-exposure system. Their ovaries were then collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on an Illumina Sentrix Mouse ref-8 v2 Beadchip
