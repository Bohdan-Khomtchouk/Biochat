TITLE
Exon array expression profiling: DYRK1A acts as transcriptional activator

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of depletion of DYRK1A in HeLa cells Global gene expression profiling has shown upregulation of many genes in the context of DYRK1A depletion in HeLa cells. Many of these genes deregulated by DYRK1A are involved in immune response system.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis of siRNA against DYRK1A transfected in HeLa cells on GeneChipÂ® Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays (Affimetrix). Control HeLa cells have been transfected with the same concentration of siRNA non-targeting (siNT). Experiment has been done experimental triplicates.
