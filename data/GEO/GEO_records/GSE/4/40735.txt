TITLE
Regulation of Oxidative Stress Responses by the Arabidopsis Heat Shock Factor A4A

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Identification of target genes for the transcription factor HSFA4A  in Arabidopsis thaliana.

DESIGN
Two weeks-old Col-0 wild-type and transgenic plants overexpressing the HSFA4A transcription factor under the estradiol-inducible promoter lexA (HSFA4Aox2) were treated by 5ÂµM estradiol with or without 1mM H2O2 for 6h in liquid 0.5 MS medium and the isolated RNA samples were used for RNAseq analysis.
