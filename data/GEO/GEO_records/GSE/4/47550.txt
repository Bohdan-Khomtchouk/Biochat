TITLE
mRNA expression data from whole trachea dissected from either wild-type mice or Scnn1b-Tg mice at post-natal days 0, 3, 10, and 42

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Scnn1b-Tg mice overexpress the beta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (Scnn1b) in airway Club cells.  The general phenotype of these mice is described in three published manuscripts (Mall et al. 2004, Nature Medicine, 10(5):487-93;  Mall et al. 2008, Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 177(7):730-42; Livraghi-Butrico et al. 2012, Physiol. Genomics 44(8):470-84; and Livraghi-Butrico et al. 2012, Mucosal Immunology 5(4):397-408). Briefly, overexpression of the Scnn1b transgene in airway Club cells leads to hyperabsorption of sodium from the airway surface liquid, which causes airway surface liquid and mucus dehydration, resulting in reduced mucus clearance and airway mucus obstruction.  The data provided here represents mRNA expression data from dissected whole trachea (distal and proximal ends were cut 3-4 cartilage rings below the larynx and just above the bifurcation, respectively) from male WT and Scnn1b-Tg littermates (C57Bl/6N Tac background) at 4 time points [postnatal days (PND) 0, 3, 10, and 42].  Histologically, PND 0 trachea are normal, a tracheal mucus plug/obstruction develops around PND 3 and typically recedes to the intrapulmonary airways after PND 10, and the trachea is again histologically normal by PND 42.  The data from the WT mice provides a global look at mRNA post-natal developmental changes, while the data from the Scnn1b-Tg line provides mRNA data that allows differential gene expression due to airway mucus obstruction to be queried. The data presented for the trachea is part of a larger body of work evaluating gene expression in whole lung, trachea, and purified macrophages.

DESIGN
24 Total tracheal samples were analyzed;  three from each timepoint.  In our manuscript, we were most interested in changes between WT and Scnn1b-Tg mice, however, the data can also be used to evaluate changes in gene expression across time (PND 0, 3, 10, and 42).  It should be noted that a significant difference in RNA expression quality parameters was noted for the 10 day trachea data.
