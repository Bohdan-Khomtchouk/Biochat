TITLE
Profiling gene expression of ETV2-induced vascular endothelial cells (ETVECs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ETV2 induces expression of endothelial-specific genes in primary human adult skin fibroblasts (HAFs) Human unbillical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are used as a control

DESIGN
32 days after ETV2 induction into HAFs, cells are recognized as ETVECs. ETVECs were created from three independent skin donor. Each number of ETVEC is correspond to the number of HAF.
