TITLE
Transcriptome-wide analyses of CstF64-RNA interactions in global regulation of mRNA alternative polyadenylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We mapped CstF64-RNA interactions at the transcriptome level and studied CstF64-mediated regulation of global mRNA alternative polyadenylation by using iCLIP-seq and direct RNA sequencing analyses.

DESIGN
CstF64 iCLIP-seq in HeLa cells;  direct RNA sequencing (DRS) of control HeLa cells, CstF64-RNAi cells and CstF64 & CstF64tau-RNAi cells
