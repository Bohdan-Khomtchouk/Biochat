TITLE
Whole-genome expression data from normal FVB mouse lung tissue, transgenic cyclin E overexpressing (CEO) normal mouse lung tissue, and transgenic CEO lung adenocarcinomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FVB mice were engineered to express wild-type human cyclin E under control of the human surfactant C promoter (CEO mice; Ma et al, PNAS 2007).  These mice develop spontaneous lung tumors, which were shown to be adenocarcinoma by histological analysis.  Here we compare whole-genome RNA expression levels between the tumors and normal lung of 4 CEO mice as well as 4 nontransgenic animals.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from the lungs of 4 FVB mice and adjacent normal and tumor tissue from 4 FVB transgenes harboring human surfactant protein C- driven wild-type human cyclin E, all 7-11 months in age.  These samples were divided into 3 groups of four, and  12 independent hybridizations were performed for analysis with Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse 430 2.0 arrays.
