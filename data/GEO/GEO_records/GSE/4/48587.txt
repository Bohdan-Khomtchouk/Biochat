TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and an isogenic HCN negative mutant (PAO6344), grown under cyanogenic conditions.

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces the toxic secondary metabolite hydrogen cyanide (HCN) at high cell population densities and low aeration. We have used Affimetrix microarrays to investigate the impact of HCN as a signal in cell-cell communication by comparing the transcriptome of the wild-type strain PAO1 to that of an HCN-negative mutant (PAO6344) under cyanogenic conditions.
