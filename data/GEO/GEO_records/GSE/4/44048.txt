TITLE
Human glioma cell line T98G: BAP-PCBP2 RIP vs. BAP-GFP RIP (Control)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RIP-Chip analysis of PCBP2 and identification of preferentially associated mRNAs. T98G cells were transfected transiently with BAP-tagged constructs. BAP-tagged proteins were biotinylated in vivo by the co-transfected hBirA enzyme. RNPs were recovered via precipitation with Steptavidin-sepharose beads. Finally, RNAs were purified and analyzed on microarrays. BAP-GFP as control was used in three independent sets of experiments.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, BAP-PCBP2 vs. BAP-GFP cells. Biological replicates: 3 BAP-PCBP2 replicates, 3 BAP-GFP (Control) replicates
