TITLE
miR-106a-5p inhibits the proliferation and migration of astrocytoma cells and promotes apoptosis by targeting FASTK

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA microarray experiments were performed to measure global mRNA expression in the presence of increased or decreased miR-106a-5p levels to to identify the total transcripts regulated by miR-106a-5p directly or indirectly. FASTK was identified as a direct target gene of miR-106a-5p.

DESIGN
In order to identify the total transcripts regulated by miR-106a-5p directly or indirectly, we first measured the global mRNA expression change through mRNA microarray by overexpressing or knocking down miR-106a-5p in cancer cells. Next, we combined bioinformatics programs to select candidate miR-106a-5p targets from the differentially regulated genes to refine the number of miR-106a-5p targets. Then we validated the miR-106a-5p target gene through western blot analysis, quantitative real-time PCR and luciferase reporter assay.
