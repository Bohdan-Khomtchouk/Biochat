TITLE
Global Gene expression data from Mycobacterium tuberculosis treated with new TB drug named Bedaquiline

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Sirturo or Bedaquiline has been shown to inhibit the ATP synthase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We used microarrays to investigate compound-induced gene expression changes in general as well as effects on the transcription of the different ATP synthase genes and other metabolic pathways.

DESIGN
Log phase Mycobacterium tuberculosis were cultivated in Middlebrook 7H9 broth and treated with 1 ÂµM Bedaquiline. We have extracted RNA from five different time-points after treatment: 0 min (T0), 30 min (T30), 60 min (T60), 180 min (T180) and 360 min (T360).
