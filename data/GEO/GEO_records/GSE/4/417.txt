TITLE
Kc167_RNA_Quant_Eval

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Three different amounts, 20 ug (GSM6155), 40 ug (GSM6157) and 80ug (GSM6158), of total Kc167 RNA were used in homotypic labelings to determine the optimal amount of RNA necesary to produce the most useable data using the CDMC_Drosophila_7k2 array.  See Neal et al. 2003 for results and discussion. Keywords = Kc167 Keywords = Drosophila Keywords = RNA amount Keywords: other
