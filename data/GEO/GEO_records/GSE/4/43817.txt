TITLE
Human HEK 293T cells transfected with pEGFP-survivin gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human embryonic kidney 293 cells comparing transfected control pEGFP-C1 (empty vector) with pEGFP (survivin vector).

DESIGN
One condition experiment; survivin transfected cell as test sample vs empty vector transfected cell as reference; one dye swap replicate
