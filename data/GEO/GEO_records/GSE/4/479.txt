TITLE
Alveolar septation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Mg-delta strain of fibrillin-1 deficient mice display an early defect in alveolar septation.  This study attempts to identify expression patterns in the mutant mouse lung compared to their wild-type littermates that suggest pathways that are critical for normal septation.  This experiment focuses on postnatal days 1 and 5.  Other time points will be added at a later date. Keywords: other
