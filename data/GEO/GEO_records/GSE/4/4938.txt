TITLE
murine CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells from wildtype and Gfi knockout cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
to compare the transcriptomes of na√Øve CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells from Gfi1-knockout cells with wildtype cells, spleenocytes  from wildtype and Gfi-knockout C57Bl/6 mice were isolated, stained with CD44, CD4 and CD8 antibodies and separated by using a FACS Diva (Becton Dickinson). Total RNAs isolated from 2 mice each (approximately 2xE06 cells) were pooled and subjected to microarray analysis on Affymetrix MOE430A_2.0 arrays Keywords: knockout mice
