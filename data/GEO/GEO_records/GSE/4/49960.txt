TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of annotated coding genes and sORF under elevated CO2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
There are seedling samples (high CO2 exposure of 0h, 2h, 6h, 12h, 1d, 3d, 7d, 14d) with duplicates in two chambers.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis WT (Col-0) seeds were plated on Murashige and Skoog plates and placed at 4°C in darkness for at least 2 d to synchronize germination. Plants were grown at 22C under long-day conditions (16-h light and 8-h dark) in two atmospheric CO2 environments: ambient (CO2: 390 μmol mol–1) or elevated (CO2: 780 μmol mol–1). Plants were grown in ambient atmospheric CO2 concentration and then exposed to elevated CO2 for 0 h, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, 1 d, 3 d, 7 d and 14 d. 14-d-old seedlings were sampled at the same time. Treatments for elevated CO2 were carried out two times using two different chambers. Duplicate samples were collected from each chamber experiment. Totally, four biologically replicates were prepared in each condition.
