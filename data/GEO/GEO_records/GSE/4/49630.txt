TITLE
miRNA expression data from saliva, blood, semen and vaginal swap

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Body-fluid specific marker provide important information for crime scene, but some marker such as mRNA and protein can provide wrong information because cross-reaction. We used microarrays to identify body-fluid specific miRNA marker for forensic use.
