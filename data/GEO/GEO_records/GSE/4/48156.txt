TITLE
Global transcriptome analysis of orange wheat blossom midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana (Gehin) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) to identify candidate transcripts regulating diapause

ORGANISM
Sitodiplosis mosellana

SUMMARY
Many insects enter a developmental arrest (diapause) that allows them to survive harsh seasonal conditions. Despite the well-established ecological significance of diapause, the molecular basis of this crucial adaptation remains largely unresolved. Sitodiplosis mosellana (Gehin), the orange wheat blossom midge (OWBM), causes serious damage to wheat throughout the northern hemisphere, and sporadic outbreaks occur in the world. Traits related to diapause appear to be important factors contributing to their rapid spread and outbreak. To better understand the diapause mechanisms of OWBM, we sequenced the transcriptome and determined the gene expression profile of this species.

DESIGN
Examination of  different gene expression in DOL and NDOL Total RNA was extracted separately from DOL and NDOL using Trizol Reagent following manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 10μg RNA from each sample was used to construct individual DGE libraries. mRNA was isolated as described under cDNA library construction. The cDNA fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and enriched by PCR amplification. Each library had an insert size of 200 bp, and 42 - 50 bp sequences were generated by Illumina HiSeq 2000 in a single run using paired-end technology. SRA Study SRP019201.
