TITLE
Comparison of nucleotide-resolution, genome-wide transcriptome maps of Escherichia coli K12 strain BW25113 and Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) strain M145.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
This data contained within this entry was produced as part of a study that included differential RNA-sequencing.

DESIGN
S. coelicolor and E. coli reference strains were grown in batch culture with shaking. The E. coli sample was extracted during mid-exponential growth, while the S. coelicolor sample was extracted at the start of pigmented antibiotic production.
