TITLE
Methylation analysis of normal and adenocarcinoma lung tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and adenocarcinoma lung tissues. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in lung adenocarcinoma samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNAs from the 88 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
