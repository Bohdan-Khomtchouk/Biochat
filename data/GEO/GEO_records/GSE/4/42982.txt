TITLE
Preliminaly gene transcriptional profiling of the oesophageal gland of male S. mansoni

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
This study provides a transcriptomic analysis of the oesophageal gland of S. mansoni male. The results obtained will help direct future research on the functional aspects of this  tissue, and will allow the characterisation of currently unannotated genes in S. mansoni

DESIGN
Quantification of gene expression of S. mansoni male oesophageal gland was achieved by a combination of laser microdissection microscopy (LMM) and oligonucleotide microarray analysis. We compared the gene expression profile of the adult male oesophageal glands with whole male worm controls.
