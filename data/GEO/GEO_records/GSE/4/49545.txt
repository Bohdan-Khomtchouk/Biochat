TITLE
Regulation of onco and tumor suppressor miRNA by mTORC1 inhibitor PRP-1 in human chondrosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was comparative analysis of differentially expressed miRNA and their targets in human chondrosarcoma JJ012 not treated (Control)  and JJ012 chondrosarcoma cell line treated with  antitumorigenic neuropeptide PRP-1. The goal was to  elucidate the major signal transduction pathways deregulation in sarcomagenesis. Total RNA extraction was followed by the analysis of RNA quality and integrity, Exiqon human miRNA panel of 743 unique miRNA assays,was performed. performed.211 unique gene targets were detected for downregulated miRNAs and 104 unique target genes for upregulated miRNAs with 28 target genes  common for both. out of 122 upregulated and 109 downregulated , total 9 differentially statistically significant miRNAs(3 upregulated and 6 downregulated) fitting P < 0.05 by Benjamini Hochberg  were detected   when comparing chondrosarcoma cell line  treted to not treated control  using human Exiqon arrays with biological triplicates.: miR192, regulating cell cycle checkpoinrts   was upregulated in treated samples 4 fold, miR125b, known as tumor suppressor in sarcomas was upregulated 4.87 fold. miR20a was upregulated 5.29 , known to form  complexes with Argonaute proteins-part of  RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) Downregulated miRNas included miR509-3p (12.88 fold), its targets Yap, Rac1 and Yes1 known to be associated with Src kinase activity; miR589 was downregulated 7.46 fold , targets Src adaptors'. miR 302c was downregulated6.46 fold  and miR199a=5p -5.66 fold , that acted as oncogenes in sarcomas. miR584 involved on cell migration  and TGFbeta signaling was downregulated 4.78 fold

DESIGN
Comparison of miRNA expression between control   samples and samples treated with antiproliferative cytostatic mTORC1 inhibitor PRP-1  cytokine  in human chondrosarcoma  JJ012 cell line
