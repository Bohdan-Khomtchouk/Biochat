TITLE
Expression of genes in the spleen of WT and MUC1.Tg mice immunized with dendritic cells loaded with MUC1 peptide

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Goal of study: To determine differentially expressed genes with potential roles in tolerance and immunity in MUC1-immunized WT and MUC1.Tg mice

DESIGN
WT (C57Bl/6) and MUC1.Tg mice were immunized (i.v.) with dendritic cells loaded with sythetic, human MUC1 peptide. At 24h and 72h splenic RNA from vaccination groups (n=3) was pooled and microarray performed.
