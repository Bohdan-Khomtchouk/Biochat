TITLE
H3K27ac and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq in Oryzias latipes

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Here we analyze key epigenetic marks from medaka (O. latipes) during the vertebrate phylotypic period (stage 24).

DESIGN
Chromatin immuno-precipitation with histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation and histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation antibodies.
