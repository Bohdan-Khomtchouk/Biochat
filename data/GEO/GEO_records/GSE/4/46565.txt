TITLE
Contribution of CBX4 to cumulus oophorus cell phenotype in mice, and attendant effects in cumulus cell cloned embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cumulus oophorus cells play an essential role in oocyte development. CBX4 is a member of the Polycomb complex, which plays a role in regulating cellular differentiation.

DESIGN
We used siRNA mediated knockdown of Cbx4 expression followed by Affymetrix array analysis to evaluate the role of CBX4 in cumulus cell differentiated state.
