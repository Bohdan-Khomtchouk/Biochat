TITLE
Functional Changes of HepG2 cells by VECELL 3-D Culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
VECELL 3-D insert is newly developed culture scaffold with collagen-coated ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene) mesh. Effects of VECELL 3-D insert on the functionalities of HepG2, human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, were analyzed.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were cultured either on normal cell culture plate (n=3) or on VECELL (n=3) for three days and total RNA were extracted. aRNA were obtained from each RNA and hybridized to HG U133A chip in duplicate.
