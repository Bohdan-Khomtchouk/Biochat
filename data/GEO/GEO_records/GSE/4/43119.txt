TITLE
The enhancer and promoter landscape of human regulatory and conventional T cell subpopulations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ human regulatory T cells (Treg) are essential for self-tolerance and immune homeostasis. Here, we generated genome-wide maps of poised and active enhancer elements marked by histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation for CD4+CD25highCD45RA+ naive and CD4+CD25highCD45RA- memory Treg and their CD25- conventional T cell (Tconv) counterparts after in vitro expansion . In addition we generated genome-wide maps of the transcription factors STAT5, FOXP3, RUNX1 and ETS1 in expanded  CD4+CD25highCD45RA+ Treg- and CD4+CD25- Tconv to elucidate their role in cell type-specific gene regulation.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of 2 histone marks and transcription factors ETS1, STAT5, FOXP3 and RUNX1 in expanded T cell subpopulations
