TITLE
Genome-wide Profiling of FOXA2 and POL2 binding in the mouse uterus [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) is a critical regulator of endometrial gland development in mice. In the adult mouse uterus, FOXA2 is expressed solely in the GE cells of the endometrium. Conditional deletion of Foxa2 after birth in the uterus, using the progesterone receptor Cre mouse (PgrCre), impeded gland development, thereby rendering the adult mouse infertile due to defects in blastocyst implantation stemming from a lack of endometrial glands and their secretions. As a first step to begin understanding the FOXA2 function in the endometrial glands of the uterus, genome-wide investigation of in vivo FOXA2 and RNA polymerase II (POL2) binding target regions in the neonatal and adult uterus was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq).

DESIGN
In order to determine the transcriptional regulatory networks mediating FOXA2 regulation of endometrial gland development and function, chromatin immunoprecipitation and massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) was used to create a genome-wide profile of in vivo FOXA2-binding sites in the developing (PD 12) and adult (DOPP 2.5 and 3.5) mouse uterus.
