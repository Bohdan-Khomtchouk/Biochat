TITLE
Discovery of the p53 targetome in MCF7 cells from ChIP-Seq data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq and ChIP-seq on MCF-7 breast cancer cell line upon activation of p53 by the non-genotoxic small molecule Nutlin-3a

DESIGN
ChIP-seq on p53 in MCF7 with Nutlin-3a stimulation (S) in triplicate, and the control (input), in stimulated and non stimulated, using illumina HiSeq 2000
