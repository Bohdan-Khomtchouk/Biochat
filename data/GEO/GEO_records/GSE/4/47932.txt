TITLE
Epigenetic Reprogramming Modulates Malignant Properties of Human Liver Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reversal of DNA hypermethylation and associated gene silencing is  an emerging cancer therapy approach. In this context we have addressed the  impact of epigenetic alterations and local microenvironment on the  functional and transcriptional reprogramming of hepatic cancer stem cells. (CSCs) using the DNMT1 inhibitor Zebularine (ZEB). We show for the first  time that cellular context is a critical determinant in the response to  DNMT1 inhibition resulting in either a long term epigenetically driven  malignant reprogramming or an effective antitumor therapeutic  reprogramming. Furthermore, permanent reduction of DNMT1 protein level  renders the HCC cell lines insensitive to both DNMT1 inhibition and  cellular context. These results emphasize the importance of decoding the mechanisms involved in therapeutic application of DNA demethylating agents.

DESIGN
Huh7 and PLC treated with ZEB, and Huh7 depleted for DNMT1
