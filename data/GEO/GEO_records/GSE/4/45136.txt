TITLE
Identification of the chemokine CCL28 as a growth and survival factor for human hematopoietic stem- and progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To discover novel growth factors for hematopoietic stem- and progenitor cells (HSPCs), we have assessed cytokine responses of cord blood (CB)-derived CD34+ cells in a high-content growth factor screen. We identify the immunoregulatory chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 28 (CCL28) as a novel growth factor that directly stimulates proliferation of primitive hematopoietic cells from different ontogenetic origins. Microarrays are used to compare the expression profiles of HSPCs expanded in SCF, TPO and CCL28 respectively.

DESIGN
HSPCs were cultured in Serum-Free Expansion Medium with SCF, SCF + TPO, and SCF + CCL28 respectively, and hybridised microarrays in triplicate.
