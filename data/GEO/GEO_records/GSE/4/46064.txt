TITLE
Epigenetic treatment of B-cell lymphoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used DNA microarray technology to assess changes in gene expression after treatment of 11 lymphoma cell lines with epigenetic drugs. We identified genes with upregulated expression in treated cell lines and with downregulated expression in B-cell lymphoma patient samples when compared to normal B cells.

DESIGN
Assess changes in gene expression after treatment of 11 lymphoma cell lines with epigenetic drugs (aza and TSA).
