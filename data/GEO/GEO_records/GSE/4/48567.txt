TITLE
Expression data of A224 cell with ectopic overexpression of FGF18 and RFP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have identified the overexpression of FGF18 as an independent predictive marker for poor clinical outcome in patients with advanced stage, high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Functional studies have demonstrated that FGF18 promotes migration, invasion and tumorigenicity of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. To identify the FGF18 responsive genes contributing its biologic effects on ovarian tumorigenesis, we performed gene expression profiling in ovarian cancer cell line A224 with ectopic overexpression of FGF18 or RFP (as control).

DESIGN
Microarrays were completed using total genomic DNA free RNA extracted from three independent paired cultures of A224 cells overexpressing FGF18 or RFP.
