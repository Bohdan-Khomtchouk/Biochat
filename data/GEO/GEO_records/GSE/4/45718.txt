TITLE
Expression data from early and late vegetative stages from rice hybrid and its parents

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Heterosis is a complex phenomenon governed by many phenotypes in combination. In comparative account of the different stages a better understanding regulating this phenomenon in terms of gene action can be ascertained. We used microarrays to ascertained the kind and extent of gene actions in the different developmental stages to reach to the conclusion of contribution of different mode of gene actions.
