TITLE
Molecular Profiling of glucokinase-expressing cells from mouse hypothalamus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of genes from glucokinase-expressing cells following immunoprecipitation of hypothalamic EGFP-tagged L10 ribosomal protein from Glucokinase-cre/Elongation factor 1 alpha 1 - lox stop lox - EGFPL10 mice

DESIGN
mRNA obtained by immunoprecipitation in adult Gck-cre/EF1A1-LSL-EGFPL10 mice
