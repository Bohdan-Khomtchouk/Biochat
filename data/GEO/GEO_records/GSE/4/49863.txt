TITLE
Gene expression profile of p16-induced senescence in normal human diploid fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of p16-induced senescent human diploid fibroblasts compared with proliferating cells.

DESIGN
TIG-3 ER-p16 cells (primary normal human diploid fibroblasts expressing a 4-hydroxytamoxifen(4-OHT) regulatable form of human p16) were cultured for 7 days  with or without 4-OHT. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent and were analyzed using the hum
