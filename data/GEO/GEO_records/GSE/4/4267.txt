TITLE
P46DR (dark reared) mouse non-deprived vs. deprived visual cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild-type (C57Bl6) mice were dark reared from birth to P42, then underwent monocular enucleation at P42. They were then placed in a normal light-dark environment for 4 days, after which they were sacrificed (at P46). Visual cortex was dissected from 1-mm thick coronal sections, and total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using Trizol (Gibco-BRL). Keywords: repeat
