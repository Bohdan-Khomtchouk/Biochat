TITLE
MiRNA expression profiling in human medullary thyroid carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aims to investigate the microRNA profile in human medullary carcinoma tissue by microarray analysis and RT-qPCR. Matched tumor and adjacent normal tissue were obtained from 24 patients and analysed using human microRNA Microarray Kit Agilent, Differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by RT-qPCR using 37 other tumors samples (validation set), Associations of microRNA expression with clinicopathological items were studied

DESIGN
Matched tumor and adjacent normal frozen tissues were obtained from thyroid of 40 patients. Normal tissue (name with suffix S) and lesionnal tissue (name with suffix L) were hybridized on microarray.
