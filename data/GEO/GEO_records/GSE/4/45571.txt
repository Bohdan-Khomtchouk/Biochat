TITLE
JA-inducible genes in the wild-type rice leaves.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Jasmonates is inductively produced as a major plant hormone responsible for defense reactions in plants against both biotic and abiotic stresses, such as pathogen infection and mechanical wounding.  We identified JA-inducible genes in the wild-type rice leaves 0 - 4 h after JA treatment using 44k microarray.

DESIGN
Expression profiling in the wild-type rice leaves treated with jasmonic acid for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h was compared with that in the untreated wild-type rice leaves using two-color method with three biological replicates.
