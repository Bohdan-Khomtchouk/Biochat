TITLE
Argonautes promote male fertility and provide a paternal memory of germline gene expression in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
During each life cycle germ cells preserve and pass on both genetic and epigenetic information. In C. elegans, the ALG-3/4 Argonaute (AGO) proteins and their small-RNA cofactors are expressed during male gametogenesis and promote male fertility. Here we show that the CSR-1 AGO functions with ALG-3/4 to positively regulate target genes required for spermiogenesis. Our findings suggest that ALG-3/4 functions during spermatogenesis to amplify a small-RNA signal that represents an epigenetic memory of male-specific gene expression, while CSR-1, which is abundant in mature sperm, transmits this memory to offspring.  Surprisingly, in addition to small RNAs targeting male-specific genes, we show that males also harbor an extensive repertoire of CSR-1 small RNAs targeting oogenesis-specific mRNAs. Together these findings suggest that C. elegans sperm transmit not only the genome but also epigenetic binary signals in the form of Argonaute/small-RNA complexes that constitute a memory of which genes were active in preceding generations.

DESIGN
Examine small RNA changes in WT and alg-3/4 mutant males cultured at 20°C and 25°C, as well as determine the small RNAs enriched in a FLAG::CSR-1 IP from male worms grown at 25°C.  mRNA sequencing was also performed to determine how transcripts targeted by small RNAs change in mutant background at 20°C and 25°C.
