TITLE
Characteristic molecular and proteomic signatures of drug-induced liver injury in a rat model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
we assessed characteristic molecular and proteomic signatures in rat liver treated with drugs (pyrazinamide, ranitidine, enalapril, carbamazepine, and chlorpromazine) that are known to cause DILI in humans.

DESIGN
In the present study, we assessed the characteristic gene expression signature for DILI in a rat model. Rats were administered representative drugs that are already known to induce DILI in humans and transcriptomic changes in rat liver were analyzed. The representative drugs, which induce three types (hepatocellular, mixed, and cholestatic) of DILI, that were used in this study were pyrazinamide (PZA, 150~1500 mg/kg), ranitidine (RAN, 209.5~2095 mg/kg), enalapril (ENA, 148.65~1486.5 mg/kg), carbamazepine (CBZ, 97.85~978.5 mg/kg), and chlorpromazine (CPZ, 7.1~71 mg/kg).
