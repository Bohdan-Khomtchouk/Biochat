TITLE
PML regulates NF-κB transcriptional activity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor NF-κB is the master regulator of the immune response but also regulates gene expression to influences cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. Inducible site-specific phosphorylation of NF-κB is critical for its activity and appears to be important in gene specific transcriptional control. Promyelocytic Leukemia (PML) is a nuclear protein that forms sub-nuclear structures termed nuclear bodies associated with transcriptionally active genomic regions. We demonstrate that PML promotes NF-κB- induced transcriptional responses by promoting the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 at key regulatory sites. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for PML in promoting NF-κB transcriptional activity through signal induced post-translational modifications.

DESIGN
WT and PML-/- MEFs were analysed for gene expression analysis. Total of 12 samples, inlcluding triplicates were utilized. WT MEFs and PML-/- were stimulated with TNFα for three hours and analysed for gene expresison using unstimulated WT MEFs as control.
