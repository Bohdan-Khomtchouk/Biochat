TITLE
Permanganate ChIP-seq analysis of Pol II in nonheat shocked and heat shocked Drosophila S2R+ cells and nonheat shocked BG3 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The genomic distribution of transcriptionally engaged Pol II in control and heat shocked cells was determined by combining formaldehyde crosslinking and permanganate oxidation of transcription bubbles

DESIGN
Cells treated in succession with formaldehyde and then permanganate, were subjected to chromatin precipitation with Rpb3 antibody, and then the pattern of permanganate modifications were mapped genome-wide
