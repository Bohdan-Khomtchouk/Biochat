TITLE
Sex-specific gene expression in the human left ventricle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study cDNA microarrays were used to identify genes with sex-biased expression in the human left ventricle of two age classes ( < 40 years and 50-65 years of age). Keywords: cDNA microarray hybridization, sex-specific expression
