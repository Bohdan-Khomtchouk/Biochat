TITLE
Analysis of gene content among Group II Clostridium botulinum strains

ORGANISM
Clostridium botulinum

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to compare the gene content of several group II C. botulinum strains to determine the utility of DNA microarrays for subtyping this organism. Group II type B, E, and F C. botulinum strains were compared in a study to examine the gene content of a unique type E strain (CDC66177).

DESIGN
One replicate of genomic DNA isolated from 16 type E strains, 4 type B strains, and 2 type F strains were examined.
