TITLE
In the livers of rats treated with thioacetamide for 28 days

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To clarify the regulatory molecular mechanisms behind cell cycle aberrations related to the early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis. We investigated the early stage of hepatocarcinogenesis using global expression analyses.

DESIGN
Livers from rats treated with thioacetamide were subjected to microarray analysis. Results were compared with livers from rats untreated controls (n = 4 animals/group).
