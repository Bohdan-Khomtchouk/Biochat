TITLE
ChIP-chip of 6 chromatin marks (FAIRE, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3R17me2, H3AZAce) in breast cancer cell line MCF7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Altered gene expression patterns in human diseases reflect perturbations in the transcriptional networks that regulate cellular state. In breast cancer, Nuclear Receptors (NRs) play a prominent role in governing gene expression. NRs have prognostic utility and are therapeutically important targets. Here we describe a complete regulatory map for twenty-four NR proteins that are expressed in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, as well as fourteen additional breast cancer associated transcription factors (TFs) and six key chromatin state markers.

DESIGN
Input DNA was used as control against all 6 Chromatin ChIPchip samples grown in complete medium. All samples are done in triplicates.
