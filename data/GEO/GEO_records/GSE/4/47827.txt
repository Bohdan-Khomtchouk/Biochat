TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profile of muscle samples from growth promoters-treated and control cows.

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
A bovine oligo microarray platform (GPL7053) was used to evidence differences in gene expression profiles from twenty-four (24) muscle samples from growth promoters-treated cows and thirteen (13) from control animals. Two-factor ANOVA was performed using age and treatment as independent categorical variables and 958, 2695 and 2482 genes were found significantly regulated by the treatment for Finaplix, Revalor and Revalor plus dexamethasone, respectively.

DESIGN
In this study, we analyzed thirty-seven (37) bovine biceps brachii samples, twenty-four (24) from growth promoters treated cows and thirteen (13) from control animals. Gene expression profiling was performed using the Agilent-015354 Bos taurus Oligo Microarray platform (GPL7053) based on single-colour detection (Cyanine-3 only). Microarrays were scanned with Agilent scanner G2565BA (barcode on the left, DNA on the back surface, scanned through the glass) at a resolution of 5 microns; all slides were scanned twice at two different sensitivity settings (XDRHi 100% and XDRLo 10%); the scanner software created a unique ID for each pair of XDR scans and saved it to both scan image files. Feature Extraction (FE) 9.5 used XDR ID to link the pairs of scans together automatically when extracting data. The signal left after all the FE processing steps have been completed is ProcessedSignal that contains the Multiplicatively Detrended, Background-Subtracted Signal.
