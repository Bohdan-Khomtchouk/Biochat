TITLE
microRNA (miRNA) expression data from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons exposed to VX

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Chemical warfare nerve agents (CWNA) are potent cholinesterase inhibitors that may also have non-cholinesterase effects. Several in vivo studies have shown that exposure to CWNA compounds induces damage in the brain and heart. Underlying mechanisms of this damage are a critical area of research for the development of medical countermeasures. This study utilized microRNA (miRNA) analysis to evaluate potential direct cellular effects of the nerve agent VX (o-ethyl-s-[2 (diisopropylamino) ethyl] methylphosphonothiolate) on human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons
