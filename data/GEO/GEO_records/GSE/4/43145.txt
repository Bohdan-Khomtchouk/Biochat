TITLE
Expression data of mouse gastric tumors (TNF KO-Gan and BALB/c-Gan mice )

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gan mice express Wnt1, Ptgs2, and Ptges, which develop inflammation-associated gastric tumors (Oshima et al, Gastroenterology 131: 1086, 2006).  We examined the role of TNF-alpha in tumorigenesis by construction of TNF-/- Gan mice.  We also examined genetic background difference in tumor phenotype by changing Gan mouse background from C57BL/6(B6) to BALB/c. Microarray analyses were performed to examine changes of expression profiles in tumors by TNF gene disruption or by changing genetic background.

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from B6 Gan mice (n=3: Gan1-Gan3), B6-Gan TNF-/- mice (n=3: Gan(TNF KO)1-Gan(TNF KO)3), BALB-Gan mice (n=3: Gan(BALB/c)1-Gan(BALB/c)3), and wid-type normal glandular stomach (n=3: WT1-WT3).  We used Affymetrix microarrays for hybridization, and examined expression profiles.
