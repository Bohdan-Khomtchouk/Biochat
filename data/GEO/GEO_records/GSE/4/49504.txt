TITLE
Placental DNA methylation difference in spontaneous preterm delivery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide placental DNA methylation profiling of full term and preterm deliveries sampled from 5 full term deliveries and 4 preterm deliveries. The Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,577 CpGs in formalin fixed samples. Samples included 4 placental tissues from 4 women with preterm delivery and 5 placental tissues from 5 women with full term delivery.

DESIGN
9 women's placental DNA (4 women had perterm deliveries and 5 women had full term deliveries) were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip
