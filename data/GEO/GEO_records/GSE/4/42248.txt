TITLE
MiRNAs expression data from GM0637 treated with and without ATM inhibitor after DNA damage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GM0637 cell were pretreated with ATM inhibitor before adding DNA damaging agent neocarzinostatin (NCS), and cells were harvested after 4 hours for the microarray analyses of whole-genome miRNAs.

DESIGN
To examine how miRNAs are regulated in the DNA damage response, we assessed the genome-wide mature miRNA expression in GM0637 cells treated with or without ATM inhibitor (ATM-IN)
