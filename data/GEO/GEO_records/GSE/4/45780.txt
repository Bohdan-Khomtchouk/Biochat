TITLE
Time-dependent toxic effects of dietary TCDD in juvenile rainbow trout

ORGANISM
Osmerus mordax

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of chronic TCDD exposure on global gene expression in developing rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Juvenile rainbow trout(0.18Â±0.01g) were fed Biodiet starter with TCDD added at 0, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100ppb, and ten fish were sampled and pooled from 10 ppb group at 7, 14, 28 and 42 days for microarray experiments after initiation of the exposure. Gene expression analysis was performed using the Genomics Research on All Salmonids Project (cGRASP) 16K cDNA microarrays. TCDD-responsive whole body transcripts identified in the microarray experiments have putative functions involved in various biological processes including response to stimulus, cell wall organization or biogenesis, growth and cell proliferation. In addition, TCDD caused leisons in multiple organ systems in juvenile rainbow, including skin, oropharynx, liver, gas bladder, intestine, pancreas, nose and kidney.
