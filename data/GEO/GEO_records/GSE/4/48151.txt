TITLE
Directional RNA-seq reveals highly complex condition-dependent transcriptomes in E. coliK12 through accurate full-length transcripts assembling

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Using a highly efficient and strand-specific RNA-seq method combined with a highly accurate and robust algorithm and tool we developed, TruHMM for assembling full-length transcriptomes,  to profile the transcriptome of E.coli K12 under different culture conditions and growth phases, we showed that the dynamic transcriptome structures appears to be culture condition and growth phases dependent.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of E.coli K12 cultured under different treaments including LB (OD=0.87), Heatshock (15min, 30min, 60min), and MOPS-P(0h,2h,4h).
