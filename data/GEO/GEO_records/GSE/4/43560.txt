TITLE
Allele-specific expression in A. thaliana hybrids grown under control and drought stress conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We estimate Allele-specific expression in F1 hybrids between Col-0 and Cvi-0 accessions grown under well watered and drought stress conditions. We found that ~90% of the genes showed similar ASE under both stresses. Trans-effects were less robust across environments, however its effect was milder compared to cis-variation.

DESIGN
Assessment of ASE in different environments
