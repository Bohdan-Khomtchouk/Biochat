TITLE
Transcriptional effect of CRH on MCF7 estrogen receptor signalling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF7 cells were stimulated with vehicle or 100nM corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) for 24h. The effect of CRH on the expression of genes relevant to estrogen signalling was investigated by using the Human Estrogen Receptor Signaling RT² Profiler™ PCR Array (SABioscience Corp).

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. MCF7 cells were treated separately in triplicate. Equal amount total RNA was processed further for gene expression analysis.
