TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of Salmonella Typhimurium upon desiccation on stainless steel and subsequent rehydration

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles of Salmonella Typhimurium str. ST4/74 air-dried onto stainless steel for 4 h was compared to an early stationary phase (ESP) culture control.  Cells that had been air-dried for 4 h were then subsequently rehydrated with water for a 30 min period, after which the transcriptional profile was compared to an ESP control.
