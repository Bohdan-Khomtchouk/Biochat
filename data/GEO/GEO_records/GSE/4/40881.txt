TITLE
The effect on gene expression of Smchd1 deletion in premalignant pre-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Smchd1 appears to act as a tumour suppressor in the Eµ-Myc B cell lymphoma model. We find gene expression differences are most pronounced in premalignant cells. We always detect a small number of clustered genes and imprinted genes as differentially expressed, along with others involved in tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
The microarrays compared Smchd1 null and Smchd1 wildtype samples from premalignant pre-B cells. All samples are on the C57BL/6 background, and carry the Eµ-Myc transgene. Smchd1 null samples are additionally homozygous for a Smchd1 genetrap allele.
