TITLE
Changes in gene expression in dermal fibroblasts following exposure to Et1 peptide

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine if aberrant activation of  endothelin-1 (Et1) could lead to the dysregulation of many downstream genes, we exposed fibroblasts to exogenous ET1 peptide and assayed for transcriptional changes by microarray. Mouse dermal fibroblasts were treated with exogenous Et1 peptide for 24 hours.  ET1 treatment resulted in significant expression changes — primarily downregulation — of a number of genes. In particular, Tgfβ2 and Tgfβ3 were among the downregulated genes, which in turn alter the expression status of their many target genes. These data suggest that the stable silencing of Et1 is important for the phenotypic stability of dermal fibroblasts, and perhaps many other cell types as well. Keywords: endothelin-1; Et1; dermal fibroblast
