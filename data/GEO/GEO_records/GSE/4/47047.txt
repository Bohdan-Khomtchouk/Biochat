TITLE
Gene expression data from immortal and arsenite-transformed malignant prostate epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to determine how gene expression is changed after arsenite-induced malignant transformation of prostate epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression from three distinct passages of untreated, immortal RWPE-1 cells was compared to three timepoints of arsenite-exposed RWPE-1 cells (CAsE-PE) that have undergone malignant transformation.
