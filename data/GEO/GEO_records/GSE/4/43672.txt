TITLE
Expression data from MDA-MB-231 derived tumors grown in NOD/SCID mice: control- and Memo1-targeted shRNA pools

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
0.5 x10^6 MDA-MB-231 cells, infected with lentivirus encoding either a control shRNA (shLacZ) or a shRNA targeting human Memo1, were injected into the second mammary fatpad of 6-8 week old female NOD/SCID mice and collected 4 weeks after injection.

DESIGN
This expression data represents mRNA collected from 3 shLacZ control and 3 shMemo tumors
