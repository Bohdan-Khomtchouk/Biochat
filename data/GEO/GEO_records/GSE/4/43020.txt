Effect of genetic Zfx deletion on gene expression in Notch induced T-ALL

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) maintain the undifferentiated phenotype and proliferative capacity of their respective cells of origin, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and immature thymocytes. The mechanisms that maintain these progenitor-like characteristics are poorly understood. We report that the transcription factor Zfx is required for the development and propagation of experimental AML caused by MLL-AF9 fusion, and of T-ALL caused by Notch1 activation. In both leukemia types, Zfx activated progenitor-associated gene expression programs and prevented differentiation. Key Zfx target genes included mitochondrial enzymes Ptpmt1 and Idh2, whose overexpression partially rescued the propagation of Zfx-deficient AML. These studies identify a common mechanism that controls the cell-of-origin characteristics of acute leukemias derived from disparate lineages and transformation mechanisms.

DESIGN
Independent primary Notch induced T-ALL cell lines were created by retroviral transduction of Notch-IC into hematopoietic progenitors carrying the tamoxifen inducible Cre-ER transgene and the Zfx conditional (Zfx fl/y) allele (lines 14843, 14844, 14846).  T-ALL cells generated from each line were isolated from moribund mice and transplanted into sublethally irradiated secondary recipients. Ten days after transplant when T-ALL cells had appeared in the blood of the secondary recipients, they were treated by gavage with either Vehicle or Tamoxifen (5 mg /day for three days) to induce Zfx deletion in leukemia cells.  48 hours after the final Tamoxifen treatment, the mice were sacrificed and T-ALL cells were recovered by FACS for microarray studies.
