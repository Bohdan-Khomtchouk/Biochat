TITLE
A temperature-responsive network links cell shape and virulence traits in a primary fungal pathogen -- ChIP-chip

ORGANISM
Histoplasma capsulatum

SUMMARY
The ability to grow at host temperature is a critical trait for most pathogenic microbes of humans. Thermally dimorphic fungal pathogens, including Histoplasma capsulatum, are a class of soil fungi that undergo a dramatic change in cell shape and virulence gene expression in response to host temperature. Here we elucidate a complex temperature-responsive network in H. capsulatum, which switches from an environmental filamentous form to a pathogenic yeast form. We dissect the circuit driven by three regulators that control yeast-phase growth, and demonstrate that these factors, including two deeply conserved Velvet family proteins of unknown function, associate with DNA. We identify and characterize a fourth regulator of this pathway, and define cis-acting motifs that recruit these transcription factors to a tightly interwoven network of temperature-responsive target genes. Our results provide the first comprehensive analysis of the complex transcriptional network that links temperature to morphology and virulence in thermally dimorphic fungi. This submission gives the chromatin immunoprecipitation results.

DESIGN
For each of the four Ryp proteins, ChIP vs. input hybridizations were performed for three replicate immunoprecipitations from the wild-type strain and two negative control replicates from the corresponding mutant strain.
