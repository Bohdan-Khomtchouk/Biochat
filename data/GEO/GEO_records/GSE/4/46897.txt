TITLE
Cyclodextrin protects podocytes in diabetic kidney disease [HumanWG-6 v3.0 array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression changes in differentiated human podocytes treated with the serum from patients with (DKD+) or without (DKD-) diabetic kidney disease when compared to normal subjects (C). The hypothesis is that the three groups can be distinghed by their differential gene expression pattern. The results obtained revealed important information regarding differences in gene expression in human podocytes treated with the serum from patients with (DKD+) or without (DKD-) diabetic kidney disease when compared to normal subjects (C).

DESIGN
Human podocytes were contacted with the serum from patients with diabetes and kidney disease (DKD+) or without kidney disease (DKD-) and compared to normal human podocytes contacted with serum from patients without diabetes (C).
