TITLE
Human BRAF-V600E melanoma cell lines drug sensitive vs drug resistant

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
aCGH of human melanoma cell lines comparing parental (drug sensitve) vs isogenic drug resistant-derived subline

DESIGN
Two condition experiment: two BRAF-V600E mutant cell lines (drug sensitive - parental baseline) vs two derived sublines after chronic exposure to the MEK inhibitor trametinib (drug resistant) are compared
