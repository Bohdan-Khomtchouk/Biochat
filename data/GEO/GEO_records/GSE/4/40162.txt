TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of Prunus mume for different tissues.

ORGANISM
Prunus mume

SUMMARY
We have sequenced a wild Prunus mume and constructed a reference sequence for this genome. In order to improve quality of gene models, RNA samples of five tissues (bud, leaf, root, stem, fruit) were extracted from the Prunus mume. To investigate tissue specific expression using the reference genome assembly and annotated genes, we extracted RNA samples of different tissues and conducted transcriptome sequencing and DEG analysis.

DESIGN
Five RNA pools were created corresponding to different tissues of the Prunus mume.
