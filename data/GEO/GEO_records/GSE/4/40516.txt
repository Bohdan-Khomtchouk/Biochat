TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression changes in human alveolar epithelial cells grown on collagen- or matrigel-coated dishes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of human alveolar epithelial cell signatures at gene expression level. The aim of the study was to identify candidate genes that are induced in human alveolar epithelial type II cells on collagen-coated dishes. Results provide important information about changes hAT2 cells undergo in the transformation to AT1-like cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human alveolar epithelial cells grown on collagen- or matrigel-coated dishes for 12, 24, 48 and 72 hr.
