TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of LINK1 and LINK2 effects on the Arabidopsis transcriptome

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the transcriptional profile (RNA-seq) of wild type plants with that of link1link2 double mutants grown under continous light or long day (16h light/8 h darkness) conditions.

DESIGN
In the first experiment wild-type and link1link2 mutant plants were grown for two weeks under continuous white light conditions at 22 degrees centigrades and the transcriptional profile of these plants was analyzed using RNA-seq. In the second experiment, wild-type and link1link2 mutants were grown under long day conditions (16 h light/8 h darkness), and the transcriptional profile of these plants was analyzed in samples harvested every 4 hours over a 24 hour, starting 2 hourse after the onset of the light period.
