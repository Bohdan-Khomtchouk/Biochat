TITLE
MiRNA profiling in lung epithelial cells during infection with influenza A virus of H5N1 strain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aims at elucidating how H5N1 influenza infection perturbs the host's miRNA regulatory pathways that may lead to adverse pathological events, such as cytokine storm, using the miRNA microarray approach.

DESIGN
The cell line - NCI-H292, was infected with various preparations of H5N1 influenza viruses was analysed for miRNA expression profiles subsequently. The miRNA expression profiles were measured at 3, 6, 18, and 24 hours post infection, respectively.
