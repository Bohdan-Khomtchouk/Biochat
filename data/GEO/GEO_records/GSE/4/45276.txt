TITLE
Expression data from Control, AKT and RAS transduced cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mutations in both RAS and the PTEN/PIK3CA/AKT signaling module are found in the same human tumors. PIK3CA and AKT are downstream effectors of RAS, and the selective advantage conferred by mutation of two genes in the same pathway is unclear. Based on a comparative molecular analysis, we show that activated PIK3CA/AKT is a weaker inducer of senescence than is activated RAS. More-over, concurrent activation of RAS and PIK3CA/AKT impairs RAS-induced senescence. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression after transduction of AKT and RAS

DESIGN
IMR90 cells were transfected with Control, AKT and RAS retrovirus containing medium in 4 replicates.  Fibroblasts were drug selected and kept in drug for duration of experiments.
