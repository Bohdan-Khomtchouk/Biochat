TITLE
Changes in gene expression in porcine lungs following infection with Zaire ebolavirus

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To elucidate the mechanisms involved in pulmonary inflammation in Zaire ebolavirus-infected pigs, lung sections infected pigs were used for a porcine microarray to analyse changes in gene expression with particular interest in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine transcription.

DESIGN
Pigs were given inhalation anaesthesia and then inoculated with 106 plaque forming units of Zaire ebolavirus in sterile PBS per pig via the intranasal, intraocular and oral routes. Three control pigs were mock inoculated with PBS and housed separately.
