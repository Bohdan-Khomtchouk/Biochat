TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of potato hypersensistive response to PVY infection

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Our aim was to investigate involvement of  salicylic acid signalling in Ny-mediated hypersensistive response by comparison of transcriptomic response to the Potato Virus Y in potato plants of genotypes Rywal, bearing Ny-1 allele and NahG-Rywal, unable to accumulate salicylic acid in three time points (1, 3 and 6 days post inoculation) after viral inoculation.

DESIGN
Inoculated leaves of  mock- and virus- inoculated plants (four each) were sampled 1, 3 and 6 days after inoculation (dpi). POCI microarrays were used (one-color design)
