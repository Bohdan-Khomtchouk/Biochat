TITLE
Epigenetic silencing of HAND2 is a crucial step in endometrial carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we demonstrate that epigenetic silencing of HAND2 is a key step in endometrial carcinogenesis. We performed an epigenome-wide methylation analysis of > 27,000 CpG sites in endometrial cancers and controls and identified methylation of HAND2 as one of the most common hypermethylated and silenced genes in endometrial cancer.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 87 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2.
