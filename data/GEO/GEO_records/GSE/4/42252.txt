TITLE
Expression data from gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cancer cells have wide variety of gene expression profile. The objective of the study is to reveal the cancer-associated gene expression profile. Microarray analysis was used to investigate gene expression of cancer cells.

DESIGN
Both gastric and pancreatic cancer tissues were surgically resected and total RNA was purified from these tissues by a conventional method.
