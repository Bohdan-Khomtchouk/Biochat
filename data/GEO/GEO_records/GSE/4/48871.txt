TITLE
Gene expression profiles of two lung squamous cell carcinoma cell lines treated with SOX2 siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SOX2 is a transcription factor essential for self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. Recently SOX2 was found overexpressed in the majority of the lung squamous cell carcinoma (SQC), in which it acts as a lineage-survival oncogene. However, downstream targets/pathways of SOX2 in lung SQC cells remain to be identified. In order to identify genes/pathways likely to be downstream of SOX2, we conducted SOX2 silencing experiments in LK2 and NCI-H520 (H520 thereafter), two SOX2-abundant lung SQC cell lines and analyzed global gene transcription changes by gene expression microarray assay.

DESIGN
Each of H520 and LK2 cell lines was treated with either pooled siRNAs of SOX2 or non-silencing (control) siRNAs. After 48 h, cells were harvested and totoal RNA extracted for gene expression microarray analysis using Illumina HumanHT12 v3 BeadChip.
