TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the SNAPc complex [Illumina array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The small nuclear RNA (snRNA)-activating protein complex (SNAPc) is a basal transcription factor that mediates the transcriptional activation of snRNAs. Here, we describe the genome-wide occupancy of the SNAPC1_and SNAPC4 subunits of SNAPc. While the SNAPC4 occupancy was in accord with the role for SNAPc in snRNA transcription, SNAPC1_displayed a broader genomic profile mirroring that of RNA polymerase II at highly active protein-coding genes. Our functional analysis revealed a role for SNAPC1_in regulation of both basal and activator-induced transcription of protein-coding genes. These studies expand the role for SNAPC1_beyond its regulation of snRNA transcription.

DESIGN
EGF stimulation of Hela cells, transfected with a control sh (scr) or a SNAPC1_sh
