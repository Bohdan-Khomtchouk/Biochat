TITLE
AGO-PAR-CLIP of DG75 and BCBL-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AGO-PAR-CLIP was employed to identify microRNA binding sites in BCBL-1, a Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infected B-cell line and DG75, a KSHV negative B-cell line as a control. By using our novel computational method (PARma) and differential analysis of PAR-CLIP data, highly accurate target sites of KSHV microRNAs can be defined.

DESIGN
Examination of microRNA target sites in two different cell lines using replicate PAR-CLIP experiments
