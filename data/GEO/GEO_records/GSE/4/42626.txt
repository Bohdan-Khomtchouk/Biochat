TITLE
Methylation profiling categorizes HIV-associated lymphomas in two distinctive groups

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIV-positive patients have a higher risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with poor prognostic features. To characterize features of HIV-associated lymphoma, we compared the DNA methylation profiles of 803 cancer-related genes in between 9 HIV-associated and 12 non-HIV lymphoma samples by Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I microarray.

DESIGN
Bisulfite-converted DNA from the 42 samples  (duplicate analysis of 21 samples) were analyzed to obtain the methylation profiles of cancer-associated genes by using Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I microarray.
