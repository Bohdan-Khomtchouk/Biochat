TITLE
Identification of Ccr4-Not complex as a regulator of transition from partial to genuine iPS cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Partial induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) are cell lines strayed from normal route from somatic cells to iPSCs and are immortalized. Mouse partial iPSCs are able to convert to real iPSCs by the exposure to 2i condition using MAPK and GSK3? inhibitors. However, the molecular mechanisms of this conversion are totally not known. Our piggyback vector mediated genome-wide screen revealed that Cnot2, one of core components of Ccr4-Not complex participates in this conversion. Subsequent analyses revealed other core components, i.e., Cnot1 and Cnot3 and Trim28 which is known to extensively share genomic binding sites with Cnot3 contribute to this conversion as well. Our bioinformatics analyses indicate that the major role of these factors in the conversion is the down-regulation of developmental genes in partial iPSCs.

DESIGN
Two partial iPSC clones (2B1 and 5C5) cultured under conventional culture condition with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and serum and those converted to iPSCs by the exposure to 2i condition were used for RNA source. Partial iPSCs (2B1) cultured under conventional condition in which either one of Cnot1, Cnot2, Cnot3 and Trim28 cDNA or these factors were combinatorially incorporated after retrovirus infection and those in which empty vector or Nanog were stably integrated were also used for RNA source. In addition, embryonic fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from 13.5 dpc embryos and blastocysts, respectively, from Nanog-GFP transgenic mice and wild-type ESC line (EBRTcH3) were used for RNA source.
