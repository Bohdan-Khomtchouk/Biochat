TITLE
Gene expression changes induced by overexpression of IDH1mut in the sorted mouse bone marrow cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mutations in the enzymes IDH1 and IDH2 have been identified in a wide variety of tumors like glioma, chondrosarcoma, thyroid cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and in acute myeloid leukemia. Mutated IDH1/2 produces the metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which interferes with epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and thus may promote tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
HoxA9 immortalized bone marrow cells from C57BJ/6 mice were transduced with either empty vector or pSF91-IDH1wt-IRES-EGFP, or pSF91-IDH1mut-IRES-GFP and transplanted in irradiated recipient mice. Four weeks after transplantation, GFP+ cells were sorted from mouse bone marrow, from which total RNA was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis.
