TITLE
Profiling of genes related to cross protection and competition for NbTOM1 by HLSV and TMV

ORGANISM
Nicotiana tabacum

SUMMARY
To investigate the mechanism under the cross protection between HLSV and TMV, microarray analysis was conducted to examine the transcriptional levels of global host genes during cross protection, using Tobacco Gene Expression Microarray, 4x44k slides. The transcriptional level of some host genes corresponded to accumulation level of TMV. Some host genes were up-regulated only by HLSV.
