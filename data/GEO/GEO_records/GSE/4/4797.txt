TITLE
Microarray analysis of human spermatogenic dysfunction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated testicular biopsies from 28 men which presented with full spermatogenesis (Johnsen Score 10, 12 samples), arrest at the spermatid stage (Johnsen Score 8, 6 samples), arrest at spermatocyte stage (Johnsen Score 5, 5 samples) and Sertoli-cell-only syndrom (Johnsen Score 2, 5 samples). Testicular biopsies were obtained by the " sandwich " method and conserved in RNALater (Ambion) during surgery. Keywords: spermatogenesis germ cell differentiation Keywords: disease state analysis
