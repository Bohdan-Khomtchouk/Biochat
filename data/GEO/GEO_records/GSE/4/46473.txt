TITLE
Prostate-specific Pten deletion and Pten-Lrf deletion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to analyze the global gene expression and identified differentially expressed gene list between wild-type anterior prostates and Pb-Cre4;PtenLoxP/LoxP anterior prostates, Pb-Cre4;PtenLoxP/LoxP;LrfLoxP/LoxP anterior prostates at 12 weeks of age.

DESIGN
Prostate-specific Pten deletion (Pb-Cre4;PtenLoxP/LoxP) results in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) which, following a long latency, can progress to high-grade adenocarcinoma, albeit with minimally invasive and metastatic features. However, inactivation of Lrf in the prostate epithelium in combination of Pten results in aggressive prostate tumors. To understand the molecular mechanisms by which loss of Lrf promotes Pten-loss-driven prostate tumorigenesis, we conducted transcriptome comparison of three wild-type anterior prostates, three Pb-Cre4;PtenLoxP/LoxP PIN, and three Pb-Cre4;PtenLoxP/LoxP;LrfLoxP/LoxP anterior prostate tumors.
