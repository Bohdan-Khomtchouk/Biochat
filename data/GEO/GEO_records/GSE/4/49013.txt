TITLE
DamID experiment looking at Dichaete-bound regions in 2-7h old Drosophila embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Dichaete is a developmentally important transcription factor, known to be involved in basic biological processes including segmentation and nervous system development among others. The aim of this experiment was to gain further insight into the role of Dichaete during early embryogenesis, by finding out where in the genome it's binding using the DamID technique.

DESIGN
3 independent biological replicates. Embryos between 2-7 h old were collected. The sample embryos contained a Dichaete-Dam methylase fusion, while the control embryos had a Dam methylase only to simulate the background level of methylation not specific to transcription factor binding.
