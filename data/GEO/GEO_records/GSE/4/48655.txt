TITLE
Expression data from growth restricted fetal rat pancreatic islets

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Intrauterine growth restriction is a common complication of pregnancy. We induce IUGR in rats by bilateral uterine artery ligation at e18 of a 23 day gestation. This mimics placental insufficiency. This array experiment compares gene expression changes in isolated pancreatic islets from e19, 24 hours post-surgery , or sham operated animals.

DESIGN
RNA from isolated pancreatic islets from e19 fetuses, pooled from an entire litter. There are 4 control (sham) operated litters and 4 IUGR litters.
