TITLE
Expression data from C57BL/6J and C57BL6/J Sarm-deficient mice uninfected or infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sarm-deficient mice are protected from VSV encephalitis and death. Microarray was done to examine genes contributing to this phenotype

DESIGN
WT and KO mice were infected with VSV and brains were harvested at day 5 post-infection for RNA extraction
