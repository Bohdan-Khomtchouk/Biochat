TITLE
comparison of MILI+/- and MILI-/- at D10 testis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Spermatogenesis in MILI-KO mice was blocked completely at early prophase of the first meiosis during the zygotene and early pachytene stage. To analyze the molecular basis of MILI function, we examined the difference between gene expression for MILI-/- and MILI+/- testes. Keywords: total RNAs of day10 testes
