TITLE
MeDIP of adult whole brain tissue from fetal alcohol exposed mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this report we assessed alterations to adult mouse brain tissue by assaying DNA cytosine methylation and small noncoding RNA (ncRNA) expression, specifically the microRNA (miRNA) and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) subtypes. We found long lasting alterations in DNA methylation as a result of fetal alcohol exposure, specifically in the imprinted regions of the genome harboring ncRNAs and sequences interacting with regulatory proteins. ~20% of the altered ncRNAs mapped to three imprinted regions: Snrpn-Ube3a, Dlk1-Dio3, and Sfmbt2, which showed differential methylation and have been previously implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. The findings of this report help to expand on the mechanisms behind the long lasting changes in the brain transcriptome of FASD individuals.

DESIGN
Comparison of fetal alcohol exposed and matched control adult C57/BL6J mice brains with olfactory bulbs removed
