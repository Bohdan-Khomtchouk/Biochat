TITLE
Dissecting physiological and transcriptional responses of nitric oxide to drought stress by increasing in vivo nitric oxide content in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in all major environmental stresses. However, most of these understandings were mainly based on pharmacological study using NO modulator compounds. Recently, our studies together with others provided a new class of plant experimental system with specific in vivo NO release through constitutively overexpressing rat neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) in plants. In this study, we found that the nNOS transgenic Arabidopsis plants displayed lower level of H2O2 content, but higher levels of antioxidant enzyme activities and osmolytes under drought stress conditions. Transcriptomic analysis identified 490 and 20 genes that were differentially expressed in wild type (WT) and nNOS transgenic plants under control and drought stress conditions, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed that many genes involved in photosynthesis, cell, misc, co-factor and vitamin metabolism, major CHO metabolism, OPP and secondary metabolism were largely changed in nNOS vs. WT under control or drought stress conditions. Interestingly, CBF1/2 and 13 zinc finger family proteins, known as important family of transcription regulators in modulating several stress-responsive genes, were differentially expressed by nNOS transgenic effect. Additionally, some genes were commonly regulated by nNOS transgenic and abscisic acid (ABA) effects, indicating new insights to cross-talk between ABA and NO. Taken together, in vivo NO modulated antioxidant enzyme activities, osmolyte level, and the expression of genes involved in several pathways, thereby resulting in enhanced stress tolerance in nNOS transgenic plants. These observations might provide some insights to understand the physiological and molecular mechanisms of NO in response to drought stress in Arabidopsis.
