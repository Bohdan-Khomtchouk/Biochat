TITLE
Exon-level expression profiling of normal colonic mucosa samples.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These samples have been analyzed for global alternative splicing variation on exon-level expression data using the FIRMA algorithm. We have identified and described transcriptome instability as a genome-wide, pre-mRNA splicing related characteristic of solid cancers.

DESIGN
This Series consists of 19 normal colonic mucosa samples from colorectal cancer patients,  and is an amendment to a larger series of colorectal cancer and adjacent normal colonic mucosa samples analyzed for gene expression at the exon-level (GSE24550).
