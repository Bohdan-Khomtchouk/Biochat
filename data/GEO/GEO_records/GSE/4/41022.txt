TITLE
CpG underrepresentation and the new bacterial CpG specific DNA methyltransferase M.MpeI

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The CpG depleted Mycoplasma penetrans harbors a CpG specific C5 methyltransferase. The aim of this experiment was to confirm the specificity of the methyltransferase in vivo and in vitro.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from Mycoplasma penetrans and Escherichia coli genomic DNA that either was or was not methylated in vitro by M.MpeI were subjected to Illumina MiSeq bisulfite sequencing.
