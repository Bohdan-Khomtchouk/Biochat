TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin histone methylation marks in neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epigenetic changes in DNA and chromatin are implicated in organogenesis and cell differentiation. Through a genome-wide chromatin-immunoprecipitation DNA-sequencing approach (ChIP-seq) we analyses the enrichment of H3K79me2 and H3K4me3 (histone methylation marks associated with transcriptional activation) and H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 (histone methylation marks associated with transcriptional repression) in neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes. The histone methylation profile obtained was correlated with an Illumina gene expression profile from the same samples. Our results demonstrate that histone methylation, and in particular the DOT1L-mediated H3K79me2 mark, drives cardiomyogenesis through the definition of a specific transcriptional landscape
