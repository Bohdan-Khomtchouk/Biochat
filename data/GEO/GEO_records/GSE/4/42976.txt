TITLE
Effect of rBC2LCN on human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We show a recombinant lectin probe, rBC2LCN, is a new tool for fluorescence-based imaging and flow cytometry analysis of human pluripotent stem cells, as an alternative to conventional pluripotent maker antibodies. Live or fixed colonies of both human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells were visualized using fluoresceinated rBC2LCN. Fluoresceinated rBC2LCN also separated live pluripotent stem cells from mixed cell population by flow cytometry.

DESIGN
Induced gene expression in human ES cells was measured at 3 days treatment of rBC2LCN lectin. WA01 (H1) cells were treated with 1, 10 and 100 ug/ml of rBC2LCN or 1 of FITC-rBC2LCN for three days. Two independent experiments were performed at each treatment experiment. Samples of human ES cells (KhES-1 and 3), human iPS cells (201B7 and 253G1) and HDF in each conventional culture condition were used for outgroup examples.
