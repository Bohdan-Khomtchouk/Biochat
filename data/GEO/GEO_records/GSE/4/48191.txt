TITLE
The gene expression profiles of WT and NML-KO livers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine whether energy starvation caused by the increase in rRNA transcription affects liver metabolism, we compared the gene expression profiles of WT and NML-KO livers using Affymetrix microarray technology.

DESIGN
We analyzed 5 livers of WT mice and 5 livers of NML-KO mice.
