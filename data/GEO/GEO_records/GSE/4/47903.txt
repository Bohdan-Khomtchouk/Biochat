TITLE
Expression data of E16 GFAP-tTA: TetO-VEGF-A164 bitransgenic embryos compared to wild type

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Overexpression of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) in the germinal matrix of the brain causes GMH-IVH-like anomalies (Germinal matrix hemorrhage [GMH]; intraventricular hemorrhage [IVH]). This dataset provides the list of differentially expressed genes in the brain cortices of embryos with transgene directed overexpression of VEGF.

DESIGN
Eight samples were analyzed, including four control and four with induced over expression of VEGF. A simple unpaired T-test was used for analysis, with GeneSpring software,
