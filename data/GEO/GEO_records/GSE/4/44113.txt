TITLE
Time dependent expression profiles of microRNAs in rat milk

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We have reported that microRNAs are present in human and bovine milk. But, it is unknown the roles of milk miRNAs. To clarify the roles of milk miRNAs, experimental animal such as rat study would be needed. However, it is unclear whether rat milk also contains miRNAs. Thus, we have employed microarray to show that rat milk also contains miRNAs.

DESIGN
Milk samples were obtained at day 2, 9, and 16 postpartum from 3 rats. And serum samples were obtained from dam rats (n=3) at day 21 postpartum.
