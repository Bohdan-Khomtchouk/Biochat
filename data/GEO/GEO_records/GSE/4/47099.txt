TITLE
Genes involved in cholestatic intestinal injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we examined C57BL/6J and AJ mice who received either sham surgery or cholestatic intestinal injury. Mice were anesthetized by inhaled isoflurane anesthesia. The abdomen was clipped and then prepared in sterile fashion with 70% ethyl-ethanol followed by betadine. A transverse upper abdominal incision was performed. The CBD was dissected away from the portal vein and was ligated near its junction with the duodenum using aneurysm clips engineered with a precisely standardized opening/closing mechanism. The abdominal wall was then closed in a two-layer fashion using absorbable sutures. Sham-operated mice were treated identically but without dissection or ligation of the CBD.

DESIGN
Male AJ and C57BL6J mice, 8 weeks of age, were randomly assigned to surgery or sham (n=3 microarrays per strain/condition).
