TITLE
Gene expression profiles of human hepatocellular carcinoma (training set 2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in young subjects is rare but more devastating. We hypothesize that genes and etiological pathways are unique to young HCC (yHCC; â‰¤40 years old at diagnosis) patients. We therefore compared the gene expression profiles between yHCCs and HCCs from elderly patients.

DESIGN
16 young HCC were collected from patients aged less than 40. 16 elder HCC profiles were downloaded from the Expression Project for Oncology (expO) of the International Genomics Consortium, with accession number GSE2109 in GEO database.
