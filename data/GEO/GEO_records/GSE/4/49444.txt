TITLE
Expression profiling of isolated populations of prepachytene spermatocytes, pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids of PWD and B6 males

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of isolated populations of prepachytene spermatocytes (LP), pachytene spermatocytes (RP) and spermatids (ST) from PWD and B6 was performed to study the genome wide variation in gene expression between two mouse subspecies. To evaluate the transcriptional difference between B6 and PWD in during meiosis, we compared their transcriptomes in sorted populations of pre-pachytene primary spermatocytes (Leptonema, Zygotene and Pachytene), pachytene spermatocytes (Mid-late pachytene and diplotene) and spermatids.

DESIGN
Populations of pre-pachytene spermatocytes, pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids were isolated from PWD and B6 mice. All populations were isolated in duplicates from two animals. Hence, RNA was prepared from 12 samples (= 2 strains x 3 tissues x 2 replicas) and was then subject to labeling and hybridization on microarray chips.
