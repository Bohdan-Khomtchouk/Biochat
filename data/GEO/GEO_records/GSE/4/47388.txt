TITLE
Expression following beta-catenin stabilization in synovial sarcomagenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Synovial sarcoma is a deadly soft-tissue malignancy with a predilection for adolescents and young adults. Mice recapitulate synovial sarcomagenesis from expression of SS18-SSX2 in certain cells. Concomitant expression of a stabilized form of beta-catenin enhances synovial sarcomagenesis and expands the potential cells of origin.

DESIGN
Mice bearing conditional expression of SS18-SSX2 from the Rosa26 locus and conditional excision of the 3rd exon of beta-catenin, each activated in the leg by Cre-recombinase expressed from an adeno-associated viral vector, formed large tumors at brief latency.
