TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans strains isolated from the same individual during short term persistent infections using a pan-genome microarray

ORGANISM
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans

SUMMARY
To characterize the differences in pattern of gene expression between different pairs of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans strains (SCC393 vs A160, SCC1398 vs SCC4092, and S23A vs I23C), where each pair was isolated from an individual over time.

DESIGN
The microarray was used to examine the transcriptome of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans strains SCC393, A160, SCC1398, SCC4092, S23A, and I23C, where biological triplicates were produced for strains SCC1398, SCC4092, S23A, and I23C and biological duplicates were produced for strains SCC393, and A160
