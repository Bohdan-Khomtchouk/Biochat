TITLE
ChIP-on-chip from KYSE410 cells with CUL4B, EZH2 and BMI

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A total of 619 unique promoters were found to be co-targeted by CUL4B and EZH2, among which only 53 were overlapped with the 891 targets of BMI EZH2/PRC2 and CUL4B/CRL4B have a predominant cooperation, at least in KYSE410 cells.

DESIGN
comparison of CUL4B, EZH2, and BMI target genes
