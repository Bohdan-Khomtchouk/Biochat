TITLE
Gene expression in the blood of Live Attenuated Rev-Independent Nef¯SIV  infected Rhesus macaques during acute infection

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Rhesus macaques (RMs) inoculated with live-attenuated Rev-Independent Nef¯ simian immunodeficiency virus (Rev-Ind Nef¯SIV) as adults or neonates controlled viremia to undetectable levels and showed no signs of immunodeficiency over 6-8 years of follow-up.  We tested the capacity of this live-attenuated virus to protect RMs against pathogenic, heterologous SIVsmE660 challenges

DESIGN
Blood PBMC Time after SIV infection: 2 weeks post SIV infection Infection:Rev-Ind Nef¯SIV
