TITLE
Expression data from adult Rattus liver

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Activation of the pregnane X receptor (NR1I2) by drugs and other xenobiotics stimulates (or suppresses) expression of numerous genes involved in the metabolic elimination of foreign compounds and some toxic endogenous substrates. We used microarray analysis to identify genes whose expression in rat liver was significantly altered by pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile (PCN) treatment. Keywords: a single ip injection of PCN (100 mg/kg), 8 h treatment
