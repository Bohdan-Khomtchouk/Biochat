TITLE
Activation of the chromatin-remodeling factor Smarca4/Brg1 cooperates with Olig2 to establish oligodendrocyte identity and control CNS myelination [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Spinal cord mRNA profiles of 14-day-old control (Brg1c/+;Olig1-Cre) and Smarca4/Brg1 conditional knockout (Brg1c/c;Olig1-Cre) mice were generated by RNA-seq. Differential expressed genes are identified using Cuffdiff and validated with qPCR.

DESIGN
Spinal cord mRNA profiles of 14-day old control and Brg1c/c;Olig1-Cre mice were generated by RNA-sequencing.
