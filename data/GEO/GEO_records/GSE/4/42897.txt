TITLE
Expression data from rat INS-1E cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Cytokine-induced beta-cell apoptosis is a key event for the death of pancreatic beta cells in the development of type-1 diabetes. We identified BRD0476 as a novel suppressor of cytokine-induced beta-cell apoptosis. We used microarrays to look for gene set(s) that are regulated by BRD0476.

DESIGN
Rat INS-1E cells were treated with cytokine cocktails (IL-1b, IFN-g and TNF-a) and/or BRD0476 for 6 or 12 hours. Total RNAs were isolated using the RNEasy kit from Qiagen.
