TITLE
Comparison of gene expression from thymocyte populations and equivalent OP9-DL1 cultured cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison between ex vivo immature, mature and stimulated T cells and in vitro generated counterparts. The T cells generated in vitro were cultured on OP9-DL1 stroma supplied with growth factors.

DESIGN
Three in vivo (Thymus DPCD3+, Thymus SP8, PBMC CD8 POST) and three in vitro (CCd14 DPCD3+, CCd20 SP8, CCd27 Post) samples were collected.  T-cells were sorted to high purity, RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. No technical replicates were used. The expression profiles of in vivo samples were then compared to the ones of in vitro samples.
