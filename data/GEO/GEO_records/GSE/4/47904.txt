TITLE
Somatic point mutation calling in low cellularity tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina 1M Omni Quad arrays were used to test mutation calling accuracy of qSNP tool (a mutation caller) Ilumina array genotypes with GenCal (GC score) > 0.70 were used in the comparison of genotype calls using next generation sequencing data and qSNP (mutation caller)

DESIGN
2 samples (control cell line and Melanoma cell line). This is the data for a validation step. contributor: Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative
