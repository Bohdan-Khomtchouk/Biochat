TITLE
Whole genome transcriptome analysis identifies indices of fast and slow disease progression in two ALS mouse models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis has been applied to the study of ALS in order to investigate gene expression in whole spinal cord homogenates of SOD1 G93A mice and human ALS cases, although the massive presence of glial cells and inflammatory factors has made it difficult to define which gene expression changes were motor neuron specific. Recently, laser capture microdissection (LCM), combined with microarray analysis, has allowed the identification of motor neuron specific changes in gene expression in mouse and human ALS cases. The aim of the present study is to combine LCM and microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profiles of motor neurons from two SOD1G93A mouse strains (129Sv and C57) with different progression of the disease in order to discover the molecular mechanisms that may contribute to the distinct phenotypes and to uncover factors underlying fast and slow disease progression

DESIGN
Motor neurons have been isolated from the spinal cord of 129SvG93A mice, C57G93A mice and non transgenic littermates at different time points and the transcription expression profile of the isolated motor neurons has been analysed
