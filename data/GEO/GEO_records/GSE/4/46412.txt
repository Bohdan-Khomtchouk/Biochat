TITLE
Expression analysis of Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 WT and ∆arcA mutant

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 ∆arcA mutant, compared to the wild-type strain.  The mutations engineered into this strain produce a strain lacking the ArcA protein. The results are further described in the manuscript The response regulator ArcA uses a diverse binding site architechture to globally regulate carbon oxidation in E. coli
