TITLE
Expression data from BMP9-treated human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-D)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BMP9 signaling has been implicated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and vascular remodeling, acting via the HHT target genes, endoglin and ALK1. This study sought to identify endothelial BMP9-regulated proteins that could affect the HHT phenotype. Gene ontology analysis of cDNA microarray data obtained following BMP9 treatment of primary human endothelial cells indicated regulation of chemokine, adhesion, and inflammation  pathways.

DESIGN
The sample set is comprised of three biological replicate control human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, and three treated (5 ng/ml human recombinant BMP9) biological replicate human dermal microvascular endothelial cells
