TITLE
Expression data from human olfactory neurosphere derived cells (hONS) established from adult donors treated with coated and uncoated ZnO nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ZnO nanoparticles can elicit a range of cytotoxic responses in different cells in vitro that may reflect either Zn2+ dissolution or nanoparticle-specific effects.  Coating the ZnO nanoparticles may mitigate their cytotoxicity. We aimed to capture whole genome transcriptional profiles (up and down regulated) at time-points associated with distinct cytotoxic responses in cells treated with two types of uncoated (Nanosun, Z-COTE) or two types of coated (HP1, MAX) ZnO nanoparticles, compared to untreated cells.

DESIGN
hONS cells were incubated with 25ug/ml ZnO nanoparticles (uncoated: Nanosun and Z-COTE; coated: MAX, HP1) for 2h and 6h and their expression profiles were compared to time-matched untreated cells.
