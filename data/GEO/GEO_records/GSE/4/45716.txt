TITLE
Replication timing profiling by Repli-chip in Mus musculus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The replication timing program, or the order in which DNA is duplicated during S-phase, is associated with various features of chromosome structure and function, including gene expression, histone modifications, and 3-D compartmentalization of chromatin.

DESIGN
