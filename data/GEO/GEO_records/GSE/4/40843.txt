TITLE
Differentially expressed miRNAs in TGF-β1-knock down rhabdmyosarcoma cell lines vs controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of TGF-β1-regulated miRNAs in the progression of RMS,we performed comprehensive miRMA microarray analysis on RNA derived from typical RMS cell lines and TGF-β1 knock-down cell lines. We identified a novel set of TGF-β1-related miRNAs.
