TITLE
PGN induced transcriptional changes in human neonatal neutrophils

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes differentially expressed in cord blood purified neutrophils after a short-term exposure to peptidoglycan (PGN).

DESIGN
PGN induced gene expressions of neonatal neutrophils were measured at 4 hours. Three biological replicates were performed for each treatment group.
