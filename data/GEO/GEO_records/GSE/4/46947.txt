TITLE
Antivirulence activities of zinc ion and ZnO nanoparticle against Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
An antivirulence approach targets bacterial virulence rather than cell viability in the antibiotic approach that can readily lead to drug resistance. Opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces a variety of virulence factors, and biofilm cells of this bacterium are much more resistant to antibiotics than planktonic cells. To identify novel inorganic antivirulence compounds, the dual screenings of thirty-six metal ions were performed to identify that zinc ions and ZnO nanoparticle inhibited the pyocyanin production and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa without affecting the growth of planktonic cells. Moreover, zinc ion and ZnO nanoparticle markedly reduced the production of 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone and siderophore pyochelin, while increased the production of another sideropore pyoverdine and swarming motility. Further, zinc ion and ZnO nanoparticle clearly suppressed hemolytic activity in P. aeruginosa. Transcriptome analyses showed that ZnO nanoparticle induced zinc cation efflux pump czc operon, porin genes (oprD and opdT), and Pseudomonas type III repressor A ptrA, while repressed pyocyanin-related phz operon, which partially explains the phenotypic changes. Overall, ZnO nanoparticle is a potential candidate for use in an antivirulence approach against persistent P. aeruginosa infection.
