TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana:cyanamid-treated seedlings versus control seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings treated with cyanamid, highlighting to the physiological function of phytochemicals by observing early response of gene expressions in Arabidopsis seedlings

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, cyanamid-treated seedlings vs. control seedlings. Biological replicates:2 control replicates, 2 cyanamid treated.
