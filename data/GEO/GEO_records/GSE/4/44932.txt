TITLE
A chronological expression profile of gene activity during embryonic mouse brain development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The brain is a functionally complex organ, the patterning and development of which are key to adult health. To help elucidate the genetic networks underlying mammalian brain patterning we conducted detailed transcriptional profiling during embryonic development of the mouse brain. 2400 genes were identified as showing differential expression between three developmental stages. Analysis of the data identified nine gene clusters to demonstrate analogous expression profiles. A significant group of novel genes of as yet undiscovered biological function were detected, as being potentially relevant to brain development and function, in addition to genes that have previously identified roles in the brain. Analysis of left-right asymmetry of expression revealed 35 genes as putatively asymmetric from a combined data set. Our data constitutes a valuable new resource for neuroscience and neuro-development, exposing possible functional associations between genes, including novel loci, and encouraging their further investigation in human neurological and behavioural disorders.

DESIGN
Whole genome transcriptional profiling carried out on 24 samples during 3 stages of embryonic development of the mouse brain was carried out with matching left-right asymmetry on four biological replicates at each stage.
