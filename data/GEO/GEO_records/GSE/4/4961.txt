TITLE
Identification of salt stress regulated genes in tomato seedlings by SSH and microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
High salinity is one of the most serious threats to crop production. To 1 better understand the molecular basis of plant responses to salt stress, we combined suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and microarray approaches to identify the potential important or novel genes involved in salt tolerance. First, SSH libraries were constructed for two cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) genotypes: LA2711, a salt tolerant cultivar, and ZS-5, a salt sensitive cultivar, to compare salt treatment and non-treatment plants. Then a subset of clones from these SSH libraries were used to construct a tomato cDNA array and microarray analysis was carried out to verify the expression changes of this set of clones upon salt treatment at various time points compared to the corresponding non-treatment controls. A totalof 201 non-redundant genes differentially expressed upon 30 min of salt stress treatment either in LA2711 or ZS-5 were identified from microarray analysis, most of which were not previously associated with salt stress. The diversity of the putative functions of these genes indicated that salt stress resulted in a complex response in tomato plants.
