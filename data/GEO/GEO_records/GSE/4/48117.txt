TITLE
Physiological and genomic analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae artificial hybrids with improved fermentation performance and mannoprotein release capacity

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast mannoproteins contribute to several aspects of wine quality by protecting wine against protein haze, reducing astringency, retaining aroma compounds and stimulating growth of lactic-acid bacteria. The selection of a yeast strain simultaneously overproducing mannoproteins and showing good fermentative characteristics is a difficult task. In this work, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae x Saccharomyces cerevisiae hybrid bearing the two oenologically relevant features was constructed and a reduction in the amount of bentonite necessary for wine stabilization was observed for wines fermented with the generated strain. Additionally, different copy numbers of some genes probably related with these physiological features were detected in this hybrid. Hybrid share with parental Sc1 similar copy number of genes SPR1, SWP1, MNN10 and YPS7 related to cell wall integrity and with parental Sc2 similar copy number of some glycolytic genes as GPM1 and HXK1 as well as genes involved in hexose transport as HXT9, HXT11 and HXT12. This work demonstrates that artificial hybridization and stabilization in winemaking conditions constitute an effective approach to obtain yeast strains with desirable physiological features as mannoprotein overproducing capacity and improved fermentation performance, characteristics genetically depending on the coordinated expression of a multitude of different genes. In this work, genetically stable mannoprotein overproducing Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains simultaneously showing excellent fermentation capacities were obtained by hybridization methods giving rise to non-GMO strains. The potential relationship between the copy number of specific genes and the improved features was also evaluated by means of aCGH analysis of parental and hybrid strains.
