TITLE
EDCs gene expression profile in MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are compounds that disrupt normal hormonal signaling. Examples are Xenoestrogens (e.g BPA) and Phytoestrogens (e.g isoflavones).

DESIGN
Comparison of EDC treated versus vehicle treated MCF7 parental cells. Each comparison in technical and biological duplicate.
