TITLE
Rat Pancreatic Tissue From Animals Fed Either an Iron Deficient or Iron Loaded vs. Iron Adequate Diet

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of pancreatic tissue comparing gene expression in rats fed an iron deficient or iron loaded diet vs. iron adequate diet. Goal was to determine changes in gene expression in response to iron status.

DESIGN
2 separate two-condition experiments: iron deficient (FeD) vs. iron adequate (FeA), and iron overload (FeO) vs. iron adequate (FeA). Performed in dye-switched duplicates. Samples pooled (n=6).
