SUMMARY
HIV-1 Tat induces the expression of interferon (IFN)-inducible genes in immature dendritic cells (iDC) in the absence of IFN production. We evaluated how three alleles of Tat and some Tat mutants differ in cellular gene modulation and whether a similar gene induction pattern could be detected by treating cells with IFN’s.  The three alleles and mutants, with the exception of mutants TatSF21-47 and TatSF2G48-R57A that do not localize in the nucleous, modulated to different degrees IFN-inducible genes without concomitant induction of IFN’s. The first exon TatSF21-72 and the minimal transactivator TatSF21-58, all induced genes to a significantly greater extent than full-length Tat. The 2nd exon appears to diminish the gene modulation that can be observed when the first exon alone is expressed. We investigated the effect of various Tat alleles and mutants on host cell gene expression in immature dendritic cells (iDC). The cells were infected with adenoviruses expressing the Tat constructs.

DESIGN
The Tat alleles and mutants are under a tetracycline inducible promoter and are expressed only in cells co-infected with Ad-tTA, which expresses the tetracycline responsive transactivator. 10e6 iDC were infected with 5 plague forming units per cell of the adenoviruses and cells were collected  10 and 20 hours post-infection. RNA was isolated and mRNA expression levels were analyzed by microarrays. As controls we used cells that were left uninfected and cells that were infected with Ad-LacZ, which expresses beta-galactosidase.
