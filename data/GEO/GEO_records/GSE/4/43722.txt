TITLE
The Toxoplasma unfolded protein response

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
To characterize the nature of the unfolded protein response in this Toxoplasma, we carried out microarray analyses to measure the changes in the transcriptome and in translational control during ER stress.

DESIGN
Total RNA or RNA fractionated into monosomes or polysomes were purified from parasites treated with DMSO or tunicamycin for 1 hour.  RNA was processed for microarray analysis using a ToxoGeneChip.
