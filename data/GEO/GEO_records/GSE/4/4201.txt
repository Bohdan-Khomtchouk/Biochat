TITLE
Zebrafish microRNA miR-430 promotes deadenylation and clearance of maternal mRNAs

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs comprise 1-3% of all vertebrate genes, but their in vivo functions and mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. Zebrafish miR-430 is expressed at the onset of zygotic transcription and regulates morphogenesis during early development. Using a microarray approach and in vivo target validation, we find that miR-430 directly regulates several hundred target mRNAs. Targets are highly enriched for maternal mRNAs that accumulate in the absence of miR-430. We also show that miR-430 accelerates the deadenylation of target mRNAs. These results suggest that miR-430 facilitates the deadenylation and clearance of maternal mRNAs during early embryogenesis. Keywords: Dicer, MZdicer, miR-430, miRNA target, maternal, zygotic
