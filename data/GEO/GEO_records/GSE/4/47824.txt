TITLE
HEK293T cells treated with actinomycin D for 9h

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we use transcriptome-wide analysis of mRNA stability in conjunction with MeRIP-Seq to demonstrate that methylated transcripts are more stable than their unmethylated counterparts.  We also find that coding sequence and stop codon-proximal methylation are highly associated with increased transcript stability, suggesting that the precise distribution of m6A within a transcript is important for its function.

DESIGN
Profiling of m6A in HEK293T cells after actinomycin D treatment
