TITLE
In vivo development, differentiation and function of brown fat proceeds in the absence of miRNAs 193b and 365-1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Brown adipose (BAT) development and function are unaffected by the absence of miR-193b/365-1

DESIGN
We refer to wild-type mice (+/+) as WT and to mice lacking the mir-193b (-/-) as Null mice.
