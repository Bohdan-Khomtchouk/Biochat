TITLE
A radiation-induced gene expression signature as a tool to predict acute radiotherapy-induced adverse side effects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The majority of patients tolerate radiotherapy well, but some of them suffer from severe side effects. To find genes possibly predictive for radiosensitivity, mRNA profiles were generated before and 6 h after in vitro irradiation with 5 Gy. We analyzed lymphocytes from four head and neck and eight breast cancer patients with strong acute radiation toxicity and from 12 matching normal reacting patients in a blind study. In peripheral blood lymphocytes of all patients, 153 genes were identified which were statistically significantly altered by a fold change of more than 50% by irradiation. Pathway analysis revealed genes involved in p53 signalling, cell cycle control and apoptosis in response to radiation in primary lymphocytes. In these cells, a set of 67 radiation-induced genes was identified capable of differentiating between severe radiosensitive and normal reacting patients. More than one third of such classifying genes belong to the group of apoptosis or cell cycle regulating genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from lymphocytes of cancer patients with strong acute radiation toxicity and from matching normal reacting patients were compared 6 hours after in vitro irradiation with 5 Gy.
