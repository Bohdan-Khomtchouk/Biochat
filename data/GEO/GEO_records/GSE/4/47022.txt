TITLE
Impaired Transcriptional Response of the Murine Heart To Cigarette Smoke in the Setting of High Fat Diet and Obesity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify biosignatures that describe these lifestyle susceptibility factors, we performed parallel exposures of regular weight (RW) C57BL/6 and diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 mice to cigarette smoke, either mainstream (MS) or sidestream (SS), mimicking both the smoker and environmental exposure through second-hand smoke, respectively. Transcriptional responses were measured by global microarray analysis of heart tissue.

DESIGN
Groups (N=6-8 biological replicates) of RW and DIO C57BL/6 mice (15-weeks old at start of exposures) were exposed to either filtered air (sham controls, SC), mainstream (MS) or sidestream (SS) cigarette smoke by nose-only inhalation exposure for 5 hr/day for a total of eight exposures over two weeks as follows: 5 consecutive days of exposure, followed by 2 days with no exposure, then three days of exposure, with necropsies occurring the day following the last exposure.
