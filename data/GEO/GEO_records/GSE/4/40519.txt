TITLE
Genome-wide GTL1 binding sites in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand how GTL1 regulates cell growth, we first identified its potential direct targets by the chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by the hybridization on an Affymetrix Arabidopsis Tiling 1.0R array (ChIP-chip). To enrich the genomic region bound by GTL1 in vivo, we harvested whole aerial parts of 12-day-old gtl1-1 plants complemented with the pGTL:GTL1:GFP constructs and immunoprecipitated the chromatin fragments associated with GTL1-GFP proteins using antibodies against GFP. After applying a cut-off P-values of 0.001of MAT (Model-based  analysis of tiling array), we identified a total number of 3,900 putative immediate target genes that showed consistent binding by GTL1.

DESIGN
Two IP chips compared to two Input chips.
