TITLE
Phenotypic changes in PMN in Periodontits patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to use a rapid method for oral neutrophil isolation and use a transcriptomics approach to characterize and compare the neutrophil gene expression profile in the blood and oral compartment of healthy individuals, chronic periodontitis patients and refractory periodontitis patients.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated neutrophils from blood and oral samples of Healthy patients, chronic periodontits patients and refractory periodontitis patients
