TITLE
Affymetrix SNP 6.0 data for analysis of esophageal adenocarcinoma samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Esophageal adenocarcinoma is characterized by complex chromosomal alterations. Tumors were evaluated to identify regions of recurrent copy gains and losses and to determine the prognositic significance of the degree of segmental aneuploidy as measured by SNP array.

DESIGN
41 superficial esophageal adenocarcinomas were analyzed for copy number abnormalities. Matched normal lymph node tissue was used as a copy number reference.
