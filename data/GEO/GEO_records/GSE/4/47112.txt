TITLE
Gene expression profile of frazzled (fra) mutant Drosophila embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In order to analyze the global changes in gene expression resulting from loss of Fra signaling, we performed a microarray experiment comparing Drosophila embryos containing a loss of function fra[3] mutation to age matched wildtype embryos.  RNA extracted from fra[3] mutant vs. wildtype embryos were hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip Drosophila Genome 2.0 .

DESIGN
We selected Drosophila embryos at stage 13, which marks the onset of Fra expression in the embryonic CNS and the early stages of commissural axon guidance in the ventral nerve cord.  RNA was extracted from both fra[3] and wildtype embryos. Hybridization experiments were performed on Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 microarrays.
