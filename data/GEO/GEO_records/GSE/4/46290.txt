TITLE
Large-scale downregulation of cytokeratins in amniotic epithelium after Group B Streptococcus choriodecidual infection in Macaca nemestrina: a pathway to PPROM

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Early events leading to intrauterine infection remain poorly defined, but may hold the key to a therapeutic intervention for preterm delivery.  To determine early molecular pathways associated with membrane weakening that may progress to preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), we examined the effects of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) on fetal membranes after a choriodecidual infection.
