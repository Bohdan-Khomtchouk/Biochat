TITLE
Global transcriptional profile of Streptomyces avermitilis wild-type strain ATCC31267 and avermectin overproducing strain 76-02-e at different time points

ORGANISM
Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680 = NBRC 14893

SUMMARY
To discover novel regulators that influence avermectin biosynthesis, comparative transcriptome analysis between wild-type strain ATCC31267 and avermectin overproducing strain 76-02-e were performed to reveal some differentially expressed genes.
