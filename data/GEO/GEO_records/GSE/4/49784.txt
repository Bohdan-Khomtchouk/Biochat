TITLE
The role of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) in hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) proliferation and self-renewal, as well as insult-induced differentiation, decrease markedly with age, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for these declines remain unclear.  Here we show that levels of NAD+ and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), the rate-limiting enzyme in mammalian NAD+ biosynthesis, decrease with age in the hippocampus.  Ablation of Nampt in adult NSPCs reduced their pool and proliferation in vivo.  The decrease in the NSPC pool during aging can be rescued by enhancing hippocampal NAD+ levels.  Nampt is the main source of NSPC NAD+ levels and required for G1/S progression of the NSPC cell cycle.  Nampt is also critical for oligodendrocytic lineage fate decisions through a mechanism mediated redundantly by Sirt1 and Sirt2.  Ablation of Nampt in the adult NSPCs in vivo reduced NSPC-mediated oligodendrogenesis upon injury.  These phenotypes recapitulate defects in NSPCs during aging, implicating Nampt-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis as a mediator of these age-associated functional declines.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from neurospheres derived from postnatal hippocampi subjected to 48 hours in vitro of incubation with Nampt-specific inhibitor FK866 (10 nM, 4 samples) or vehicle (DMSO, 1:1000, 4 samples).
