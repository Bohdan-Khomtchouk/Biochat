TITLE
How cyanobacteria pose new problems to old methods: Challenges in microarray time series analysis

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
Quantification of circadian gene expression in WT Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells

DESIGN
We quantified circadian gene expression of the wild type Synechocystis PCC6083 strain. Over a 24 h time course, 6 samples for RNA isolation were taken at the following time points: 30 minutes before and after light is switched off (sample 1 - CT 11.5 and sample 2 - CT 12.5), 30 minutes before midnight (sample 3 - CT 17.5), 348 30 minutes before and after light onset (sample 4 - CT 23.5 and sample 5 - CT 0.5) and 30 minutes before noon (sample 6 - CT 5.5).
