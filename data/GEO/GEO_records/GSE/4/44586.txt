TITLE
Genome-wide nucleosome, TFIIIC and TFIIIB occupancies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Paired-end sequencing study of nucleosomes and immuno-precipitated Tfc1 and Brf1 complexes from MNase-digested nuclei.

DESIGN
Nucleosomal DNA, input DNA and DNA from immunopurified TFIIIB and TFIIIC complexes (IP) were subjected to paired-end sequencing.
