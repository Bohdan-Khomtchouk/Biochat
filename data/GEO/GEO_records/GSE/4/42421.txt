TITLE
Expression profiles of primary motor neurons after knocking down Fus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To clarify the functional properties of FUS, we established the differentially expressed alternative exons in FUS-silenced primary motor neurons by using exon-sensitive microarray technology. To clarify the functional properties of FUS, we established the differentially expressed alternative exons in FUS-silenced primary glial cells by using exon-sensitive microarray technology. To clarify the functional properties of FUS, we established the differentially expressed alternative exons in FUS-silenced primary cerebellar neurons by using exon-sensitive microarray technology.

DESIGN
We analyzed total RNA of primary motor neuron infected with lentivirus expressing shRNA against mouse Fus or control. RNA was harvested 11 days after transfection. We analyzed total RNA of primary glial cells infected with lentivirus expressing shRNA against mouse Fus or control. RNA was harvested 11 days after transfection. We analyzed total RNA of primary cerebellar neurons infected with lentivirus expressing shRNA against mouse Fus or control. RNA was harvested 9 days after transfection.
