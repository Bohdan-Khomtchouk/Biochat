TITLE
The Swi/Snf tumor suppressor complex establishes nucleosome occupancy at target promoters [Mnase-Seq II]

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Precise nucleosome-positioning patterns at promoters are thought to be crucial for faithful transcriptional regulation. However, the mechanisms by which these patterns are established and dynamically maintained and subsequently contribute to transcriptional control are poorly understood. The Swi/Snf (Baf) chromatin remodeling complex is a master developmental regulator and tumor suppressor that is capable of mobilizing nucleosomes in biochemical assays. Yet, its role in establishing the nucleosome landscape in vivo is unclear. Here we have inactivated Snf5 and Brg1, core subunits of the mammalian Swi/Snf complex, to evaluate their effects on chromatin structure and transcription levels genome-wide. We find that inactivation of either subunit leads to disruptions of specific nucleosome patterning combined with a loss of overall nucleosome occupancy at a large number of promoters, regardless of their association with CpG islands. These rearrangements are accompanied by gene expression changes that promote cell proliferation. Collectively, these findings define a direct relationship between chromatin-remodeling complexes, chromatin structure, and transcriptional regulation.
