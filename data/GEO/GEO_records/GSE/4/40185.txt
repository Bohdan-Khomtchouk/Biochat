TITLE
Gene expression analysis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and a control normal oral epithelial cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to examine gene expression differences between human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (FaDu, UTSCC8, UTSCC42a) grown in culture in comparison to a normal oral epithelial cell line. Gene expression data was integrated with global protein expression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and conditioned media to identify secreted protein markers up-regulated at the mRNA level in cancer cells versus the normal cell line.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and a normal oral epithelial cell line
