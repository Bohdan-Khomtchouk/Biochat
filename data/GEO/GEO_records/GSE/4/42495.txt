TITLE
Macrophages in T cell/histiocyte rich B cell lymphoma strongly express metal-binding proteins and show a bi-activated phenotype

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a supervised principal component analysis, histiocytes from TCHRBCL were most closely related to epithelioid cells from NLPHL, with both types of cells expressing genes related to proinflammatory and regulatory macrophage activity.

DESIGN
39 microdissected histiocyte samples were compared with 9 sorted monocyte samples
