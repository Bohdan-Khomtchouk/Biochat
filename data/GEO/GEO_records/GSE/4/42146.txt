TITLE
RECURRENT SETBP1 MUTATIONS IN ATYPICAL CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq analysis of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia samples

DESIGN
We sequenced leukemic mRNA from 13 Atypical Cronic Mieloid Leukemia (aCML) samples  by Illumina GAIIx. Transcriptomic profiles, differentially expressed genes and pathway enrichment analysis were obtained comparing 7 SETBP1-mutated samples and 6 non-mutated (WT) samples by using TopHat aligner and SAMMate gene expression quantifier. We focused on the gene expression profile of known coding transcripts. A dataset of 20,907 protein-coding Ensembl Genes was obtained from the RNA-Seq by using the Human Ensembl GTF annotation file vs54 dowloaded from
