TITLE
ICL0011 - Host response in human Calu-3 cells to infection with A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG3/2004 (H5N1) (PB1-F2 deletion), A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG3/2004 (H5N1) (PB2-627E mutant) or WT: A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential expression was determined in Calu-3 cells between mock infected and infection with one of 3 Influenza viruses (wild-type VN1203, VN1203 mutant PB1-F2del, VN1203 mutant PB2-627E) at different times post infection.

DESIGN
Purpose: To obtain samples for transcriptional analysis in triplicate using the VN1203 pathogenicity mutants PB1-F2del and PB2-627E. Overview of Experiment: . Time Points: 0, 3, 7, 12, 18 and 24 hrs post infection. . There are two time points for wild type VN1203. . Done in triplicate. . Triplicates are defined as 3 different wells, plated at the same time using the same cell stock for all replicates. . Time-matched mocks were done in triplicate from the same cell stock as the rest of the samples. . Culture medium (the same as what the virus stock is in) was used for the mock infections. Calu-3 cells were infected with A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG3/2004 (H5N1) (PB1-F2 deletion), A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG3/2004 (H5N1) (PB2-627E mutant) or mock infected and samples were collected at 0, 3, 7, 12, 18 and 24 hpi. Calu-3 cells were infected with WT: A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) and samples were collected at 7 and 24 hpi. There are 3 mock and 3 infected replicates for each time point. Expression profiles were determined.
