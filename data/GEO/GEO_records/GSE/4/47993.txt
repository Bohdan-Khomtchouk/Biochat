TITLE
Genome wide expression analysis of FABP4 modulation in urothelial cancer cell UM-UC14 and UM-UC9

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profiling in FABP4 modulation UM-UC14 and Um-UC9 cells. The overall objective was to identify genes regulated by PPARÎ³ signaling pathway in particular FABP4

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from FABP4 modulated (either by FABP4 knockdown or rosiglitazone treatment) UM-UC14 or UM-UC9 cells compared to untreated control
