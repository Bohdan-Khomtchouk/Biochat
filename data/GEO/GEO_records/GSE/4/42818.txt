TITLE
Identification of c-Rel and RelA binding regions in stimulated EL4 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
c-Rel and RelA are members of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors. They both have important roles in T cell activation. To discover where in the genome c-Rel and RelA bind and hence which genes they may directly target, we used ChIP-chip with EL4 cells stimulated with phorbol ester (PMA) and Ionomycin. We have identified regions in EL4 cells (background strain: C57BL/6N) activated for 2h or 8h by PMA and Ionomycin, that bind the transcription factors c-Rel and RelA.

DESIGN
Immunoprecipitated samples from EL4 cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 2 h and 8 h with antibodies against RelA or c-Rel respectively were used for ChIP-on-chip experiments. In addition, samples from total input and mock immunoprecipitation were used as controls. Biological triplicates were used.
