TITLE
Genome-wide anyalysis of gene expression during prolonged endotoxin tolerance in Aoah -/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in explanted peritoneal macrophages from  Aoah -/- and Aoah +/+ mice treated with LPS 21 days prior to harvest. Explanted peritoneal machrophages were challenged with LPS or control (PBS). The study seeks to characterize global gene expression in the state of prolonged LPS tolerance induced in mice lacking the LPS-inactivating enzyme Aoah.

DESIGN
Groups of 9 C57BL/6 Aoah+/+ or Aoah-/- mice were given i.p. injections of 10 Âµg E. coli LPS/mouse.  Twenty-one days later (when Aoah-/- mice remain tolerant and Aoah+/+ mice have recovered), peritoneal macrophages were harvested and the yields from three mice were pooled to form 3 samples per group (i.e., three samples of Aoah+/+ and Aoah-/- mice, with each sample comprised of peritoneal macrophages from 3 mice). Next day, cells were challenged with LPS or PBS and whole RNA was isolated 2 hours later and used for microarray experiments.
