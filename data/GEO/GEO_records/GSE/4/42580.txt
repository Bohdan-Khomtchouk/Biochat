TITLE
PRDM14 Ensures a Naïve Pluripotency by a Dual Mechanism Involving Signaling and Epigenetic Pathways in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) fluctuate between a naïve inner cell mass (ICM)-like state and a primed epiblast-like state of pluripotency in serum, but are harnessed exclusively in a distinctive, apparently more naïve state of pluripotency (the ground state) with inhibitors for mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 pathways (2i).  Understanding the mechanism ensuring a naïve state of pluripotency would be critical in realizing a full potential of ESCs.  We show here that PRDM14, a PR domain-containing transcriptional regulator, ensures a naïve pluripotency by a dual mechanism: Antagonizing fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling that is activated paradoxically by the core transcriptional circuitry for pluripotency and directs a primed state and repressing de novo DNA methyltransferases that create a primed epiblast-like epigenome.  PRDM14 exerts these functions by recruiting polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) specifically to key targets and repressing their expression.

DESIGN
Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESCs) or mESC-like cells with different Prdm14 genotypes {Prdm14(+/+), Prdm14(-/-), and Prdm14(-/-) rescued with Avitag-EGFP-Prdm14 transgene [Prdm14(-/-)+AGP14]} are cultured on MEF in different medium [2i, Serum(day 2), Serum+MEK inhibitor (PD0325901) (day 2), Serum without LIF (day2)].
