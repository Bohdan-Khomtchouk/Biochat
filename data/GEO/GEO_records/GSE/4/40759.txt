TITLE
Transgenic Eµ-myc mouse lymphoma array CGH data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used array CGH data from Eµ-myc lymphomas to assess significant differences in DNA copy number variation between Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 lymphomas.

DESIGN
When Eµ-myc mice had evidence of lymphoma and/or ill appearance, they were humanely sacrificed and dissected.  Lymphoma tissue was obtained and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Later, lymphoma tissue was homogenized, and genomic DNA was extracted.  Array CGH was performed on genomic DNA, with genomic DNA from normal background strain mice used as the reference.
