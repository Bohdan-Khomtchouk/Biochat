TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional analysis of PE-2 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study we investigate the molecular physiology of the main S. cerevisiae commercial strain (PE-2) used on Brazilian bioethanol process under two distinct conditions: typical (TF) and flocculated (co-aggregated - FL) fermentation. Transcriptional machinery of PE-2 was assessed by high throughput sequencing-based methods (RNA-seq) during industrial fed-batch fermentations. Data from comparative analysis revealed distinct transcriptional profiles among conditions, characterized mainly by a deep gene repression on FL process.

DESIGN
We investigated the transcriptional changes in S. cerevisiae PE-2 strain under industrial fermentation conditions using RNA-seq protocols. We analyzed 13 fermentation time-points where 6 time-points on typical fermentation conditions (TF) and 7 time-points on flocculate conditions(FL). The raw data have been submitted to SRA as SRP014755
