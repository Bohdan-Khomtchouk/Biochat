TITLE
A potential relationship among beta-defensins haplotype, SOX7 duplication and cardiac defects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the pathogenesis of a patient born with congenital heart defects, who had appeared normal in prenatal screening.

DESIGN
In routine prenatal screening, G-banding was performed to analyse the karyotypes of the family and fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to investigate the 22q11.2 deletion in the fetus. After birth, the child was found to be suffering from heart defects by transthoracic echocardiography. In the following study, sequencing was used to search for potential mutations in pivotal genes. SNP-array was employed for fine mapping of the aberrant region and quantitative real-time PCR was used to confirm the results. Furthermore, other patients with a similar phenotype were screened for the same genetic variations. To compare with a control, these variations were also assessed in the general population.
