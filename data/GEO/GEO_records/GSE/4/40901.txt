TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of pancreas gene expression induced by maternal diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to characterize transcriptional changes induced by maternal diet in several adult tissues and to test whether differences in DNA methylation or microRNA expression could explain these changes. -------------------------- Note: non-normalized values and associated raw data cannot be located by the submitter

DESIGN
Total RNA from offspring of mothers fed high fat or low fat diets
