TITLE
The expression profiles of miRNAs in the heart with glucose fluctuation compared with sustained hyperglycemia.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We examined miRNAs expression profiles in rat hearts. The expression of five of 350 scanned miRNAs significantly differed between rat hearts exposed to vehicle and diabetic rat hearts. The expression of 31 miRNAs significantly differed between vehicle and diabetes with fluctuations in glucose levels, and that of 22 miRNAs significantly differed between diabetic hearts and diabetic hearts with glucose fluctuations.

DESIGN
Diabetes mellitus was induced with an intravenous injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) and glucose fluctuation was induced by a 24-h- fast and an insulin injection (0.5 IU/kg).
