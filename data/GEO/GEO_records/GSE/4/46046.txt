TITLE
Transcriptome analysis reveals an activation of MHC-I and MHC-II pathways in chicken trachea immunized with infectious laryngotracheitis virus vaccine

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an acute, contagious, upper respiratory disease, which is caused by gallid herpesvirus 1 (GaHV-1). Due to the mortality rates up to 70% depending on the virulence of the virus, it is of economic importance of the disease to explore the etiology of the ILT in the poultry industry. In this study, 15-day-old SPF white leghorn chickens were used to transcriptome analysis in chicken trachea immunized with infectious laryngotracheitis virus vaccine. In conclusion, chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccine activation of the MHC-I and MHC-II pathways provides insight into the molecular mechanism of immune response in chickens, and holds potential for evaluation and design of new ILT vaccines in a manner adapted to the host immune response to the virus.

DESIGN
Ten vaccine inoculated birds were randomly divided in two groups. Each group represents one replication of five pooled tissues, for inoculated birds. Control group consists of five birds that received sterile vaccine diluent.
