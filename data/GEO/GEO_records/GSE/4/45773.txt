TITLE
Expression data from GPR15+CD4+ and GPR15-CD4+ T cells in LILP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GPR15 is an orphan G-protein coupled receptor and its expression is abundant among T cells in the large intestine lamina propria. We used microarrays to examine charateristics of GPR15- vs GPR15+ CD4+ T cells in LILP and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes in GPR15+ CD4+ T cells.

DESIGN
We have generated GFP knock-in mice in GPR15 locus and used GFP as a maker for GPR15 expression. In heterozygous mice, GPR15+CD4+ T cells and GPR15-CD4-T cells were sorted and RNA was prepared from them.
