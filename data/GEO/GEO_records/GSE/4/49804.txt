TITLE
Expression data from dexamethasone treated mouse embryonic neural progenitor/stem cells isolated from wild type C57Bl/6 or caveolin-1 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neurosphere cultures prepared from E14.5 mouse cerebral cortex at passage 3 were treated for 4 hours with 100 nM dexamethasone We used microarrays to detail the global program of dexamethasone regulated gene expression  in embryonic neural progenitor/stem cells

DESIGN
Cerebral cortex was isolated from E14.5 mouse fetuses and cultured as neurospheres for 3 passages prior to treatment with 100 nM dexamethasone or ethanol vehicle for 4 hours
