TITLE
subventricular zone progenitors healthy vs. Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of subventricular zone (SVZ) progenitors comparing control healthy mice to mice induced to develop an autoimmune demyelination (EAE model). Goal was to unveil genes involved in demyelination-induced reactivity of SVZ progenitors.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, healthy vs. EAE derived SVZ progenitors. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 EAE replicates. SVZ progenitors were sorted in two cell populations: neuronal progenitors (PSA-NCAM magnetic sorting) and glial progenitors (NG2 magnetic sorting). Progenitors from healthy mice are reference samples.
