TITLE
Expression data from a human MLL-AF6 positive AML cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The MLL gene on chromosome 11 fuses to the AF6 gene on chromosome 6 in a balanced chromosomal translocation that is characetristic of certain adult and pediatric human leukemias. We established a murine leukemia model of MLL-AF6 using the retroviral MLL-AF6 contruct in a bone marrow transplantation system. The ML2 human MLL-AF6 positive leukemia cell line was used for gene expression profiling to assess the transctiptional profile in MLL-AF6 leukemias.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from the ML2 cell line cultured under standard conditionswith TRIZOL (Invitrogen), purified using RNAeasy(Qiagen) and hybridized onto Affymetrix arrays.
