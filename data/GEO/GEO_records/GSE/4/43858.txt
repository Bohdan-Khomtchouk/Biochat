TITLE
Patterns of Population Epigenomic Diversity in Arabidopsis thaliana (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Natural epigenetic variation provides a source for the generation of phenotypic diversity, but to understand its contribution to phenotypic diversity, its interaction with genetic variation requires further investigation. Here, we report population-wide DNA sequencing of genomes, transcriptomes, and methylomes of wild Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Single cytosine methylation polymorphisms are unlinked to genotype. However, the rate of linkage disequilibrium decay amongst differentially methylated regions targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation is similar to the rate for single nucleotide polymorphisms. Association analyses of these RNA-directed DNA methylation regions with genetic variants identified 2,372 methylQTL, which revealed the first population estimate of genetically dependent methylation variation. Analysis of invariably methylated transposons and genes across this population indicates that loci targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation are epigenetically reactivated during male gametogenesis, which facilitates their silencing across generations.

DESIGN
RNA-seq from naturally-occurring Arabidopsis accessions
