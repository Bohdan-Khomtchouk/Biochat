TITLE
Expression data from mammary tumors from a Diversity Outcross x PyMT mouse cross

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse genetic crosses were established between the PyMT model of metastatic breast cancer and the G5 generation of the Diversity Outcross (DO). Tumors were harvested from the animals for gene expression analysis to identify genes associated with progression to distant metastatic disease.

DESIGN
Gene expression of 133 samples from the Diversity Outcross were assayed on Affymetrix chips.
