TITLE
Expression data from T-cells isolated from healthy mice or mice with polyposis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
There is much controversy about the role of T-regulatory cells (Treg) in human colon cancer. High densities of tumor-infiltrating Treg can correlate with better or worse clinical outcomes depending on the sutdy. Treg have potent anti-inflammatory functions that have been shown to control cancer progression. However, Treg isolated from patient with colon cancer or in mouse models of polyposis do not have the ability to suppress inflammation and instead promote cancer. Gene expression was preformed to determine differences between Treg isolated from healthy mice and Treg isolated from polyp-ridden mice.

DESIGN
Treg (CD4+Foxp3-GFP+) and CD4+ non-Treg (CD4+Foxp3-GFP-) were isolated from various organs of healthy Foxp3-GFP reporter mice or polyp-ridden Foxp3-GFPxAPCÎ”468 reporter mice
