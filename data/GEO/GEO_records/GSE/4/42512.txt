TITLE
Human HAK-1A hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells: TCF-4J-overexpressing clone (under normoxia) vs. TCF-4K-overexpressing clone (under normoxia)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The microarray gene expression analysis revealed that TCF-4 isoforms activate different downstream target genes in HCC. TCF-4J upregulated genes associated with Wnt/beta-catenin, Notch, and insulin/IGF-1/IRS1 signal transduction pathway.

DESIGN
1 HAK-1A HCC clone overexpressing TCF-4J, 1 HAK-1A HCC clone overexpressing TCF-4K
