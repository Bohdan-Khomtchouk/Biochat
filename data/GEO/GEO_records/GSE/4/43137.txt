TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of mRNA from lungs of WT and Pglyrp1-/- mice sensitized with HDM

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild type (WT) and Pglyrp1-/- mice were treated with PBS or sensitized 5 days/week for 3 or 5 weeks with 10 Âµl per application of 2.5 mg/ml of purified house dust mite allergen. 3 days after the last sensitization the lungs were removed and homogenized, and RNA was isolated from the right lobes using the TRIZOL method. Quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify the amounts of mRNA in the lungs using custom RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays designed by us and manufactured by Qiagen/SA Biosciences.

DESIGN
qRT-PCR gene expression profiling
