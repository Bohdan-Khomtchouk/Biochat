TITLE
miR-34 regulates JARID1A expresion (SK-N-BE2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
p53 inactivation occurs only rarely in neuroblastoma, although miR-34, a transcriptional target of p53, is often deleted in neuroblastoma, suggesting  another way in which p53 signaling might be impaired. In this study we show that miR-34 directly targets and downregulates the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and its associated histone demethylase, JARID1A, in a p53-dependent manner,

DESIGN
4 samples were transfected with miRNA control or miR-34a, miR-34b, miR-34c into SK-N-BE2 cells.
