TITLE
Usp44 binds centrin to regulate centrosome positioning and suppress tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Most human tumors have abnormal numbers of chromosomes, a condition known as aneuploidy. The mitotic checkpoint is an important mechanism that prevents aneuploidy through restraining the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). USP44 was identified as a key regulator of APC activation that maintains the association of MAD2 with the APC co-activator Cdc20. However, the physiological importance of USP44 and its impact on cancer biology are unknown. Here, we show that USP44 is required to prevent tumors in mice and is frequently down-regulated in human lung cancer. USP44 inhibits chromosome segregation errors independently of its role in the mitotic checkpoint by regulating proper centrosome separation, positioning, and mitotic spindle geometry, functions that require direct binding to the centriole protein, centrin. These data reveal a new role for the ubiquitin system in mitotic spindle regulation and underscore the importance of USP44 in the pathogenesis of human cancer.

DESIGN
Study included 100 non-neoplastic (N) lung samples, and 69, 12, and 13 stage I, II, and II lung adenocarcinoma (AD) frozen tissues, respectively.  Expression levels of Usp44 in different stages of AD was compared against N.
