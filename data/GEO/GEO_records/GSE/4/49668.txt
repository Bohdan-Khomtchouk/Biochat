TITLE
Small RNA content in mouse serum upon S.mansoni infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNA that play important roles in disease processes in animals and are present in a highly stable cell-free form in body fluids. Here we examine the capacity of host and parasite miRNAs to serve as tissue or serum biomarkers of Schistosoma mansoni infection. Sequencing of small RNAs from serum confirmed the presence of  miRNAs and revealed 11 parasite-derived miRNAs that were detectable by 8 weeks post S.mansoni infection.

DESIGN
Small RNA content in serum of na√Øve and Schistosoma mansoni infected mice were examined in two different librarys. 1- prepared according to the  290 Illumina small RNA Sample Preparation Kit version 1.5 and sequenced on the GAIIX  and 2- prepared according to the TruSeq Small RNA protocol (without size-selecting small  295 RNA) and sequenced on the HiSeq2
