TITLE
Gene expression study in Neuroblastoma after BET inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied transcriptional changes by Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 microarrays in 2 Neuroblastoma cell lines after i-BET-726 treatment

DESIGN
2 neuroblastoma cell lines SK-N-SH and CHP-212 were treated with i-BET-726 at 100nM or 1uM concentrations for 16 hrs to study gene expression.
