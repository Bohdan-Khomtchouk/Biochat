TITLE
Expression data from Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315 hfq and hfq2 mutants

ORGANISM
Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315

SUMMARY
Hfq proteins are RNA chaperones that play a critical role in post-transcription regulation of gene expression. Bacteria of the Burkholderia cepacia complex harbor two distinct and functional Hfq proteins, the Hfq and Hfq2. We have previously performed the functional analysis of Hfq and Hfq2 in the pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315. In order to examine the impacts of each RNA chaperone on the global transcriptome of B. cenocepacia J2315, we performed comparative transcriptome profile of mutants on the hfq and hfq2 genes, using as reference the wild-type strain.
