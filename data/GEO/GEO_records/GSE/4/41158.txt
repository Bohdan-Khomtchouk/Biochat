TITLE
FBP1 expression in basal-like breast cancer MDA-MB231 and Hs578T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FBP1 is a rate limiting enzyme in glucogenogenesis and FBP1 expression changes cells to oxidative phosphorylation. Expressing FBP1 in basal-like breast cancer cells, which lack the expression of this enzyme, will identify the genes involved in glycolysis.

DESIGN
FBP1 was expressed in MDA-MB231 and Hs578T cells, stable clones were selected, and RNA was prepared for microarray analysis.
