TITLE
Gene expression in Drosophila Invadolysin mutant and wild-type

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We aimed to assess the consequences of loss of the Invadolysin gene on global gene expression by microarray analysis. Four biological replicates each of Invadolysin mutant and wild-type larvae were used to assess gene expression on FL002 microarrays (GPL5135).

DESIGN
Four biological replicates of invadolysin mutant and wild-type Drosophila. Two arrays had wild-type in Cy5 channel and invadolysin in Cy3 channel, the other two were reversed.
