Dnmt3L-dependent regulation of DNA methylation promotes stem cells differentiation toward primitive germinal cells [ChIP-seq]

SUMMARY
The de novo DNA methyltransferase 3-like (Dnmt3L) is a catalytically inactive DNA methylase that has been previously shown to cooperate with Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b to methylate DNA. Dnmt3L is highly expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) but its function in these cells is unknown. We here report that Dnmt3L is required for the differentiation of ESC into primordial germ cells (PGC) through activation of the homeotic gene Rhox5. By genome-wide analysis we found that Dnmt3L is a positive regulator of methylation at gene bodies of housekeeping genes and a negative regulator of methylation at promoters of bivalent genes. We demonstrate that Dnmt3L interacts with the Polycomb PRC2 complex in competition with the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b to maintain low the methylation level at H3H27me3 regions. Thus, in ESC, Dnmt3L counteracts the activity of de novo DNA methylases to keep low the level of DNA methylation at developmental gene promoters.
