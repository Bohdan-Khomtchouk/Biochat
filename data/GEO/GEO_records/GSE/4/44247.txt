TITLE
Lipoprotein lipase in chronic lymphocytic leukemia - strong biomarker with lack of functional significance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LPL co-deregulated genes after LPL specific siRNA knock-down In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA overexpression is an established poor prognostic marker, its function, however, is poorly understood. Measuring extracellular LPL enzymatic activity and protein, we found no difference between levels in CLL patients and those of controls, both before and after heparin treatment in vivo and in vitro. Investigating LPL knock down effects, we determined five potential downstream targets, of which one gene, STXBP3, reportedly is involved in fatty acid metabolism.

DESIGN
While possibly reflecting an epigenetic switch towards an incorrect transcriptional program, LPL overexpression by itself does not appear to significantly influence CLL cell survival.
