TITLE
The interactome of Pou5f1 enhancer in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of enyzme-based 4C-Seq technique for exploring Pou5f1 enhancer interactome in mouse ES cells.

DESIGN
We explored the interactome of Pou5f1 upstream enhancer in mouse ES cells by using an enzyme digestion based 4C-Seq protocol. The interactome is involved in gene active regulation.
