TITLE
Dmrt1 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1) conditional knockout expression analysis of E15.5 ovaries.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dmrt1 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1) is a conserved transcriptional regulator of male differentiation required for testicular development in vertebrates.  This study examines the result of conditional removal of Dmrt1 in E15.5 ovaries.

DESIGN
