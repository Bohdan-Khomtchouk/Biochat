TITLE
Phenotypic activation and repression of three ELAV-like proteins in Trypanosoma brucei

ORGANISM
Trypanosoma brucei brucei TREU927

SUMMARY
Three potential ELAV-like proteins of T. brucei, including Tb927.3.2930, Tb927.7.5380, and Tb927.8.6650, were either inhibited by RNAi or phenotypically activated by over-expression, followed by microarray analysis of the transcriptome. The results indicated that these ELAV-like proteins regulate the abundance of a large number of T. brucei transcripts, potentially through regulation of mRNA stability.
