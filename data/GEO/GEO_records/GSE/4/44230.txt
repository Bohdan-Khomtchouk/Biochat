TITLE
Gene expression in tomato in response to Pyrenochaeta lycopersici infection

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Transcriptional changes in greenhouse-grown plants of tomato varieties Monaymaker and Mogeor infected with Pyrenochaeta lycopersici compared to uninfected control plants. The objective of the the study was to give an insight into the establishment of compatible and incompatible interactions between tomato and the pathogen using susceptible (Moneymaker) and resistant (Mogeor) varieties of tomato. ****[PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Justyna Anna Milc.
