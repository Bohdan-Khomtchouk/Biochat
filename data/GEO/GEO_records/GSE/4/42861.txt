TITLE
Differential DNA methylation in Rheumatoid arthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation level was studied to determine whether Rheumatoid arthritis patients (cases) has methylation differences comparing to normal controls in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs). We used Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array to determine the genome-wide DNA methylation difference in PBLs from Rheumatoid arthritis patients (cases) and normal controls

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the Rheumatoid arthritis patients (cases) and normal controls were hybridized to the Illumina Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays
