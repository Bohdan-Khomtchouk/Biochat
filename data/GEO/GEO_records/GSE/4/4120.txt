TITLE
training induced gene expression in arrhythmogenic plakogloin (+/-) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Endurance training accelerated development of right ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias in plakoglobin+/- mice. Histology and electron microscopy did not identify right ventricular abnormalities. To identify differences in the transcriptional response to training gene expression profiling was performed. Keywords: expression response of plakoglobin (+/-) to training
