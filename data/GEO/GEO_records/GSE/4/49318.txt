SUMMARY
Genome-wide  gene expression analysis of new cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from resident c-kitpos endogenous cardiac stem cells (eCSCs) after myocardial injury by Isoproterenol (ISO) in mice. These data show that of new CMs derived from resident c-kitpos eCSCs have a gene expression profile  that closely resembles the specific gene expression of adult cardiomyocytes. This result supports a role of c-kitpos eCSCs in the regeneration and repair of myocardial damage.

DESIGN
To test the identity and the degree of differentiation of new cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from resident c-kitpos endogenous cardiac stem cells (eCSCs) after myocardial injury by Isoproterenol (ISO) in mice.  Global gene expression profiles by microarray was obtained in c-kitpos eCSCs, c-kitpos eCSC-derived YFPpos CMs and normal adult CMs. c-kitposCD45neg eCSCs were isolated from B6.129X1-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos/J mice and harvested at 4th passage (n=3). YFPpos cardiomyocytes were FACS sorted from left ventricle apex of Lentirius-c-kit/cre recombined B6.129X1-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos/J mice 28 days after ISO (N=3). Normal adult CMs were isolated from B6.129X1-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos/J mice (n=3).
