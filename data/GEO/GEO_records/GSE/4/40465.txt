TITLE
Large-Scale Identification of Coregulated Enhancer Networks in the Adult Human Brain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The complexity of the brain and the links entailed to its functional diversity remain a major challenge of biology to understand. Distinct anatomical areas regulate a vast array of processes including organismal homeostasis, cognitive functions and susceptibility to neurological pathologies, many of which define our species. Distal enhancers have emerged as key regulatory elements that acquire epigenetic modifications in a cell-type specific manner, thus enforcing cell- and species-specific gene expression programs. Here, we survey the epigenetic landscape of promoters and cis-regulatory elements in 87 anatomically distinct regions of the human brain, spanning over a hundred different anatomical structures.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq of various regions of the human brain. Also includes mouse and rat samples. Contributor: The Netherlands Brain Bank
