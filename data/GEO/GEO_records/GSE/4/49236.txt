TITLE
Gene expression of T47D-MTVL human breast cancer cells growing in normal conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Basal gene expression of T47D-MTVL human breast cancer cells growing in normal conditions

DESIGN
Breast cancer cells T47D-MTVL cells were grown in rich media and total RNA was extracted to monitor basal gene expression
