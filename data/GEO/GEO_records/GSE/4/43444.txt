TITLE
The effects of M3 muscarinic receptor gene ablation on murine colon neoplasia and gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In mice treated with azoxymethane (AOM), an intestine-selective carcinogen, both colon tumor number and size were robustly reduced in Chrm3-/- compared to WT mice.   In the present study, a microarray approach was used to identify genes that might have mechanistic relevance regarding the effects of M3R expression and activation on colon neoplasia, and also to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for colon cancer

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated colon tumor in WT mice compared to M3KO mice.
