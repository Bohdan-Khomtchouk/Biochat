TITLE
Transcriptional perturbations caused by SV40 large T antigen and its fragments

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The small genome of polyomaviruses encodes a limited number of proteins that are highly dependent on interactions with host cell proteins for efficient viral replication. The SV40 large T antigen (LT) contains several discrete functional domains that contribute to the viral life cycle, including the DNA binding and helicase domains.  In addition, the LT the C-terminal region is required for lytic infection in certain restrictive cell types. To understand how LT affects the host cell to facilitate viral replication, we expressed full-length or functional domains of LT in cells and identified interacting cellular proteins and performed expression profiling.  LT perturbed the expression of p53 target genes and subsets of cell-cycle dependent genes regulated by the DREAM and the B-Myb-MuvB complexes.

DESIGN
To examine transcriptome perturbations directly in human cells, we generated expression constructs of each LT fragment. Full length and truncated LT containing N-terminal HA and FLAG epitope tags were expressed from the pMSCV retroviral vector and introduced into U-2 OS cells. Total RNA was isolated from three biological replicate U-2 OS stable cell lines and gene expression was assayed on Affymetrix Human Gene U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.
