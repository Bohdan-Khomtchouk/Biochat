TITLE
compare of mRNA expression between IA and MMA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To exploring the difference of mRNA expression between IA and MMA, we have employed mRNA array expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes between the IA and MMA.  It's a compensate experiment after microRNA array, we paired the mRNA data with miRNA targets, finally, these data were used for the functional analysis.

DESIGN
2 IA and 2 MMA tissue were used for the microarray
