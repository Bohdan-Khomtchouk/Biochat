TITLE
The Aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein Ring1B combine to regulate active promoters in quiescent lymphocytes [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide distribution of proteins and histone marks in CD43 negative mouse resting B cells

DESIGN
ChIP-seq analyses of Aurora B, Ring1B, Bcx7, USP16, H3K27me3,  and Ezh2 were carried out on wild-typeCD43 negative resting B cells. ChIP-seq datasets obtained from  Aurora B knockout and RingiB knockout cells were used as  negative controls to validate the signals for Aurora B and Ring1B  from wild-type cells. 8WG16 ChIP-seq datasets were generated from WT (Cre-ERt2 homozygous) and Ring1B KO (Cre-ERt2/Rnf2 flox homozygous). RNAP-S5ph ChIP-seq datasets were generated from WT (Cre-ERt2 homozygous) and Aurkb KO (Cre-ERt2/Aurkb flox homozygous). ChIP-seq analyses of H3S28 phosphorylation (H3S28ph) and H2AK119 monoubiquitination (H2Aub1) in wild-type (Cre-ERt2 homozygous) and Aurora B KO (Cre-ERt2/Aurkb flox homozygous) CD43 negative resting B cells treated with 250nM tamoxifen (4-hydroxytamoxifen) for 48 hours. ChIP-seq analyses of the levels of unphosphorylated RNA Pol II (8WG16) and serine 5-phosphorylated RNA Pol II (RNAP-S5ph) were conducted in Aurkb KO (Cre-ERt2/Aurkb flox homozygous) and Ring1B KO (Cre-ERt2/Rnf2 flox homozygous) CD43 negative resting B cells treated with 250nM tamoxifen (4-hydroxytamoxifen) for 48 hours respectively). All libraries were prepared from sonicated, formaldehyde-crossilinked chromatin. For H2Aub1, ChIP was performed using micrococcal nuclease-digested, unfixed chromatin, instead.
