TITLE
Global gene expression profile of coronary artery disease in Asian Indians

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression profile of whole blood in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) showed significant upregulation of 343 genes and down regulation of 151 genes as compared to controls (p < 0.05). There was predominant differential regulation of inflammatory and immune response genes as well as early growth response genes in our dataset. Of the ten candidate genes selected for validation by real time PCR in an independent cohort, CXCL1, EGR3, IL8, PTGS2 and CD69 genes were up regulated and IFNG and FASLG down regulated in cases relative to controls.

DESIGN
We selected 13 patients with angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease (CAD) between ages 40 - 55 years and 11 population-based asymptomatic controls with normal ECG and matched for age, gendre and common risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension to that of the cases. Global gene expression profiling was performed on the Agilent microarray platform.
