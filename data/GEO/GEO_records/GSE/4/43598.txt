TITLE
miR-1061 and miR-591 are involved in paclitaxel-resistance and their regulation increases the sensitivity to paclitaxel

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression in paclitaxel (PTX)-resistant SKpac sublines was compared to that of the PTX-sensitive, parental SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell line using microarray and real-time RT-PCR. The function of differentially expressed microRNAs in chemoresistant ovarian cancer was further evaluated by apoptosis, cell proliferation, and migration assays.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from four different chemo-resistant subcell lines (skp 41,43,44,46) compared to parent cell line (skov3), human ovary cacinoma
