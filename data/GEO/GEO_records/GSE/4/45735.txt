TITLE
Changes in PBMC gene expression profiles after influenza vaccination in healthy human subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Daily sampling of peripheral blood from human subjects vaccinated for influenza was done immediately before vaccination and for 10 days after vaccination. Temporal patterns of gene expression, determined by RNA-seq, in unfractionated PBMC suggested migration of myeloid/dendritic cell lineage cells one day after vaccination.

DESIGN
Five subjects, 11 time points per subject (pre-vaccination and daily for 10 days post-vaccination)
