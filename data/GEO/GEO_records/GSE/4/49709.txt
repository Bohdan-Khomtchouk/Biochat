TITLE
Chronic exposure to fluticasone propionate shapes gene expression and modulates innate and adaptive activation pathways in human macrophages (LPS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we investigate how glucocorticoids affect the response to LPS in human macrophages.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from monocyte-derived macrophages exposed to lipopolysacharide presceding exposure to fluticasone propionate or left untreated.
