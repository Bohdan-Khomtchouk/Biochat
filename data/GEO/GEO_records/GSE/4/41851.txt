TITLE
Expression data from follicular lymphoma cells cultured either in suspension either as Multicellular aggregates of lymphoma cells (MALC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Follicular Lymphomas are blood tumors growing as spheres in patients. Before this study, there was no experimental model mimicking the 3D organization of these in vivo tumors. We develop such a model, called MALC, and performed a pan-genomic comparative analysis between MALC and classical suspension cultures. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression profile induced by aggregated growth of lymphoma cells.

DESIGN
10 days-old MALC and suspension RL cells were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix U133+ 2.0 microarrays.
