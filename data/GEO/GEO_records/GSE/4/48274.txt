TITLE
A novel insulin receptor-binding protein enhances glucose uptake and glucose clearance in vitro and in vivo through triggering insulin receptor signaling pathway

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, a novel IR-binding protein (IRBP) from Momordica charantia, named as mcIRBP, was identified by analyzing the physical and functional interactions between mcIRBP and IR. The hypoglycemic effect and mechanism of mcIRBP were further evaluated in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.

DESIGN
Normal and diabetic mice were treated without or with mcIRBP and RNAs from muscle tissues were extracted for microarray analysis. Number of replicate was three.
