TITLE
Expression data from iMyc mouse B lymphoma and human DLBCL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cross-species comparative gene expression profiling was performed to identify differentially expressed genes conserved in aggressive B lymphomas.

DESIGN
Whole genome expression arrays from mouse B220+ splenic B cells (wild-type C57BL/6, B6) were compared to whole tumors (approximately > 75% neoplastic cells) from B6.iMyc mice.  Correspondingly, isolated human peripheral blood B cells were compared to human diffuse large B cell (DLBCL) whole tumors (approximately > 75% neoplastic cells) DLBCL.
