TITLE
Dysregulated microRNAs in sapje and sapje-like zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs were isolated from wild type (SW and SLW; sapje-wild type littermates, sapje-like-wild type littermates) and sapje and sapje-like fish at 5 and 30 days post fertilization (dpf) Comparison of wildtype and sapje and sapje-like fish at 5 and 30 dpf to identify commonly dysregulated microRNA biosignature

DESIGN
This experiment includes 2 groups per cohort (SW1, 2 vs S1, S2 at 5 and 30 dpf) and (SLW1,2 vs SL1, 2 at 5 and 30 dpf)
