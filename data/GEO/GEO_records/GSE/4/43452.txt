TITLE
Gene profile of glioblastoma cells treated with y15 and temozolomide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gene expression profiles were identified in glioblastoma cells treated with FAK inhibitor Y15, temozolomide alone or with combination of Y15 and Temozolomide

DESIGN
DBTRG and U87 were treated with FAK inhibitor Y15 at 10 microM for 24 h; U87 cells were treated with Temozolomide 100 microM for 24 h and Y15+temozolomide at the same dose as each agent alone
