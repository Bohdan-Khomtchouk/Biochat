TITLE
Expression data of multiple sclerosis patients receiving Interferon-beta therapy [HG-U133_Plus_2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression dynamics of mRNAs and microRNAs in response to subcutaneous IFN-beta-1b treatment (Betaferon, 250 Âµg every other day) in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) or relapsing-remitting type of the disease (RRMS). By using Affymetrix microarrays, we obtained gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 6 patients within the first month of IFN-beta treatment.

DESIGN
EDTA blood samples were taken from all patients immediately before first, second and third IFN-beta injection as well as after 1 month. Total RNA of Ficoll-isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from each sample was extracted, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays to quantify the mRNA levels. This GEO entry provides the U133 Plus 2.0 microarray data.
