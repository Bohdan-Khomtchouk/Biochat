SUMMARY
This project is based on the hygiene hypothesis that exposure to TB provides a protective mechanism against asthma through specific cytokines and the balance of Th1, Th2 cells.  Additionally, expression changes are examined in patients with and without atopy in combination with asthma and PPD status.  Expression levels were evaluated in CD4+ cells isolated from peripheral blood of 30 patients.  Each patient was evaluated on the entire U133 Affymetrix GeneChip set. Hypothesis: That CD4+ cells have specific diagnostic profiles based upon atopy and asthma state. Further information at Specific Aim: To define diagnostic genes from purified CD4+ blood cells have specific diagnostic profiles based upon atopy and asthma state.
