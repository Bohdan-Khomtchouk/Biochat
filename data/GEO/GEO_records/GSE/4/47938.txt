TITLE
Multiple roles for LEC in initiation and elongation phases of snRNA gene transcription

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes have been widely used as a model system for understanding transcriptional regulation due to unique aspects of their promoter structure, selectivity for either RNA Polymerase (Pol) II or III and a unique mechanism of termination that is tightly linked with the promoter.  Recently, we identified the Little Elongation Complex (LEC) in Drosophila that is required for the expression of Pol II-transcribed snRNA genes. Here, we identify the molecular mechanism by which LEC specifically regulates Pol II-dependent snRNA gene transcription. We present genetic and molecular evidence from both Drosophila and mammals that LEC regulates both initiation and elongation stages of transcription of Pol II-transcribed snRNA genes.

DESIGN
In human HCT116 cells we performed: ChIP-seq of ICE1, ICE2, ZC3H8, ELL, and AFF4; total RNA-seq following ICE1 knock-down and non-targeting (GFP) knock-down; ChIP-seq of ICE1 and Pol II following non-targetting (shGFP) and ICE1 knock-down (shICE1).  In fly S2 cells we performed: Ice1 ChIP-seq following small hairpin knock-down of GFP (shGFP/non-targeting control) and Ice1 (knock-down of Ice1); ChIP-seq of Pol II following small hairpin knock-down of GFP (shGFP/non-targeting control), Ice1 (knock-down of Ice1), and Ell (knock-down of Ell).
