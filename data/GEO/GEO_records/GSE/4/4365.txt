TITLE
Balanced growth of Ecoli MG1655/pTrc99a(NOX+) at different growth rates

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Responses of Escherichia coli MG1655/pTrc99a(NOX+) grown at different growth rates in chemostat in M9 + salts NOX: NADH oxygenase converts NADH to NAD. Cells with NOX are able to recycle the excess NADH generated during rapid growth, leading to lesser accumulation of acetate Keywords: different growth rates in parallel
