TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Neurospora crassa cells containing MAK2Q100G allele: Exposure to ATP-analog (1NM-PP1) vs control

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
To study the consequences of MAK-2 activity modulation during vegetative cell fusion, we took advantage of a previously constructed allele of MAK-2 (MAK-2Q100G) to specifically perturb kinase signaling during germling vegetative cell fusion (inhibition of MAK-2Q100G activity by addition of the ATP analog 1NM-PP1 results in a phenotype indistinguishable from mak-2 deletion strains). Whole genome microarrays of mak-2Q100G cells following 20 min 1NM-PP1 treatment were performed.
