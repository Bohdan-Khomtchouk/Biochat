TITLE
Expression profile of CXCR6 Hi T cells or CXCR6 Lo helper T cells in CD45Rb Hi tranfer model mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the role of chemokine receptor in inflammation of colon, we isolated CD3+CD4+ helper T cells harboring CXCR6 from colonic lamina propria of mice We used microarrays to identify the differentially expressed genes between CXCR6Hi Tcells and CXCR6Lo Tcells

DESIGN
CXCR6 Hi or CXCR6 Lo T cells were isolated from colonic lamina propria for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
