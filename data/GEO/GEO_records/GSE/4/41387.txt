TITLE
Regulation of gene expression by YAP1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to define YAP1-specific gene expression patterns in gastric cancer, the constitutively active mutant YAP1 (YAP1-S127A) was over-expressed in MKN45 gastric cancer cells. Defined gene expression signature was later used to stratify gastric cancer patients according to the presence of the YAP1-activated signature.

DESIGN
Three groups of samples are included: 1. Mock control; 2. Vector control; 3. YAP-S127A expression. Gene expression profiles of YAP-S127A mutant-expressing cells were compared to that of mock and vector control. Experiments were done in MKN45 gastric cancer cells.
