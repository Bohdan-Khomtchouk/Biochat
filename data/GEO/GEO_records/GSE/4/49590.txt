TITLE
Expression data from 10 day old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to detail the global programme of gene expression comparing wild-type and RNAi knock-down plants of SPT4-1 and SPT4-2

DESIGN
Arabidosis seeds were stratified for 2 days and grown for 10 days on solid (0.8% Agar) MS in an plant incubator in a 16 hours day, 8 hours night rythm.  Only the aerial part was harvested 2h after turning on the light.
