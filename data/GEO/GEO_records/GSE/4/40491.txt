TITLE
Expression data from post natal mouse aortic heart valves treated with all-trans retinoic acid or a retinoic acid receptor antagonist (LE540) relative to DMSO treated controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our lab has previously shown that treatment of murine heart valve explants with ATRA promotes calcification in vitro. In order to fully explore gene expression changes in the valve in response to ATRA or LE540, a high throughput microarray was performed. In this data set, we include expression data from dissected murine post natal aortic valve explants treated with ATRA or DMSO as a vehicle control. These data are used to obtain 432 probe sets that are differentially expressed in response to ATRA treatment, with 118 being downregulated and 314 increased.

DESIGN
A total of 9 samples were analyzed; 3 DMSO treated controls, 3 LE540 and 3 ATRA treated experimental samples. Differential expression of probe sets were ranked based on false discovery rate ( < 0.1) and fold change ( > 2).
