TITLE
High-fat diet induced changes to mouse liver mRNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild-type c57Bl/6 mice were placed on high-fat diet (21% fat) for 3 weeks, and total RNA from liver was used for affymetrix microarray analysis. Data were analyzed using GeneSpring GX12.0.

DESIGN
Briefly, raw data was normalized using RMA (summarization algorithm) and quantile normalized, data was baseline transformed to median of all samples.
