Identification of E47 targets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In maturing T-lineage cells, the helix-loop-helix protein E47 has been shown to enforce a critical proliferation and developmental checkpoint commonly referred to as Î² selection.  To examine how E47 regulates cellular expansion and developmental progression, we have used an E2A deficient lymphoma cell line and DNA microarray analysis to identify immediate E47 target genes.  Hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression patterns revealed that E47 coordinately regulates the expression of genes involved in cell survival, cell growth, lipid metabolism, stress response and lymphoid maturation.   These include Cdk6, CD25, Tox, Gadd45a, Gadd45b, Gfi1, Gfi1b, Socs1, Socs3, Id2, Eto2 and Xbp1.  We propose a regulatory network linking JAK/STAT mediated signaling, E47 and SOCS proteins in a common pathway.   Finally, we suggest that the aberrant activation of Cdk6 in E47 deficient T-lineage cells contributes to the development of lymphoid malignancy. Keywords: gene targets for E47
