TITLE
Expression profiling in palatal mesenchymal cells stimulated with TGF-beta2 in the presence and absence of TGFbRI and Tak1 kinase inhibitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TGF-beta signaling in neural crest cells is required for normal craniofacial development. This signaling can be transduced via TGF-beta type I receptors (TGFbRI) using Smad-dependent or Smad independent signaling pathways. We used microarrays to identify TGF-beta-responsive genes that are dependent either on TGFbRI kinase, Tak1 kinase or both.

DESIGN
Primary palatal mesenchymal cell cultures were established. Cultured cells were stimulated with TGF-beta2 in the presence or absence of TGFbRI kinase and Tak1 kinase inhibitors. Unstimulated cells were used as controls. Total RNAs were isolated and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
