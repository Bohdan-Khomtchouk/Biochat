Differential gene expression by NKX2-1 suppression in NCI-H2009 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The NKX2-1 transcription factor, a regulator of normal lung development, is the most significantly amplified gene in human lung adenocarcinoma. To better understand how genomic alterations of NKX2-1 drive tumorigenesis, we generated an expression signature associated with NKX2-1 amplification in human lung adenocarcinoma, and analyzed DNA binding sites of NKX2-1 by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation from NKX2-1-amplified human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines.  Combining these expression and cistromic analyses identified LMO3, itself encoding a transcription regulator, as a candidate direct transcriptional target of NKX2-1, in addition to consensus binding motifs including a nuclear hormone receptor signature and a Forkhead box motif in NKX2-1-bound sequences.  RNA interference analysis of NKX2-1-amplified cells compared to non-amplified cells demonstrated that LMO3 mediates cell proliferation downstream of NKX2-1; cistromic analysis that NKX2-1 may cooperate with FOXA1.  Our findings provide new insight into the transcriptional regulatory network of NKX2-1 and suggest that LMO3 is a transducer of lineage specific cell survival of NKX2-1-amplified lung adenocarcinomas.

DESIGN
NCI-H2009 cells with stable expression of either pLKO-Tet-Op-shGFP (n=4) or pLKO-Tet-Op-shNKX2-1 (pooled population; n=3 and a clone; n=3) were treated with 50ng/ml of doxycyline for 48 hours. Total RNA was extracted, gene expression profiling was performed and differential gene expression between shGFP and shNKX2-1 was analyzed to determine the effects by suppression of NKX2-1 in NCI-H2009 cells.
