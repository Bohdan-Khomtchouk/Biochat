TITLE
Differential gene expression during cold-acclimation in barley, wheat and rye

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
The present transcript profiling compares the gene expression during cold-acclimation in different genotypes of  barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rye (Secale cereale L.) in order to determine factors influencing frost tolerance. Because of its outstanding robustness against adverse environmental conditions rye is considered to be a model species for abiotic stress tolerance. Wheat is moderate frost-tolerant and barley is most sensitive species in this study. The aim of this study elucidate conserved,  as well as, species-specific gene regulation across the Triticeae. Furthermore, transcript abundances were correlated between the distinct frost tolerances of genotypes within each species in order to find candidate genes for frost tolerance.
