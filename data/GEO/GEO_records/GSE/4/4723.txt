TITLE
Comparison of miRNA expression in Dickkopf1-expressing versus control newborn mouse skin

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
miRNA expression was compared in skin from control newborn mice and littermate mice ectopically expressing the potent secreted WNT inhibitor Dickkopf 1 (DKK1) in the epidermis. DKK1 completely suppresses hair follicle development. Multiple miRNAs were identified that reproducibly produced signals above background in both types of skin sample. Several miRNAs were identified for which hybridization signals were on average more than 2.5 fold higher in control samples than in Dkk1-expressing samples, suggesting these may be upregulated in hair follicles, and/or are direct or indirect targets of WNT inhibition in the skin. Keywords: miRNA expression array, transgenic mouse, skin, WNT
