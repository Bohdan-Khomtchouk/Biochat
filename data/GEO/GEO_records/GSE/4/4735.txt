TITLE
E. coli Transcriptome Dynamics during the Transition from Anaerobic to Aerobic Conditions

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Escherichia coli is a metabolically versatile bacterium that is able to grow in the presence and absence of oxygen.  Several previous transcript-profiling experiments have compared separate anaerobic and aerobic cultures.  Here, for the first time, the process of adaptation was investigated by determining changes in transcript profiles when anaerobic steady-state cultures were perturbed by the introduction of air. Escherichia coli strain MG1655 was grown in a New Brunswick Scientific Bioflow 1000 fermentation vessels (1.8 l capacity) with culture agitation speed constant at 400 rpm and the temperature maintained at 37 °C. Oxygen levels were monitored using galvanic oxygen electrodes while the pH was maintained at 7.2 ±0.2 by automatic titration with sterile KOH. Evans defined medium was used as the growth medium with glucose (30 mM) as the carbon source with the dilution rate being 0.2 h-1.  Anaerobic cultures were maintained by sparging the chemostat with oxygen-free nitrogen (95 %) and carbon dioxide (5 %) (0.2 l min-1).  The switch to aerobic conditions was achieved by sparging the culture with air (2.0 l min-1) in place of the above gas mix. After a period of 5, 10, 15 and 60 min exposure to air, cells were harvested directly into RNA Protect (Qiagen) to stabilize RNA before total RNA purification using Qiagen’s Rneasy Midi kit as recommended by manufacturer’s instructions. Keywords: time course response to air
