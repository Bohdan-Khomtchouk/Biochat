TITLE
Expression data from murine skin of tamoxifen-induced Ugcgfl/fl K14CreERT2 vs. Ugcgfl/fl

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tamoxifen-induced deletion of endogenous GlcCer-synthesizing enzyme UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG) in keratin K14-positive cells results in epidermal GlcCer depletion. We used microarrays to investigate the molecular consequences of Ugcg-depleted mouse epidermis.

DESIGN
Ugcgfl/fl K14CreERT2 vs. Ugcgfl/fl samples taken at day 21 post tamoxifen induction
