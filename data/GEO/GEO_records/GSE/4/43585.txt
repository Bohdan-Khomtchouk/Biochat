TITLE
Expression profiles of bone marrow cells from model mice for erythropoietin-deficiency anemia (ISAM)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We established a novel mouse model for postnatal erythropoietin (Epo)-deficiency anaemia, designated ISAM (inherited super anemic mouse), using a transgenic complementation rescue technique. To identify Epo-regulated genes in vivo, we examined the mRNA expression profile in the bone marrow of ISAM 6 hours after recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) administration.

DESIGN
Erythropoietin-induced gene expression in mouse bone marrow was measured at 6 hours after rHuEPO administration (3,000 U/kg). Three Epo-treated samples were analyzed, and two PBS-treated and one untreated samples were used as a control group.
