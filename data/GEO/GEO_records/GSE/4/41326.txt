TITLE
Expression data from HepG2 cells before and after RNF43 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It has been demonstrated that Ring finger protein 43 (RNF43) is overexpressed in colorectal cancer and mediates cancer cell proliferation. We found that RNF43 was frequently overexpressed in HCC, and knockdown of RNF43 could induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation, invasion, colony formation and xenograft growth of HCC cells. Suggesting that RNF43 is involved in tumorigenesis and progression of HCC. We used microarrays to profile gene expression patterns before and after RNF43 knockdown, and identified differentially expressed genes during this process.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were transfected with RNF43 siRNA or negative control siRNA in triplicate. Forty-eight hours after transfection, total RNA was extracted,labeled and hybridized to HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.
