TITLE
Gene expression data from primary human bronchial epithelial cells expressing EGFP or DN-GRHL2 for 48h

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The airways of the human lung are lined by an epithelium made up of ciliated and secretory luminal cells and undifferentiated p63+ Krt5+ basal cells. The integrity of this epithelium and its ability to act as a selective barrier are critical for normal lung function. In other epithelia there is evidence that transcription factors of the evolutionarily conserved grainyheadlike (GRHL) family play key roles in co-ordinating the expression of numerous proteins required for epithelial morphogenesis, differentiation, remodeling and repair. However, little is known about their function in the adult lung. We use Affymetrix microarray analysis to compare transcripts in lentivirus transfected primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressing either EGFP or DN-GRHL2 for 48h when the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) reached a threshold level. The goal is to identify direct target genes of GRHL2 and early events in the uncoupling of junctional interactions, including those regulating transepithelial resistance.

DESIGN
Primary HBE cells from three donors were infected with EGFP or DN-GRHL2 expression lentivirus. Dox was added for 48h to induce the expression of either EGFP or DN-GRHL2 when TER reached a threshold level in ALI culture.
