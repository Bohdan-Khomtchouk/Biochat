TITLE
A hypomorphic Lsd1 allele results in heart development defects in mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray characterization of Lsd1 knock-outs compared to littermate controls Microarrays were employed to identify transcripts that were differentially modulated in the hearts of wild-type and Lsd1-hypomorphic late-stage embryos.

DESIGN
Late-stage embryonic hearts were isolated from wild-type and Lsd1-hypomorphic hearts, in order to isolate RNA for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  We sought to identify gene products that are differentially regulated between the two genotypes, in order to explain the observed ventricular septal defects in the hypomorphic animals.
