TITLE
Expression data from D3, siSCR, siPRMT1 and siPRMT8 ES cell derived neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PRMT1 and PRMT8 knockdown D3 embryonic stem cells were generated (siPRMT) or as a control, scrambled sequence was introduced (siSCR). We used microarray to investigate the effect of PRMT1 and PRMT8 in early embryonic neurogenesis.

DESIGN
PRMT1 and PRMT8 knockdown D3 embryonic stem cells were generated (siPRMT1 or 8) or as a control, non-modified (D3) cells were used. We also used non target control, this case scrambled sequence was introduced (siSCR). Samples were collected at day 16 of differentiation and used for microarray. Three replicates each.
