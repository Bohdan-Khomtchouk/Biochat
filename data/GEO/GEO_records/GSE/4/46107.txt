TITLE
Expression data in response to WRKY40 and WRKY63 knock-out/overexpression (and in response to high light stress)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In response to WRKY40 and WRKY60 perturbation (and high light stress), significant transcriptional re-programming occurs particularly for genes encoding stress responsive mitochondrial and choloplast proteins. We used microarrays to analyse the response to WRKY40 and WRKY63 KO/OE in resonse to high light stress.

DESIGN
Wild-type (Col0) and transgenic WRKY40 and WRKY60 knock-out/over-expressing Arabidopsis plants were grown to 21-days and leaf samples were collected with/without high light treatment.
