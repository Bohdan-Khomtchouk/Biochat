TITLE
Overexpression of OsMADS29 in Oryza sativa var. PB1

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Overexpression of MADS29 results in severely dwarfed phenotype, resulting from a shift in auxin-cytokinin ratio in favor of cytokinins. To see the extent of change in gene expression in the leaves of the transgenic plants, whole genome transcript analysis was carried out using microarray.

DESIGN
Three biological  replicates of MADS29 OX (overexpression) lines and Wild Type PB1 (control) plants were used for microarray study
