TITLE
Epigenome analysis of primary breast cancer tumors and different types of recurrences.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of primary breast cancer tumors and their axillary metastasis and/or ipsilateral breast recurrence and/or contralateral breast recurrence. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs. Samples included 20 primary breast tumors and their matched axillary metastasis, 17 primary breast tumors and their matched ipsilateral breast recurrence, and 11 primary breast tumors and their matched contralateral breast recurrence.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 96 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2 contributed by Institut Curie  - Fabien Reyal
