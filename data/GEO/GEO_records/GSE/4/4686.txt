TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in Nicotiana benthamiana following NbCD1- or NbCD3-overexpression using SuperSAGE Array1

ORGANISM
Nicotiana benthamiana

SUMMARY
We developed a novel platform for genome-wide gene expression analysis in any eukaryotic organism, that we coin SuperSAGE Array. The SuperSAGE Array is a microarray onto which oligonucleotides of 26 nucleotides corresponding to SuperSAGE tag sequences are directly synthesized.  A SuperSAGE Array combines the advantages of the highly quantitative SuperSAGE expression analysis with the high-throughput microarray technology.  This technology was also applied to the detailed study of expressed genes identified by SuperSAGE in Nicotiana benthamiana, an organism without available DNA database. Keywords: transgene overexpression, transient expression
