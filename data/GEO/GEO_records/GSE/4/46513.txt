TITLE
RNA-sequencing analysis of 5' capped RNAs identifies novel differentially expressed genes in sessile serrated colon polyps (SSPs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-sequencing of SSP RNA from patients with serrated polyposis syndrome identifies VSIG1 and MUC17 as potential diagnostic markers for SSPs

DESIGN
5' capped RNA from seven ascending SSPs, six patient matched uninvolved right colon and two normal right colon samples was used for RNA sequencing (15 samples total)
