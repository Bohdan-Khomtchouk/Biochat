TITLE
E14 mouse molar tooth germs cultured with/without TCDD

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dioxins are ubiquitous environmental poisons that are developmentally toxic. Exposure of mouse E14 tooth germs to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) leads to reduced tooth size and deformation of cuspal morphology implying the induction of a variety of biological responses on both cellular and molecular levels. To verify such responses at the gene level, mouse embryonic cap staged tooth germs were cultured for 24 h with/without 1 ÂµM TCDD. Keywords: tissue culture, exposure to TCDD, tooth development
