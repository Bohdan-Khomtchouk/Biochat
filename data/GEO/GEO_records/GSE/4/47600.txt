TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles of Sca-1+ and Sca-1- cells post alveolar injury induced by P. aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Alveolar type II cells were isolated from mice before P. aeruginosa injection (basal state) and at 72 h post-PA, and were separated into Sca-1+ and Sca-1- populations.   Gene expression profile in the following four groups of cells were compared: non-PA Sca-1-, non-PA Sca-1+, 72 h post-PA Sca-1- and 72 h post-PA Sca-1+.

DESIGN
To determine whether the Sca-1+ type II cells appear post alveolar injury displayed generalized expression of progenitor-cell-specific genes, we compared gene expression profile of the isolated Sca-1+ and Sca-1- type II cells before and post p. aeruginosa indeced injury.
