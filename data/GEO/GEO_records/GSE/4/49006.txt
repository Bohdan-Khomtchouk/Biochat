TITLE
Expresion analyses of red2 deletion cells

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in red2âˆ†, compared to the parental wild-type strain. The red2 deletion cells analyzed in this study will be described in Sugiyama and Sugioka-Sugiyama.

DESIGN
An mRNA profiling study using total RNA recovered from vegetatively growing wild-type culture of fission yeast and red2 deletion cultures of fission yeast.  Each chip measures the expression level of 4.997 genes from S.pombe with fourteen 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with seven-fold technical redundancy.
