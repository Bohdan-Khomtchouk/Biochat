TITLE
Isolation and expression profiling of circulating tumor cells in breast cancer patients part 2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed a method to isolate pure circulating tumor cells (CTC). RNA from such CTCs isolated from the peripheral blood of metastatic breats cnacer patients and gene expression was performed using cDNAmicroarray. we used cDNA array  to compare  gene expression of CTCs with normal epithelial and breast tumor samples

DESIGN
normal peripheral blood, normal epithelium, and CTCs
