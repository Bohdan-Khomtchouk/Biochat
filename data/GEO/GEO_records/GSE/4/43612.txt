TITLE
Microarray analysis of microbiota of gingival lesions in noma patients

ORGANISM
Bacteria

SUMMARY
We used phylogenetic low-density microarrays targeting the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the gingival flora of acute noma and acute necrotizing gingivitis lesions, and compared them to healthy control subjects of the same geographical and social background. Various types of samples were collected (column characteristics); patients from the same hospital without mouth infection (H), matched control populations (T), patients suffering gengivitis (Gengivitis), patient suffering NOMA (noma), patient suffering NOMA receiving antimicrobials (N-ATB). Sampled from patients were retrieved from both sides (column Description); healthy- or lesion-side of the mouth. All controls are matched with specific patients (see column patient category and number)
