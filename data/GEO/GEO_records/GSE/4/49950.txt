TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Arabidopsis using strand-specific RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We applied single-end strand-specific RNA-seq experiments to compare the abundance of natural antisense transcripts in Arabidopsis.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 wild type (WT) organs, including leaves, inflorescences and siliques.
