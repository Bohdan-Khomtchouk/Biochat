TITLE
PHF6 knockdown in rat cortical neurons

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
E18 embryonic rat cortical neurons cultured in vitro are infected with lentivirus expressing control or PHF6shRNA-2, and harvested 5 days after infection

DESIGN
pLL3.7 lentivirus expressing control or PHF6shRNA-2 was generated in 293T cells and concentrated using ultracentrifuge. In vitro cultured cortical neurons were infected and RNA was harvested 5 days after infection. PHF6 knockdown was validated by QPCR before sample was processed for microarray analysis.
