TITLE
Identification of Novel Molecular Markers through Transcriptomic Analysis in Human Fetal and Adult Corneal Endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Corneal endothelium is composed of a monolayer of corneal endothelial cells (CECs) in the inner layer of cornea, which is essential for maintaining corneal transparency. In order to better characterize CECs in different developmental stages, we profiled mRNA transcriptomes in human fetal and adult corneal endothelium with the goal to identify novel molecular markers in these cells. By comparing CECs with 12 other types of tissues, we identified 245 and 284 signature genes that are highly expressed in fetal and adult CECs, respectively. Functionally, these genes are characteristic of CECs, involving in cell adhesion, proteoglycan and sulfur metabolic process. Importantly, several of these genes are disease target genes in hereditary corneal dystrophies, consistent with their functional significance in CEC physiology. By comparing fetal and adult CECs, we also identified stage-specific markers associated with CEC maturation, such as the activation of the Wnt pathway genes in fetal, but not in adult CECs. Lastly, by immunohistochemistry of ocular tissues, we further confirmed the unique protein expression patterns for Wnt5a, S100A4, S100A6, and IER3, the four novel markers for either fetal or adult CECs.  The identification of a new panel of molecular markers for fetal and mature CECs would be very useful for characterizing and quality controlling CECs through ex vivo expansion or stem cell differentiation for cell replacement therapy.
