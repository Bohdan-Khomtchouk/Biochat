TITLE
Gene expression profile in isolated E13 gonadal somatic support cells and E13 gonads.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gonadal sex determining (GSD) genes that initiate fetal ovarian and testicular development and differentiation are expressed in the cells of the urogenital ridge that differentiate as somatic support cells (SSCs), i.e., granulosa cells of the ovary and Sertoli cells of the testis. To identify potential new mammalian GSD genes, we analyzed the gene expression differences between XX and XY SSCs cells isolated from the gonads of embryonic day (E) 13 mouse fetuses carrying an EGFP reporter transgene expressed specifically in SSCs. In addition, genome wide expression differences between XX and XY E13 whole gonads were examined. Newly identified differentially expressed transcripts are potential GSD genes involved in unexplained human sex reversal cases.
