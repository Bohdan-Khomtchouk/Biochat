TITLE
The effect of vitamin D supplementation on tumorigenesis in a thioacetamide (TAA)-induced rat intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on tumorigenesis in a thioacetamide (TAA)-induced rat intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma model as vitamin D is known to have a spectrum of anticancer activities. Using PET, we found that tumor formation and progression were suppressed in rats fed a diet supplemented with 6 IU/g vitamin D3(+6D) as compared to the group fed a 2 IU/g vitamin D3 diet (+2D) or controls. Microarray analysis of the tumors that arose revealed that vitamin D supplementation caused significant up- and down regulation in 21 and 16 genes, respectively.

DESIGN
There are 9 tissue samples (3 rats in each group labeled as (+6), (+2) and control). Duplicate analysis were used for each sample.
