TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Postnatal Day 6 Testes Sired by Paternally Exposed Males to Saline or BEP

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To determine the changes in gene expression of testes from postnatal day 6 pups, a window in development where spermatogonial stem cells is predominant, following paternal exposure to saline or BEP, a chemotherapeutic coktail used to treat testicular cancer

DESIGN
Postnatal day 6 testes (2) of pups sired by males treated with saline (n=5) or BEP (n=5) for a 9 weeks followed by a 9-week recovery period
