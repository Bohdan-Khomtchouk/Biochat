TITLE
miRNA expression in Blimp-1-deficient dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression of Blimp-1 was specifically deleted in dendritic cells (DCs) by breeding Blimp-1 flox and CD11c-CRE mice. MiRNA expression was evaluated and compared from DCs, CD4+ T cells and total B cells from spleens of control and Blimp-1 KO mice.
