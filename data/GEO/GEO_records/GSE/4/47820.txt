TITLE
Gene expression changes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to linoleic acid hydroperoxide

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Reactive oxygen species, generated in vivo or exogenously encountered, constantly challenge living organisms. Oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which are susceptible to oxidant attack, can lead to initiation of lipid peroxidation and in turn rapid production of toxic lipid hydroperoxides. Eukaryotic microorganisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae can survive harsh industrial conditions that contain high levels of the PUFA linoleic acid and its oxidised derivative, linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LoaOOH). The precise signalling and response mechanisms induced by yeast to overcome lipid hydroperoxide stress are ill understood. We used genome-wide microarrays to investigate the changes in gene expression of S. cerevisiae to LoaOOH-induced oxidative stress.
