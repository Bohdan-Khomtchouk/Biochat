TITLE
Analysis of small RNA response to viral infection in C.elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Dissection of the small RNA pathway required for generation of an antiviral small RNA response

DESIGN
Small non-coding RNA (~15-30nt) was extracted from animals infected with the Orsay virus
