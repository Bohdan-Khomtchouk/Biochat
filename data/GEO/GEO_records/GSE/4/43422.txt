TITLE
Profiling of expression level in adult female Nasonia vitripennis

ORGANISM
Nasonia vitripennis

SUMMARY
The expression level in the parasitoid Nasonia vitripennis adult female samples was profiled and compared with the methylation pattern. Methylated and non-methylated genes showed markedly different patterns. The expression level was higher for methylated than non-methylated genes. non-nmethylated genes account for 99% of the genes that were not found to be expressed in the adult female RNA-seq data (FPKM < 0.1). Unlike methylated genes, the expression distribution of the non-methylated genes was bimodal with a lower expressed group and a moderately expressed group of genes, indicating that methylation status is not the only determinant of high expression in adult females. Methylated genes also have lower coefficient of variation (CV) of expression level across five developmental stages, suggesting that they are expressed more evenly across development.
