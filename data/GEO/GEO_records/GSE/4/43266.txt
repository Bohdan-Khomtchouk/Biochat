TITLE
scAT gene expression from women with PCOS following LC n-3 PUFA or placebo supplementation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expresion profiles from the scAT following 6 week LC n-3 PUFA and 6 week placebo supplementation were compared Women with PCOS were supplemented with 4g n-3 PUFA (containing 1.8g EPA and DHA) daily for 6 weeks and changes in subcutaneous adipose tissue gene expression was compared with 6 week placebo supplementation.

DESIGN
This was a cross-over placebo, controlled dietary intervention wherein women with PCOS received both treatments.
