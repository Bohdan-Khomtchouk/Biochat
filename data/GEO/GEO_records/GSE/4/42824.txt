TITLE
Molecular bases for tumor induced exhaustion in CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The immune system can recognize and respond to tumors. However there are some conditions in which the genetic instability and heterogeneity of tumor cells leads to the development of variants that can escape the immune system. T cells have infiltrated inside many tumors (Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes or TILs), but generally these TILs have lost their functional capacity and are unable to eliminate tumor cells.   We developed a model of autochthonous melanoma in mice that recapitulates some aspects of inflammatory melanoma in humans. These include a systemic Th2/Th17-oriented chronic inflammation, recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and acquisition by TILs of an “exhausted” phenotype characterized by expression of receptors for multiple inhibitory molecules. To address the molecular bases for the “exhausted” TILs phenotype, we performed transcriptomic analyses on sorted CD8 or T cells from the induced melanomas. These transcriptomes were compared to those of naïve CD8 T cells and of CD8 T cells immunized with a virus.

DESIGN
10 samples, 3 replicates for controls (untreated and infected with AdP1A), 4 replicates for TILs CD8 from melanoma
