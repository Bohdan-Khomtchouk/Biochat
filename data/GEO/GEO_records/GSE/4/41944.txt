TITLE
affy_tour_2012-02-Study of sunflower seed dormancy by translatome analysis

ORGANISM
Helianthus annuus

SUMMARY
affy_tour_2012-02 - Identification of transcripts that are addressed to traduction in imbibed seeds in relation with dormancy: comparison of the translatome in Dormant versus Non-Dormant seeds -- At harvest seeds are dormant. They stay dormant if they are stored at -20°C (D) and become non-dormant (ND) if they are stored 2 months at +20°C. Polysomal fractions were purified on sucrose gradients from sunflower axis isolated from dormant and non-dormant seeds imbibed at 10°C during 3h, 15h or 24h. - These fractions allow to identify the transcripts addressed to translation (translatome) during the seed imbibition process (3, 15 and 24h) - The translatome of 2 types of seeds are compared: Dormant vs Non-Dormant at the 3 time points.

DESIGN
18 arrays - SUNFLOWER; time course,treated vs untreated comparison
