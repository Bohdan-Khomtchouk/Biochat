TITLE
Direct reprogramming of human fibroblasts to functional hepatocyte-like cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Plasticity of differentiated cells has been proved by nuclear transfer, induced pluripotent cells and transdifferentiation. Here we show that by transduction of 3 factors (FOXA3, HNF1A and HNF4A), human fetal fibroblasts can be converted to hepatocyte-like cells (hiHep cells), expressing hepatic marker genes, and acquiring many mature hepatocyte functions in vitro and in vivo.

DESIGN
Human fetal fibroblasts (HFF) were tranfected with 3 liver enriched transcription factors (FOXA3, HNF1A, HNF4A), and converted to hepatocyte-like cells (hiHep cells). HFF and primary human hepatocytes (PHH) serve as control.
