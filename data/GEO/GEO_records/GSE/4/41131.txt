TITLE
Expression data in response to pepper leaf curl virus (PepLCV) infection in Chili pepper at three leaf stage

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
A comparative study to determine the pepper leaf curl virus resistance machanism between resistant and susceptible genotypes at three leaf stage. To study the molecular mechanism of pepper leaf curl virus (PepLCV) resistance, pepper plants were exposed to PepLCV through artificial inoculation and hybridization on Agilent tomato microarrays. The expression analysis of PepLCV resistant and susceptible genotypes after artificial inoculation at three leaf stage showed that the resistance against PepLCV is due to sum of expression of hundreds of genes at a particular stage.
