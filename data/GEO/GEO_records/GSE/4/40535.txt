TITLE
Genome-wide dMTF-1-binding sites in Drosophila S2 cells in the absence or presence of copper or cadmium

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Cells respond to changes in environment by shifting their gene expression profile to deal with the new conditions. The cellular response to changes in metal homeostasis is an important example of this. Transition metals such as iron, zinc, and copper are essential micronutrients but other metals such as cadmium are simply toxic. The cell must maintain metal concentrations in a window that supports efficient metabolic function but must also protect against the damaging effects of high concentrations of these metals. One way a cell regulates metal homeostasis is to control genes involved in metal mobilization and storage. Much of this regulation occurs at the level of transcription and the protein most responsible for this is the conserved metal responsive transcription factor, MTF-1. Interestingly, the nature of the changes in the gene expression profile depends on the type of exposure. The cell somehow senses the kind of metal challenge and responds appropriately. We have been using the Drosophila system to try to understand the mechanism of this metal discrimination. Using genome-wide mapping of MTF-1 binding under different metal stresses, we find that, surprisingly, MTF-1 chooses different DNA binding sites depending on the specific nature of the metal insult. We also find that the type of binding site chosen is an important component of the capability to induce the metal-specific transcription activation.

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with Drosophila genomic tiling arrays (ChIP-chip) was used to identify genomic regions directly bound by dMTF-1 in untreated and metal (Cu and Cd) challenged S2 cells. The dMTF-1 antibody was raised against amino acids 1-113 and 406-540 of MTF-1.
