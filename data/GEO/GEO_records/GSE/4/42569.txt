TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human CD4+ T cells differentiated into Th17 cells in the presence of high-salt

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Th17 cells are believed to be a critical cell population for driving autoimmune diseases. However, environmental factors that are directly related to the development of Th17 cells are largely unknown. High-salt (NaCl) concentrations enhance Th17 differentiation of human naive CD4+ T cells in vitro. The aim of the study was to analyse the changes in gene expression induced by high-salt conditions during Th17 differentiation.

DESIGN
Naive human CD4+ T cells were in vitro differentiated into Th17 cells in the presence or absence of high-salt. We arrayed 2 different donors for each condition (control & high-salt).
