TITLE
Human esophageal dysplasia (16 cases) vs. esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (59 cases)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our aim is to identify frequent genomic aberrations both in ESCC and esophageal dysplasia, and to discover important copy number-driving genes and microRNAs in ESCC. We carried out array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) on 59 ESCC resection samples and 16 dysplasia biopsy samples. Expression of genes at 11q13.3 was analyzed by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Integrated analysis was performed to identify genes or microRNAs with copy number-expression correlations.

DESIGN
Two group experiment, esophageal dysplasia vs. esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Biological replicates: 16 dysplasias vs. 59 carcinomas
