TITLE
miRNA profile of radioresistant pancreatic cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We established radioresistant cell sublines, named as BxPC3/RR1 and BxPC3/RR2 which were derived from parental human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC3. The miRNA expression profiles of the radioresistant pancreatic cancer cells were then compared with their parental cells.
