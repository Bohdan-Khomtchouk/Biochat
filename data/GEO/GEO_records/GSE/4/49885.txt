TITLE
miRNA regulation in diabetes associated impaired wound healing

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Circulating miRNAs constitute a novel class of disease biomarkers, which are altered in diabetes but the effect of diabetes associated inflammation as seen in chronic wounds is unknown. We here compared the miRNA pattern in diabetic patients in presence or absence of chronic wound with PAD.
