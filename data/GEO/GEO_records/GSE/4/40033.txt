TITLE
The gene expression pattern of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from patients with psoriasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Object: To study the difference of gene expression pattern of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) between psoriatic patients, normal adults and aborted fetuses, and then to explore the influence of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to immune system. Methods: Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) of 7 psoriatic patients, 4 healthy volunteers and 3 aborted fetuses were isolated and the BMMSCs were cultured using the adherent method. Gene expression of 14 samples was detected by gene microarray and the different expressed genes were analysised by SAM software. Results: 654 differentially expressed genes (66 up regulated, 588 down regulated) were detected between the psoriatic patients and normal adults, which were enriched in immune response, chemotaxis and cell adhesion etc. 2020 differentially expressed genes (888 up regulated, 1132 down regulated) were detected between the aborted fetuses and normal adults. These genes were enriched in cell cycle, cell division, immune response and MHC class II antigen etc. Conclusion: The gene expression pattern such as immune response, chemotaxis was aberrant in psoriatic BMMNCs, which was consistent with aborted fetuses in some immune related genes.
