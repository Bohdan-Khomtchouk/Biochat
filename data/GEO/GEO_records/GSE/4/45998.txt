TITLE
Effects of hexachlorocyclopentadiene (HCCPD)

ORGANISM
Daphnia magna

SUMMARY
Sublethal effects of the flame retardant intermediate hexachlorocyclopentadiene (HCCPD) on the gene expression and protein activity of Daphnia magna Reference sample is a composite of equal amounts of total RNA (500 ng each) from n=3 culture media controls and n=3 methanol controls

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment:  controls (methanol and cell culture) and three sublethal doses of HCCPD (0.138 ug/L, 1.38 ug/L, 13.8 ug/L). Biological replicates:  3 replicates each group.
