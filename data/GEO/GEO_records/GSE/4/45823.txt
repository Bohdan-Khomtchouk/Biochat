TITLE
Campylobacter jejuni transcriptomic response to benzylisothiocyanate

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Campylobacter jejuni is a widespread pathogen responsible for most of the food-borne gastrointestinal diseases in Europe. For pathogen control in the food industry, the use of natural antimicrobial molecules is a promising strategy to avoid antibiotic treatments. Isothiocyanates are natural antimicrobial compounds which also display anti-cancer activity. Several studies described the chemoprotective effect of isothiocyanates on eukaryotic cells, but the antimicrobial mechanism is still poorly understood. We investigated the early cellular response of C. jejuni to benzylisothiocyanate (BITC) by both transcriptomic and physiological (respirometry, ATP content measurements and isolations of aggregated proteins).
