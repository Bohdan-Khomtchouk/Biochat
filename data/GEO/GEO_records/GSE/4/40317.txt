TITLE
Constitutional Trisomy 8 Mosaicism as a Model for Epigenetic Studies of Aneuploidy (DNA methylation)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To increase our understanding of epigenetic patterns associated with aneuploidy we used constitutional trisomy 8 mosaicism as a model, enabling analyses of single cell clones, harboring either trisomy or disomy 8, from the same patient. We profiled gene and miRNA expression as well as genome-wide and promoter specific DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation patterns in trisomic and disomic fibroblasts, using microarrays and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation.

DESIGN
comparison of trisomy 8 cells with disomic as well as reference fibroblasts
