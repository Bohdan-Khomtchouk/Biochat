TITLE
Early molecular assessment of osseointegration in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the early temporal wide genome transcription regulation by the surface topography at the bone-implant interface of implants bearing micro-roughened or superimposed nanosurface topology.

DESIGN
Fourty four cp titanium implants with surface topographies exhibiting nanoscale features (Osseospeed-OS) and microrough surface without nanoscale features (TiOblast-TiO) were placed in the alveolar bone of 11 systemically healthy subjects and subsequently harvested at 3 and 7 days after placement. Total RNA was isolated from cells adherent to retrieved implants. A whole genome microarray using the Affymetrix Human gene 1.1 ST Array  was used to describe the gene expression profiles that were differentially regulated by the implant surfaces.
