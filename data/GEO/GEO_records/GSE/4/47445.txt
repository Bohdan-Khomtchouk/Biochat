TITLE
Adaption of Dinoroseobacter shibae to anaerobic conditions

ORGANISM
Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL 12 = DSM 16493

SUMMARY
To unravel the adaptation strategies of D. shibae to anaerobic conditions in microaerobic to anaerobic parts of the ocean and to define the underlying regulatory network an anaerobic shift experiment in Salt-Water-Medium in a chemostate was established. Transcriptome analyses were used to investigate the physiological status of D. shibae under this conditions.
