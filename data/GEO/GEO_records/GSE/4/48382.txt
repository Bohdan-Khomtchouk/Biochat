TITLE
ChIp-Chip using RNAP II, CREB C/EBPb and cJun antibody in undifferentiated or differentiated keratinocytes (expression)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Combinatorial recruitment of CREB, C/EBPb and Jun determines activation of promoters upon keratinocyte differentiation Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of RNAP II, CREB C/EBPb and cJun in undifferentiated or differentiated keratinocytes demonstrate recruitment of RNAP II to promoters bound by combination of specific transcription factors. Analysis of mRNA expression data from contrl keratinocytes or keratinovtyes where binding of transcription factors is disrupted demonstrate functional requirements for ceratin class of promoters

DESIGN
comparison of undifferentiated and differentated keratinocytes using mRNA expression data
