TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of DZNep treated B cell Lymphoma cell line Jeko-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Jeko-1 cells were culture with or without PRC2 inhibitor 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep)(1uM) for 72hrs. We used TaqMan® Human MicroRNA Array to quantitate miRNA expression profile regulated by PRC2.

DESIGN
qPCR miRNA expression profiling.
