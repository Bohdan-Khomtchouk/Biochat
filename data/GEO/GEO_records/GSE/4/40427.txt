TITLE
Identification of entertoxigenic Escherichia coli genes transcriptionally altered with the interaction of host cells

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Genes identified in ETEC E24377A after interaction with host cells (Caco-2) after time points of 30 min, 60 min and 120 min.  Both the adherent and non-adherent cells were profiled as well as E24377a grown only in tissue culture media.
