TITLE
5'-Serial Analysis of Gene Expression of the transcriptomes of Coprinopsis cinerea during fruiting body initiation

ORGANISM
Coprinopsis cinerea

SUMMARY
Large scale assessment of the transcriptomes of the vegetative mycelium and primordium will facilitate the generation of a more comprehensive picture of the fruiting process in basidiomycetes. We coupled 5'-Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (5'-SAGE) to high-throughput pyrosequencing from 454 Life Sciences to analyze the transcriptomes and identify up-regulated genes (URGs) among vegetative mycelium (Myc) and stage 1 primordium (S1-Pri) of Coprinopsis  cinerea during fruiting body development. We evaluated the expression of > 3,000 genes in the two respective growth stages and demonstrated that almost one-third of these genes were preferentially expressed in either stage, which implicated a significant transcriptomic switch during fruiting body initiation. We annotated > 34,000 and > 45,000 transcription start sites (TSSs) in the transcriptomes of Myc and S1-Pri respectively. We identified a wealth of potential URGs related to early fruiting events, although their functions and roles are not exactly known. This study serves to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of fruiting body development in the model mushroom C. cinerea.
