TITLE
Increased CLL Proliferation upon IgM stimulation is Sustained by the Up-regulation of miR-132 and miR-212: a Combined miRNA and Gene Expression Profiling Analysis and Correlation with Disease Progression [miRNA expression]

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
In order to investigate a potential involvement of miRNAs in BCR stimulation, in the present work we first evaluated their expression following IgM cross-linking in CLL cells, as well as in healthy B lymphocytes. Next, to infer putative miRNA targeting networks, we combined miRNA profiling results with gene expression and functional analyses
