TITLE
Global analysis of alternative splicing regulated by RBM10

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RBM10 is an RNA binding protein that was identified as a component of spliceosome complex, suggesting its potential role in splicing regulation. However, the direct experimental evidence for this function has been lacking. Here we characterized in vivo RBM10-RNA interactions and investigated the role of RBM10 in splicing regulation at the global level. We observed significant RBM10-RNA interactions in the vicinity of splice sites and identified hundreds of splicing changes following perturbation of cellular RBM10 abundance. A RNA splicing map integrating the binding pattern and splicing profiles revealed a significant correlation between RBM10-enhanced exon skipping events and its binding close to the splicing sites of both upstream and downstream introns. Furthermore, we demonstrated the splicing defects in a patient carrying a RBM10 mutation. Overall, our data provided insights into the mechanistic model of RBM10-mediated splicing regulation and established genomic resources for future studies on its function  in different pathophysiological contexts.

DESIGN
We sequenced the mRNA of HEK293 cells and LCL cells, and we determined the RBM10 binding sites using PARCLIP in HEK293 cells. In total we sequenced four mRNA-Seq libraries for KD and two for OE in HEK293 cells; for each of these libraries, we also sequenced one control library. We also sequenced the mRNA of one patient LCL and two normal LCL libraries. Two replicates of PARCLIP sequencing were perfomed.
