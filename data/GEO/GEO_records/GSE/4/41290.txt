TITLE
Gene expression analysis of SCG sympathetic neurons with loss of Egr3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Egr3 has been shown to have a cell autonomous role in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) development. We utilized microarray analysis to identify potential downstream target genes deregulated with loss of Egr3. Both conditions were in the null Bax background to prevent apoptosis and therefore mitigate identification of apoptosis related genes. Our analysis identified genes involved in biological processes that were expected such as SNS development and axonogenesis as well as those that were unexpected such as dendritogenesis and axon guidance. This led us to investigate whether Egr3 is important in these unexpected biological processes within sympathetic neurons.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from superior cervical ganglion (SCG) dissected from P0 mice with the genotype of Egr3+/+; Bax-/- or Egr3-/-; Bax-/-. Each genotype had 3 samples each.
