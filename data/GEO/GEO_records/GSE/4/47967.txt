TITLE
Cooperation of estrogen and oocytes on gene expression in mouse cumulus cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oocyte-derived paracrine factors and estrogens cooperate to regulate the function and development of mouse cumulus cells.

DESIGN
Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were isolated from ovaries of mice. Oocytes were removed from some complexes (OOX). Groups were cultured with/without oocytes with/without estrogen and then cumulus cell transcriptome analyzed by microarrays.
