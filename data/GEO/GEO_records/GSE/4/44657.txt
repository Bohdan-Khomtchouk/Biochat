TITLE
Expression analysis of INA6 cells after IL-6 withdrawal

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome expression analysis of INA6 cells on Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0 array set. IL-6 has been withdrawn for 13 hours which initiates apoptosis. Transcriptome-wide expression data was assessed by using TileShuffle (Otto C, Reiche K, Hackerm√ºller J. " Detection of differentially expressed segments in tiling array data " . Bioinformatics. 2012 Jun 1;28(11):1471-9. Epub 2012 Apr 6.).

DESIGN
We analyzed one Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0R set
