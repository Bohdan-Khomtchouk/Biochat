TITLE
Transcriptome Profile of Gα12-depleted OSCC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The elevation of guanine nucleotide binding protein alpha 12 (Gα12) expression is highly associated with tumor invasiveness in several human cancers. We used an siRNA strategy to deplete Gα12 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells and analyze the transcriptome profile by the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis of total RNA samples from OSCC cells. We analyzed OSCC cell samples using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by the Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool. No technical replicates were performed.
