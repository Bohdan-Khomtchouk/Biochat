TITLE
Methylation profiling classifies HIV-associated lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIV-positive patients have a higher risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with poor prognostic features. To characterize features of HIV-associated lymphoma, we compared the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in between 11 HIV-associated and 20 non-HIV lymphoma samples by Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip v1.0.

DESIGN
Bisulfite-converted DNA from the 31 samples were analyzed to obtain the genome-wide methylation profile by using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip microarray.
