TITLE
Time series of global gene expression after trivalent influenza vaccination in humans (female cohort)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of the study was to assess the patterns of global gene expression in peripheral blood cells before and at three time points after the administration of a trivalent influenza vaccine in human female subjects, and to relate these to the antibody response to the vaccine

DESIGN
128 healthy female human volunteers ages 19 - 41 years were recruited in the study. Whole-blood RNA samples were collected in PaxGene tubes before and at three time points after administration of a trivalent influenza vaccine. Baseline samples (before vaccination) are labeled as day 0. The three additional time points are days 1, 3, and 14 after vaccination. A total of 417 arrays, corresponding to 110 individuals, passed quality control, corresponded to individuals where at least two of the four arrays in the series were available, and corresponded to individuals who were ethnically homogeneous as determined by identity-by-state and multidimensional scaling analysis of their genotype data. That set of 417 arrays was used for analysis in the associated publication and was therefore included in this GEO upload. These are distributed as follows:  Day 0: 107 Samples  Day 1: 107 Samples  Day 3: 105 Samples  Day 14: 98 Samples
