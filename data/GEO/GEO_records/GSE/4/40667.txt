TITLE
CTCF binding patterns in mouse trophoblast stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This Series reports data from a CTCF ChIP-Seq experiment performed in F1-hybrid mouse trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). The data are part of a larger study examining inactive X gene expression and chromatin states, reported as GEO Series GSE39406. Included for this dataset are FASTQ files, BED alignments and WIG files with coordinates relative to UCSC genome build mm9, and _snp files that report the location of all SNP-overlapping reads

DESIGN
Single CTCF ChIP-Seq experiment
