TITLE
96 mRRBS libraries: Gel-free multiplexed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing for large-scale DNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sequencing based approaches have led to new insights about DNA methylation. While many different techniques for genome-scale mapping of DNA methylation have been employed, throughput has been a key limitation for most. To further facilitate the mapping of DNA methylation, we describe a protocol for gel-free multiplexed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (mRRBS) that reduces the workload dramatically and enables processing of 96 or more samples per week. mRRBS achieves similar CpG coverage as the original RRBS protocol, while the higher throughput and lower cost make it better suited for large-scale DNA methylation mapping studies including cohorts of cancer samples.

DESIGN
Libraries of 96 human samples
