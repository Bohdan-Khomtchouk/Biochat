TITLE
IL1R2 and glucocorticoid responsiveness in patients with AIED

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glucocorticoid responsive AIED patients demonstrate alternate splicing of IL1R2 in response to dexamethasone prior to treatment.  Identification of IL1R2 as a potential target gene in AIED was determined by a microarray analysis of patients with end-stage AIED and controls with non-immunologic etiologies of hearing loss undergoing cochlear implantation.
