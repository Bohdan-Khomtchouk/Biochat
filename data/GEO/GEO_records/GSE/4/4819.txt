TITLE
Expression data from control untreated mouse melanoma B16F1 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
B16F1 cells are a good model to study cell motility and cytoskeletal organization. In our lab, a combination of microscopy and gene silencing was used to approach the problem. Having gene expression profiles for B16F1 would facilitate and support subsequent gene silencing by RNAi as well as potentially identify new molecular players. We used microarrays to detail the expression profiles in cells cultured in regular conditions. These profile will serve as a reference point for further studies. Keywords: control
