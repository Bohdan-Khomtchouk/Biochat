TITLE
Expression data from untreated and IAA treated cells

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We investigated the physiological changes induced by indoleacetic acid (IAA) treatment in the totally sequenced Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. We used DNA macroarrays to measure the mRNA levels for all the 4,290 E. coli protein-coding genes and observed that 50 genes (1.1 %) exhibited significantly different expression profiles. In particular, genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), glyoxylate shunt, and amino acid biosynthesis (leucine, isoleucine, valine and proline) were up-regulated, whereas the fermentative adhE gene was down-regulated. To confirm the indications obtained from the macroarray analysis we measured the activity of 33 enzymes involved in the central metabolism and found an activation of the TCA cycle and the glyoxylate shunt. Keywords: treatment
