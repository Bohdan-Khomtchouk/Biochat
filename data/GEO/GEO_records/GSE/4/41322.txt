TITLE
Identification of miR-34c targets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we set out to characterize the mechanisms by which miR-34c deregulation contribute to PCa progression. The genes regulated by miR-34c in the prostate cancer cell line PC3 were identified by microarray analyses, and the top biofunctional pathways enriched for identified genes were found to be cell death, cell cycle, cellular growth, and cellular movement. One of the identified targets was MET, a receptor protein tyrosine kinase activated by hepatocyte growth factor, that is crucial for metastatic progression. see above

DESIGN
A total of 6 samples. Where 3 are ectopic expression of miR-205 and 3 are ectopic expression of a scramble mimic.
