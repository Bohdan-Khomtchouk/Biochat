TITLE
Sex differences in immune response

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In the field, adult male rodents are more frequently infected with hantaviruses than females.  Early data suggests that sex steroid hormones modulate sex differences in host immune response.  This project focuses on elucidating sex differences in gene expression in the lungs of infected males 15 and 40 days post infection with Seoul virus (naturally occurring hantavirus in Norway rats) relative to infected females 15 and 40 days post infection on 12 RG_U34 GeneChips.
