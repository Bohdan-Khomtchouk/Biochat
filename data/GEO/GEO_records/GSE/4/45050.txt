TITLE
Expression data from human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Cirrhosis, and non-tumor liver tissues.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There are significant differences in the expression of genes that regulate metabolic pathways in HCC as compared to Cirrhosis or non-tumor liver tissues. These charcteristic pathways can be exploited for metabolic imaging biomarkers of HCC. We used microarrays to perform genome-wide association study expression in human Grade III hepatocellular carcinoma and surrounding tissues.

DESIGN
Human tissues were obtained from as matched paired (HCC vs Cirrhosis or HCC vs non-tumor) or individually, and total RNA was exracted from these tissues. Quality control was performed on the total RNA to assess the quality and integrity of the sample. Affymetrix genechip for microarray gene analysis in two separate experiment. Statistical comparisons were made between groups and between paired samples of the same patient.
