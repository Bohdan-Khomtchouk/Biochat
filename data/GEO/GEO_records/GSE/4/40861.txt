TITLE
Expression data of Arabidopsis pollen tube of an AGP6 AGP11 double null mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabinogalactan proteins are proteoglycans known to have important roles during cell growth and development, namelly during pollen tube growth. A microarray experiment was performed on agp6 agp11 pollen tubes to search for genetic interactions in the context of pollen tube growth.

DESIGN
RNA from wt and mutant pollen tubes was extracted after 8h of in vitro germination and hybridized on Affimetrix microarrays.
