TITLE
Genome-wide Genotyping of Acute Myeloid Leukemia with Translocation t(9;11)(p22;q23) Reveals Novel Recurrent Genomic Alterations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify cooperating lesions in de novo and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) with translocation t(9;11)(p22;q23) we performed high-resolution SNP-array profiling on 40 leukemia samples [de novo: n=22; t-AML: n=16; unknown: n=2]. A mean of 1.73 copy number alterations (CNAs)/case were identified with no differences between de novo and t-AML cases. We identified a novel minimally deleted region (MDR) at 7q36.1-q36.2 partly overlapping with a MDR previously identified in core-binding factor AML; MLL3 was the only gene affected in both regions. In addition, a recurrent gain was found at 13q21.33-q22.1 harboring the potential oncogene KLF5. Sequence/expression analysis of selected candidate genes revealed deregulated EVI1 at high frequency (50%). Copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (CN-LOH) was absent in the paired cohort Further analysis of the candidate genes might provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of t(9;11) AML

DESIGN
SNP genotyping was performed on 40 de novo and therapy-related MLL-MLLT3-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia samples; Germline control DNA from remission bone marrow or peripheral blood was available for paired analysis in 15 patients. Data were processed using reference alignment, dChipSNP and circular binary segmentation.
