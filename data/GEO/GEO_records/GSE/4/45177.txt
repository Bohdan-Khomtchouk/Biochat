TITLE
Comparative analysis of gene expression in response to LL-37 treatment

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
To identify the potential LL-37-responsed genes, we treated cells with or without LL-37 and their correspondent transcriptional profiles were compared. Total 104 significant genes were identified. Among them, 70 genes are upregulated in repsonse to LL-37 while 34 genes are downregulated in comparison with the control cells.

DESIGN
LL-37 responsed gene was measured after 3 h growth in YPD followed by 30 min of incubation in the presence of 5 ug/ml LL-37 in RPMI.  Two batches of five independent experiments were performed.
