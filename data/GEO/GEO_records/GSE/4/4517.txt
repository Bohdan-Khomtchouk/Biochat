TITLE
Transcriptome of Nitrosomonas europaea with a disrupted nitrite reductase (nirK) gene

ORGANISM
Nitrosomonas europaea

SUMMARY
Global gene expression was compared between Nitrosomonas europaea wild-type and a nitrite reductase-deficient mutant using a genomic microarray. Keywords: wild-type to mutant global transcriptome comparison
