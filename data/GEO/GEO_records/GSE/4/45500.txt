TITLE
Gene expression profiles of unfertilized eggs of Ciona intestinalis

ORGANISM
Ciona intestinalis

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of unfertilized eggs of Ciona intestinalis was determined with microarrays.

DESIGN
To obtain gene expression profiles of unfertilized eggs, we took 14 biological replicates. For the first through fourth replicates, we also took a technical duplicate. Gene expression profiles of the 8-, 16-, 32-cell embryos were obtained with embryos from the third to fifth animals.
