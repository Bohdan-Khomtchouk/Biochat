TITLE
Progesterone receptor-dependent gene signatures in the mouse mammary gland after acute progesterone treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Progesterone (P) acting through its cognate nuclear receptors (PRs) plays an essential role in driving pregnancy-associated branching morphogenesis of the mammary gland. However, the fundamental mechanisms, including global cistromic and acute genomic transcriptional responses that are required to elicit active branching morphogenesis in response to P, have not been elucidated. We used microarray analysis to identify global gene expression signatures that are acutely regulated by PRs in the mouse mammary gland after acute P treatment.

DESIGN
Mammary gland gene expression data from 10-week-old ovariectomized wildtype and progesterone receptor null mice treated subcutaneously with 17β-Estradiol for 24 hours and then 17β-Estradiol plus Progesterone for 8 or 24 hours. Three replicate pools were tested with three mice per pool.
