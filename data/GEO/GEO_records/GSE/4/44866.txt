TITLE
Classification of cancer cell lines using a promoter-targeted liquid hybridization capture-based bisulfite sequencing approach

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation plays a significant role in assuring cell identity, thus potentiating its application in molecular classification of cancers in respect of tissue origins or clinically and aetiologically distinct subtypes. In this study, we adapted our liquid hybridization capture-based bisulfite sequencing approach on the targeted sequencing of promoter methylomes. We detected ten cell lines originated from different tissue origins and demonstrated a similar potentiality of promoter methylomes as classifiers for cancer cell lines from different tissue origins in comparison with gene expression profiles. Furthermore, promoter methylome can sensitively differentiate two different cell lines from the same tissue origin in respect of the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), as in the case of AGS and BGC-823 gastric cancer cell lines. These results potentiate the targeted sequencing of promoter methylomes as a means for comprehensive screening and classifying cancer cells with respect to tissue-origins and CIMP subtypes in the future studies.

DESIGN
We proved the potentiality of promoter-targeted LHC-BS that requires reduced experimental cost and less amount of initial DNA samples in comparison with a previous design [23] using YH cell line. In addition, we generated single-base promoter methylomes for ten cell lines, including eight cancer cell lines generated from four types of tissues and one pair of model cell lines for ovarian cancer (T29 and T29H).
