TITLE
MLLT10 gene recombinations in pediatric T-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MLLT10, a 24 exons gene at 10p12, is known in leukemogenesis as partner of MLL or PICALM and recently NAP1L1. We identified HNRNPH1 and DDX3X, genes involved in RNA processing, as new MLLT10 partners in 2 cases of pediatric NOTCH1 positive T-ALL. HNRNPH1/5q35 encodes for a member of the ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) subfamily of RNA binding protein. DDX3X/Xp11.3, belongs to the big family of RNA helicases with a DEAD box domain.

DESIGN
Whole genome analysis by SNPs and Combined Interphase FISH (CI-FISH) identified different co-operating lesions in the two cases. Fusion isoforms were found in both cases: interestingly all fusions retained the OM-LZ domain of MLLT10 that is needed to induce Acute Myeloid Leukemia in mice. Gene expression profiling (GEP) of the two new MLLT10 fusions was similar to PICALM-MLLT10 positive but differed from other HOXA positive T-ALL, suggesting MLLT10 fusions share a common leukemogenic pathway. Clinical data indicate relative good prognosis in T-ALL with MLLT10 variants. This submission represents the gene expression component of the study [For privacy reasons, SNP data will not be deposited].
