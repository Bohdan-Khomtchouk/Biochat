TITLE
Expression profiles of primary cortical neurons after knocking down Tdp-43

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To clarify the functional properties of Tdp-43, we established the differentially expressed alternative exons in Tdp-43-silenced primary cortical neurons by using exon-sensitive microarray technology.

DESIGN
We analyzed total RNA of primary motor neuron infected with lentivirus expressing shRNA against mouse Tdp-43 or control. RNA was harvested 11 days after transfection.
