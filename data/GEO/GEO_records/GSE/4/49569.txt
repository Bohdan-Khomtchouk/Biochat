TITLE
Plasticity of the ripening process among berry classes

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Investigation of gene expression differences between three tissues of developmentally different berry classes before, at the onset of ripening, and at maturity The berry classes analyzed in these studies were at prevéraison stage, at midvéraison and 5 week postmidvéraison.

DESIGN
A 63-array study on gene expression variability among developmentally berry classes (PV, GS, PS, RS, GSH, PSH, RSH) sampled at three developmental stages (prevéraison for PV, midvéraison for GS, PS, and RS and maturityfor GSH, PSH, and RSH ) in skin, seed, and pulp tissues. Each data point was performed in triplicate
