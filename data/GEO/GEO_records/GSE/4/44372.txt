TITLE
Gene expression profile in visceral-pancreatic adipose tissue from control rats fed a standard chow diet and obese rats fed a high-caloric cafeteria diet for 30 days.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Changes in the secretion profile of visceral-pancreatic white adipose tissue due to diet-induced obesity are partially responsible for increased beta cell replication, suggesting that a crosstalk between pWAT and beta cells may play a role in regulating beta cell plasticity. The molecular mechanisms underlying this cross-talk are still not fully understood. The aim of this study was to integrate transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data to unravel the cross-talk between adipose tissue and pancreatic islets during evolution of obesity.

DESIGN
Adipose tissue from control lean and obese rats were obtained. RNA was extracted and processed for further hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays (GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)).
