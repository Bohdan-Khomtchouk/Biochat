TITLE
Expression data from dexamethsone-treated human adipose stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we aimed to gain further insight on the role of GCs in adipocyte differentiation. For the future drugability of candidate targets it is of utmost importance to find factors relevant to human biology. Thus, we analyzed the transcriptome of GC induced primary human adipose stem cells (hASC) to identify novel factors downstream of GC action We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression following glucocorticoid treatment and identified distinct classes of up- and downregulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Human preadipocytes (human adipose stem cells) were obtained from lipoaspirates by enzamytic digestions, followed by several steps of centrifugations (Mikkelsen et. al Cell. 2010 Oct 1;143(1):156-69.). Following isolation, human adipos estemm cells were treated with Dexamethasone (100nM) for various times.
