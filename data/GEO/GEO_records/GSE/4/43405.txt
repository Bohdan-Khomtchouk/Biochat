TITLE
Identifying vitamin C and RA-regulated genes in the J1 mESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It has been demonstrated that vitamin C enhances reprogramming efficiency during inducing pluripotent stem cells, however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. To find the downstream target genes of vitamin C and investigate the mechanism of vitamin C on reprogramming promotion, we performed Microarray analyses to identify its downstream targets. Retinoic acid (RA), a stimulus molecule for cellular differentiation, is set as negative control. The data show the genes regulated by vitamin C or RA.

DESIGN
J1 mESCs maintained in medium containing 1000 U/mL LIF and supplemented without or with vitamin C or RA for 24 hours, then total RNA was extracted for analysis.
