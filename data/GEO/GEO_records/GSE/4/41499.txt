TITLE
Expression profiling of ovarian cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Paired platinum-sensitive & platinum-resistant cell lines PEO1 and PEO4 (respectively) were derived from the same patient. Cell line cultures were profiled with the HT-HGU133a GeneChip to investigate chemotherapy resistance related expression of genes marked with different histone modifications in a primary ovarian tumour (clinical data for the primary ovarian tumour is available as Series supplementary file).

DESIGN
4 replicates of each of the PEO1 and PEO4 cell line were profiled using the HT-HGU133a GeneChip
