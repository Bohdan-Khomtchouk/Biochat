TITLE
Karyotyping using SNP array of  primary uveal melanoma cells, normal uveal melanocytes, neural crest stem cells, embryonic stem cells and uveal melanoma cell lines MUM2B and OCM1A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Karyotyping by SNP array of primary uveal melanoma samples, uveal melanoma cell lines and normal controls

DESIGN
The Human660WQuad v1.0 DNA Analysis Bead Chip and kit were used for high resolution molecular karyotyping of DNA isolated from snap-frozen primary uveal melanoma tissue isolated from enucleated eyes.
