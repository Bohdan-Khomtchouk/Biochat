TITLE
Expression data from the comparison between poly(I:C)-treated WT and Oasl1-/- BMDMs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oasl1-/- BMDMs express more type I IFN upon poly(I:C) treatment. Because OASL1 seems to rather specifically suppress the type I IFN expression, we tried to address the specificity by determining the defects associated with the Oasl1 mutation using genome-wide gene expression microarray analysis under moderate poly(I:C) stimulation (5 Âµg/ml for 9 h); this condition was used to identify the primary targets of OASL1 while minimizing the secondary targets induced by the earlier, higher production of type I IFNs in Oasl1-/- cells. Only 23 genes out of approximately 35,000 probed transcripts showed a signal difference greater than two-fold between the WT and KO cells; 15 showed higher signals in KO cells while 8 showed lower signals in KO cells

DESIGN
We analyzed total RNA from poly(I:C)-treated WT and Oasl1-/- BMDM using the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array. Array data were processed by Affymetrix GCOS software. We compared these using Affymetrix Expression console1.1, TMEV4.4, DAVID.
