TITLE
IF002 - Custom designed Agilent arrays result on the Cystic Fibrosis model in ferrets.

ORGANISM
Mustela putorius furo

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to use newly designed ferret Agilent arrays to compare transcriptome profiles between wild type, CF3959(-/-) and CF3959(+/-) ferrets.  Lung and trachea tissues from newborn and 15 day-old ferrets were RNA-extracted and subsequently analyzed by microarray.

DESIGN
Using the newly designed ferret Agilent arrays, we compared the transcriptome profiles between wild type, CF3959(-/-) and CF3959(+/-) ferrets.  Samples sets: RNA from a combination of trachea and lung tissue from 4 newborn wild type ferrets and 4 newborn CF3959(-/-) ferrets.  In addition, lung tissue from two 15 day-old wild type, three 15 day-old CF3959(+/-) and three 15 day-old CF3959(-/-) ferrets was RNA-extracted and subsequently analyzed by microarray.
