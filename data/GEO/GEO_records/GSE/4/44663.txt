TITLE
Expression data from adult mouse mesenteric arteries

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Vascular smooth muscle cells require beta1 integrin for survival. Following the induced deletion of smooth muscle beta1 integrin, smooth muscle cells undergo apoptosis and arteries become fibrotic. This microarray study on mesenteric arteries 2 weeks after the initiation of beta1 integrin deletion specifically in smooth muscle cells of the adult mouse aimed to examine early changes in expression following deletion.

DESIGN
Mesenteric arteries from three wild type mixed background and three beta1 integrin smooth muscle knockout mixed background mice are examined.
