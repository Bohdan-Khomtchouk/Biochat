TITLE
Isolation of human skeletal muscle precursor cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Novel fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) strategies to prospectively purify functionally distinct cell populations from the human myofiber-associated (hMFA) cell compartment, including human Skeletal Muscle Precursor cells (hSMPs): HSMPs, identified as CD45-Mac1-GlyA-CD31-CD34-CD56intITGA7hi hMFA cells, are highly enriched for cells expressing the satellite cell marker PAX7 and show efficient myogenic and lack adipogenic capacity. CD45-CD11b-GlyA-CD31-CD34+ hMFA cells (CD34+ cells) do not express PAX7, lack myogenic and exhibit adipogenic activity.

DESIGN
We used Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays to gain deeper insights into the molecular underpinnings functionally and phenotypically discrete human myofiber-associated cell subsets.
