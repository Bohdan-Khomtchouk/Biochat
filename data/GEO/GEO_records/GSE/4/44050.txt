TITLE
Expression data from Sox4 knockdown cells in the presence and absence of TGFβ in NMuMG cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling after Sox4 knockdown (KD) during epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NMuMG reveals a significant number of genes that are transcriptionally deregulated.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling is performed in Sox4-ablated (siSox4) NMuMG cells. Cells transfected with siControl is used as a control. The cells were either treated with transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ; 2ng/ml) or not.
