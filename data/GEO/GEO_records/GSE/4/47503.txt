TITLE
Identification of novel gene targets and functions of p21-activated kinase 1 during DNA damage by gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of the study was to identify new PAK1 targets in response to ionizing radiation with putative role in the DNA damage response. We examined the effect of IR on the gene expression patterns in the murine embryonic fibroblasts with or without Pak1 using microarray.

DESIGN
Differentially expressed transcripts were identified using Gene Spring GX 10.0.2. The samples used were Wild type, Pak1 knock out, Wild type treated with ionizing radiation and Pak1 knock out treated with ionizing radiation. Triplicates of each sample type were used for analysis.
