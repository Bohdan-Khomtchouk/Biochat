TITLE
Comparative genomics of a fluconazole-resistant variant Candida albicans strain CaLY188.

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
To investigate the diversity of gene contents of Candida albicans strain by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH; aCGH).

DESIGN
A fluconazole-resistant variant Candida albicans strain CaLY188 was selected to carry out the comparative genomics microarray. Two-condition experiment, CaLY188 vs.SN152. Biological replicates: 2 control, 2 transfected, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
