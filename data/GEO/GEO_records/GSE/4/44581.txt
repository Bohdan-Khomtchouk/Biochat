TITLE
Hedgehog pathway inhibition in chondrosarcoma using the Smoothened inhibitor IPI-926 directly inhibits sarcoma cell growth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mice bearing primary human chondrosarcoma xenografts were treated with IPI 926, and mRNA levels of known Hh pathway genes and endpoint tumor volumes were measured. Gene expression profiling of IPI-926 treated tumors was conducted to identify potential novel Hh target genes.

DESIGN
4 Control treated and 4 IPI-926 treated NSG Mice.  Primary tumor was obtained from a single chondrosarcoma patient.
