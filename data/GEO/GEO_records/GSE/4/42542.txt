TITLE
Effect of clpX overexpression in Synechococcus

ORGANISM
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942

SUMMARY
In the unicellular cyanobacteriuIn the cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, most genes show rhythmic expression controlled by the Kai-based clock under continuous light conditions (LL). Overexpression of clpX led to a decrease in kaiBC promoter activity, disruption of circadian rhythm, and eventually cell death. We found that overexpression of clpX upregulated mRNA levels of ribosomal protein subunits, after which expression of other genes containing the clock genes was decreased.
