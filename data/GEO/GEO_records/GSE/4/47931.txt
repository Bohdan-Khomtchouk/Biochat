TITLE
Gene expression of mice over-expressing secretoglobin 3A2 in lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2 is a cytokine-like secretory protein and is predominantly expressed in airway epithelial cells. While SCGB3A2 is known to have anti-inflammatory, growth factor, and anti-fibrotic activities, its roles in lung homeostasis and diseases are still elusive. In order to obtain an insight into these roles, a transgenic mouse line over-expressing SCGB3A2 in the lung using the human surfactant protein-C promoter was established.

DESIGN
non-treated Condition. Biological replicates: 4WT,4TG samples.
