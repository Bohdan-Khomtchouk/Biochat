TITLE
Gene expression profiling for placentas from pre-eclamptic and normal pregnancies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes between placentas from pregnancies with PE and placentas from normal pregnancies to search for the candiadate genes for further DNA methylation analysis The differentially expressed genes LEP and SH3PXD2A were further analyzed by DNA methylation.

DESIGN
5 placentas from pregnancies with PE and 7 from normal subjects were included in the gene expression microarray analysis.
