TITLE
Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR is expressed in small cell lung cancer and is relevant to cellular proliferation, invasiveness and clinical relapse: tissue and cell-line analyses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LincRNA HOTAIR was expressed in pure SCLC and higher expression was significantly related to lymphatic invasion and relapse. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that HOTAIR expression correlated with RFS. In vitro experiments demonstrated that half of SCLC cell lines expressed HOTAIR at higher levels than normal cells and that, using cells of SBC-3, knockdown of HOTAIR decreased proliferative activity and cellular invasiveness with altered expression of cell adhesion-related genes.

DESIGN
Total RNAs from one siHOTAIR-transfected SBC-3 cells and control cells (siGFP-transfected cells), were extracted using RNeasy mini kit Plus (Qiagen) and hybridized to the microarrays, Sure Print G3 Human GE 8x60K microarrays (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Subsequently, data analysis was carried out using the GeneSpring GX 12 software (Agilent Technologies), with a stringency of P < 0.1 and a 2-fold or more change using gene ontology analysis.
