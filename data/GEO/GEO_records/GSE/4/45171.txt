TITLE
Gene expression profile of endothelial cells maturated into brain-like endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the molecular mechanisms during the maturation of cord blood-derived endothelial cells into blood brain barrier capillary endothelial cells (BCECs), we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes responsible for the maturation process. Hematopoietic stem cells were isolated from cord-blood samples and differentiated into endothelial cells. The endothelial cells were further maturated into BCECs by co-culturing with blood-brain barrier (BBB) specific cells (pericytes) for 3 days and 6 days.

DESIGN
The gene expression in human hematopoietic stem cell-derived endothelial cells was measured at 3 and 6 days after co-culture with pericytes. Three independent experiments were performed at each time (3 or 6 days). The RNA obtained from different experiments were pooled together for each group before microarray studies.
