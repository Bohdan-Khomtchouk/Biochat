TITLE
Gene expression profiling in leiomyosarcomas and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas: SRC as a new diagnostic marker

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of leiomyosarcomas (LMS) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (UPS) aiming to identify molecular biomarkers. Data were validated using RT-qPCR. To assess the relevance of the gene signature, a meta-analysis was performed using five published studies. SRC protein immunolabeling was performed for 38 UPS and 52 LMS.

DESIGN
Experiment condition, 22 LMS vs. 22 UPS. Total RNA extracted from tumors was labeled with Cy5, while a custom reference sample (combination of equal amounts of total RNA obtained from 15 different human cell lines) was labeled with Cy3. Samples Cy3 and Cy5 were mixed and hybridized on a two-Color Human GE 4X44K Microarray platform (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
