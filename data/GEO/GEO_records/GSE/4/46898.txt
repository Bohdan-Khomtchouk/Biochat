TITLE
Expression data from 5-week-old mouse prostate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Heparan sulfate (HS) is a linear, sulfated polysaccharide, and expresses abundantly in prostate and PCa tissues. Intriguingly, the HS content and sulfation modifications appear to increase when the prostate becomes malignance, suggesting that HS may critically modulate PCa pathogenesis. We specifically ablated Ext1, the enzyme that initiates HS biosynthesis, in mouse prostate at late development stage. And used microarray to detail the gene expressions affected by Ext1 ablation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Prostate tissues were removed from euthanized mice at 5 weeks old for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to compare gene expression during tumorigenesis among the wildtype, prostate specific knockout of Pten and double knockout of Pten and Ext1 in prostate.
