TITLE
Identification of host miRNA regulated by HIV-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Time-dependent profile of differentially expressed miRNA following HIV-1 infection. Small RNAs were extracted from HIV-1 infected and non-infected pNL4-3 Jurkat cells at days 0, 7, 21 and 42 and miRNA expression was analyzed by microarray. Keywords: time course
