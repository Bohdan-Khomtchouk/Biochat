TITLE
Timecourse of mCMV Infection of Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages (BMDMs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The systematic temporal gene expression analysis of primary macrophages activated under immune (interferon-gamma) and productive viral infection with murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV). The primary objective of the study is to define, in an unbiased manner, cause-and-effect relationships in the program of gene activation in this cellular system. The even spacing and time intervals (every 30 minutes) makes this study amenable to modelling of gene networks in the system.

DESIGN
A kinetic analysis of mCMV infection on the gene expression of murine (BALB/c) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) over the first 12 hours, sampling every 30 minutes. Agilent mouse genome arrays were used to determine the differences in gene expression between mock and mCMV infected. The 25 samples collected for the mock infected were pooled and treated as a pooled control. Pooled control was labelled with Cy3 dye and hybridised with every other sample (labelled with Cy5 dye) = 25 dual-dye array hybridisations. The reference channel of the dual-channel hybridisations was only used to normalise the expression of the test channel, rather than used to calculate ratio data. Thus, the normalised data represent log2 single-channel data.
