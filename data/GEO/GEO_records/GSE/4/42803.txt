TITLE
Expression data from dsDNA-stimulated mouse embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transfection of dsDNA into many mammalian cell types indues the production of type I interferons and interferon-stimulated genes.  We performed an siRNA screen to identify genes involved in this innate immune response, and identified Abcf1. We used microarrays to determine which genes are regulated by ABCF1 following dsDNA stimulation.

DESIGN
We treated p53-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with siRNAs targeting Abcf1 or Irf3 (positive control) or a negative control siRNA (siCtrl), and then stimulated the cells with 45-base pair dsDNA for 6 hrs or left the cells unstimulated.  We then lysed the cells and hybridized the RNA to Affymetrix microarrays.
