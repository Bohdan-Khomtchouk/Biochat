TITLE
Expression data from the telencephalon of wild-type and rSey2/rSey2 rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Pax6 is one of the important transcription factors involved in regional specification and neurogenesis in the developing cortex. To identify candidate target genes of Pax6, we performed transcriptome analyses of wild-type (WT) and Pax6 homozygous mutant rats (rSey2/rSey2) telencephalons at E11.5 within a day of onset of Pax6 expression. In our transcriptome analyses, down-regulated genes in the rSey2/rSey2 rat exhibited larger fold changes, whereas up-regulated genes had relatively small fold changes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared using  from 13 telencephalon dissected from E11.5 WT or rSey2/rSey2 rats embryos. Experiments using 13 telencephaon were repeated twice in each genotype.
