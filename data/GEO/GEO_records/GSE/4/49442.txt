TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in testis of mouse inter-subspecific hybrids

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
MiRNA expression profiling on 14.5 day old testis from sterile (PWD x B6)F1, (PWK x B6)F1 and fertile (B6 x PWD)F1 inter-subspecific hybrids were performed to study the genome wide variation in miRNA expression between different inter-subspecific hybrids during meiosis.
