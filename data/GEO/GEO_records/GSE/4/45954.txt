TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of human fibroblasts and converted neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human fibroblasts can be directly converted into cholinergic neurons by Neurogenin 2 (Neurog2 or NGN2) under the treatments of small molecules. Genome-wide analysis of gene expression was performed to examine the similarity of converted neurons to samples from human brain or spinal cord.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated human fetal lung fibroblasts or converted neurons at 21 days. Commercially available total RNAs from adult human brains and spinal cords were used as controls.
