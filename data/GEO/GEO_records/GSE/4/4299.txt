TITLE
Resveratrol-Induced Gene Expression Profiles in Human Prostate Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell Culture and Treatments The LNCaP cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (CDT; Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) in an environment of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 370C. Upon reaching 75% confluence, cells were treated with either DMSO control or purified resveratrol at several concentrations (LKT Laboratories, St. Paul, MN), dissolved in DMSO, and incubated for varying lengths of time. Final concentration of DMSO in media was 0.01%. Total RNA was prepared from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract. Keywords: all_pairs
