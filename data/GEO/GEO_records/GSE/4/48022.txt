TITLE
Gene expression patterns of mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow and Wharton's jelly of umbilical cord

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising tools for the treatment of diseases such as infarcted myocardia and strokes because of their ability to promote endogenous angiogenesis and neurogenesis via a variety of secreted factors. MSCs found in the Wharton's jelly of the human umbilical cord are easily obtained and are capable of transplantation without rejection. We isolated MSCs from Whartonâ€™s jelly and bone marrow (WJ-MSCs and BM-MSCs, respectively) and compared their transcriptional profiles.

DESIGN
In this study, BM-MSCs and WJ-MSCs were isolated from 4 and 3 independent donors, respectively.
