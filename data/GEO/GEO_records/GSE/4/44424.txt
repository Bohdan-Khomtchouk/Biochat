TITLE
Global CpG Methylation profiling of donor cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global CpG methylation profiling using Illumina 27k Infinium platform of (a) human embryonic stem cells, (b) low passage episomal stromal-primed myeloid iPSC, (c) intermediate passage fibroblast iPSC, and (d) samples of corresponding donor cells.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was harvested from indicated donor cells, hESC, or iPSC. A single sample of each cell line was used for this analysis.
