TITLE
Transcript map of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1

ORGANISM
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1

SUMMARY
High-resolution tiling analysis of the MR-1  transcriptome under diverse growth conditions The conditions include aerobic growth in Luria-Bertani broth (LB), aerobic growth in defined lactate minimal medium, anaerobic growth in defined lactate minimal medium with 20mM dimethyl sulfoxide as the electron acceptor, anaerobic growth in defined lactate minimal medium with 10mM iron (III) citrate as the electron acceptor, 10 minutes post heat shock at 42oC see GSE39468 for tiling data on lactate minimal media

DESIGN
Four slides hybridized to mRNA and one “genomic control” array hybridized to genomic DNA
