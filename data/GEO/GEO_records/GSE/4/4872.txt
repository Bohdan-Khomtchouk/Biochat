TITLE
Response of Lactococcus lactis to isoleucine starvation

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis

SUMMARY
For the first time in Lactococcus lactis, amino acid starvation response was characterized. The natural imposition of isoleucine starvation, by its consumption during growth, associated to transcript profiling, allowed defining exhaustively this stress stimulon. It consisted of a general induction of nitrogen metabolism (amino acid biosynthesis and transport, proteolytic system and proteases), a strong repression of genes encoding major physiological activities (translation, transcription, carbon metabolism, purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism) and the induction of unexpected cross responses to acid, osmotic and oxidative stresses. Keywords: stress response, time course
