TITLE
Epigenetic changes underlying mouse hematopoietic stem cell aging

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigate the aging changes for Histone marks H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 for mouse hematopoietic stem cells.

DESIGN
Mouse hematopoietic stem cell histone methylation profiles of 4 month and 24month old WT mice were generated generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2000
