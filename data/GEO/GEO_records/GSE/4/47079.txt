TITLE
Expression data of patient-derived triple negative breast cancer xenograft tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype that lack targeted clinical therapies. In addition, TNBC is heterogeneous and was recently further sub-classified into seven TNBC subtypes that displayed unique gene expression patterns. To develop therapeutic treatment regimens, we established seven patient-derived xenograft models from TNBC tumors. These xenograft models not only retained the histology and clinical markers of the corresponding patient tumors, but also bearing the same mutations and deletions identified in the patient tumors. Moreover, as part of evaluation of these models, we performed microarrays on the xenograft tumors to assess their TNBC subtypes.

DESIGN
After obtaining IRB-approved informed written patient consent, breast cancer tissues were obtained fresh from Stanford Hospital and transplanted into the number 2 mammary fat pads of female NOD SCID mice (NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J, Jackson Laboratory West, Sacramento, CA, USA). Mice were maintained in pathogen-free animal housing. The established xenografts were subsequently passaged from mouse to mouse. Xenograft tumor tissues were frozen on dry ice for RNA isolation and microarray analysis.
