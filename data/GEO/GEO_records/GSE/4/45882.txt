TITLE
Small RNA Solexa sequencing of mouse hematopoietic progenitor and dendritic cell samples

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We applied Illumina massively parallel signature sequencing to identify miRNomes in hematopoietic stem cells, bone morrow-derived immature DCs, mature DCs, and IL-10 and NO-producing regulatory DCs.The miRNomes of these DC subsets will contribute to investigate the significance of miRNAs in DC immunobiology.

DESIGN
Examination of the miRNome in hematopoietic stem cells, bone morrow-derived immature DCs, mature DCs, and IL-10 and NO-producing regulatory DCs. All four mouse cell types.
