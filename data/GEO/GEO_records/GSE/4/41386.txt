TITLE
Role of REST in the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The loss of REST in uterine fibroids promotes aberrant gene expression and enables mTOR pathway activation

DESIGN
We used siRNA to knockdown REST/ NRSF in cultured primary myometrial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and global gene expression was analyzed using microarrays.
