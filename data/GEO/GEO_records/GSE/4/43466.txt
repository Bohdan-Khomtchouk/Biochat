ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Expression data from hypoxic time course and transcription factor over expression experiments. (Abstract from paper will be appended after publication)

DESIGN
Hypoxic time course experiments were done with a minimum of 3 replicates. TFOE are matched to the ChIP-seq experiment done simultaneously. This submission consists of the the gene expression component only.
