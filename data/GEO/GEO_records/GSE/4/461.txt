TITLE
Response to LiCl of galactose grown cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Wild type strain CEN.PK113-7D was grown in an aerobic batch cultivation with a start concentration of 20 g/L galactose. During exponential growth at a biomass concentration of 3 g dry weight/L LiCl was added to a concentration of 10 mM. Just before addition of LiCl (time 0) and 20, 40, 60 and 140 minutes after addition of LiCl samples were taken for transcription analysis. Lithium inhibits phosphoglucomutase whereby both galactose uptake and growth is strongly affected. Keywords = Saccharomyces galactose lithium Keywords: time-course
