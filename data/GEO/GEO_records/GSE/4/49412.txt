TITLE
Expression data from five primary human glioblastomas (frozen surgical resection) and one non-neoplastic adult brain (frozen autopsy tissue)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA hypomethylation could lead to activation of alternate promoters in GBM. We profiled DNA methylation and H3K4me3 genome-wide, and also performed expression and copy number analysis on the same samples In this dataset, we include all expression data obtained for five GBMs and one normal brain. We identified loci with concurrent DNA hypomethylation and H3K4me3 in GBM, and analyzed expression of the nearest gene in the same sample using these data

DESIGN
Six total samples were analyzed. Each GBM sample was compared to normal brain to obtain expression changes
