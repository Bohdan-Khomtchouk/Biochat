TITLE
Gene expression in brain and antennae of starved and fed Drosophilla adult

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We found in our behavior experiment clearly distinnct olfactory responses in fed vs starved flies in response to differrent odors.To investigate the molecular basis of the starvation mediated olfactory modulation process, we compared gene expression at the level of the antenna and the brain for fed and starved flies.

DESIGN
Gene expression in brain and antennae was measured at 0hr and 28 hours starved.  Four independent experiments were performed at each time using different flies for each experiment.
