TITLE
Single-base resolution DNA methylomes of soybean recombinant inbred lines reveals heritability patterns of natural methylation variants

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
The epigenomics approaches presented here provide the first comprehensive study of the patterns and heritability of methylation variants in a complex genetic population over multiple generations paving the way for understanding how methylation variants contribute to phenotypic variation.

DESIGN
MethylC-Seq and RNA-Seq data collected from Glycine max leaves of two parental lines of a RIL population and two individual RILs. Additionally gDNA-Seq was performed on the two parental lines [SRA060034].
