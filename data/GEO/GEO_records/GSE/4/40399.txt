TITLE
Distinct Signaling Roles of Ceramide Species in Yeast Revealed Through Integromics Analyses

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Yeast cells were subjected to different combination of the following perturbations: heat stress, myriocin (ISP1) treatment and lipid (myristate) supplement.  Then gene expression and lipidomic data were collected under each experimental condition with triplicates.
