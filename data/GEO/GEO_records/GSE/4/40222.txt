TITLE
A combinatorial extracellular matrix platform identifies cell-extracellular matrix interactions that correlate with metastasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Extracellular matrix interactions play essential roles in normal physiology and many pathological processes. Here, we report a novel screening platform capable of measuring phenotypic responses to combinations of ECM molecules. While the importance of ECM interactions in metastasis is well documented, systematic approaches to identify their roles in distinct stages of tumorigenesis have not been described. Using a genetic mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, we measured the ECM-dependent adhesion of tumor-derived cells.  Hierarchical clustering of adhesion profiles generated using this platform differentially segregated metastatic cell lines from primary tumor lines. Furthermore, we uncovered that metastatic cells selectively associate with fibronectin when in combination with galectin-3, galectin-8, or laminin. These interactions appear to be mediated in part by α3β1 integrin both in vitro and in vivo. We show that these galectins also correlate with human disease at both a transcriptional and histological level. Thus, our in vitro platform allowed us to interrogate the interactions of metastatic cells with their surrounding environment, and identified ECM and integrin interactions that could lead to therapeutic targets for metastasis prevention.
