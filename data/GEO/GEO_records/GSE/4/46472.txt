TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profile of SMEI patient iPSCs and control human Embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SMEI patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were derived from patient fibroblasts. In order to test the similarity between patient iPSCs and human embryonic stem (hES) cells, microarry analysis was carried out on SMEI patient iPSCs and human embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
SMEI patient iPSCs were derived from patient fibroblasts. Human embryonic stem cells were derived from human blastocyst.And we use the microarray method to compare the global expression of patient iPSCs and embryonic stem cells.
