TITLE
microRNAs involved in regulating embolic stroke recovery following spontaneous reperfusion [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To date, miRNA expression studies on cerebral ischemia in both human and animal models have focused mainly on acute phase of ischemic stroke. In this study, we present the roles played by microRNAs in the spontaneous recovery phases in cerebral ischemia using rodent stroke models.
