TITLE
Runx1/Cbfb deficiency effect on MLL-AF9 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the target genes of Runx1/Cbfb in MLL fusion leukemia, we performed microarray analysis using control and Runx1/Cbfb-deleted MLL-AF9 cells.

DESIGN
c-Kit(+) bone marrow cells derived from Runx1/Cbfb double floxed mice were transduced with MLL-AF9 and CreERT2 (coexpressing Puromycin).  After several rounds of replating with Puromycin, EtOH (control) or 4OHT was added to induce gene deletion. Two independent experiments with 2 independent clones were performed, and gene-expression was compared using the 4 sets of samples 24 hours after 4OHT addition.
