TITLE
Mechanism of cell death induced by saporin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Insights into the mechanism of cell death induced by saporin delivered into cancer cells by an antibody fusion protein targeting the transferrin receptor 1 These studies detail transcriptional changes induced in cancer cells by the complex of saporin (b-SO6) and the antibody fusion protein ch128.1Av. Delivery of saporin into cancer cells by ch128.1Av, induces a transcriptional response consistent with oxidative stress and DNA damage, a response that is not observed with ch128.1Av alone.

DESIGN
Time course, after delivery of saporin into cells by ch128.1Av
