TITLE
Genes differentially expressed Haloarcula hispanica strains: PHB (ΔphaEC mutant) vs 960 (wild type)

ORGANISM
Haloarcula hispanica

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Haloarcula hispanica comparing PHB with 960. PHB represents the PHA synthase genes mutant (i.e., ΔphaEC) which is deficient in PHBV accumulation when grown in MG medium. 960 represents the wild-type strain which can produce PHBV when grown in MG medium. Goal was to explore the PHBV biosynthesis and its impact on central metabolism in H. hispanica.

DESIGN
Total RNA from PHB and 960 were used to generate target cDNA, and then hybridized to 8*15K Haloarcula hispanica genome array genechips, representing about 3800 genes.
