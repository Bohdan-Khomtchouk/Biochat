TITLE
Expression data from murine sarcomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cell of origin for rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) remains to be determined.  We utilized two skeletal muscle specific inducible Cre mouse lines to transform both skeletal muscle stem cells and progenitors to determine which cells give rise to RMS and UPS.

DESIGN
Both P7KP and MDKP derived mice were injected with systemic tamoxifen and mice were euthanized after tumor development.  Sections of resected tumor were placed in RNAlater and placed at -80 until RNA isolation.  RNA was isolated by grinding up tumor sections in liquid nitrogen and using the Qiagen RNEasy Micro kit.
