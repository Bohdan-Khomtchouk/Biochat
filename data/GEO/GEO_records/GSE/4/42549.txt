TITLE
Transcriptional responses of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) lines to PKC inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCL lines (biological replicates) were treated with DMSO or 2.5uM Sotrastaurin for 3hrs This experiment is designed to see if a common set of genes is affected by Sotrastaurin (STN) treatment in STN-sensitive and STN-insensitive MCL lines.

DESIGN
MCL cells were seeded in 6well dishes and treated for 3hrs with DMSO or 2.5uM Sotrastaurin
