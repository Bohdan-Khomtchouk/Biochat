TITLE
Identification of SDPR as a metastasis suppressor gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify metastasis suppressor genes, which are functionally compromised in late-stage breast cancer, we compared the gene expression profiles of an established breast cancer progression cell line model and leveraged large amounts of publically available data by applying multiple bioinformatics filters. Here we report the identification of serum deprivation response (SDPR, also known as cavin-2) as a bona fide metastasis suppressor, capable of impairing the metastatic growth of cancer cells while having no effect on the growth of primary tumors. Breast cancer cell lines representing progressive stages of the disease are compared by microarrays to find the genes repressed at the metastatic stage.

DESIGN
Three cell lines, MCF-10AT1Kcl2 (MII - carcinoma in situ), MCF-10A1h (MIII - carcinoma) and MCF-10A1a (MIV - carcinoma, metastatic), are chosen to extract mRNA and hybridization with Affymetrix microarrays to establish the list of the genes that are lost in metastatic MIV breast cancer cell line.
