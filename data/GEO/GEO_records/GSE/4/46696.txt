ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to profile the changes in gene signatures after 6 hours of subarachnoid haemorrhage in the rat cerebral arteries .

DESIGN
Cerebral arteris of rats subjected to SAH or SHAM operated animals were isolated after 6 hours of SAH and total RNA was extracted for the array
