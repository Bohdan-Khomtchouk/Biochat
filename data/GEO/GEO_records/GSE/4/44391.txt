TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of zones of colonies of the ΔflbA strain of Aspergillus niger

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger CBS 513.88

SUMMARY
Gene expression was studied at the periphery, an intermediate zone, and the centre of wild-type and ∆flbA colonies using Affymetrix A. niger whole genome microarrays. We used Affymetrix GeneChip A. niger Geome Arrays and identifed up- and down-regulated genes that may account for the differences between wild-type and  ΔflbA colonies.
