TITLE
Genome array of hair follicle genes in lamp skin with different patterns

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Differentially expressed genes in the skin tissue of newborn Hu sheep were screened using an Agilent gene chip and RT-PCR. Differential expression analysis revealed 3 groups of large waves and small waves; 1067, 2071, and 3879 differentially expressed genes; and 137 genes common to all 3 groups. Differentially expressed genes were classified using gene ontology. They were found to be mainly involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, growth, immune response, and ion transport. RT-PCR results of 4 differentially expressed genes were consistent with gene chip results. Combined with related literature, our results suggest that BMP7, MMP2, SNAI1, SFXN1, CDKNIC, MT3, and POU1F1 may have important effects on the formation of large-wave and small-wave hair follicles.

DESIGN
The samples collected with three full-sib individual and they borned at two days, what's more they were from the same paternal, each pair of big wave and small wave individuals from the same female parent.
