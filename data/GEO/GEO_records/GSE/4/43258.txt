TITLE
PRAME induced inhibition of retinoic acid receptor signaling-mediated differentiation - a possible target for ATRA response in AML without t(15;17)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) without retinoic acid receptor (RAR) rearrangement the effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is still poorly understood despite an association of NPM1 mutation and ATRA response. Recently, PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma) has been shown to be a dominant repressor of RAR-signaling.   Experimental design: Thus, we further investigated ATRA response mechanisms, especially the impact of PRAME expression on ATRA-responsiveness by profiling gene expression in K562 cell lines.  Results: Our data revealed a PRAME-expression associated gene pattern to be significantly enriched for genes involved in the retinoic acid metabolic process. In leukemia cell line models we could demonstrate that retinoic acid-regulated cell proliferation and differentiation are impacted by PRAME expression.  Conclusions: PRAME seems to impair differentiation and to increase proliferation likely via blocking RAR-signaling, which might be reversed by ATRA.

DESIGN
For the cell line model GEP was performed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133plus2.0 Array technology according to the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations as previously reported. siRNA and scrRNA treated as well as ATRA treated K562 cells stemming from independent experiments were profiled. Using the BRB Array Tools software package fluorescence ratios were normalized by applying the RMA algorithm and supervised ClassComparison PathwayClassComparison analyses were performed.
