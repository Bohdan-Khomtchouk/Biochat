TITLE
Stress response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to exposure to natural product Azinomycin B.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Stress responses to DNA damaging agents show characteristic responses. The effect of Azinomycin B upon cultured yeast cells in growth conditions appears to be significant. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression induced in the stress response to Azinomycin B. Keywords: stress response
