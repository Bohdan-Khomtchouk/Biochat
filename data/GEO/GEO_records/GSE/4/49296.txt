TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Escherichia coli under various stress conditions

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
A genome reduced E. coli strain MDS42Î”galK::Ptet-gfp-kan were applied for the comparative transcriptome analysis. Genome-wide transcriptional changes under high osmotic prresure, high temperature condition and starvation were evaluated.

DESIGN
Exponentially growing cells from recoverying stress response were collected for the transcriptome analysis. High osmotic prresure, high temperature condition and starvation were chosen as stressor. In each kind of stress, three level of stresses were applied. Every 3 biological replications were performed.
