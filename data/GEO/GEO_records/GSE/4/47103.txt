TITLE
The gene expression characteristics involved in amino acids formation of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2038

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2038

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2038 during the growth in casein proteins conditioned medium compared with the start control (cells treated in whey conditioned medium). Identifying the genes that are differentially expressed during the growth of Lb. bulgaricus 2038 in casein proteins condition provides a starting point for the investigation of metabolic mechanisms.

DESIGN
Twelve Samples at different growth time points. Three replicates each.
