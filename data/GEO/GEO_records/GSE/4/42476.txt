TITLE
Functional modulation of dendritic cells (DCs) by photo-switchable generation of intracellular ROS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment was performed to estimate the difference between DCs stimulated with intracellular ROS or LPS.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtainded from DCs stimulated with intracellular ROS or LPS was analyzed for transcriptome
