TITLE
Gene expression in bovine ovarian follicle theca interna

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Thecal tissue forms a layer around the follicle just prior to antral stage and grows with the follicle (containing an oocyte) as it matures. The innermost component (theca interna) supplies hormones and other factors necessary to the growth and development of the granulosa and oocyte. Most follicles regress and die (become atretic) at the antral stage, and this process as well as development of the follicle are undoubtedly influenced by the theca. Transcriptional changes in ovarian theca interna at the global level were examined by microarray during atresia and development to improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved.

DESIGN
Four groups of bovine ovarian follicles were selected for analysis . Follicle size, type and array number for each group are, small (3-5 mm) healthy rounded (n=5), healthy columnar (n=5), atretic(n=5) and large healthy ( > 9mm), (n=4). For each group, the RNA from the theca interna of a single follicle was used to hybridise an array.
