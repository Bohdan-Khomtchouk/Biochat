TITLE
HDAC mediated suppression of histone turnover promotes epigenetic stability of heterochromatin

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Analysis of histone H3 turnover in wild-type and mutant fission yeast cells by using MNase-ChIP-chip

DESIGN
Exponentially growing cultures of fission yeast cells expressing an ectopic copy of FLAG tagged histone H3 under the control of inv1 promoter were synchronized and expression of H3-FLAG was induced by changing the carbon source of the medium to Sucrose. Cells were crosslinked with 1% Formaldehyde and chromatin was fragmented into mononucleosomes by using micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA recovered with anti-FLAG antibody from wild-type and mutant fission yeast cells and whole cell extracts DNA were amplified by random priming and respectively labeled with Cy5 and Cy3. Labeled DNA samples were mixed and hybridized onto  44k pombe Agilent oligo arrays. Data were processed using Agilent scanner and Feature Extraction software.
