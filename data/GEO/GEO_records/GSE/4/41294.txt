TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from muscle samples of the pig commercial herd Pix(DLxDE)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In this study, we analyzed the miRNA expression pattern in muscle and constructed miRNA coexpression networks. Target of miRNA networks were enriched for biological pathways.

DESIGN
190 crossbred pig muscle samples were hybridized to Affymetrix miRNA arrays.
