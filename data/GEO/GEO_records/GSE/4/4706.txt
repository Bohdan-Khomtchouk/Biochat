TITLE
Response and adaptation to growth with low glucose concentration

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
The faecal indicator bacterium Escherichia coli K12 was used to study the cellular events that take place at the transcription level using the microarray technology during short-term (physiological) and long-term (genetic) adaptation to slow growth under limited nutrient supply. Short-term and long-term adaptation were assessed by comparing the mRNA levels isolated after 40 or 500 hours of glucose-limited continuous culture at a dilution rate of 0.3 h-1 with those from batch culture with glucose excess. Keywords: glucose-limited continuous culture, adaptation, microarray, high affinity transport systems, transcriptome, Escherichia coli
