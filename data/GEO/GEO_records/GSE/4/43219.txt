TITLE
mRNA changes induced by acute exercise

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to determine what gene expression changes are induced by acute exercise in humans, and how those changes relate to insulin sensitivity

DESIGN
14 subjects had muscle biopsies at rest and 30 minutes after a single exercise bout for measurement of mRNA changes. Glucose clamps were used to assess insulin sensitivity.
