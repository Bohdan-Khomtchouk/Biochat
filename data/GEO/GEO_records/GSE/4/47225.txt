TITLE
Murine ES Cells: Control vs. ETV4/5 double KO

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ETS-related transcription factors ETV4 and ETV5 play crucial roles for organogenesis and morphogenesis.  We compared the transcriptional profiles between wild-type and ETV4 and ETV5 double knockout (ETV4/5 dKO) ES cells by an oligo DNA microarray analysis.  Self-renewal capacity and pluripotency are known to be controlled by an ES cell-specific transcription factor network; therefore, we focused on transcription-associated genes. Of 1258 transcription-related genes, 47 genes were significantly downregulated and 98 genes were significantly upregulated in ETV4/5 dKO ES cells.  Several genes whose expression is specific to undifferentiated ES were repressed in ETV4/5 dKO ES cells.  In contrast, expression of differentiation markers was enhanced in ETV4/5 dKO ES cells.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiles between wild-type and ETV4/5 dKO ES cells were examined by an oligo DNA microarray analysis. ES cells were cultured on gelatin-coated dishes with LIF-supplemented ES cell medium.  Total RNAs were isolated from wild-type and ETV4/5 dKO ES cells and subjected to microarray analysis.
