TITLE
Gene expression profile analysis of mouse whole spleen following infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), comparing LCMV-Armstrong and LCMV-Clone 13 expression patterns at 0, 5, 9, and 30 days

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify mechanisms behind immunosuppression during virus infections, we infected mice with LCMV-Armstrong and LCMV-Clone 13 expression patterns.  LCMV-Armstrong induces a T-cell reaction that resolves infection within 8-10 days, while LCMV-Clone13 generates a persisten infection through immunosuppression. We used microarray to uncover splenic gene expression patterns specific to each LCMV infection at 5, 9, and 30 days

DESIGN
C57BL6 mice, 6-10 weeks old, were infected with LCMV-Armstrong and LCMV-Clone 13 or left uninfected (na√Øve).  At days 5, 9, and 30 whole spleens were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetric microarray.
