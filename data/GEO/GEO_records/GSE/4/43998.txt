TITLE
C/EBPa gene signature

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We defined the C/EBPa signature characterized by a set of genes which are upregulated upon C/EBPa activation. In order to identify the C/EBPa signature, we performed microarray gene expression analysis of K562 cells stably expressing p42-C/EBPa-ER after activating the C/EBPa construct to translocate to the nucleus for 6 hours with beta-estradiol.

DESIGN
The gene expression profile was performed in K562 p42-C/EBPa-ER expressing cells treated with beta-estradiol (n=4) or EtOH vehicle control (n-4) for 6 hours. Induction of nuclear localization of C/EBPa-ER fusion protein was achieved by addition of 1 uM beta-estradiol as indicated into the culture medium.
