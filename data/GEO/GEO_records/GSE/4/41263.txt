TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate the pathogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), particularly for different subgroups, we performed a SNP array-based copy number analysis of 54 RMS specimens from primary cases with ERMS (N = 30), ARMS (N = 14), unclassified RMS (N = 1), and RMS of unknown histology (N = 3) together with 7 RMS-derived cell lines. The ERMS subtype was characterized by hyperploidy and was significantly associated with gains of chromosomes 2, 8, and 12, whereas majority of ARMS cases exhibited near-diploid copy number profiles.  Recurrent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosomes 3 (28.6%) and 15q (35.7%) was detected in ARMS. Uniparental disomy/polysomy of 11p was commonly found in both tumor types.  Focal gains/amplifications were associated mostly with PAX3-FOXO1 (5/10) or PAX7-FOXO1 (6/6) fusions, but novel amplified regions were also found, including the IRS2 in 2 ARMS.  Gain of 13q was significantly associated with good patient outcome in ERMS.  These findings not only illustrate genetic differences between ARMS and ERMS but also provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of RMS.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix 50K/250K SNP arrays was performed for 54 RMS samples.
