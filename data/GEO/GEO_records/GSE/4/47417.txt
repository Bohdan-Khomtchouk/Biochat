TITLE
∆Np63 regulates stem cell activity in mammary gland development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MaSC, luminal progenitor enriched subpopulations and total MECs as well, were isolated from both wild type and ∆Np63 KO heterozygous mouse and the transcriptome profiles were determined and compared.

DESIGN
Three populations: P4, P5 and MECs; two genotypes: WT vs ∆Np63 heterozygous.
