TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of Cbx7 Knockdown Effects in Ovarian Clear Cell Adenocarcinoma Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cbx7 knockdown resulted in increase of genes related with apoptosis and  inflammation.

DESIGN
Expression microarray was performed using RNA extracted from 2 ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma cell lines, namely, KOC-7C and TOV21G, either trancduced by Cbx7 siRNA or control.
