TITLE
A Unifying Model for Molecular Determinants of the Pre-selection Vb Repertoire [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The primary antigen receptor repertoire is sculpted by the process of V(D)J recombination, which must strike a balance between diversification and favoring gene segments with specialized functions. The precise determinants of how often gene segments are chosen to complete variable region coding exons remain elusive. We have quantified Vβ usage in the pre-selection Tcrb repertoire and report relative contributions of 14 distinct features in shaping their recombination efficiencies, including transcription, chromatin environment, spatial proximity to their DβJβ targets, and quality of recombinase recognition elements. Computational analyses provide a unifying model, revealing a minimal set of eight parameters that are predictive of Vβusage, dominated by chromatin modifications associated with transcription, but largely independent of the precise spatial proximity to DβJβclusters.

DESIGN
Transcription profiles of mouse DN thymocytes from Rag1 KO mice were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina Hi-Seq 2000.
