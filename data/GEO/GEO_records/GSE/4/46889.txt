TITLE
Temporal Gene Expression Patterns in the skin of D6 null and wild type mice after inflammation with the chemical irritant TPA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The chemokine decoy receptor D6 internalises and degrades inflammatory CC chemokines enabling resolution of inflammation. In D6 deficient mice (D6 KO), otherwise innocuous cutaneous inflammatory stimuli induce a grossly exaggerated inflammatory response that bears many similarities to human psoriasis. In the present study we have used transcriptomic approaches to define the molecular make up of this response. The result of such analysis highlights potential roles for a number of cytokines iniating and maintaining psoriasis like pathology. Most compellingly, we provide data indicating a key role for the type I interferon pathway in the emergence of this pathology

DESIGN
Backskin of D6 null mice was painted with three successive applications of 50uM TPA (in acetone), 24 hours apart. Control (labelled as day 0 or untreated) were treated with acetone only. After the three successive applications of TPA, pathology was left to develop for 1, 2, 4 or 6 days and backskin was taken for microarray analysis at each of these time points.   To identify differentially expressed genes, comparisons were made between D6 KO and WT mice at each time point (D6 KO vs WT mice at day 0, day 1, day 2, day 4 or day 6).  Significantly differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05 according to an unpaired t-test) and up or down regulated more than 3 fold were identified ay each time point and selected for further analysis.
