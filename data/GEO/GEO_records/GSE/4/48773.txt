TITLE
Effect of high glucose on gene expression in ASCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The object of this study was to investigate the effect of elevated glucose concentrations (15 and 25 mM glucose) on gene expression in undifferentiated and adipogenic differentiated ASCs.

DESIGN
Undifferentiated (proliferating) ASCs were cultured in medium containing 5, 15 or 25 mM  glucose, and were passaged regularly. RNA was collected at day 21. Adipogenic differentiated cells were seeded confluent at D-2, added DMEM/F12 with 5, 15 or 25 mM glucose at day -1 and induced to differentiate with IBMX, Dexamethasone, Indomethacin and insulin at day 0. Cell culture media was changed every 3 days. RNA was collected at day 21.
