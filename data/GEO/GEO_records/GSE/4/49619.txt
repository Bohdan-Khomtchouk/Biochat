TITLE
Expression data from CD4+ Naïve T cells under Treg-inducing condition in the presence or absence of butyrate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Commensal bacteria shapes gut immune system. Colonization bacteria increase the frequency of regulatory T cells, however, the molecular mechanisms has not yet been unknown. To reveal the mechanism, we isolated Naïve CD4+ T cells from spleen of C57BL/6 mice and cultured the cells under Treg-inducing condition culture in the presence or absence of butyrate, a metabolite produced by commensal bacteria.

DESIGN
Naïve T cells were isolated from spleen and were cultured in the presence of IL-2, TGF-beta and in the presence or absene of Butyrate. RNA was extracted at Day 2
