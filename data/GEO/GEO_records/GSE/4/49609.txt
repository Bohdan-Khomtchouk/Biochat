TITLE
In-culture titration experiment for sRSE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to test the transcriptome-wide functionality of the identified sRSE instances, we performed an in vivo titration experiment in which synthetic RNA oligonucleotides harboring tandem sRSE1 repeats were used as intracellular decoys that would bind the putative trans factor, preventing it from targeting endogenous transcripts.

DESIGN
Capped and poly-adenylated RNAs carrying tandem sRSE elements were transfected along with scrambled RNA molecules as control. 48 hours post-transfection, samples were subjected to transcriptome profiling to measure the regulatory consequences of the in-vivo titration of the sRSE-binding trans factor.
