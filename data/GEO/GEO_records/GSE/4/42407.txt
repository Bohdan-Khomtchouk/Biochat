TITLE
Expression data from CL1-0 and CL1-5 lung cancer cell line.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A lung cancer cell model of invasive transformation was developed to select progressively invasive cell populations from a parental cell line of human lung adenocarcinoma, CL1. Five progressive sub-clones namely, CL1-1, CL1-2, CL1-3 CL1-4, and CL1-5 were selected using transwell and displayed increasing invasion potential (Chu et al, 1997). Here, we used microarrays to analyze and compare gene expression profiles between CL1-0 and CL1-5 for the identification of invasion/metastasis associated gene signatures.

DESIGN
CL1-0 and CL1-5 lung cancer cell lines were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. A total of 6 chips were used for microarray analysis including three biological repeats from CL1-0 and three biological repeats from CL1-5.
