TITLE
Global DNA Hypermethylation in Down Syndrome Placenta [Bisulfite-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis at single base resolution and gene expression analysis, resulted in hypermethylation in all autosomes in DS samples, mediated by down-regulation of all three TET family genes, and down-regulation of REST/NRSF. Genes located on chr21 were up-regulated by a median of 45% in DS compared to normal villi, while genes with promoter hypermethylation were down regulated.

DESIGN
DNA methylation comparison in human placenta between 6 normal and 11 Trisomy 21 samples
