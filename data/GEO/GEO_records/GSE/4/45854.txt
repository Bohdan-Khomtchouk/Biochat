TITLE
Expression profiling data of RD and C2C12 cells ectopically expressing DUX4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic changes induced by DUX4 expression were compared between human and mouse cell lines of muscle lineage. We used microarrays to compare transcripts induced in human rhabdmyosarcoma and mouse C2C12 cells ectopically expressing DUX4.

DESIGN
Human rhabdomyosarcoma and mouse C2C12 cells were transfected with DUX4 expression vectors (n=4).  Cells transfected with insertless vectors were used as controls.  Samples were processed for RNA extraction 16 hours following transfection.
