TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of SIK2 regulated genes and pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of SIK2 regulated genes and pathways after SIK2 knock-down and overexpression of a wild-type and kinase-dead SIK2. The hypothesis is that SIK2 regulated gene expression via CREB1

DESIGN
Total RNAs were obtained after SIK2 gene was knocked down with siRNA and after a wild-type SIK2 or a kinase-dead SIK2 construct were over-expressed in LNCaP cells. A control where the cells were treated with a CREB1 inducer (Forskolin) was also included.
