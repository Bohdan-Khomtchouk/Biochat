TITLE
The effect on gene expression of Smchd1 deletion in end stage lymphomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Smchd1 appears to act as a tumour suppressor in the Eµ-Myc B cell lymphoma model. We find gene expression differences are most pronounced in the premalignant cells, and observe more variability in end stage lymphomas. We always detect a small number of clustered genes and imprinted genes as differentially expressed, along with others involved in tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
The microarrays compared Smchd1 null and Smchd1 wildtype samples from end stage lymphomas. All lymphomas are on the C57BL/6 background and carry the Eµ-Myc transgene, and Smchd1 null samples are additionally homozygous for a Smchd1 genetrap allele.
