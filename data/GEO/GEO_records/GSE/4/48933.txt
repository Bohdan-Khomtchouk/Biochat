TITLE
Ribosome profiling reveals features of normal and disease-associated mitochondrial translation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ribosome profiling and RNAseq data on human BJ fibroblasts and cybrid cells using an adapted ribosome profiling protocol to improve detection of mitochondrial ribosome protected fragments

DESIGN
51-base length single read ribosome profiling data on human fibroblasts and cybrid cells using an adapted ribosome profiling protocol; and 51-base length single read RNAseq on polyA enriched RNA
