TITLE
Expression of miR-196a in Huntington's disease transgenic (HD) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We intend to screen altered genes after overexpression of miR-196a in  HD transgenic mice. Two transgenic mouse lines were used in this study, including HD transgenic mice and HD transgenic mice overexpressing miR-196a. The mice were all at approximate 12 months of age. At this point, HD transgenic mice showed severve motor dysfunctions, whereas HD transgenic mice overexpressing miR-196a displayed mild motor dysfunctions.

DESIGN
We used the striatum tissues from 2 HD transgenic mice and 3 HD transgenic mice overexpressing miR-196a. The mice were all at approximate 12 months of age. Two technique repeats were performed for each sample.
