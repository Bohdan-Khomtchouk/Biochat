TITLE
Dose-dependent effects of TCDD in juvenile rainbow trout

ORGANISM
Osmerus mordax

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of chronic TCDD exposure on global gene expression in developing rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Juvenile rainbow trout (0.18Â±0.01g) were fed Biodiet starter with TCDD added at 0, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100ppb, and ten fish were sampled and pooled from each group for microarray experiments at 28 days after initiation of the exposure. Gene expression analysis was performed using the Genomics Research on All Salmonids Project (cGRASP) 16K cDNA microarrays. TCDD-responsive whole body transcripts identified in the microarray experiments have putative functions involved in various biological processes including cellular process, metabolic process, biological regulation, and response to stimulus. In addition, TCDD caused leisons in multiple organ systems in juvenile rainbow, including skin, oropharynx, liver, gas bladder, intestine, pancreas, nose and kidney.
