TITLE
Efficacy and molecular mechanism of a glycoside compound inhibiting abnormal prion protein formation in prion-infected cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This report describes our study of the efficacy and the potential mechanism underlying the anti-prion action of a new anti-prion compound having a glycoside structure in prion-infected cells. The study revealed involvements of two factors in the mechanism of the compound action: interferon and a microtubule nucleation activator, phosphodiesterase 4D interacting protein. In particular, phosphodiesterase 4D interacting protein was suggested to be important in regulating the trafficking or fusion of prion protein-containing vesicles or structures in cells. The findings of the study are expected to be useful not only for the elucidation of cellular regulatory mechanisms of prion protein, but also for the implication of new targets for therapeutic development.

DESIGN
Prion-infected N167 cells were treated with either anti-prion glycoside compound (Gly-9) or control glycoside compound (Gly-14) at a dose of 5 Î¼g/mL for three days. Then, gene expression profiles were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis. Experiments were performed in quadruplicate.
