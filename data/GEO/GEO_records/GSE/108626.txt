TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in VECs and CFs after co-culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gene expression in vascular endothelial cells (VECs) and circulating fibrocytes (CFs) was tested either culturing alone or co-cultured. Our previous study showed that CFs inhibit both proliferation and apoptosis of VECs. In this present study, we co-cultured CFs and VECs in Transwell and tested the gene expression in CFs and VECs in order to delight the mechanism under which CFs affect the proliferation and apoptosis of VECs.

DESIGN
CFs and VECs were either cultured alone or co-cultured in Transwell with each other for 24 hours. Then total RNA was extracted from CFs cultured alone, CFs co-cultured with VECs, VECs cultured alone and VECs co-cultured with CFs.
