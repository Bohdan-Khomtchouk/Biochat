TITLE
Impact of Developmental Lead Exposure on Splenic Factors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study focuses on the impact of developmental Pb exposure on splenic gene expression. Pb exposure from gestational day 8 (gd8) to post-natal day 21 (pnd21) was used to obtain insight into how Pb induces anemia and negatively influences the immune response Keywords: exposure analysis

DESIGN
This study uses Codelink Mouse whole genome microarrays. Mouse spleen from 3 control and 3 experimental (treated with 0.1mM Pb since gd8) BALB/c female mice on pnd21 were used to study gene expression.
