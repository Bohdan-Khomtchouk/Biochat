TITLE
Gene Expression data from synovium in mouse serum transfer arthritis model (STA) model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To find regulated genes during peak inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we have collected synovium from  mouse Serum Transfer Arthtitis (STA) model at day 0  (Non Arthritic) and day 10 (Peak Inflammation). Serum transfer arthritis was induced in 12-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory) by intraperitoneal injection of 150 μl of arthritogenic serum on days 0, 2, and 7. Nonarthritic mice received 150 μl of sterile phosphate buffered saline at each time point.

DESIGN
We analyzed gene expression data from Non-arthritic synovium pooled from 3 mice and Arthritic synovium at peak inflammation pooled from 10 mice. Two biological replicates for each time points.
