TITLE
Expression data from adult mice breast cancer cell 4T1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microaaray data for CD44v8-10-positive / CD44v8-10-negative 4T1 cancer cells (mouse breast cancer cells) We used microarrays to detail the global programming of gene expression of 4T1 cells depending on whether CD44v is present or not.

DESIGN
4T1 cells, one of the mouse breast cancer cells, were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the data about to which extent gene expression profile is different between CD44v-positive and CD44v-negative 4T1 cancer cells.
