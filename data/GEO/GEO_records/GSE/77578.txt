TITLE
Molecular consequences of Csf1R (M-CSF receptor) inhibition by PLX3397 in the pilocarpine-induced chronic epileptic mouse hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Efficacy of Csf1R inhibition by PLX3397 compound in a mouse model of chronic epilepsy has been assessed by daily administration of either vehicle, 3 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg during 2 weeks monitoring. At the end of the study, RNA was extracted from study animals hippocampi to assess treatment consequences at the gene expression level in view of the in vivo efficacy results and the previously identified consequences of epilepsy in hyppocampus. Naive healthy mice were added separately to determine baseline expression.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from chronic epilepsy mouse hippocampi after 2 weeks daily exposure to vehicle, PLX3397 3mg/kg or 30 mg/kg. Healthy, non-epileptic mice, were added separately to determine baseline expression.
