TITLE
Epigenomics analysis of a fibrosarcoma with ESCC case

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We detected DNA methylation of a fibrosarcoma with ESCC sample and the corresponding normal sample to identify the aberrant DNA methylation status in this rare disease.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 2 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
