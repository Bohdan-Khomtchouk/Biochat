TITLE
EGFRvIII vs. Control - xenograft glioblastomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma cell lines were xenografted onto mice and resulting tumors were profiled by microarray. Xenograft recipient mice were NOD/SCID/gamma (NSG) male mice 3 months old.

DESIGN
In this set, 6 total samples were analyzed.  There were three biological replicates for each of two conditions:  EGFRvIII containing tumors and control.  Arrays were analyzed for gene expression using GeneBase and for alternative splicing using MADS+ software.
