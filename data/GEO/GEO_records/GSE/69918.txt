TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed genes and pathways for myofiber characteristics in soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles between chicken breeds differing in meat quality

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
In the modern chicken industry, fast-growing broilers have undergone strong artificial selection for muscle growth, which has led to remarkable phenotypic variations compared with slow-growing chickens. However, the molecular mechanism underlying these phenotypes differences remains unknown. In this study, a systematic identification of candidate genes and new pathways related to myofiber development and composition in chicken Soleus muscle has been made using gene expression profiles of two distinct breeds: Qingyuan partridge (QY), a slow-growing Chinese breed possessing high meat quality and Cobb 500 (CB), a commercial fast-growing broiler line. Agilent cDNA microarray analyses were conducted to determine gene expression profiles of soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscle sampled at sexual maturity age of QY (112 d) and CB (42 d).

DESIGN
two chicken breeds, two muscle types, three repeats

PLATFORM
GPL15357 Agilent-026441 Gallus gallus (Chicken) Oligo Microarray v2 (Probe Name version)
