TITLE
Genomic Run On (GRO): determination of the nascent transcriptional rates in a series of a mex67 mutant.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C

SUMMARY
The goal of the project was to check the effect on transcription rate of a sudden depletion of Mex67 protein by using a thermosensitive mutant: mex67-5

DESIGN
Cells were grown in YPD at 26ºC to 0.5 OD600. At that time cells were shifted to 37ºC to induce Mex67 protein inactivation and recovered after, 0, 5, 20, 40, 60 and 150 min.
