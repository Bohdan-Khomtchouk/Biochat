TITLE
Genomic Run On (GRO): determination of the nascent transcriptional rates in a series of a mex67 mutant.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The goal of the project was to check the effect on transcription rate of a sudden depletion of Mex67 protein by using a thermosensitive mutant: mex67-5
