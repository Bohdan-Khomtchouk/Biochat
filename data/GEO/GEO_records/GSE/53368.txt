TITLE
Copper Metabolism Domain-Containing 1 Represses Genes That Promote Inflammation and Protects Mice From Colitis and Colitis-Associated Cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background & Aims Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) has been associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Copper metabolism MURR1 domain containing 1 (COMMD1), a regulator of various transport pathways, has been shown to limit NF-κB activation. We investigated the roles of COMMD1 in the pathogenesis of colitis in mice and IBD in human beings.

DESIGN
Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) were isolated from two individual wildtype - and two Commd1 knockout mice. Cells from individual mice were splitted and were treated with LPS for 3h, 24h, or, were left untreated. The corresponding 12 cell samples were subjected to total RNA preparation and subsequently used for Single-Color-based Microarray Analysis (Agilent Technologies).
