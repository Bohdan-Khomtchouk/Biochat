TITLE
Gene Expression in the Lrrc10 knockout heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LRRC10 is a heart-specific gene required for proper cardiac function.  The effects of Lrrc10 deletion on gene expression in the adult mouse heart was investigated.

DESIGN
Lrrc10 knockout mice or wildtype controls, housed in 12 hour light:12 dark, ad lib feeding and drinking conditions were sacrificed at two months of age for cardiac gene expression analysis.  A two color, reference design experiment in which heart RNA from 2 Lrrc10 knockout mice was pooled and labeled with Cy5 and hybridized according to Agilent protocols against a reference pool of RNA madeup from respective tissue taken from 2 month wildtype mice  which was labeled with Cy3.
