TITLE
Genome-wide expression of the epithelial layer cells of mice injected with Clostridium difficile Toxin A and B

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Toxin A (TcdA) and Toxin B (TcdB), of the pathogen Clostridium difficile, are virulence factors that cause gross pathologic changes (e.g. inflammation, secretion, and diarrhea) in the infected host, yet the molecular and cellular pathways leading to observed host responses are poorly understood. To address this gap, TcdA and/or TcdB were injected into the ceca of mice and the genome-wide transcriptional response of epithelial layer cells was examined. Bioinformatic analysis of gene expression identified sets of cooperatively expressed genes. Further analysis of inflammation associated genes revealed dynamic chemokine responses.

DESIGN
In total, 32 samples were analyzed (one microarray per mouse). The sample groups are separated by two factors: Toxin (TcdA, TcdB, TcdA+TcdB, or Sham injection) and endpoint (2, 6, or 16h). TcdA+B at 16h was not included, leaving 11 sample groups. Each sample group included biological triplicates, except TcdA+TcdB at 6h (one array) and Sham injection at 16h (four arrays).
