TITLE
Gene expression on CD11b+ IgA and CD11b- IgA cells in the small intestine #01

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare gene expression between CD11b+ IgA and CD11b- IgA cells in the small intestine, each cell population was isolated from the murine small intestine.

DESIGN
Similar experiment with different sample was performed as described in Gene expression on CD11b+ IgA and CD11b- IgA cells in the small intestine #02
