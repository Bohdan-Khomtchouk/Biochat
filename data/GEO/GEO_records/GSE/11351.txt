TITLE
Peroxide stress in Sigma54 mutant and Wt

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

SUMMARY
Analyses of the Wild type and the sigma 54 mutant strain NZ7306 with and without peroxide treatment: A Lactobacillus plantarum strain with a deletion in the alternative sigma factor 54 (?54) encoding gene rpoN, displayed a 100 fold higher sensitivity to peroxide as compared to its parental strain. This feature could be due to ?54-dependent regulation of genes involved in peroxide stress response. However, transcriptome analyses of the wild type and the mutant strain during peroxide exposure did not support such a role for ?54. Subsequent experiments revealed that the impaired expression of the mannose PTS operon in the rpoN mutant caused the observed increased peroxide sensitivity. Keywords: genetic modification
