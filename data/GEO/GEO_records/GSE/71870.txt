TITLE
Epigenetic silencing of Th1 chemokines shapes tumor immunity, immunotherapy and patient outcome [shEZH2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To define the gene profile altered by EZH2 and H3K27me3 in response to IFNg, we performed several microarrays in primary ovarian cancer cells transfected with shEZH2 or treated with GSK126. We found that 155 and 124 genes were altered by shEZH2 and GSK126 treatment, respectively, and 20 genes were increased or decreased by both shEZH2 and GSK126 treatment.

DESIGN
Primary ovarian cancer cells were pretreated with GSK126, or transduced with a shEZH2 lentivirus, and stimulated with IFNg for 24 hours. RNA were isolated by Rneasy kit according to the manufacturer's protocol, and applied for affymetrix microarray at University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core
