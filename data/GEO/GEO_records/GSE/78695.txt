TITLE
Q0990.bdl vs Q0990.Col

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of  Q0990 x bdl vs Q0990 x Col-0 development embryos after 3days and 6 days of fertilization

DESIGN
Two conditional experiments: Q0990 x bdl vs Q0990 x Col-0, and two satges was compared: 3days and 6 days after fertilization. . 4 biological replicates for each experiment. The submitter states that the Agilent Feature Extraction files have been lost: the original files was stored in a unrecoverable crashed computer,  because the Base 2 in my institute is  not in service anymore, so I can not re-download my file with the Agilent  Feature

PLATFORM
GPL21520 Arabidopsis Oligonucleotide Microarrays Version 3.0, 70-mer oligonucleotide v2
