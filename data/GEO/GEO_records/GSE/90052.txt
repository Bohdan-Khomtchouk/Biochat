TITLE
Topoisomerase I dependent gene expression in human primary astrocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression measurements were carried out in human primary astrocytes treated with either 0.1% DMSO (Control) or 300nM Topotecan for 24h and 48h, to assess the effect of topoisomerase I inhibition on the transcription of long genes.

DESIGN
Treatment was carried out in triplicate wells of a 6-well plate.
