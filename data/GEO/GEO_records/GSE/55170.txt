TITLE
Infection of Myeloid Angiogenic Cells (MACs) with Bartonella henselae (B.h.) induces a chord formation phenotype in vitro.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Myeloid Angiogenic Cells (MACs) were infected with the intracellular, bacterial pathogen Bartonella henselae (B.h.). Infected cells were seeded onto Matrigel coated plates. While uninfected cells showed no phenotypic changes and died over time, infected cells showed strong phenotypic changes and developed into complex 2D chord networks over the course of long term culture (eg 49d). To examine the changes in gene expression associated with the development of the B.h.dependent chord formation phenotype, RNA was isolated from MACs shortly after isolation (d4) and from cells of the chord structures (+B.h. Matrigel). As primary endothelial cells are also know to form chord networks when cultured on Matrigel, a sample of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured on Matrigel for 12hr was also included in the analysis as a control.

DESIGN
myeloid angiogenic cells (MACs) from three donors were compared d4 after isolation with MACs infected with Bartonella henselae and cultured on Matrigel coated plates for up to 49 days, 1 sample from human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 12hr on Matrigel coated plates were also included as a control.
