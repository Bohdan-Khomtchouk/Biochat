TITLE
Genome-wide maps of histone H4 acetylation in human K562 cells in optimal growth conditions and upon heat stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide characterization of histone H4 acetylation in K562 cells in optimal growth conditions (NHS) and upon 30 min heat stress at 42Â°C (HS30).

DESIGN
ChIP-seq mapping of histone H4 acetylation in non-treated and heat shocked K562 cells. Input (fragmentet total chromatin) serves as a background control. The antibody (UpState 06-866) recognizes histone H4 acetylation at lysines 5, 8, 12 and 16. Ten ChIP-replicates in each condition were prepared separately, then pooled together, purified, and sequenced as a single sample with paired-end sequencing (HiSeq PE100). Please, see also GSE43579 where HSF1 and HSF2 target loci, as well as IgG controls, were prepared from the same cell populations and in parallel ChIP-experiments, but were sequenced earlier and only from single end.
