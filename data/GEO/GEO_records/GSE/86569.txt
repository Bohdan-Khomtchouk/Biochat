TITLE
Different expression of inflammation-related proteins in human heart failure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Heart failure (HF) causes various inflammatory responses. It remains unclear whether the inflammation the cause or effect of HF. Therefore, we wished to characterize the transcript profiles in the left ventricle (LV) of preserved and failed hearts respectively. Results: Twenty inflammatory genes were differentially expressed between the preserved and failed LV respectively.
