TITLE
Transcriptional profile comparing Hep3B transfected with miR-19b inhibitor with Hep3B transfected with control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-19b was up-regulated with hepatocellular carcinoma. We compared the transcriptional profile of Hep 3B transfected with miR-19b inhibitor with Hep3B transfected with control to identify genes affected by miR-19b knockdown.
