TITLE
Expression data from hMSC-TERT4 cells after siZNF25 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differentiation of human skeletal stem cells (hMSC) into osteoblasts is regulated by a few well described transcription factors. Our study used clustering and gene expression data to identify a novel transcription factor. ZNF25, which we showed is involved in osteoblast differentiation. We used microarrays to study gene expression of hMSC-TERT4 cells after siZNF25 knockdown. hMSC-TERT4 cells were sampled as undifferentiated hMSC and as differentiated osteoblasts.

DESIGN
hMSC-TERT4 cells were transfected with siZNF25. Gene expression was analysed using Affymetrix microarrays at days 0 post osteoblast induction and days 14 post osteoblast induction.
