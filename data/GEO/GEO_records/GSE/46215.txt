TITLE
Identification of genes regulated by glucocorticoids and an RNA binding protein (RBP) in early erythroid progenitor using microarray experiment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Early erythroid progenitors were isolated from mouse E14.5 fetal liver, infected with viruses encoding either control shRNA or shRNAs targeting the RNA binding protein (RBP), and cultured in a medium containing stem cell factor, erythropoietin, and insulin-like growth factor 1, in the absence or presence of dexamethasone (DEX). After 3 days of culture, microarray experiments were carried out to profile the gene expression pattern of these cells.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA expression profiles in day3 cultured cells
