TITLE
Expression data from testes and abdomen in fertile and sterile introgression males

ORGANISM
Drosophila simulans

SUMMARY
Postmating reproductive isolation is often manifested as hybrid male sterility, for which X-linked genes are over-represented. In contrast, X-linked gene are significantly under-represented among testis-expressing gene.This seeming contradiction may be germane to the X:autosome imbalance hypothesis on hybrid sterility ,in which the X-linked effect is mediated mainly through the misexpression of autosomal genes. We compared gene expression in fertile and sterile males in the hybrids between two Drosophila species. These hybrid males differ only in a small region of the X chromosome containing the OdsH locus of hybrid sterility. Of genes expressed in the testis, autosomal genes were indeed more likely to be misexpressed than X-linked genes under the steriizing action of OdsH.

DESIGN
We compared gene expression between D. simulans males that carried either a fertile or sterile introgression (referred to as F or S males, respectively) from D. mauritiana. The introgressions span approximately 1/10 of the X chromosome, but the difference between the two introgressions is only about 3 Kb which contains exons 3 â€“ 4 of OdsH. In short, F and S males have the same genetic background with respect to species origin, except the source of a portion of the OdsH gene. Three separate extractions and hybridizations were carried out for the RNA samples derived from testes and abdomens in each of two introgression lines.
