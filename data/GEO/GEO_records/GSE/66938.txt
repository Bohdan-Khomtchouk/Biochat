TITLE
Food protein-induced activation and death of CD4+ Helios+ Foxp3- T cells is required for IL-10 production and intestinal homeostasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The impact of dietary proteins on homeostasis and immune function of the intestine is poorly understood. We here show that physiological uptake of dietary proteins induced an activated, CD4+CD44+Helios+ T cell population, predominantly in Peyer's patches (PP). These cells are distinct from Foxp3+regulatory T cells and microbiota-independent. Dietary protein-reactive T lymphocytes remained innocuous due to an equilibrium between activation and apoptosis. Macrophage mediated uptake of apoptotic T cells from the PP but not from other tissues resulted in strong IL-10 expression. In contrast, replacement of dietary proteins by amino acids resulted in low numbers of activated and apoptotic CD4+CD44+Helios+ T cells together with reduced amounts of IL-10 and downregulation of genes involved in intestinal integrity such as trefoil factors and gastrokines. The impaired intestinal barrier function of these animals was restored after switching to conventional diet, demonstrating the essential role of food proteins for induction of epithelial repair mechanisms and immunological homeostasis.

DESIGN
Microarray experiments were performed as dual-color hybridizations on Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome 4x44K catalog arrays. To compensate for dye-specific effects, a dye-reversal color-swap was applied.
