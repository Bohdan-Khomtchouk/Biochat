TITLE
Maternal microRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs detected in Drosophila melanogaster unfertilized eggs

DESIGN
Bloomington w[1118] flies were kept at 25ÂºC on cornmeal based media, with 12 hours light/dark cycles. Virgin females were sorted at the pupae stage to avoid any unwanted fertilization. In a population cage I let 80-100 females to lay eggs in apple juice agar plates for 8 hours, collecting 1 hour after dawn. Eggs were collected with a sieve and washed with saline solution. Small RNA was size selected and sequenced.
