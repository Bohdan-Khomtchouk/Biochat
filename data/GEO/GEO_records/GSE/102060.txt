TITLE
The plasticizer Bisphenol A favors cancer progression in adult zebrafish by perturbing the epigenome: A systems level analysis of the miRNome (mRNA).

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor (ED), has raised concerns for both human and ecosystem health. Epigenetic factors, including microRNAs, are key regulators of gene expression during cancer. The effect of BPA exposure on the zebrafish epigenome remains poorly characterized. Zebrafish represents an excellent model to study cancer as the organism develops disease that resembles human cancer. Using zebrafish as systems toxicology model, we hypothesized that chronic BPA-exposure impacts the miRNome in adult zebrafish and establishes an epigenome more susceptible to cancer development. After a 21 day exposure to 100 nM BPA, RNA from the liver was extracted to perform high throughput mRNA and miRNA sequencing. Differential expression (DE) analyses comparing BPA-exposed to control specimens were performed using established bioinformatics pipelines. In the BPA-exposed liver, 6,188 mRNAs and 15 miRNAs were differently expressed (q â‰¤ 0.1). By analyzing human orthologs of the DE zebrafish genes signatures associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell cycle were uncovered. Chronic exposure to BPA has a significant impact on the liver miRNome in adult zebrafish and has the potential to cause adverse outcomes including cancer.
