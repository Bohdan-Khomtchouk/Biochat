TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human bone marrow cells (hMSC-TERT) transfected with mIR-320c or miR-negative control at 72hrs post-transfection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray  to identify changes in gene expression in human bone marrow MSCs (hMSC-TERT) transfected with miR-320c or miR-negative control at 72hrs post-transfection

DESIGN
Human MSC line (hMSC-TERT) were transfected with miR-320c (30 nM) or miR-negative control (30 nM), subsequently, RNA was extracted using Norgen total RNA isolation kit at 72hrs post-transfection. Extracted RNA was labeled and then hybridized to the one-color Agilent Human GE 8x60K Microarray chip.
