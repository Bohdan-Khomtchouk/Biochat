TITLE
Differentially expressed adipocyte-associated genes in Bone-marrow Mesenchymal stem cells under normal and hypoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify proteins involved in the regulation of adipogenic differentiation under hypoxic conditions, an RT2 Profiler PCR array was used to screen a panel of 84 genes associated with human adipogenesis in Bone-marrow Mesenchymal stem cells under normal and hypoxic conditions.

DESIGN
Bone-marrow Mesenchymal stem cells were put in hypoxic chamber, set at an oxygen concentration of 0.2%. Cells under normoxia are considered as a control.

PLATFORM
