TITLE
Comparison of plant responses upon Aphanomyces euteiches infection in wild type (A17) and NFP allelic mutants

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
affy_aphanomyces_medicago - NFP is one of the putative Nod factor receptor and plays therefore a key role in the establishment of symbiosis. nfp allelic mutants are more susceptible to Aphanomyces euteiches (Ae), a root pathogen, than the A17 wild type (WT) line.  In this study we want to compare the early plant responses, 1 day post inoculation (dpi) between WT and the nfp2 mutant, in order to identify NFP-dependent gene networks during infection.-Fifteen-day-old A17 or nfp-2 plants were grown in vitro on M medium. The entire roots were then inoculated (or not = controls) with a A. euteiches zoospores (105/ml) and harvested one day after inoculation. Three independent repeats were performed.
