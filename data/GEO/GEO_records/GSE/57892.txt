TITLE
A specific missense mutation in GTF2I occurs at high frequency in thymic epithelial tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Next generation sequencing of 28 thymic epithelial tumors (TETs) revealed a high frequency of GTF2I missense mutation (chr7:74146970T/A) in A thymomas, a  relatively indolent subtype. The GTF2I mutation was confirmed in 82% of A and 74% of AB thymomas in a series of 274 TETs but was rare in aggressive subtypes, where recurrent mutations of known cancer genes were identified. Therefore, GTF2I mutation correlated with a better survival. GTF2I Beta and Delta isoforms were expressed in TETs and both mutant isoforms were able to stimulate cell proliferation in vitro. Thymic carcinomas presented a higher number of mutations than thymomas (average 43.5 and 18.4, respectively). Recurrent mutations of known cancer genes, including TP53, CYLD, CDKN2A, BAP1 and PBRM1 were identified in thymic carcinomas. These findings will complement the diagnostic work up of these rare tumors, and also help the development of a molecular classification, and assessment of prognosis and treatment strategies.

DESIGN
Tumor samples of 286 patients were collected from 4 different institutions: National Cancer Institute (Bethesda MD), Pisa University Hospital (Pisa, Italy), Padua University Hospital (Padua, Italy) and IRCCS Istituto Clinico Humanitas (Rozzano, Italy).
