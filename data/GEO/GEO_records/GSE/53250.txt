TITLE
The DNA Double-Strand Break Response Is Abnormal in Myeloblasts From Patients With Therapy-Related Acute Myeloid Leukemia [NimbleGen]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to examine if acquired copy number alterations in DNA repair genes is commonly observed in therapy-related AML, we used this custom built NimbleGen array with dense tiling of probes in 170 DNA repair genes to interrogate paired normal (skin) and tumor (bone marrow) samples.

DESIGN
DNA was extracted from bone marrow cells or skin biopsy samples  taken directly from patients after written informed consent. DNA was labeled and hybridized to custom built NimbleGen array CGH chips containing dense tiling in 170 DNA repair genes to detect copy number amplification.

PLATFORM
GPL18053 NimbleGen Human CGH array [091130_HG18_DL_CGH; condensed PROBE_ID version]
