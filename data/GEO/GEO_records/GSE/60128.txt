TITLE
Toxicity Evaluation of Manufactured CeO2 Nanoparticles Before and After Alteration: Combined Physicochemical and Whole-Genome Expression Analysis in Caco-2 Cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression to distinguish the effect of environmental aging on the toxicity of several cerium oxide nanoparticles (NPs) in human intestinal cells compared  .  Cells were exposed in vitro, and datasets of differentially expressed genes were identified for each type of NPs versus control samples.

DESIGN
NPs induced gene expression in Caco-2 cells was measured at 24 hours after exposure .  Six independent experiments were performed  using different NPs and controls for each experiment.
