TITLE
Prevalence of Copy-number neutral LOH in glioblastomas revealed by analysis of laser-microdissected tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed a laser capture microdissection technique and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays to characterize genomic alterations associated with the development of glioblastomas.  Combined analysis of LOH and copy number revealed that more than half of the identified 254 LOH loci showed no copy number alteration, indicating the presence of copy-number neutral LOH Keywords: DNA copy number, Loss of heterozygosity
