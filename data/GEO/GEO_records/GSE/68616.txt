TITLE
Complex transcriptional regulation and independent evolution of fungal-like traits in a relative of animals

ORGANISM
Creolimax fragrantissima

SUMMARY
To understand the evolution of genome regulation and cell differentiation, we investigated the transcriptional dynamics of the ichthyosporean Creolimax fragrantissima, a close relative of animals that undergoes coenocytic development. We report the transcriptional differences between the amoeboid stage and the multinucleate stage of this species, describing the various aspects of differential genome regualtion found in those samples.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA profiles from 2 stages of C. fragrantissima development.
