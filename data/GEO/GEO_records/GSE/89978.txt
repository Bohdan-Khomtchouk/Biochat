TITLE
Comprehensive miRNA expression profiling in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by small RNA-sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled the full miRNA expression profile of 48 T-ALL patient samples from different subtypes by means of small RNA-sequencing, identifying for the first time subtype specific miRNA signatures. In addition we also profiled T-ALL cell lines by small RNA-sequencing, recapitulating the subtype specific miRNAs. Furthermore, profiling of CD34+ and CD4+CD8+ healthy donor thymocytes identified several novel potential oncogenic miRNAs or miRNAs with a tumor suppressive role in T-ALL. With these datasets, we complement the mRNA and lncRNA T-ALL subtype specific expression signatures with miRNAs, leading to the full transcriptomic profile of T-ALL subtypes.

DESIGN
Small RNA-seq of 48 patient samples, 2 CD34+ thymocyte subsets, 2 CD4+CD8+ thymocyte subsets and 7 T-ALL cell lines

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
