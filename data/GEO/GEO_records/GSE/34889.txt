TITLE
Molecular Mechanisms of Diabetic Neuropathy: A Transcriptional Profling Study of db/db Mouse Sciatic Nerve

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy (DN) development and progression  are not fully understood. We examined global gene expression in the  sciatic nerve (SCN) of BKS-db/db mice at 8 and 24 weeks of age to  identify genetic pathways altered in peripheral nerves at early and  advanced stages of DN. The sets of differentially expressed genes were  analyzed to identify enriched biological functions and regulated  genetic pathways. Our results suggest that carbohydrate metabolism and  lipid metabolism pathways are dysregulated in the db/db SCN at 8 weeks  of age. Impairment of Schwann cell-extracellular matrix interaction  and axon guidance occurs early in the development of DN, while  neurotrophic support, neurotransmitter transport and axonogenesis are  impaired at the advanced stage of DN. Gene expression changes also  suggest that oxidative stress- and inflammation-mediated nerve damage occurs by 8 weeks. Our analysis identified mechanisms regulated in the early stages of DN. Additionally, interactions between genes from different pathways provide insight into potential relationships among the regulated pathways.

DESIGN
RNA extracted from the SCN of four groups of mice: (8 week old db/db (n=8) or db/+ (n=8), and 24 week old db/db (n=6) or db/+ (n=7)) was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. Gene expression for the two genotypes (db/db vs. db/+) was compared at each age. Gene expression at the early and advanced stages of DN (8 weeks vs. 24 weeks) was also compared for each genotype.
