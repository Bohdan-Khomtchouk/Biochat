TITLE
Integrative Gene Expression Profiling Reveals G6PD-Mediated Resistance to RNA-Directed Nucleoside Analogues in B-Cell Neoplasms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
8-amino-adenosine (8-NH2-Ado) inhibits RNA synthesis and specifically inhibits synthesis of mRNAs with short half-lives.  We hypothesize that the mRNAs affected code for proteins important in apoptosis and glucose metabolism.  Gene Expression Arrays will help us understand which gene families may be affected by this drug and give us a better understanding of mechanism of action of this drug

DESIGN
1.  MM.1S cells treated with 8-amino-adenosine for 0, 5 hrs and 17 hrs. (myeloma cells sensitive to the drug) 2.  U266 cells treated with 8-amino-adenosine for 0, 5 hrs and 17 hrs. (myeloma cells resistant to the drug). 3.  Jeko cells treated with 8-amino-adenosine for 0, 5 hrs and 17 hrs. (Mantle cell lymphoma cells sensitive to drug) 4.  Granta cells treated with 8-amino-adenosine for 0, 5 hrs and 17 hrs. (Mantle cell lymphoma cells resistant to drug).
