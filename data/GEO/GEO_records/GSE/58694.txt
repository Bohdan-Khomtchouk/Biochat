TITLE
Affymetrix CytoScan HD array data for patient with Intellectual Disabilities

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Standard cytogenetic GTG-banding analysis (550 bands) revealed an interstitial deletion on 15q21q22 chromosomal region. Refinement of the 15q21.2 deletion intervals was conducted using aCGH (Cytoscan HD, Affymetrix) on DNA samples from the patient. This assay revealed the presence of submicroscopic alterations on chromosomes 1, 9 and 15. The result was arr[hg19] 9p24.1(6,619,823-6,749,335)x3, 1q44(248,688,586-248,795,277)x1, 15q21.2q22.2(50,848,301-61,298,006)x1.

DESIGN
Affymetrix CytoScan HD arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples.
