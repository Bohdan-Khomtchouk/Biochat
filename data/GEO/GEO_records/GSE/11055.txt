TITLE
Temporal expression analysis of C. elegans larvae hatching in the presence and absence of food.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
When C. elegans larvae hatch in the absence of food they persist in a stress resistant, developmentally arrested state (L1 arrest).  We characterized mRNA expression genome-wide in a pair of bifurcating time series starting in the late embryo and proceeding through the hatch in the presence and absence of food (E. coli). We used Affymetrix C. elegans expression arrays to measure gene expression in 18 total timepoint/conditions in three biological replicates. Keywords: time course; plus/minus food
