TITLE
Human Natural Killer Cell activation by mycobacteria

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purified NK cells were co-cultured with M. bovis BCG or M. tuberculosis H37Rv (1:1) in the presence of IL-2 (100U/ml) or IL-12 (10pg/ml) for 24h before trizol extraction. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression underlying NK cell activation by mycobacteria.

DESIGN
NK cell were isolated from the blood of 6 independent donors and activated with different mycobacteria and cytokines in order to study their transcriptional profiles according to mycobacterial virulence.
