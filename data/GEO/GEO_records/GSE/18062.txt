TITLE
Microarray of RNA from calvaria in WT and OASIS-/- (KO) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in OASIS KO calvaria compared to wild-type calvaria. To gain further insight into the potential mechanisms underlying the defective bone formation in OASIS KO mice, we compared the gene expression in calvaria between WT and OASIS KO mice using a microarray.

DESIGN
Each sample of total RNA was collected from a number of  mice.
