TITLE
The effect of inhaled IFNbeta (SNG001) versus placebo on peripheral blood mononuclear cells during an upper respiratory tract infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of whole blood samples (collected into PAXgene tubes from PreAnalytiX) during a phase II double-blind, randomized (1:1 ratio) clinical trial in which inhaled IFN-β (SNG001) or placebo treatment was initiated within 24 hours of asthmatics reporting cold symptoms. Patients were dosed once a day for 14 days, with samples collected at day 1 (prior to first dose), day 4 and day 7.  Analysis of genome-wide gene expression (only conducted using samples from the BTS Step 4/5, mITT subgroup), showed a treatment-related enhancement of systemic innate immunity, thereby providing compelling evidence for exogenous IFN-β enhancing antiviral responses.

DESIGN
Placebo versus SNG001 (IFNbeta). Day 4 (visit 3); Placebo 25 replicates, SNG001 18 replicates.  Day 7 (visit 4); Placebo 28 replicates, SNG001 20 replicates.
