TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of boars with high and low skatole levels

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Skatole is one of the compounds causing boar taint in meat of uncastrated male pigs. This study focuses on differences in gene expression of 50 Danish Landrace boars with high and low skatole levels. The animals were divided into 2 groups based on the skatole measurements, with animals having a skatole concentration of less than 0.01 ppm in one group, and above 0.275 ppm in the other group. Gene expression was assessed using porcine oligonucleotide microarrays. We report differential expression of CYP2E1, CYP2A13 and suggests involvement of FMO1, HSD17B13, CBR4 and several transcription factors.

DESIGN
Gene expression study of liver, comparison of 25 boars with high and 25 boars with low skatole levels, using in-house printed porcine two-colour oligonucleotide microarrays.
