TITLE
OVX/P4/6h/UTX 129 WT vs. Hoxa-10-/-

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Female mice used were SvJ/129, 10-16 weeks of age; Hoxa-10+/+ and Hoxa-10-/- littermates were used in parallel experiments. 14 days after ovariectomy, mice were injected subcutaneously with progesterone dissolved in sesame oil (Sigma; 0.2mg/0.1mL/mouse), followed by sacrifice and removal of uterine horns at 6 hours after injection.  8 uterine horns from 4 mice were pooled to form one sample.  Total RNA preparation, cRNA labeling and hybridization were performed according to recommendations by Affymetrix. The 6 samples were obtained and processed in two batches: (1: GSM3047 and GSM3041), and (2: GSM3048, GSM3049, GSM3042, and GSM3043). Keywords: other
