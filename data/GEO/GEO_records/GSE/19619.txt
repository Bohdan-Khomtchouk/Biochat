TITLE
PARP-1, H3 and H3K4me3 ChIP-chip from MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We are examining the mechanisms by which the nuclear enzyme PARP-1 regulates gene expression.  We performed ChIP-chip for PARP-1, histone H3 and H3K4me3 (lysine 4 trimethylation on histone H3) in MCF7 breast carcinoma cells, and looked at 23550 RefSeq genes to determine binding patterns of these factors at promoters.  Each experiment was performed in duplicate.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip biological replicates for PARP-1, H3 and H3K4me3 (2 replicates each) from MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells are included.
