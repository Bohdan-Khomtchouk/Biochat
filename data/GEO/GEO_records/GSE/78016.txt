TITLE
Analysis of genes regulated by AS2 and RH10 at 22, 26Â°C

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
AS2 encodes a protein containing AS2 domain and epigenetically regulate transcription. RH10 encodes an ortholog of human DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX47. These genes are involved in the formation of axes of leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana. To know the gene regulation in the leaf development, expression profile among wild-type, as2, rh10 and as2 rh10 double mutant plants were compared.

DESIGN
Shoot apices that contain leaf primordia were selected.
