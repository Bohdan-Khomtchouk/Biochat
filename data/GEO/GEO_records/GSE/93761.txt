TITLE
Phosphate solubilization and gene expression of phosphate-solubilizing bacterium Burkholderia multivorans WS-FJ9 under different levels of soluble phosphate

ORGANISM
Burkholderia multivorans

SUMMARY
Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) have the ability to dissolve insoluble phosphate and enhance soil fertility. However, the growth and mineral phosphate solubilization of PSB could be affected by exogenous soluble phosphate and the mechanism has not been fully understood. In the present study, the growth and mineral phosphate-solubilizing characteristics of PSB strain Burkholderia multivorans WS-FJ9 were investigated at six levels of exogenous soluble phosphate (0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 and 20 mM). The WS-FJ9 strain showed better growth at high levels of soluble phosphate. The phosphate-solubilizing activity of WS-FJ9 reduced as the soluble phosphate concentration increased, as well as the production of pyruvic acid. Transcriptome profiling of WS-FJ9 at three levels of exogenous soluble phosphate (0, 5 and 20 mM) identified 446 differentially expressed genes, among which 44 genes were continuously up-regulated when soluble phosphate concentration increased and 81 genes were continuously down-regulated. Some genes related to cell growth were continuously up-regulated which would account for the better growth of WS-FJ9 at high levels of soluble phosphate. Genes involved in glucose metabolism, including glycerate kinase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and sugar ABC-type transporter were continuously down-regulated which indicates that metabolic channeling of glucose towards phosphorylative pathway was negatively regulated by soluble phosphate.

DESIGN
In the present study, the growth and mineral phosphate-solubilizing characteristics of PSB strain Burkholderia multivorans WS-FJ9 were investigated at six levels of exogenous soluble phosphate (0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 and 20 mM).Transcriptome profiling of WS-FJ9 at three levels of exogenous soluble phosphate (0, 5 and 20 mM) were analysised.
