TITLE
Ab initio identification of transcription start sites (TSSs) in the Rhesus macaque genome by histone modification and RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
We addressed the lack of experimentally supported transcript annotations in the Rhesus macaque genome by ab initio identification of the transcription start sites (TSSs). We took advantage of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3)'s ability to mark TSSs and the recently developed ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq technology to survey the transcript structures in the macaque brain. We then integrated the two types of our newly generated data with genomic sequence features and extended a TSS prediction algorithm to ab initio predict and verify 16,833 of previously electronically annotated transcription start sites at 500 bp resolution and predicted ~10,000 new TSSs.
