TITLE
Roles for microRNAs, miR-93 and miR-130b, and TP53INP1 tumor suppressor in cell growth dysregulation by HTLV-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is to study the role of miRNAs in human T-cell leukemia virus-1, HTLV-1.

DESIGN
In this study, we profiled the miRNA expression in virus transformed human cell lines and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Adult-T cell leukemia (ATL) patients using the RNA-primed, array-based Klenow enzyme (RAKE) assay.
