TITLE
Expression data from Neuro2a mouse neuroblastoma cell lines, anchorage dependent cells (AD) and anchorage-independent tumorspheres (AI)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ability of high-risk neuroblastoma to survive unfavorable growth conditions and multimodal therapy is hypothesized to result from a phenomenon known as reversible adaptive plasticity (RAP). RAP is a novel phenomenon enabling neuroblastoma cells to transition between a proliferative anchorage dependent (AD) state and a slow growing anoikis-resistant anchorage independent (AI) state. We used microarrays to investigate the global gene expression profiles in AD and AI cells, and to identify the differential expressed genes within signaling pathways contributing to the reversible adaptive plasticity between AD and AI cells.

DESIGN
Comparison of microarray data from AD cells (n=4 independent cultures) versus AI cells (n=4 independent cultures) were performed using Partek Genomics Suite 6.5. Differentially expressed genes with an FDR ≤5% and a fold-change ≥1.5 were selected for pathway analysis.
