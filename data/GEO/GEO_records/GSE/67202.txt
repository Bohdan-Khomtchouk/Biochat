TITLE
Transcriptomes of ΔrelAspoT and ΔdksA mutants of Haemophilus ducreyi in mid-log, transition, and stationary phase

ORGANISM
Haemophilus ducreyi 35000HP

SUMMARY
To better understand the role of the (p)ppGpp-mediated stringent response in control of H. ducreyi  virulence determinants, here we defined genes potentially regulated by either (p)ppGpp or DksA by using RNA-seq. We were able to show that loss of either (p)ppGpp or DksA resulted in dysregulation of multiple genes including several known virulence determinants. We also show that loss of (p)ppGpp or DksA resulted in differential expression of putative H. ducreyi small RNAs.

DESIGN
RNA of Haemophilus ducreyi wildtype, relAspoT and dksA mutants were collected at mid-log, transition, and stationary phases of growth, in quadruplicate using stranded RNA -seq.
