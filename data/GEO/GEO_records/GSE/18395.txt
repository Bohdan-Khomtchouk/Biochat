TITLE
Expression data from mouse adult fibroblasts with  Rb deletion and/or p53DD expression exposed to cisplatin (CDDP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The RB and p53 tumor suppressor pathways regulate the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle progression, DNA replication, DNA repair, and apoptosis. These tumor suppressors are critical modulators of the response to genotoxic damage and both pathways are frequently inactivated in human cancers. We used microarrays to monitor gene expression patterns upon exposure to cisplatin treatment in fibroblasts harboring loss/inactivation of RB and/or p53.

DESIGN
We generated mouse adult fibroblasts harboring loss/inactivation of RB and/or p53 and subjected these cell populations to cisplatin treatment for 24 hours. Treated cell populations were allowed to recover from cisplatin exposure, generating a recurred cell popuation. Untreated and recurred cell populations were then subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
