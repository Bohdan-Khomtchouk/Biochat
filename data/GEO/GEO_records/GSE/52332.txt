TITLE
Comparative transcriptome analysis of Ptf1aCre;Kras,Brg1-/- vs. Ptf1a;Kras;p53+/- subcutaneous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this experiment the RNA of s.c. grown tumors of cancer cell lines of murine Ptf1aCre;Kras,Brg1-/- vs. Ptf1a;Kras;p53+/- PDA was isolated and analyzed for gene expression. Ptf1aCre;Kras,Brg1-/- s.c. PDA grows more benign as compared to Ptf1a;Kras;p53+/- PDA; and the rationale of this study was to identify genes responsible for this different biological behavior.

DESIGN
Total RNA of s.c. tumors of  Ptf1aCre;Kras,Brg1-/- vs. Ptf1a;Kras;p53+/- cancer cell lines was isolated, purified and analyzed on the deep sequencing platform.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
