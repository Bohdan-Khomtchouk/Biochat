TITLE
Organ-specific gene expression in single differentiating Drosophila embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Age-matched stage 13 embryos were dissected and cDNA of 8 organs from each embryo were sequenced. The organs were foregut, anterior midgut, posterior midgut, hindgut, Malpighian tubules, left salivary gland, right salivary gland, ventral nerve cord. Gene expression, transcription start and stop sites, and strands of termini were analysed. SMART amplification adapters were used for finding transcript termini and for phasing.

DESIGN
3 embryos, 8 organs from each. PolyA RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using an improved SMART protocol.
