TITLE
Expression data from Dnmt3a-deficient and control mouse MYC induced T-cell lymphomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dnmt3a catalyzes DNA methylation of gDNA, which contributes to the transriptional regulations of genes and genomic stability.

DESIGN
Dnmt3a was deleted in the hematopoietic compartment in the presence of MYC. Mice developed T-cell lymphomas which were analyzed by expression arrays.
