TITLE
Genome-wide screening of HNF1b binding sites identifies transcriptional regulation of the Kir4.1/Kir5.1 potassium channel

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
chIP-seq was used to provide a genome-wide screening of transcription factor HNF1B binding sites to further elucidate its effect on cyst formation, diabetes and electrolyte handling in patients. A highly specific dataset for Hnf1b binding was constructed for an immortalized murine DCT cell line (mpkDCT4a).

DESIGN
1 transcription factor and 1 histone modification in 1 cell type
