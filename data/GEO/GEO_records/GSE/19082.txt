TITLE
IL6 - IFNγ crosstalk experiment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment tested whether pretreatment of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) with interferon-gamma (IFNγ) for 2h affected the transcriptional response to 1h exposure to interleukin-6 (IL-6).

DESIGN
Human microvascular endothelial cells in culture; exposure to IFNγ 1 ng/ml for 3 h alone, with IFNγ 1 ng/ml for 2 h and then with IL6 50 U/ml for 1 h, with IL6 50 U/ml alone, or with neither. 4 replicates for each condition. RNA isolation, Illumina expression arrays. The supplementary file 'GSE19082_non-normalized_data.txt' contains non-normalized data for Samples GSM472434-GSM472449.
