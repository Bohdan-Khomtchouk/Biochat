TITLE
Profile of microRNAs potentially regulated by Bmi1 in Sca1+ Cardiac Protenitor Cells (CPC)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared miRNA expression profiles of B+ and sh-Bmi1 CPCs, looking for miRNAs that show a significant upregulation in B+ CPCs and reduction in sh-Bmi1 CPCs.

DESIGN
To assess the potential involvement of BMI1 in control of miRNA expression in Sca1-CPCs, we transduced freshly isolated CPCs with lentiviral vectors overexpressing or silencing Bmi1. Different replicates of infection were used.
