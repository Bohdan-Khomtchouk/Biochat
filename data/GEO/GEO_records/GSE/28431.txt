TITLE
Skipsey: Fenclorim safening of Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Wild type Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 root cultures, were treated with fenclorim or 4-chloro-6-methyl-2-phenylpyrimidine dissolved in acetone to achieve a final concentration of 100uM. The final acetone concentration of 0.1% was replicated in control root cultures. Samples were taken at four and twenty-four hours post addition in biological triplicate. Root cultures were routinely maintained at 25C in the dark.

DESIGN
18 samples were used in this experiment
