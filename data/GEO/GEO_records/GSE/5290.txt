TITLE
Temperature sensitive eIF5A mutant shows accumulation of transcripts targeted to the Nonsense Mediated Decay pathway

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The highly conserved protein eIF5A found in archaea and all eucaryotes uniquely contains the posttranslationally formed amino acid hypusine. Despite being essential the functions of this protein and its modification remain unclear. To gain more insight into these functions temperature sensitive mutants of the human EIF5A1 were characterized in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. EIF5A is proposed to be an RNA binding protein. Thus, we used microarrays to identify special RNA subsets of up- and downregulation that are influenced by a limited eIF5A function in strains expressing a point mutated form of eIF5A. Keywords: two sets of four biological replicates of wild-type and mutant strains
