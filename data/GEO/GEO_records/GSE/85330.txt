TITLE
Genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiling of cardiomyocyte differentiation from human embryonic stem cells and iPS cells (ATAC-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, time-course genome-wide chromatin accessibility of caidiomyocyte differentiation derived from human hESCs and hiPSCs was profiled. Two hiPSC lines (C15 and C20) and two hESC lines (H1 and H9) were differentiated to caidiomyocytes by ATAC-seq. The cells were collected for ATAC-seq at day 0(undifferentiated cells) day 2 (mesoderm), day 4 (cardiac mesoderm) and day 30 (cardiomyocytes).

DESIGN
Two hiPSC lines (C15 and C20) and two hESC lines (H1 and H9) were grown in 12-well plates with Essential 8 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cardiomyocyte differentiation was initiated using a monolayer differentiation method with PSC Cardiomyocyte Differentiation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). At day 0, 2, 4 and 30 during the differentiation period (before the medium-change on that day), about 50,000 cells were collected for ATAC-seq. For each cell line and each time-point, cells from two independent differentiation wells were used as two biological replicates.
