TITLE
Gene expression in transgenic line overexpressing Arabidopsis AT5G40830 (ICA)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To investigate the genome-wide effects of ica transgenic line overexpressing AT5G40830 (ICA) involved in the cambial activity and shoot growth, we used cDNA microarrays to establish global changes in the gene expression. We selected the uppermost 1 cm of vegetative nodes in the inflorescence stems at the sixth silique stage. These showed the most distinctive changes in phenotypes and endogenous hormone levels between ica and Col-0. Expression of 9 genes (ARR5, ARR6, ARR7, EXP1, GASA4, GASA6, PME1, PME44, AT3G49220) based on microarray analysis was quantified by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the inflorescence stem at the stage of the sixth silique development in Col-0 and ica
