TITLE
Trichophyton rubrum germination study

ORGANISM
Trichophyton rubrum

SUMMARY
Conidia are considered to be the primary cause of skin and nail infections by Trichophyton rubrum. A cDNA microarray containing 10112 ESTs was developed and used to estimate the relative gene expression levels and changes of gene expression during conidial germination in time-course experiments. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
In order to monitor the expression profings of germination, T. rubrum conidia were induced into Sabouraud liquid medium. Sample were collected  in 1 hr intervals throughout the 15 hr conidial germination. We established two parallel experiments in the whole process and in every parallel experiments, two duplicates were settled. So, including the 0 hr, 64 samples were collected from 16 time points during germination. Sample mRNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into cDNA and labeled with a fluorescent dye (Cy3 or Cy5). Also, the reference genome DNA isolated in the hyphal stage was labeled. Test samples and reference samples were dye-swapped to avoid variation arising from the dyes.
