TITLE
Trichophyton rubrum germination study

ORGANISM
Trichophyton rubrum

SUMMARY
Conidia are considered to be the primary cause of skin and nail infections by Trichophyton rubrum. A cDNA microarray containing 10112 ESTs was developed and used to estimate the relative gene expression levels and changes of gene expression during conidial germination in time-course experiments. Keywords: time course
