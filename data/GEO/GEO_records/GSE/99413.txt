TITLE
RNAseq data for Arabidopsis TF mutants during germination

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
RNAseq profiling of eight transcription factor mutants during germination in Arabidopsis, at 24 h in the light (after 48h of stratification).

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 50-100 mg Arabidopsis seeds in duplicates.
