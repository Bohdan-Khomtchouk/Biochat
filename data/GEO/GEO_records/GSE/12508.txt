TITLE
Transcription patterns during wheat development

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
The analysis of gene expression during wheat development: Gene expression measurements were carried out on a developmental tissue series for wild-type wheat (cv. Chinese Spring) using the Affymetrix Wheat GeneChip.  Thirteen tissues at defined developmental stages were chosen to match the barley (cv. Morex) tissue series of Druka et al. 2006 that used the Affymetrix Barley1 GeneChip.  Three replicates of: root tissue at two different developmental stages, leaf, crown, caryopsis, anther, pistil, inflorescence, bracts, mesocotyl, endosperm, embryo and coleoptiles were hybridised.  Comparisons between this wheat data and the barley dataset were performed and are available at [PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Tim Sutton.  The equivalent experiment is TA3 at PLEXdb.]
