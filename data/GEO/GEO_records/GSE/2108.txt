TITLE
Wild type yellow experiment (cell wall chip)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
S. cerevisiae was grown on YEPD. For yellow experiments, yeast cells were grown overnight at 24 °C to an optical density 0.8 - 1 (A600). The culture was refreshed to 0.2 O.D and grown at 24 °C for 6h. At this time cells were collected. Experiment was carried out hybridising the cDNA from the same RNA (from this culture) with both Cy3 and Cy5. Keywords: repeat sample
