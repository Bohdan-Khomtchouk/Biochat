TITLE
Induced Pluripotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Clones Retain Donor-Derived Differences in DNA Methylation Profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) is an epigenetic phenomenon. It has been suggested that iPSC retain some tissue-specific memory whereas little is known about inter-individual epigenetic variation of iPSC clones. In this study we have reprogrammed mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from human bone marrow by retrovirus-mediated overexpression of OCT-3/4, SOX2, c-MYC, and KLF4. Global DNA-methylation profiles of the initial MSC, MSC-derived iPSC (iP-MSC) and embryonic stem cells (ESC) were then compared using a high density DNA-methylation array covering more than 450,000 CpG sites. Overall, DNA-methylation patterns of iP-MSC and ESC were similar whereas some CpG sites revealed highly significant differences, which were not related to parental MSC. Furthermore, hypermethylation in iP-MSC versus ESC was particularly enriched in developmental genes as well as shore regions next to CpG islands indicating that these differences are not due to tissue-specific memory or random de novo methylation. Subsequently, we searched for CpG sites with donor-specific variation in MSC preparations. These “epigenetic fingerprints” were highly enriched in non-promoter regions and outside of CpG islands – and they were maintained upon reprogramming into iP-MSC. In conclusion, DNA methylation profiles of iP-MSC clones from the same donor were closely related despite heterogeneity of MSC. On the other hand, iP-MSC maintain donor-derived epigenetic differences. In the absence of isogenic controls for disease modeling applications, it would therefore be more appropriate to compare iPSC from different donors rather than a high number of different clones from the same patient.
