SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of subcutaneous adipose tissue before and after 2 years of bariatric surgery. This type of surgery produce a masive weight loss in morbidly obese subjects, and improve the comorbidities associated to obesity. Goal was to determine the effects of bariatric surgery on the gene expression of subcutaneous adipose tissue.

DESIGN
