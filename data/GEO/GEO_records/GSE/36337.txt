TITLE
Cytomegalovirus promotes maintenance and growth of glioblastoma stem cells [Mouse gene expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We introduced the HCMV IE1 gene into a mouse model of spontaneous glioma driven by p53KD and overexpression of Ras and PDGF and compared the transcriptomes of mouse gliomas +/- IE1. The following plasmids were utilized for glioma induction in equal parts: pT2/C-Luc/PGK-SB100, pT2/Cag-NrasV12, pT2/shP53/GFP4/mPDGF, and pT2/Cag-IE1 or pT2/C-Neo. Primary human glioma stem cells were maintained in neurosphere growth conditions, treated with IE1 and control siRNA for 48-72h prior to RNA harvesting. Following hybridization to HCMV DNA arrays, data analysis revealed HCMV genes significantly altered by IE1KD, by comparing Samples 1-2 and 3-4 repectively.

DESIGN
Neonatal BALB/c and B6 mice were injected with the above mentioned plasmids at P1. Tumor formation was monitored using bioluminescence. Brain tissue was extracted at 50-60 days post plasmid injection. Primary human glioma stem cells were maintained in neurosphere growth conditions, treated with IE1 and control siRNA for 48-72h prior to RNA harvesting. RNA was hybridized to HCMV spotted arrays.
