TITLE
CoCl2 Response in Cryptococcus neoformans

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of the hypoxia-mimetic CoCl2 on the gene expression of pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. Keywords: compound treatment design

DESIGN
Three biological repeats were performed using three independent RNA sets isolated from cells cultured on different days and the dye-reverse hybridizations were performed for all three sets. One set of RNA was also subjected to technical repeats.

PLATFORM
