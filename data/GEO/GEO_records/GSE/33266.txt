TITLE
SM001: SARS CoV MA15 infection of C57Bl/6 mouse model – Data from 4 viral doses at 1, 2, 4 and 7 days post infection.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose of experiment was to perform transcriptomic analysis on C57Bl/6 mice infected with different doses of SARS CoV MA15 at 4 different days post infection.

DESIGN
Twenty-week-old C57BL/6 mice were infected by intranasal instillation of 10^2, 10^3, 10^4 or 10^5 PFU of SARS CoV MA15 in 50 µl of PBS or mock-infected with PBS alone.  At days 1, 2, 4 and 7 days post-infection, lungs were harvested and total RNA was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis.  The experimental design was for 4- 5 mice/time point/dose and 3 time-matched mocks. The NIAID Systems Virology Center
