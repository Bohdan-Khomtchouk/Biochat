TITLE
Expression data of  leaves from transgenic barley expressing wheat Lr34 gene

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
The wheat gene Lr34 (Yr18/Pm38/Sr57/Ltn1) encodes a putative ABCG-type of transporter and is a unique source of disease resistance providing durable and partial resistance against multiple fungal pathogens. Lr34 has been found to be functional as a transgene in barley. We used microarrays to decipher the changes in global gene expression goverened by Lr34 expression in barley.

DESIGN
Leaves from two indipendent lines of transgenic barley plants were selected at seedling (Two weeks old plants) and mature (six weeks old plants) stages of  development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We used three biological replicates for expression profiles. Wild type plants served as controls.
