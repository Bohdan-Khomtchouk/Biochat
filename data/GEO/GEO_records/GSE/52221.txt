TITLE
Quantitative trait loci (QTL) study identifies novel genomic regions associated to Chiari-Like Malformation in Griffon Bruxellois dogs

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Chiari-like malformation (CM) is a developmental abnormality of the craniocervical junction that is common in the Griffon Bruxellois (GB) breed with an estimated prevalence of 65%. This disease is characterized by overcrowding of the neural parenchyma at the craniocervical junction and disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. The most common clinical sign is pain either as a direct consequence of CM or neuropathic pain as a consequence of secondary syringomyelia. The etiology of CM remains unknown but genetic factors play an important role. To investigate the genetic complexity of the disease, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) approach was adopted. A total of 14 quantitative skull and atlas measurements were taken and were tested for association to CM. Six traits were found to be associated to CM and were subjected to a whole-genome association study using the Illumina canine high density bead chip in 74 GB dogs (50 affected and 24 controls). Linear and mixed regression analyses were used to identify quantitative trait loci.

DESIGN
To identify the presence of causative haplotype for Chiari-Like Malformation 80 Griffon Bruxellois dogs were genotyped using Illumina CanineHD Beadchip. This cohort consisted of 53 cases and 27 controls. Ten samples were whole genome amplified using the Qiagen Repli-g kit following the protocol. Linear and mixed regression model were used to define association between morphologic traits and genetic data. The sample traits (provided in the sample characteristics field) are described in the 'README_Traits_description.pdf' Processed data were obtained in 3 different normalization batches. The normalization batch/raw data file information is provided in the sample description field.
