TITLE
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as skin carcinogens: Comparison of benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[def,p]chrysene and three environmental mixtures in the FVB/N mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), was compared to dibenzo[def,p]chrysene (DBC) and combinations of three environmental PAH mixtures (coal tar, diesel particulate and cigarette smoke condensate) using a two stage, FVB/N  mouse  skin tumor model.  DBC (4 nmol) was most potent, reaching 100% tumor incidence with a shorter latency to tumor  formation,  less than 20 weeks of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) promotion compared to all other treatments. Multiplicity was 4 times greater than BaP (400 nmol).  Both PAHs produced primarily papillomas followed by squamous cell carcinoma and carcinoma in situ.  Diesel particulate extract (1 mg SRM 1650b; mix 1 ) did not differ from toluene controls and failed to elicit a carcinogenic response. Addition of coal tar extract (1 mg SRM 1597a; mix 2) produced a response similar to BaP.  Further addition of 2 mg of cigarette smoke condensate (mix 3) did not alter the response of mix 2. PAH-DNA adducts measured in epidermis 12 h post initiation and analyzed by 32P post- labeling, did not correlate with tumor incidence. PAH dependent alteration in transcriptome of skin 12 h post initiation was assessed by microarray.  Principal component analysis (sum of all treatments) of the 922 significantly altered genes (p < 0.05), showed DBC and BaP to cluster distinct from PAH mixtures and each other.  BaP and mixtures up-regulated phase 1 and 2 metabolizing enzymes while DBC did not.  The carcinogenicity with DBC and two of the mixtures was much greater than would be predicted based on published Relative Potency Factors (RPFs).

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in mouse skin 12 hours after initiation with PAH carcinogens.  The following initiation treatments were applied to mice (N=4 or 5 per biological replicates treatment); toluene vehicle control (200 μl), BaP 400 nmol (100 μg), DBC 4 nmol (1.2 μg), or to mixtures of environmental PAH mixtures containing diesel particulate extract, coal tar extract, or cigarette smoke condensate.
