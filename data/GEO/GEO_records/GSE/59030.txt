TITLE
PCR array analysis of DNA repair gene expression in human vascular smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
cDNA from aortic and plaque VSMCs was isolated and subject to PCR array analysis VSMCs were cultured from human tissue samples and used at passage number 5 or below.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. VSMCs from 9 donors ( 5 disease free aortic tissue as controls and 4 diseased carotid plaques). Equal amounts of RNA was used from each patient sample. RNA was not pooled.
