SUMMARY
To decipher gene regulatory networks, we used systematic suppression of 97 transcription factors (TFs) and 7 other genes with shRNA in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, followed by global gene expression profiling. Meta-analysis of these data together with the earlier data obtained by the induction of 50 TFs and the existing genome-wide data on TF binding sites identified the sets of regulated target genes for 23 TFs. Principal component analysis shows different roles of two groups of TFs that are active in ES cells: Pou5f1 and Sox2 support the expression of their target genes and prevent the upregulation of trophectoderm-related genes, whereas Esrrb, Sall4, Nanog, Gbx2, Grhl2, Mtf2, Aff1, Tcfap4, and Cdc5l support the expression of targets of Esrrb, including glycolysis genes, and prevent upregulation of targets of Trp53 and Polycomb TFs. If TFs from the second group are downregulated while Pou5f1 and Sox2 are still active, then the cell state changes towards epiblast lineages.
