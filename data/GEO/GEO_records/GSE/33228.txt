TITLE
Expression profiling of wild-type and set3D fission yeast strains

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
In fission yeast the SET domain protein, Set3p  is required for the reliable execution of cytokinesis. To address whether the deletion of the set3 gene might selectively alter expression of cytokinesis genes, expression profiling of wildtype and set3D strains was performed.

DESIGN
Wild-type or set3D strains were grown to mid-log phase in YES media and treated with 0.5 mM LatA (or the solvent control, DMSO) for three hours at 30 degrees C.  Three biological replicates were performed.
