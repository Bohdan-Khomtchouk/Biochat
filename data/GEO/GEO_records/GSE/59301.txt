TITLE
Compare miRNA expression profiles of human iNSC, H9-NSC, fibroblast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling of human H9-derived neural stem cells (H9-NSCs) comparing control human adult dermal fibroblasts (hDFs), SOX2-transduced human induced neural stem cells (hDF-iNSC (SOX2)), SOX2/HMGA2-transduced human induced neural stem cells (hDF-iNSC (SOX2/HMGA2)). Goal was to determine the global miRNA expression between the groups.

DESIGN
H9-NSC vs hDF vs hDF-iNSC(SOX2) vs hDF-iNSC(SOX2/HMGA2)

PLATFORM
GPL18402 Agilent-046064 Unrestricted_Human_miRNA_V19.0_Microarray (miRNA ID version)
