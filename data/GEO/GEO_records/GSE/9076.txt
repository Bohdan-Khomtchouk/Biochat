TITLE
Rat prostate cancer cells with high Ndrg-1 and vector control - analysis of differentially expressed genes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
AT6.1 cells transfected to over-express Ndrg-1 were compared with AT6.1 vector control cells in a microarray analysis. The aim of the study was to identify differentially expressed genes between the two cell lines, as these may be modulated by Ndrg-1. Keywords: Differential gene expression analysis

DESIGN
The sample was AT6.1 cells transfected with Ndrg-1 (# 7 clone) and the control was the same cell line transfected with a vector control (# 9 clone). There are no replicates included.
