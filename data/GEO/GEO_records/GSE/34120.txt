TITLE
Differential microRNA profile in frontal cortex of suicide completers compared to control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: TrkB-T1 is a BDNF receptor lacking a tyrosine kinase domain that is highly expressed in astrocytes and regulates BDNF-evoked calcium transients. Previous studies indicate that downregulation of TrkB-T1 in frontal cortex may be involved in neurobiological processes underlying suicide. Methods: In a microarray screening study (N=8), we interrogated all known microRNA in the frontal cortex of suicide completers with low expression of TrkB-T1 and normal controls. These findings were validated and followed up in a larger sample of cases and controls (N=55) Functional analyses included microRNA silencing, microRNA overexpression and luciferase assays to investigate specificity and to validate interactions between differentially expressed microRNA and TrkB-T1 Results: microRNAs Hsa-miR-185* and Hsa-miR-491-3p were upregulated in suicide completers with low expression of TrkB.T1 (Pnominal: 9.10-5 and 1.8.10-4 respectively; FDR-corrected p=0.031). Bioinformatic analyses revealed five putative binding sites for the DiGeorge syndrome linked microRNA Hsa-miR-185*in the 3’UTR of TrkB-T1, but none for Hsa-miR-491-3P. The increase of Hsa-miR-185* in frontal cortex of suicide completers was validated then confirmed in a larger, randomly selected group of suicide completers, where an inverse correlation between Hsa-miR-185* and TrkB-T1 expression was observed ( R=-0.404; p=0.002). Silencing and overexpression studies performed in human cell lines confirmed the inverse relationship between hsa-mir-185* and trkB-T1 expression. Luciferase assays demonstrated that Hsa-miR-185* binds to sequences in the 3’UTR of TrkB-T1. Conclusion: These results suggest that an increase of Hsa-miR-185* expression levels regulates, at least in part, the TrkB-T1 decrease observed in the frontal cortex of suicide completers and further implicate the 3MB 22q11 region in psychopathology.

DESIGN
The microarray analysis consists in to compare the microRNA profile of four suicide completers with low TrkB-T1 expression level and four controls. Each RNA extract was labeled with Hy3 and hybridyzed with a reference sample labeled with Hy5. The reference sample was a pool of the eight RNA samples
