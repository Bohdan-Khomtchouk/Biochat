TITLE
Transcriptome reorganization during seasonal wood development in Pinus radiata

ORGANISM
Pinus radiata

SUMMARY
Seasonal wood development results in two distinct wood types: earlywood (EW) and latewood (LW), which is the major cause of wood qaulity variation. We investigate transcriptome reorganization during seasonal wood development in radiata pine using a newly developed 18k cDNA microarrays.

DESIGN
Three sampling trees each at juvenile (5 yrs), transition (9 yrs) and mature (14 yrs) ages (based on the wood rings at breast height) were selected from a plantation forest of radiata pine at Bondo, NSW , Australia (35º 16' 44.04 S, 148º 26' 54.66 E). The sampling trees at juvenile and mature ages were grown within 50 m distance and under similar environment. Two sampling trees at rotation age (30 yrs) were chosen at Yarralumla, ACT, Australia (35° 18' 27'' S, 149° 7' 27.9'' E).
