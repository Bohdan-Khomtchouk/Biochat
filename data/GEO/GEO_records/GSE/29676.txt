TITLE
Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Disease-Specific Autoantibody Profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Non-Demented Control (NDC) human sera were probed onto human protein microarrays in order to identify differentially expressed autoantibody biomarkers that could be used as diagnostic indicators.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, 50 AD and 40 NDC human serum samples were probed onto human protein microarrays in order to identify differentially expressed autoantibodies.  Microarray data was analyzed using several statistical significance algorithms, and autoantibodies that demonstrated significant group prevelance were selected as biomarkers of disease.  Prediction classification analysis tested the diagnostic efficacy of the identified biomarkers; and differentiation of AD samples from other neurodegeneratively-diseased and non-neurodegeneratively-diseased controls (Parkinson's disease and breast cancer, respectively) confirmed their specificity.
