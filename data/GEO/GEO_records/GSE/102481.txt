TITLE
Temporal alterations in the HSAEC transcriptome following infection by virulent and attenuated strains of Rift Valley Fever Virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes major outbreaks among livestock, characterized by “abortion storms” in which spontaneous abortion occurs in almost 100% of pregnant ruminants. Humans can also become infected with mild symptoms that can progress to more severe symptoms, such as hepatitis, encephalitis, and hemorrhagic fever. The goal of this study was to use RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze the host transcriptome in response to RVFV infection. G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, ATM signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, regulation of the antiviral response, and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) signaling were among the top altered canonical pathways with both the attenuated MP12 strain and the fully virulent ZH548 strain. Although several mRNA transcripts were highly upregulated, an increase at the protein level was not observed for the selected genes, which was at least partially due to the NSs dependent block in mRNA export.  Inhibition of ILK signaling, which is involved in cell motility and cytoskeletal reorganization, resulted in reduced RVFV replication, indicating that this pathway is important for viral replication.  Overall, this is the first global transcriptomic analysis of the human host response following RVFV infection, which could give insight into novel host responses that have not yet been explored.

DESIGN
The study included triplicate samples of HSAEC cells infected with Mock, MP12, or ZH548 strains of RVFV, and collected at 3, 9, and 18 hourse post-infection. There are a total of 27 samples.
