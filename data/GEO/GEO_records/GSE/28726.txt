TITLE
NKT, CD1d-aGC+ Va24-, and CD4 T cell clones from human peripheral blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed to determine the transcriptional profiles of NKT, CD1d-aGC+ Va24-, and CD4 T cells.

DESIGN
Clones of NKT, CD1d-aGC+ Va24-, and CD4 T cells were generated using peripheral blood drawn from two healthy individuals.  RNA was extracted from cells that had been either rested (18 days post-stimulation) or stimulated (3 days post-stimulation).
