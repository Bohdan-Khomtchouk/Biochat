TITLE
The repressive regulatory role of H3K27me3 histone mark in bovine mastitis resistance to Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The regulatory effects of H3K27me3 on target genes expressions were analyzed by comparing S. aureus mastitis resistant and susceptible cows. The differentially expressed genes are mainly associated with immune and disease-related processes, which were negatively regulated by H3K27me3 modification on the up 2Kb regions relative to TSS in S. aureus mastitis cattle.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K27me3 modifications in six cows.
