TITLE
Comparison of expression data between control, Atg7, Bdh2, Atg7 and Bdh2 dual morphant zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Bdh2 morphants displayed mitochondrial dysfunction and degradation by autophagy, as well as hypohemoglobinization. Suppression of Atg7 expression in Bdh2 morphants diminished mitochondrial clearance and partly corrected their hemoglobinization defect.

DESIGN
Total RNAs from control, Atg7, Bdh2, Atg7 and Bdh2 dual morphant zebrafish embryos were isolated at 72 hpf using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA samples were processed as per manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual, Affymetric, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) at Case Comprehensive Cancer Center Microarray Core Facility. Experiments were performed in triplicate for control, Atg7, Atg7 and Bdh2 dual morphant zebrafish embryos, and in singlet for Bdh2 morphant zebrafish embryos.
