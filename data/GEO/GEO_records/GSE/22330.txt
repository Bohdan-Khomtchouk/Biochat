TITLE
Trout macrophages: Control vs. Escherichia coli PGNs from strains O111:B4 and K12

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
We evaluated both the transcriptomic and inflammatory response in trout (O. mykiss) macrophages in primary cell culture stimulated with DAP-PGN (DAP; meso-diaminopimelic acid, PGN; peptidoglycan) from two strains of Escherichia coli (PGN-K12 and PGN-O111:B4) over time. Transcript profiling was assessed using function-targeted cDNA microarrays hibridation (n = 36) to differential responses to both PGNs that are both time and treatment dependen over trout macrophages. Wild type E. coli (K12) generated an increase in transcript number/diversity over time whereas PGN-O111:B4 stimulation resulted in a more specific and intense response. In line with this gene Ontology analysis (GO) highlights a specific transcriptomic remodelling for PGN-O111:B4 whereas results obtained for PGN-K12 shows a high similarity with a general LPS response where multiple functional classes are related to ribosome biogenesis or cellular metabolism

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, PGN vs. control cells. Biological replicates: 18 control, 18 treated. Dye-swap.
