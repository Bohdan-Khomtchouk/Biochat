TITLE
Targeting Transcriptional Addictions in Small Cell Lung Cancer with a Covalent CDK7 Inhibitor (Affymetrix)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease with high mortality. The identification of effective pharmacological strategies to target SCLC biology represents an urgent need. Using a high-throughput cellular screen of a diverse chemical library we observe that SCLC is sensitive to transcription-targeting drugs, and in particular to THZ1, a newly identified covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7).  We find that expression of super-enhancer associated transcription factor genes including MYC family proto-oncogenes and neuroendocrine lineage-specific factors are highly vulnerability to THZ1 treatment. We propose that downregulation of these transcription factors contributes, in part, to SCLC sensitivity to transcriptional inhibitors and that THZ1 represents a novel treatment paradigm for targeted SCLC therapy.
