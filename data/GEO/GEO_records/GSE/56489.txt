TITLE
Prospective Evaluation of Whole Genome MicroRNA Expression Profiling in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression contributes to the pathogenesis of several clinical conditions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the associations between miRNAs and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to discover their clinical and therapeutic implications. Forty-three children with ALL and 14 age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. MicroRNA microarray expression profiling was used for peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. Aberrant miRNA expressions associated with the diagnosis and outcome were prospectively evaluated. Confirmation analysis was performed by real time RT-PCR. miR-128, miR-146a, miR-155, miR-181a, miR-195 were significantly dysregulated in ALL patients at day 0. Following a six-month treatment period, the change in miRNA levels was determined by real time RT-PCR and expression of miR-146a, miR-155, miR-181a, miR-195 significantly decreased.

DESIGN
Forty-three children with ALL and 14 age-matched healthy controls were included in the study.
