TITLE
LSAGE Library Human Renal Glomeruli

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glomeruli were isolated from the kidney of a 72 yo male patient.  The kidney was surgically removed due to renal cell carcinoma.  The glomeruli were isolated from uninvolved renal parenchyma.  Histology (H & E) of glomeruli and interstitium was normal. Keywords: Kidney Subcompartment

DESIGN
Glomeruli were isolated using the sieving technique in ice-cold PBS, followed by isolation of total RNA with RNeasy kit.  RNA was judged intact by agarose gel electrophoresis.  SAGE library was custom-synthesized by Genzyme Corportation.
