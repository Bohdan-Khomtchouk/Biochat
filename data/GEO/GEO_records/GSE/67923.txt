TITLE
Comparison of gene expression changes in AML cells after SMARCA4, SMARCD2 or DPF2 knock-down

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We explored the role of SMARCA4 and the two Brahma associated factors SMARCD2 and DPF2 in leukaemia. We observed the selective requirement for these factors for leukemic cell expansion, as well as extended survival of mice transplanted with leukaemic cells with reduced expression of these genes. Gene expression profiling revealed largely similar alterations with the down-regulation of each of these three factors, suggesting a concerted function in transformed blood cells. These changes included loss of pluripotency-associated signature but did not correlate with c-MYC down-regulation.

DESIGN
Human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1, ACC 16) were lentivirally transduced with pLKO-puro vectors carrying shRNAs against SMARCA4, SMARCD2 or DPF2. As a negative control, THP-1 cells were transduced with pLKO-puro-shScr (Scrambled). All samples were prepared as biological triplicates.
