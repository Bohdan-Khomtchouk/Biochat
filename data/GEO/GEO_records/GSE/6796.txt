TITLE
Fibroblasts from genital and extragenital regions of 46,XY individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset contains fibroblasts from different genital and extragenital regions, mostly from 46,XY individuals. Due to proven androgen receptor gene mutations, several individuals have varying degrees of undervirilization of the external genitalia ranging from complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) to partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS). CAIS is a completely female person despite a 46,XY karyotype. AIS-3 individuals have ambigous external genitalia. AIS-4 means predominantly female (clitoral enlargement), AIS-2 means predominantly male (hypospadias).  It is important for this experiment set, that it contains data from 3 differet independent datasets that are not directly cmparable with each other. This is because of different reference RNAs and different glass slides. The particular normalization procedure is described in the paper accompanying this dataset. Only then, all arrays are allowed to be clustered together. Dataset 2 and 3 have " DS-2 " and " DS-3 " in their experiment names. All other experiments belong to dataset 1. A cell type comparison design experiment design type compares cells of different type for example different cell lines. Disease State: normal male, normal female or ambiguous external genitalia according to grading scheme by Sinnecker et al. Cell Line: fibroblast cell lines from different regions of the genital skin, some from extragenital skin Sex/Mating type: 46,XY or 46,XX karyotype Keywords: cell_type_comparison_design
