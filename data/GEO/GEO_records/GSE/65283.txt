TITLE
Transcriptomic study in RNA pol II foot mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The goal of the project was to study the effects on transctiptome of some Rpb1 foot mutations that block Rpb4/7 assembly

DESIGN
Cells were grown in YPD at 30ºC to 0.5 OD600. At that cells were spun-down or changed to 37ºC by adding hot YPD. These aliquots were cultured for 30 min and collected. Thus, wt and mutants have two samples: 30 and 37ºC. Each sample was done in triplicate.
