TITLE
Affymetrix expression array data for melanoma progression to the brain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Melanoma is one of the most aggressive and treatment-resistant cancers. It represents the most life-threatening neoplasm of the skin, and its incidence has been increasing for the last three decades. Melanoma evolves from the local transformation of melanocytes to primary tumors, which can metastasize to multiple organs. Brain metastases represent one of the most significant causes of death in cutaneous melanoma patients. Despite aggressive multi-modality threapy, patients with melanoma brain metastasis have a median survival of less than a year, with a majority of these patients dying as a result of their intracranial disease. To identify alterations in gene expression related to brain metastasis, we used Affymetrix expression arrays to assess differentially expressed genes in melanocytes, lymph node metastases, and brain metastases.

DESIGN
Total RNA from twenty-two specimens representing normal melanocytes (n=3), melanoma lymph node metastasis (n=12), and melanoma brain metastasis (n=7) was extracted and analyzed by Affymetrix expression arrays. Melanocytes specimens were used as control samples. Melanocytes were acquired from Invitrogen (LifeTechnologies). Metastatic melanoma specimens were taken from different patients, established as cell lines in the John Wayne Cancer Institute. Early passages (less than 6) were used to perform expression analysis.
