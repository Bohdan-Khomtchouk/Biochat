TITLE
Expression data from WT and GABPalpha-deficient Flt3(-) LSK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GABPalpha is an Ets family transcription factor and involved in regulation of both basic cellular functions such as cell cycle progression and tissue-specific biological processes. We found that GABPalpha is critically required for survival and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. We used microarrays to detect gene expression changes in Flt3(-) LSK cells (which contains both long-term and short-term hematopoietic stem cells) by GABPalpha deficiency.

DESIGN
Mx1Cre-GABPa(FL/+) and Mx1Cre-GABPa(FL/-) mice were treated with pIpC to induce inactivation of GABPalpha in bone marrow cells. Four days after last treatment of pIpC, the bone marrow cells were isolated and the Flt3(-)LSK subset was purified by cell sorting. RNA was extracted and hybridized to GeneChip Mouse GENE 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix).
