TITLE
TLR9 re-expression in cancer cells extends the S-phase and stabilizes p16INK4a protein expression.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips, providing a genome-wide coverage of over 24,000 genes, we have analysed gene expression variation in HNSCC 136 cells transduced with pLVUT’ TLR9 or GFP where the same number of cells  were harvested and RNA extracted after 36 h treatment with doxycyline.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained HNSCC 136 cells transduced with pLVUT’ TLR9 or GFP as controls where the same number of cells  were harvested and RNA extracted after 36 h treatment with doxycyline.Diffrential expression analysis was conducted with GFP replicates as reference group.

PLATFORM
