TITLE
Improvement of Lactobacillus plantarum Aerobic Growth by Comprehensive Transcriptome Analysis

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

SUMMARY
An aerobic Lactobacillus plantarum culture displayed growth stagnation during early growth. Transcriptome analysis revealed that regain of growth after stagnation correlated with activation of CO2-producing pathways suggesting that limiting CO2-concentration induced stagnation. Analogously providing increased CO2 gas partial pressure during aerobic fermentation prevented the temporal growth stagnation. Keywords: cell type comparison
