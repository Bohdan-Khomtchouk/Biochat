TITLE
Genome-wide identification of rat long non-coding RNAs

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In the current study, we have focused on a distinct group of non-coding elements, lncRNA, and profiled renal tissues from three different inbred rat strains. We chose the three strains S, SHR and R for the main purpose of cataloging lncRNA annotations from  the most widely used rat models of cardiovascular and renal disease.

DESIGN
Identification of lncRNAs on the rat genome by next generation RNA sequencing (NGS)

PLATFORM
GPL11282 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Rattus norvegicus)
