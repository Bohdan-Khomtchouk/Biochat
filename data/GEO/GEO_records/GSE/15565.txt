TITLE
Expression differences between inversions and their progenitors in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Inversions have a breakpoint within a " neighbourhood " of testis expressed genes and the other breakpoint megabases away. The gene expression neighbourhood is therefore intact in the progenitor but disrupted in the inversion. Keywords: Genome variation profiling by array

DESIGN
12 different inversion stocks, 3 or 4 biological replicates for each, including dye swaps.
