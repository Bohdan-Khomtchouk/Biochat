TITLE
Identification of RpoE2 target genes in Sinorhizobium meliloti

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
Sinorhizobium meliloti lives as a soil saprophyte, and engages in a nitrogen fixing symbiosis with plant roots.  To succeed in such diverse environments, the bacteria must continually adjust gene expression.  Transcriptional plasticity in eubacteria is often mediated by alternative sigma factors interacting with core RNA polymerase.  The S. meliloti genome encodes 14 of these alternative sigmas, including 11 extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigmas.  We used custom Affymetrix Symbiosis Chips to characterize the global transcriptional response of S. meliloti overexpressing the ECF sigma factor, RpoE2.  Our work identifies over 200 genes whose expression is dependent on RpoE2.
