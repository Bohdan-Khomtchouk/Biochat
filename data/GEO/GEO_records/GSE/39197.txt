TITLE
Gene expression profiling of NK cells isolated from the pancreas of BDC TCR expressing NOD mice before or after Treg ablation by DTR.  Also, NK cells cultured in vitro with activating cytokines IL12 and IL-18 with or without regulatory TGFb.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Following Treg ablation in the BDC/NOD.Foxp3-DTR strain, NK cells produce IFNg and accumulate to higher percentage and number.  We explored the signature pathways responsible for this phenomenon using microarray prolifing and comparison to other activation signatures.

DESIGN
All microarray populations were obtained from highly purified (double sorted) NK cell populations from the pancreas or the spleen following Treg ablation. Triplicates were generated for all ex vivo data. Raw data were preprocessed with the RMA algorithm in GenePattern and averaged expression values were used for analysis.
