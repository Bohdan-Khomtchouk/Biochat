TITLE
miRNA profiling in male and female chicken embryonic gonads during sexual differentiation

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a highly conserved class of small RNAs which function in a sequence-specific manner to post-transcriptionally regulate expression of target genes.  Tissue-specific miRNA expression studies have discovered numerous functions for miRNAs in various aspects of embryonic development, but a role for miRNAs in gonadal development and sex differentiation has not yet been reported.  Using the chicken embryo as a vertebrate model, differential miRNA expression between male and female embryonic gonads, was analysed at three developmental stages (embryonic days (E) 5.5, E6.5 and E9.5), using custom-designed 4x2K CombiMatrix miRNA microarray.  The aims of this study were to: 1-identify miRNAs differentialy expressed by sex; 2-identify sex-specific miRNAs; 3-analyse global changes in miRNA up-regulation in male versus female gonads before, during and after the histological onset of sexual differentiation. This study provides a basis for establishing whetehr miRNAs are involved in either initiating or regulating vertebrate gonadal sex differentiation. Keywords: miRNA, sex comparison, developmental stage comparison.
