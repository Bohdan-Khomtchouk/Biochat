TITLE
Complex in vivo RNA-seq analysis reveal reprogramming of Yersinia from virulent to persistent mode during infection [microarray II]

ORGANISM
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis YPIII

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome assessment of the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strain YPIII grown under aerobic or anaerobic conditions to stationary phase.

DESIGN
Y. pseudotuberculosis YPIII was grown at 25Â°C in LB medium supplemented with 10 g/l glucose and 0.2 M HEPES buffer under aeration or under anaerobic growth conditions (in a nitrogen atmosphere) on a rotary shaker. Total RNA was extracted using SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). The samples were treated with RNase-free DNase (Roche Applied Science) and the quality of the RNA was confirmed by the lack of PCR amplification of the hns gene and by using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.

PLATFORM
GPL15095 Agilent-020412 Yersinia pseudotuberculosis YPIII gene expression array
