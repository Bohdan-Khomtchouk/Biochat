TITLE
miRNA analysis of murine fibroblasts subjected to acute oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of miRNA modulated by H2O2 treatment in murine fibroblasts. The hypothesis in the present study is that stress balance the level of some miRNAs. These particular miRNAs may target key proteins involved in stress and thus modulate cellular response to stress.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 2 independant fibroblasts clones treated for the indicated time with 400 uM H2O2
