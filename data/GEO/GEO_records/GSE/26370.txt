TITLE
The gene expression response of MCF7 and MDAMB231 to glutamine deprivation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There are two major subtype of cells in breast cancer. These cancer cells response differently to glutamine deprivation, here we use one luminal type of breast cancer cell (MCF7) and one basal type of breast cancer cell (MDAMB231) to compare the gene expression differences of these two types of cancer cells in glutamine deprivation. Many cancer cells depend on glutamine for survival and oncogenic transformation. Although targeting glutamine metabolism is proposed as novel therapies, their heterogeneity among different tumors is unknown. Here, we found only basal-type, but not luminal-type breast cancer cells, exhibited phenotypes of glutamine dependency and may benefit from glutamine-targeting therapeutics. The glutamine independence of luminal-type cells is caused by the specific expression of glutamine synthetase (GS), a pattern recapitulated in luminal breast cancers. The co-culture of luminal cells partially rescued the basal cells under glutamine deprivation, suggesting glutamine symbiosis. The luminal-specific expression of GS is directly induced GATA3 and down-regulates glutaminase expression to maintain subtype-specific glutamine metabolism. Collectively, these data indicate the distinct glutamine phenotypes among breast cells and enable the rational design of glutamine targeted therapies.
