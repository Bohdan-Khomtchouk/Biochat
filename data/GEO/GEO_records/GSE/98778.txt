TITLE
Signatures of positive selection in germinal center B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used RNA sequencing to characterize gene expression of Ly75+/+ B1-8hi and Ly75-/- B1-8hi B cells from the germinal center light zone (LZ) 12 h after forcing positive selection of the Ly75+/+ population with anti-DEC205-OVA.

DESIGN
We primed C57BL/6 hosts with OVA-alum i.p. and after 2 weeks we adoptively transferred a mixture of B1-8hi B cells in which 15% were Ly75+/+ CD45.1 (DECP) and 85% were Ly75-/- CD45.1/2 (DECN). We then immunized the animals with NP-OVA in the footpads and after 6 days we injected anti-DEC205-OVA.  12 h or 24 h after anti-DEC205-OVA injection we sorted B220+ CD38- CD95+ CD45.1+ CD45.2- CD83hi CXCR4lo (DECPLZ) and B220+ CD38- CD95+ CD45.1+ CD45.2+ CD83hi CXCR4lo (DECNLZ) cells for whole transcriptome analysis by mRNA sequencing.
