TITLE
DNA methylation profiling for BGC823 cells stably transfected with an artificial P16 DNA methyltransferase (P16-Dnmt)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential methylation between human gastric cancer cell BGC823 transfected with P16-Dnmt or pTRIPZ control vector was identified using Illumina HumanMethylation450K array. The genome-wide methylation detection experiment was carried out by Shanghai Oebiotech Company.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 4 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.
