TITLE
Female MRL/lpr and Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) Mice Treated with Placebo or Testosterone.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Influence of Testosterone on Lacrimal Gland Gene Expression in Female Mice of the MRL/lpr and Non-obese Diabetic Models of SjšgrenÕs Syndrome Keywords: Placebo versus Testosterone Treatment.

DESIGN
Female placebo and testosterone treated lacrimal glands were harvested from each mouse strain . Tissues were pooled into 3 biological replicates and were hybridized to separate microarrays.  Each cRNA prep was hybridized to a GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences CodeLink UniSet Mouse 20K I Bioarray and a Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Expression Array 430A.

PLATFORM
GPL2894 GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences CodeLink™   UniSet Mouse 20K I Bioarray GPL8321 [Mouse430A_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array
