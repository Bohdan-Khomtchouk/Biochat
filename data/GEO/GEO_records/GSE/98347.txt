TITLE
Differential requirements for Tcf1 long isoforms in CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses to acute viral infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of the transcriptome between control Tfh and Tcf1 long isoform-deficient Tfh cells

DESIGN
SMARTA CD4+ T cells (control or Tcf1 long isoform deficient) were adoptively transferred into B6.SJL recipient mice and then infected with LCMV-Arm. On day 8 after infection, the splenocytes were isolated, and CD45.2+CD4+CXCR5+PD-1 negative cells were sorted as Tfh cells and used in RNAseq analysis.
