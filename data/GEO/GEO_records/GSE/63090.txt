TITLE
Gene expression of conventional and unconventional T cell subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The experiments were designed to gain insight into the gene expression of conventional and unconventional murine T cell subsets in the steady state and upon activation

DESIGN
TCRαβ and TCRγδ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) isolated from murine gut, naïve and virus-induced memory splenocytes, activated dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC)

PLATFORM
GPL11 SAGE:10:NlaIII:Mus musculus
