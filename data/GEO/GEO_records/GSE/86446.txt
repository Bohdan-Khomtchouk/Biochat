TITLE
Expression data from influenza A virus (H5N3, H5N2/F118 and H1N1/WSN) infected mouse macrophages at 2 and 24H

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used the microarray data to analyse the host cell responses on mouse macrophages infected with the three Influenza A viruses The global expression analysis showed increased expression changes in H5N3 infected mouse macrophages compared to H5N2/F118 and H1N1/WSN

DESIGN
Influenza A virus infected mouse macrophages were harvested at 4 and 24 hpi and RNA extraction was performed using standard protocol as described by affymetrix. The aim of this study is to investigate mouse macropahge responses to Influenza A virus infections.
