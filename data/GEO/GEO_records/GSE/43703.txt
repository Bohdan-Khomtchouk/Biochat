TITLE
Translational landscape of photomorphogenic Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report the application of ribosome profiling method to map ribosome locations on transcripts in de-etiolating Arabidopsis seedlings

DESIGN
Examine steady-state mRNA and ribosome-protected mRNA abundance in 4-day-old etiolated seedlings with/without 4-h light treatment
