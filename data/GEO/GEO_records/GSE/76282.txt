TITLE
Expression data from undifferentiated and differentiated human ES cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GCNF controls the level of Oct4 expression during ES cell differentiation and early mouse embryonic development. GCNF was overexpressed in H9 human ES cells using Tet-On Inducible system. mRNA microarray analysis demonstrated that overexpression of GCNF globally regulates gene expression in undifferentiated and differentiated hES cells.  Within altered genes, GCNF down-regulated 36% of the genes, and up-regulated 64% of the genes in undifferentiated hES cells. In addition, GCNF also showed a regulatory gene pattern that is different from RA treatment during hES cell differentiation.

DESIGN
Undifferentiation (d0) hES cells were treated with 1 ug/ml Doxycycline (Dox) or without Dox; Differentiation (d6) hES cells were treated with 1 uM RA or 1 ug/ml Dox for six days. We wanted to investigate GCNF regulation of gene expression both in undifferentiation ES cells (d0 vs do+dox) and differentiation ES cells (d6+RA vs d6+Dox).
