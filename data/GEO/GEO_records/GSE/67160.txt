TITLE
The effect of age on the skeletal muscle transcriptome during hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of skeletal muscle during hypertrophic growth in aged mice Global gene expression patterns were determined from microarray results on day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 during plantaris muscle hypertrophy induced by synergist ablation in old adult mice (25 months).

DESIGN
For each time point, two Affymetrix chips (Mouse Gene 1.0 ST) were used with 100 ng of total RNA derived from a pooled sample of either the right or left plantaris muscles from six animals.
