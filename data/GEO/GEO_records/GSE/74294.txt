TITLE
Puberty-specific promotion of mammary tumorigenesis by a high animal fat diet in P53 -/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression for genes differentially expressed between early vs. late tumor onset and high fat diet (HFD) vs. low fat diet (LFD) in P53 -/- mice.

DESIGN
4 HFD early tumor onset, 7 HFD late tumor onset, 4 HFD to LFD switch with early tumor onset, 6 HFD to LFD switch with late tumor onset, 4 LFD early tumor onset, 7 LFD late tumor onset, 5 LFD to HFD switch with early tumor onset, 4 LFD to HFD switch with late tumor onset

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
