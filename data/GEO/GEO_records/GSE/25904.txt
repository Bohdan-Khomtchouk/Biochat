TITLE
Expression data from discodermolide sensitive and resistant cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Discodermolide treatment of A549 results in senescence. We compared cells resistant to disco-induced senescence to those that are sensitive to senescence induction. We also examined the gene expression of resistant (AD32) cells overexpressing 4E-BP1, a protein known to restore sensitivity to discodermolide in these cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from A549, A549 disco, AD32, and AD32 4E-BP1 cells and gene expression profiles were examined.
