TITLE
Transcriptome profile of ureter tissue originating from CAKUT patients and healthy kidney donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification and analysis of differentially expressed genes and detection of miR activity from gene expression data in human CAKUT.

DESIGN
The intact ureter tissue of 19 CAKUT patients and 7 healthy kidney donors was homogenized in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted by TRI Reagent® Solution (Ambion). Structural integrity and concentration of total RNA and cRNA was determined using Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit on agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Linear RNA amplification procedure and synthesis of biotin labeled cRNA was performed with 200ng of total RNA using TargetAmp™-Nano Labeling Kit for Illumina® Expression BeadChip® (Epicentre). The RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN) was used for purification of synthesized cRNA. Hybridization of human samples was performed on Illumina Human-HT12 Version 4 and scanned by the Illumina iScan system.
