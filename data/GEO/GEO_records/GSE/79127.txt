TITLE
Autocrine Complement Inhibits IL10-Dependent T-cell-Mediated Antitumor Immunity to Promote Tumor Progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In contrast to its inhibitory effects on many cells, IL-10 activates CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and enhances their antitumor activity. However, how IL-10 globaly regualte TIL CD8+ T cell function is stil not clear. To understand the transcriptional regulation of TIL CD8+ T cell by IL-10, we performed a microarray analysis using in vitro expanded HUMAN LUNG CANCER TIL CD8 T cells with or without IL-10.

DESIGN
TILs from human lung cancer were in vitro expanded as described anywhere for 20 days with 6000µ/ml rIL-2 and/or 100µ/ml rIL-10. The expanded TILs were activated by 3µg/ml anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 6hrs. The CD8+ TILs were enriched by negative selection kit (Stem cell).
