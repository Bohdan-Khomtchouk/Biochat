TITLE
Hypercholesterolemia increases the incidence of colorectal cancer by miR-101c-dependent downregulation of Tet1 in Hematopoietic Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify microRNAs which differentially expressed in hematopoietic stem cells from wt mice and ApoE KO mice We used microRNA microarrays to identify miroRNAs which can directly regulate tet1 expression in hematopoietic stem cells

DESIGN
The microRNAs expression in hematopoietic stem cells from wt mice and ApoE KO mice were measured
