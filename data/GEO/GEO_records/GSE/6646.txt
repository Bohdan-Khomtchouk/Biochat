TITLE
Impact of CSN1S1 polymorphism on caprine mammary transcriptome

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
Goat's alphaS1-casein (CSN1S1) polymorphism has a significant effect on milk protein and lipid composition, which affects the nutritional quality and technological properties of milk. Moreover, this polymorphism has a large impact on the morphology of mammary epithelial cells. To explore the metabolic pathways modulated in relation to this polymorphism, we compared the mammary gene expression profiles of two groups of lactating goats carrying either two reference or two defective alleles, using a bovine oligonucleotide microarray representing 8379 genes. We identified 41 differentially expressed genes between the two genotype groups. In particular, we showed a downregulation of two key lipogenic genes encoding fatty acid synthase and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase in agreement with the low fat concentration associated with CSN1S1 deficiency. In addition, this study highlights changes in the expression level of several genes known to influence membrane fluidity, cell-cell interaction or chromatin organization. Our results open up new fields of investigation on structural modifications associated with CSN1S1 deficiency that could affect mammary gland function.
