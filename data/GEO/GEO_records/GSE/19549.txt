ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
We report the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation following by high-thoughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) using the GA II platform from Illumina for the human  RNA Polymerase III in GM12878 cells. We have also generated a sequenced input DNA datasets for GM12878 cells. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
