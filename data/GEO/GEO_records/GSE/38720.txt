TITLE
Time series data of HCV (JC1) infection of Huh7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Huh7/5-2 cells (Binder et al., Hepatology 2007) were mock infected (DMEM) (time points 4 and 48 h) or  infected with the chimeric HCV virus Jc1 (Pietschmann et al., PNAS 2006) (all time points). Multiplicity of infection was 15 (TCID50). Cells were lysed after 4, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post infection and total cellular RNA was prepared.

DESIGN
Mock infected cells serve as controls for the infected samples. The whole experiment was repeated on independent days (2 biological replicates).
