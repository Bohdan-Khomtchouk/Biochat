TITLE
Mouse lung tumor tissue: Dnmt3a KO vs. Dnmt3a WT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse lung tumors comparing Dnmt3a KO/K-ras G12D mutant with Dnmt3a WT/K-ras G12D mutant. The goal is to search for the difference of mRNA abundance between Dnmt3a KO and WT tumors.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, KO vs. WT tissure. Biological replicates: 12.

PLATFORM
