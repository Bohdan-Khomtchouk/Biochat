TITLE
Contribution of unique genes by individual cell lines to Universal Mouse Reference RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA from 11 individual mouse cell lines were reverse-transcribed to cDNA, labeled with Cy5 and cohybridized with Cy3-labeled UMRR onto 7,500-spot mouse oligo microarrays (UNC). The data was analyzed using GeneTraffic software. 300-1000 spots out of 8,000 were flagged on each microarray and excluded from further analysis. Spots with hybridization signals in Cy5 channel higher than 1000 and with Cy5/Cy3 ratio greater than 2 were collected and the number of spots with these characteristics on only one microarray was determined. A reference experiment design type is where all samples are compared to a common reference. Keywords: reference_design
