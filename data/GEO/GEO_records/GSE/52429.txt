TITLE
Functional Annotation of Colon Cancer Risk SNPs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the funtion of Colorectal cancer GWAS results, we perform a comprehensive analysis using biofeatures of HCT116 colon cancer cell line and got a list of risk-asscociated SNP. Risk-associated SNP are likely exerting their effects through promoters or enhancer. In order to understand the importance of the genes with risk-associated SNP in their promoters and enhancers' putatively targeted genes,  we did a comparison of these genes between HCT116 colon cancer cell and normal colon and try to understand their function

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of HCT116 were compared to the data of two normal colon samples already deposited in GEO (GSM1010974 and GSM1010942).
