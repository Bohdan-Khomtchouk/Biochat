TITLE
Development of Regulatory T cell Precursors in the Absence of a Functional Foxp3 Protein

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze gene expression in in regulatory T cell precursors that develop in the absence of a functional Foxp3 protein as compared to that of normal regulatory T cells Keywords: Cell type comparison

DESIGN
Murine wild-type and mutant (delta) Foxp3 alleles were tagged with EGFP reporters. CD4 positive T cells expressing the respective tagged Foxp3 allele (Foxp3/EGFP and delta Foxp3/EGFP) were isolated from hemizygous male mice by cell sorting using FACS. CD4 positive cells that did not express the EGFP tag were a isolated. Total RNA was prepared and used in the array studies.
