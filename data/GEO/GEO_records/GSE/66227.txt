TITLE
Chromatin signatures at Notch regulated enhancers reveal large-scale changes in H3K56ac upon activation

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To investigate the influence of chromatin organization and dynamics on the response to Notch signaling, we partitioned Drosophila chromatin using histone modifications and established This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
