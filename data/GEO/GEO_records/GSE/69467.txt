TITLE
cAMP treated rat DRGs

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To identify potential regeneration-associated genes, rat cultures of dissociated dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cells were treated with dbcAMP for 0,3,6,12, or 18 hours.

DESIGN
A total of 15 paired samples were examined in 5 time points with 3 replicates each.  For each array, dbcAMP-treated and control samples were run in a two-color experiment. ----------------------------------------------------- submitters of this record cannot locate the raw data
