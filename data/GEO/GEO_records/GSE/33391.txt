TITLE
Cross-species Detection in Barley1 GeneChip Array

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
This study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of cross-species detection in Barley1 GeneChip array.  We hybridized cRNA derived from first leaves of barley green seedlings (as a control), as well as the same stage of seedling leaf from representative genotypes of wheat, oat, rice, maize, and sorghum.  Ten to twenty seedlings for each species were harvested and pooled for RNA preparation, labeling, and hybridization.   ****[PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Rico Caldo.
