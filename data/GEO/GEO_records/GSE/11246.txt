TITLE
Evaluation of genes involved in watermelon fruit ripening and development

ORGANISM
Citrullus lanatus

SUMMARY
A microarray and quantitative Real-Time PCR-based study was conducted in watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai var. lanatus] in order to elucidate the flow of events associated with fruit development and ripening in this species.  RNA from three different maturation stages of watermelon fruit, as well as leaf, were collected from field grown plants during three consecutive years, and hybridized to high-density, photolithography microarrays. Keywords: developmental time course, gene expression
