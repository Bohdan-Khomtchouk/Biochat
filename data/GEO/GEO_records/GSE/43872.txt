TITLE
Expression data from one year old leaves of Populus simonii by chilling stress (4°C, 10h).

ORGANISM
Populus simonii

SUMMARY
We take the one year old plant for chilling stress (4°C, 10h) and controls.Use the Affymetrix poplar gene chip to decrypt the gene functions and mechanisms in Populus simonii leaves. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression during chilling stress (4°C, 10h).

DESIGN
Populus simonii leaves were taken from chilling stress (4°C, 10h) and controls for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.BH11269-2_Zdqe 13 and BH11269-2_Zdqe 14 from chilling stress (4°C, 10h) treatments, CK1 and CK2 controls.
