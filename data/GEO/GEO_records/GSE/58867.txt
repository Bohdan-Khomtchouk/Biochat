TITLE
Transcriptional signature of Th17 cells expressing ICOS-based CARs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of TH17 cells redirected with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) expressing various signaling domains (including CD28, 4-1BB and ICOS) after surrogate antigen stimulation. Our results showed that T cells redirected with an ICOS-based CAR specifically retained a genotype of TH17 cells with expression of Il17a, Il17f, Il1r1, Ccl20, Rorc, and in the absence of Foxp3

DESIGN
CAR-redirected TH17 cells from three different human normal donors were stimulated with immobilized recombinant mesothelin. Gene expression levels were determined prior to stimulation (day 0) and 4, 8, 24 and 96 hours upon antigen recognition.
