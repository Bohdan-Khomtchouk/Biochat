TITLE
High throughput quantitative whole transcriptome analysis of individual macrophages 7 days post-sham thoracotomy in B6 CSF1R-GFP mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using fluorescence activated cell sorting, we isolated CD45+, CSF1R-GFP+, F4/80+, Ly6G- mouse lung monocytes and macrophages at 7 days after sham thoracotomy procedures. We then used microfluidic single cell RNA-sequencing to transcriptional profile unique myeloid subsets.

DESIGN
After sequencing 31 single cell transcriptomes were analyzed. Hierarcical and k-means clustering reveals several populations of macrophages are present in the lung.
