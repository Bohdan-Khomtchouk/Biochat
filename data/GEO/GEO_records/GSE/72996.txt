TITLE
An integrated approach combining RNA-seq, Ribo-seq and Proteomics identifies the coding potential of Mycobacterium abscessus

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium abscessus ATCC 19977

SUMMARY
The objective of this study is to develop an integrated map for the M. abscessus ATCC19977 organism. Among the data types contributing to the development of this map are next-generation RNA-sequencing, differential RNA-sequencing, ribosome profiling, and mass spectrometry.

DESIGN
The design of the study consists of two biological samples, each with one technical replication; both biological samples were subjected to identical conditions.
