TITLE
Small RNA and gene expression profile in the adult testes of the common marmoset

ORGANISM
Callithrix jacchus

SUMMARY
Small RNAs mediate gene silencing by binding Argonaute/Piwi proteins to regulate target RNAs. Here we describe small RNA profiling of the adult testes of Callithrix jacchus, the common marmoset. The most abundant class of small RNAs in the adult testis was piRNAs, while 353 novel miRNAs but few endo-siRNAs were also identified. MARWI, a marmoset homolog of mouse MIWI and a very abundant PIWI in adult testes, associates with piRNAs that show characteristics of mouse pachytene piRNAs. As in other mammals, most marmoset piRNAs are derived from conserved clustered regions in the genome, which are annotated as intergenic regions. However, some of these piRNA cluster regions contain antisense-orientated pseudogenes, suggesting regulation of parental functional protein-coding genes. More piRNAs map to transposable element (TE) subfamilies when they have copies in piRNA clusters. In addition, the strand-bias observed for piRNAs mapped to each TE subfamily correlates with the polarity of copies inserted in clusters. These findings suggest that pachytene piRNA clusters determine the abundance and strand-bias of TE-derived piRNAs, and also regulate protein-coding genes via pseudogene-derived piRNAs.

DESIGN
