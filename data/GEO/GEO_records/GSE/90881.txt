TITLE
Identification of receptors involved in hemophagocytosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the mediators of phagocytosis of living cells upregulated by the triple stimuli, we examined the gene expression profiles of BMDMs(Bone-marrow derived macrophages) with microarray consisting of about 40,000 mouse genes

DESIGN
Stimuli induced gene expression in BMDMs was measured 20hrs after addition of CpG, IFN-g+IL-10 receptor blocker(IL-10RB) or triple(CpG+IFN-g+IL-10RB)
