TITLE
Expression data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in multiple sclerosis patients and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease with a presumed autoimmune component. Expression profiling in immune cells can therefore be used in order to identify genes and pathways involved in MS pathogenesis. We conducted a genome-wide expression study in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 12 MS patients and 15 controls in order to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways in MS.

DESIGN
PBMCs were isolated from whole blood and total RNA was extracted.
