TITLE
m6A-seq in glioblastoma stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
m6A RNA methylation plays an important role in regulating the self-renewal and tumorigenesis of glioblastoma stem cells. We performed m6A-seq analysis in glioblastoma stem cells with m6A levels modulated by knocking down METTL3 or METTL14 and identified m6A regulated genes in glioblastoma stem cells.

DESIGN
Glioblastoma stem cells were treated with lentivurs expressing constrol shRNA or target (METTL3 or METTL14) shRNA to knockdown the expression of METTL3 or METTL14. RNAs were extracted and m6A-seq analysis was performed using m6A specific antibody immunoprecipitation followed by RNA-seq.
