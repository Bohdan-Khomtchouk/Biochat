TITLE
Arabidopsis inflorescence stems: wild type vs eal1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of wild type and eal1 of Arabidopsis inflorescence stems. Candidate genes which were down-regulated in eal1 relative to wild type were identified.

DESIGN
Biological replicates: 2 replicates for each experiments and dye swapped for each sample
