TITLE
Genome-wide measurement of Nkx-6.1 in mouse islets.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We perfomed a ChIP-seq experiment to identify the location of binding sites for the transcription factor Nkx6-1 in mouse islets.

DESIGN
A single set of islets were extracted from a mouse and Nkx-6.1 and input ChIP-Seq libraries were prepared and sequenced.
