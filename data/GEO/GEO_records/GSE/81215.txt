TITLE
DNA methylation profile for BL2 and BL2 AID-/- cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase) is expressed at low levels in many tissue types but is most highly expressed in germinal center B cells where it deaminates cytidine to uracil during somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination of the immunoglobulin genes. In addition to this critical role in immune diversification, aberrant targeting of AID contributes to oncogenic point mutations and chromosome translocations associated with B cell malignancies. Thus, to explore a role for AID in DNA demethylation in B cell lymphoma, we performed genome-wide methylation profiling in BL2 and AID-deficient (AID-/-) BL2 cell lines (Burkitt lymphoma that can be induced to express high levels of AID).

DESIGN
Using Illumina's Infinium II DNA Methylation assay combined with the Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip, we analyzed over 450,000 methylation (CpG) sites in two samples, BL2 and BL2 AID-/- cell lines, at single nucleotide resolution.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
