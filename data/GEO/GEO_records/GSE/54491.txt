TITLE
Identification of stable markers of the EMT:MET process

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) facilitate breast cancer (BC) metastasis, however stable molecular changes that result as a consequence of these processes remain poorly defined. Therefore, we sought to identify molecular markers that could distinguish tumor cells that had completed the EMT:MET cycle in the hopes of identifying and targeting unique aspects of metastatic tumor outgrowth.Therefore, normal murine mammary gland (NMumG) cells transformed by overexpression of EGFR (NME) cells were cultured in the presence of TGF-beta1 (5 ng/ml) for 4 weeks, at which point TGF-beta1 supplementation was discontinued and the cells were allowed to recover for an additional 4 weeks (Post-TGF-Rec). Total RNA was prepared from unstimulated cells (Pre-TGF) of similar passage and compared by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
The two groups were analyzed in triplicate, three Pre-TGF samples and three Post-TGF-Rec samples.
