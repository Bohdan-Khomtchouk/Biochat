TITLE
Gene expression analysis of bovine oocytes at optimal coasting time combined with GnRH antagonist during the no-FSH period

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The objective of the study was to analyze the effect of a GnRH antagonist used during the FSH withdrawal period (coasting) on transcriptome changes in in vivo bovine oocytes at the GV stage. Oocytes were collected from super-stimulated animals after a coasting duration of 68hrs (optimal condition, control) and also from the same animal who received the GnRH antagonist (treated) during the whole coasting period.

DESIGN
68hrs of coasting (control) was compared with the 68hrs + GnRH antagonist (treatment), for each cow individually. Overall, 6 hybridizations were done, corresponding to the three biological replicates and one comparison using a dye-swap set-up.
