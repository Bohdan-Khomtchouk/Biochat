TITLE
Deletion mutants mth1, std1, and mth1+std1 v. wild type yeast grown in galactose

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles of S. cerevisiae strains with deletions of mth1, std1, or both were compared to that of a wild-type strain during growth on synthetic complete media with galactose as the carbon source, with the intent to understand each protein's contribution to the cells' response to glucose.
