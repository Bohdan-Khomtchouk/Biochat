TITLE
Deletion mutants mth1, std1, and mth1+std1 v. wild type yeast grown in galactose

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles of S. cerevisiae strains with deletions of mth1, std1, or both were compared to that of a wild-type strain during growth on synthetic complete media with galactose as the carbon source, with the intent to understand each protein's contribution to the cells' response to glucose.

DESIGN
Single-condition experiment, mth1 delete, std1 delete or the double mth1/std1 deletion strain vs. a wild type yeast strain. Biological replicates: 2. Rep. 1: Independently isolated RNA preps for each mutant was compared against a single WT sample. Rep. 2: A second set of mutant and WT samples was used to repeat the profiling. Two replicate spots representing each gene are present per array.
