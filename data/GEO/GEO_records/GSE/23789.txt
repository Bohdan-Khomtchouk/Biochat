TITLE
DNA methylation titration data from two samples with known methylation differences

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two samples with known methylation differences. Sample A is NA 10923 from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. It is a B-Lymphocyte sample from a male donor. Sample B is HTB-38 cell line from ATCC ( ). It is a colon cancer sample from a female donor. Sample A and B were normalized into the same concentration, and then mixed in five different titration ratios: 100:0, 90:10, 75:25, 50:50 and 0:100

DESIGN
Sample A and Sample B were mixed in five different titration ratios: 100:0, 90:10, 75:25, 50:50 and 0:100
