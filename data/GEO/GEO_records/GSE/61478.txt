TITLE
oxi1 transcriptome-Transcriptomic analysis on the effect of oxi1 mutation under high light.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
cea13-01_oxi1 - oxi1 transcriptome - Transcriptomic analysis on the effect of oxi1 mutation under high light stress? - 5 weeks old mutannt (M) and wild type (WT) plants were exposed to high light and low temperature (1300-1350 µmol photons m-2s-1, 7°C/14°C day/night and 380ppm CO2) for 25 hours. ~100 mg fresh weight leaves were harvested, and total RNA prepared from them. For control experiments, leaves were harvested directly from the phytotron (No light stress). Three microarray comparisons were made: Mcontrol/WTcontrol, Mstress/WTstress and Mstress/Mcontrol . For each comparison, 2 biological replicates are performed.

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - genotype comparaison

PLATFORM
GPL15719 INRA-CNRS-UEVE Arabidopsis thaliana 73K CATMAv6-HD12 [100701_Athal_CATMA6_SB_exp]
