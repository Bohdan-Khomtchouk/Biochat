TITLE
Gene expression profiles of rat liver tissues after high-fat emulsion feeding

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common disorder characterized by excessive hepatic fat accumulation, and potentially resulting in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver cirrhosis (LC) and end-stage liver disease We used Rat Genome 230 2.0 microarray to further highlight the rat liver tissues after high-fat emulsion feeding.

DESIGN
The rat model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was established, and the expression profiles of liver tissues from NAFLD were detected at  2, 4, and 6 weeks using Rat Genome 230 2.0 array. Then the significantly changed genes related to NAFLD were identified. The relevance of gene expression profiles and biological processes was analyzed by bioinformatics and systems biology.
