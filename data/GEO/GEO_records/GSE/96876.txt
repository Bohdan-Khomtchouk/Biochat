TITLE
CRISPR-Cas9 epigenome editing enables high-throughput screening for functional regulatory elements in the human genome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. Large genome mapping consortia and thousands of genome-wide association studies have identified non-protein coding elements in the genome as a having a central role in tissue development, cell-type specification, response to environmental or pharmacologic signals, and susceptibility to most common diseases. However, decoding the function of the millions of putative regulatory elements discovered in these studies remains a primary challenge. New CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenome editing technologies have enabled the precise perturbation of the activity of specific regulatory elements. Here we describe CRISPR/Cas9-based Epigenomic Regulatory Element Screening (CERES) for high-throughput screening of regulatory element activity within the native genomic context. We perform both loss- and gain-of-function screens with complementary epigenome editing tools to identify known and unknown regulatory elements of medically relevant genes in human cells. The high-throughput functional annotation of putative regulatory elements by CERES constitutes a new platform for screening biological mechanisms that cannot be perturbed by traditional methods.
