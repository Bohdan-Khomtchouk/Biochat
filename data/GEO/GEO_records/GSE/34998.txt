TITLE
Mouse E15.5 cortices: Snf2l Ex6 deleted mice versus wild type controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of mouse cortices in which the experimental strain lacks Exon 6 of the Snf2l gene which encodes an ATP-binding motif that is critical for chromatin re-modeling

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression in E15.5 cortices of Snf2l-Ex6DEL mice versus wild type controls. Two samples of each strain were used, with one pair of samples utilized for two of the replicates (dye-flip), the second pair then used for the third replicate.

PLATFORM
