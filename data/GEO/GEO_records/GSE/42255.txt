TITLE
Gene expression changes in response to aging compared to heat stress, oxidative stress and ionizing radiation in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes in response to aging, hyperoxia, hydrogen peroxide, ionizing radiation, and heat stress were compared using microarrays.  While aging shared features with each stress, aging was more similar to the stresses most associated with oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide, hyperoxia, ionizing radiation) than to heat stress.  Aging is associated with down-regulation of numerous mitochondrial genes, including electron-transport-chain (ETC) genes and mitochondrial metabolism genes, and a sub-set of these changes was also observed upon hydrogen peroxide stress and ionizing radiation stress. Aging shared the largest number of gene expression changes with hyperoxia.  The extensive down-regulation of mitochondrial and ETC genes during aging is consistent with an aging-associated failure in mitochondrial maintenance, which may underlie the oxidative stress-like and proteotoxic stress-like responses observed during aging.

DESIGN
Thirty five sample of RNA including Stress Controls (4 replicates), Heat Stress (3 replicates), Ionizing Radiation (4 replicates), Sugar (4 replicates), Hydrogen Peroxide (4 replicates), Young Controls (6 replicates) , Hyperoxia (6 replicates) and  Old (4 replicates) adult Drosophila were analysed by Affymetrix microarrays. Stress Controls were used as controls for Heat Stress, Ionizing Radiation, Sugar and Hydrogen Peroxide samples. Young Controls were used as controls for Hyperoxia and Old samples. All flies were male progeny of a cross between Oregon-R wildtype and transgenic strain w[1118];P{w+ rtTA}(3)[E2]/ TM3. Flies lacking the balancer but bearing the transgene were used.
