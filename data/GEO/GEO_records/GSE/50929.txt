TITLE
SRC family kinases are involved in the regulation of CD20

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD20 is an integrate membrane protein expressed on the surface of normal and malignant B-cells. It is an excellent molecular target for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are widely used in the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Anti-CD20-directed therapies are the most effective, successful and widely used therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, routinely incorporated into all phases of conventional treatment, including first-line, maintenance and salvage treatment. Nonetheless, the overall response rates to treatment have been reported to be 46-67% for rituximab, and in patients relapsing after initial rituximab treatment the response rate is ~40%. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this inefficiency, including modulation of surface CD20 levels, occurring due to both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations. Our observations strongly imply that the observed CD20 down-regulation relies on transcriptional mechanism and delineate new perspectives in the field of CD20 regulation.   Since many of the new therapeutic agents selectively inhibit specific signaling pathways, combining the compounds that target different mechanisms of cell growth and survival is a particularly attractive approach. However, optimal combinations of novel treatment modalities with already existing ones should take into account potential ”off-target” activity yet to be identified that could unexpectedly result in high toxicity  and/or impaired outcomes of treatment
