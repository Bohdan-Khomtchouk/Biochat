TITLE
Promoter context-specific positive and negative transcriptional regulation of Glucocorticoid Receptor target genes by coregulator G9a

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A549 lung cancer cells were not infected (NI), transfected by plasmids containing shG9a (sequence targeting G9a gene) or shNS (non-specific sequence). These cells were treated with dex to identify subsets of genes regulated by dex (hormone) and G9a (EHMT2)

DESIGN
Cells (NI/shNS/shG9a) were treated with 100nM dex for 24h and total RNA was extracted to identify differentially expressed genes
