TITLE
The CodY Regulon in Streptoccus mutans

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans

SUMMARY
In this report, codY mutant strains were constructed and used to demonstrate the relationship of (p)ppGpp synthesized by RelP and RelQ with the activation of CodY.  In addition, because CodY has not been studied in S. mutans, we used microarrays to demonstrate that this protein function as a global regulator of gene expression in S. mutans. Keywords: stress response, gene knockout analysis
