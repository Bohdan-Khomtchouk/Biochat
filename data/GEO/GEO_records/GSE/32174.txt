TITLE
microRNA profiling in duodenal ulcer disease caused by Helicobacter pylori infection in a Western population.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify and assess the utility of miRNAs as diagnostic surrogate markers for H.pylori infection. For this purpose, we analyzed the miRNA expression profile by microarrays in the antral mucosa of well characterized dyspeptic patients and then applied the most significant set of miRNAs to an independent validation group. Our results shows that a set of miRNAs are deregulated during chronic gastric inflammation and that this set may be may be useful as a surrogate marker for determining the presence of H.pylori.

DESIGN
Total RNA from antral biopsies from patients with Helicobacter pylory (Hp) infection (with or without virulence factor caG) and healthy volunteers were isolated. MiRNA expression profiles were analyzed using miRNA microarray platform.
