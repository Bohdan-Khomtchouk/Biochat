TITLE
Open chromatin profile of primary and lymph node oral cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We employed FAIRE-seq to identify open chromatin in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patient-derived primary and lymph node cell lines. We further analysed this data to identify differential open chromatin between primary and metastatic cells.

DESIGN
Examination of open chromatin in primary vs. lymph node metastatic cells from a patient (HS137) with HNSCC.
