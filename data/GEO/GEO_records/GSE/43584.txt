TITLE
Expression analysis of systemically infected Nicotiana benthamiana infected by South African cassava mosaic virus (SACMV)

ORGANISM
Nicotiana benthamiana

SUMMARY
Micrarray analysis was used to identify gene expression changes associated with disease development  and virus movement in N.benthamina plants induced by infection with the SACMV Slides were originally designed as a collaboration between Prof. Steven A. Lommel's research group and NimbleGen. Should you require any additional information regarding this array, kindly contact Prof. Lommel. http://plantpath.cals.ncsu.edu/faculty/steven-lommel

DESIGN
1-Plex , 385K array Nicotiana benthamiana (NimbleGen design name: 110121_N_benthamiana_60mer_exp) was used in this study to monitor changes in gene expression levels in SACMV- infected leaf tissue. Three biological replicates were used for infected leaf tissue and one pooled mock-inoculated sample was used as a control/reference.

PLATFORM
GPL16520 NimbleGen Nicotiana benthamiana expression array [110121_N_benthamiana_60mer_exp]
