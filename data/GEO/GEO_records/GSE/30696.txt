TITLE
Expression data from Porcine alveolar macrophages of piglets experimentally infected with Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) for 7 days

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) play an important role in innate immunity. Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a pathogen responsible for several diseases in both pigs and humans. We used microarrays to study the transcriptome of PAMs infected with SS2.

DESIGN
Healthy pigs were inoculated intranasally with 2 ml of 4.84Ã—10^6 colony-forming units of SS2 strain SC19. The PAMs were isolated at 7 dpi. RNA was extracted from PAMs obtained from infected pigs and control pigs, and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
