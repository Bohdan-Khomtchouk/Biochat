TITLE
Expression data from early and late passages of OVDM1 cell line and the original metastatic tumor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
OVDM1, a new ovarian cell line derived from a serous ovarian metastatic adenocarcinoma sample, was established by immortalization with SV40 large-T antigen and hTERT and then characterized Expression microarrays were used for molecular profiling of early and late passages of OVDM1 cell line, as well as the original metastatic tumor.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from early and late passages of OVDM1 and from the metastatic tumor for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
