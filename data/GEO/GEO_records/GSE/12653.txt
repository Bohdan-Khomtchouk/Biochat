TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis in Peripheral Blood of Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Peripheral blood cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis before/after IL-6 inhibition The obtained conclusions on the change of each gene expression level before and after MRA medication were as follows. (1)	In the case of IL-6, the specific time profile that the expression level dropped at day 21 and increased to some extent at day 42 was observed in 2 of 18 subjects. In other subjects, quite small change or small increase after day 7 was observed. (2)	In the case of IL-6R as well as in IL-6, the specific time profile that the expression level dropped at day 21 and increased to some extent at day 42 was observed in 1 of 18 subjects.  In other subjects, slow and small increase was observed in 6 of 18. (3)	The ratio of mRNA expression level of membrane and soluble type of IL-6R showed marginal difference after tocilizumab treatment, (4)	The distinct change of expression level of cytochrome P450 mRNA after tocilizumab treatment was hardly observed in most patients.

DESIGN
The measurement of expression level of several genes shown below in peripheral blood of human subjects (18 patients with rheumatic disease) before and after tocilizumab medication using DNA microarray (Hitachi human oligo chip) was conducted in this test, 1) Interleukin 6 (IL-6), membrane IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and soluble type of the IL-6R, 2) several cytochrome P450 as follows: CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19. Number of human subjects was 18 and peripheral blood samples drawn at 4 time points: day 0 (the first Omeprazole administration was done), day 7  (Tocilizumab administration was done), day 21 and day 42 for each subject were analyzed. On day 0 and day 7, the blood sampling was done before drug administration.
