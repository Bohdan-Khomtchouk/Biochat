TITLE
Bradyrhizobium japonicum_Bacteroids Time Course

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 110

SUMMARY
A time-course transcriptomic analysis of bacteroids isolated from soybean plants inoculated with B. japonicum USDA 110, relative to cells cultured in HM-arabinose medium was performed to characterize senescence genes.

DESIGN
Four independent biological materials for bacteroids and free-living cells at 6 time points. Seven or eight arrays including dye swap are presented at each time point.

PLATFORM
GPL5341 USDA Bradyrhizobium japonicum 8.5K (BJ_USDA110_Oligo_Array)
