TITLE
Genome-wide binding of MYCN protein in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The MYCN locus is amplified in about half of high-risk neuroblastoma tumors. To identify genomic loci occupied by MYCN protein in the MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines NGP, Kelly and NB-1643, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with Next-Generation Sequencing (ChIP-seq) using an anti-MYCN antibody.

DESIGN
Identification of  MYCN occupancy throughout the genome of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells.
