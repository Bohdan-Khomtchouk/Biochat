TITLE
Quantitative analysis of chromatin occupancy (ChIP-Seq) from wild-type mice and Kdm5c KO mice in standard conditions (H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and Kdm5C) or upon novelty exposure (H3K4me3), and control mice and Kdm5c ifKO mice in basal state (H3K4me3).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were conducted as previously described (Ito et al, 2013) using anti-H3K4me3 (Millipore, #07-473), anti-H3K4me1 (Abcam, #ab8895), or anti-Kdm5C (Iwase et al., 2016). Hippocampi derived from two different animals were pooled together for each sample and two independent biological replicates per condition were sequenced according to manufacturer instructions in a HiSeq2500 apparatus (Illumina, Inc). Information on library preparation method, size of the libraries, and mapping to reference genome can be found in Supplementary Material accompanying the manuscript. ChIP-seq reads were aligned to the mouse genome (Mus_musculus.GRCm.38.83) using bowtie2 (v2.2.9) (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and further processed using samtools (v1.3.1) (Li et al., 2009). Peak calling was performed using MACS2 (v2.1.0) (Zhang et al., 2008) with default parameters except for Kdm5c that were as follows: -q 0.01 --nomodel --extsize 131 --broad --broad-cutoff 0.1. Read counts on aligned bam files were performed using Rsubread (v1.22.3) (Liao et al., 2014). Differential peak methylation analysis for H3K4me3 chromatin mark was performed using DESeq2 (v1.10.0) (Love et al., 2014) of the bioconductor suite (Huber et al., 2015) in the R (v3.3) statistical computing platform. For consideration of differentially methylated regions between conditions, we used adjusted p-value < 0.05 as indicated in the manuscript.

DESIGN
Genome-wide profiles for H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and Kdm5C from adult mouse hippocampus were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Each sample was prepared by pooling hippocampal tissue from 2 idenpendent mice.
