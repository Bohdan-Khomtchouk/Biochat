TITLE
Quantitative Analysis of H3K4me3 chromatin marking through Next Generation Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) from wild-type mice and Kdm5c KO mice in home cage or upon novelty exposure, and control mice and Kdm5c ifKO mice in basal state.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were conducted as previously described (Ito et al, 2013) using anti-H3K4me3 (Millipore (07-473) Hippocampi derived from two different animals were pooled together for each sample and two independent biological replicates per condition were sequenced according to manufacturer instructions in a HiSeq2500 apparatus (Illumina, Inc). Information on library preparation method, size of the libraries, and mapping to reference genome can be found in Sup. Table S9 of the manuscript. ChIP-seq reads were aligned to the mouse genome (Mus_musculus.GRCm.38.83) using bowtie2 (v2.2.9) (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and further processed using samtools (v1.3.1) (Li et al., 2009). Peak calling was performed using MACS2 (v2.1.0) (Zhang et al., 2008) with default parameters. Read counts on aligned bam files were performed using Rsubread (v1.22.3) (Liao et al., 2014). Differential peak methylation analysis was performed using DESeq2 (v1.10.0) (Love et al., 2014) of the bioconductor suite (Huber et al., 2015) in the R (v3.3) statistical computing platform. For consideration of differentially methylated regions between conditions, we used adjusted p-value < 0.05 as indicated in the manuscript.

DESIGN
Genome-wide H3K4me3 profiles from adult mouse hippocampus were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Each sample was prepared by pooling hippocampal tissue from 2 idenpendent mice.
