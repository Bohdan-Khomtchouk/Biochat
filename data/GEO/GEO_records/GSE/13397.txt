TITLE
HNSCC samples vs. normal tonsil samples: self-self hybridization design

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
transcription profiling of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) samples vs. normal tonsil samples using a self-self hybridization experimental design on two-color arrays. Used to identify differentially expressed genes in tumor/normal samples, and compare the result to that of the same samples using the reference design experimental setting. Keywords: tumor/normal comparison

DESIGN
8 HNSCC tumor samples and 8 normal tonsil samples. Each was profiled using a self-self hybridization design, where two aliquots of the same sample were labeled with two different dyes (cy3 and cy5) and hybridize to the same array.
