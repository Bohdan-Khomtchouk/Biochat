TITLE
Gene expression signatures in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze the gene expression signatures in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), a series of 14 GIST specimens were analyzed using Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray (4x44K, G4112F).

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 32 fresh frozen GIST specimens obtained from surgical resections. Gene expression was analyzed using Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray (4x44K, G4112F, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Risk grade was assessed according to the risk definition system proposed by Fletcher et al. (Hum Pathol. 2002;33:459-65.)
