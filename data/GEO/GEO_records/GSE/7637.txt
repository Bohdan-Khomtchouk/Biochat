TITLE
Expression data from human mesenchymal stem cells (#4F1560)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human mesenchymal stem cells are expected to be a useful tool for cellular therapy. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression profiles and selected candidate biomarkers that indicate the culture stage of the cells. Keywords: mesenchymal stem cells, passage numbers

DESIGN
Human mesenchymal stem cells were cultured and subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on microarrays. Cell cultures in passage numbers 5, 7, 9, 13, 14, 21, and 28 of lot#4F1560 were subjected to the microarray analysis.
