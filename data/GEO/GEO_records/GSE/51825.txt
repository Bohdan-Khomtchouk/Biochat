TITLE
Non-growing Rhodopseudomonas palustris increases the hydrogen gas yield from acetate by shifting from the glyoxylate shunt to the tricarboxylic acid cycle

ORGANISM
Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis was performed in order to better understand the metabolic activity of non-growing cells of Rhodopseudomonas palustris for improve biofuel production.

DESIGN
Gene expression profilings of cells from various time points during non-growing phase were compared using RNA-seq.
