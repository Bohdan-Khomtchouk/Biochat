TITLE
The MisR regulon in Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain FA19

ORGANISM
Neisseria gonorrhoeae

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome analysis of N. gonorrhoeae FA19 and isogenic NGEG_00293 (misR) mutant using RNA-Seq (note that NGO0177 is the misR ORF designation in mapping strain FA1090)

DESIGN
Examination of total transcriptomes in N. gonorrhoeae FA19 WT and an FA19 misR::kan isogenic mutant to determine the regulatory impact of the MisR response regulator on cells grown under laboratory conditions.  Illumina HiSeq-2000 next generation sequencing was used to sequence the transcriptomes of each strain.  Reads were mapped against the N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 genome (NCBI accession number NC_002946) because at the time this experiment was run the FA19 genome was incomplete.

PLATFORM
