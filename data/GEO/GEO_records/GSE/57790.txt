TITLE
Impacts of high ATP supply from chloroplasts and mitochondria on the leaf metabolism of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Columbia (overexpression line) was used in this study. After sterilization, the seeds were placed on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 2% (w/v) sucrose for 10 days and then the seedling were transferred to soil under 16 hours light (22°C) / 8 hours dark (18°C) period in growth chamber at a light intensity of 120?150 µmol m-2 s-1. 20-day-old Arabidopsis leaves without bolting were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA and protein and metabolites extraction. Leaves were harvested at three different time points: t = 0 hr (end of night), t = 1 hr (one hour after light turn on) and t = 8 hr (eight hours after light turn on), respectively.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from leaves at all three time points and DNA contamination was removed by DNase I (RNeasy Plant Mini Kit, Qiagen, Hong Kong).Ribosomal RNAs were removed from the total RNA by the Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit for plant leaf (Epicentre, USA) before cDNA library construction. The libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeqTM2000. After removal of low quality reads, clean reads from three different RNA-seq samples (3 times points, t = 0, 1, 8) were aligned to Arabidopsis genome. No biological replication carried out in this experiment.
