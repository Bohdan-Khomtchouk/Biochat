TITLE
Tbx15 Controls Skeletal Muscle Fiber Type Determination and Muscle Metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle is composed of both slow-twich oxidative myofibers and fast-twitch glycolytic myofibers that differentially impact muscle metabolism, function, and eventually whole-body physiology. In the present study, we find that the mesodermal transcription factor T-box 15 (Tbx15) is highly and specifically expressed in glycolytic myofibers. Ablation of Tbx15 in vivo leads to a decrease in muscle size due to a decrease in the number of glycolytic fibers, associated with a small increase in the number of oxidative fibers. This shift in fiber composition results in muscles with slower myofiber contraction and relaxation, and also results in decreased whole-body oxygen consumption, decreased spontaneous activity, increased adiposity, and glucose intolerance. In order to identify genes regulated by Tbx15, we utilized C2C12 myoblasts with either a stable retroviral over-expression or stable lentiviral knockdown of Tbx15.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted and biotin labelled complementary RNA (cRNA) was prepared from three independent transfections of the four stable C2C12 myoblast cell lines: shTbx15, shGFP, pBABE-Empty-puro, pBABE-Tbx15-puro. Cells were collected at 90% confluency, and subjected to microarray analysis.  Affymetrix M430 2.0 Chips were used.
