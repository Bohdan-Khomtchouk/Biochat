TITLE
Characterization and function of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus-derived small RNAs generated in the tolerant and susceptible tomato varieties using deep sequencing

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequence analysis of small RNAs of TYLCV-tolerant (containing tolerance gene Ty-1) and susceptible varieties indicated that miRNA-like vsRNAs and secondary vsiRNAs are mainly contributed to hotpots. Interestingly, various characteristics of vsRNAs among each sample are consistent, but in different number of expression; Deep sequencing of degradome provided evidence for the function of vsRNAs-mediated viral transcripts slicing; And bisulfite sequencing PCR suggested the geminivirus DNA methylation induced by vsRNAs. Comparison of the expression quantity and trend of viral DNA, mRNA and vsRNA inferred that the quantity of vsRNAs is significantly corresponding to the expression level of viral mRNA. Nevertheless, vsRNAs had finite effect on inhibition of virus replication and expression. Here, we also speculated that by RDR catalysis of vsRNAs amplification, the tolerance gene Ty-1 may take an effective inhibition of viral transcription at the beginning of TYLCV infection.

DESIGN
Examination of 6 different sRNA and 4 degradome library in 2 tomato material. The main result of our paper is distinguish the host plant sRNA and viral-derived sRNA from the .fa files (MMS_21dpi, 30dpi and TY1S_21dpi, 30dpi).
