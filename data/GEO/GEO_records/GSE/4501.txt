TITLE
Tup11D,12D/WT

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We have performed a genome wide expression profile study of the transcriptional co-repressor proteins tup11,12 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The expression of a double knock out strain (tup11,12D) was compared against the expression in a WT strain under normal conditions YES-media at 30 degrees (Xue et al, 2004). Keywords: DeletionMutant/WT

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling experiment in which gene expression in logarithmically growing cultures of tup11,12D mutants was compared to that in wt controls. Wt  and tup11,12D cells were grown in rich medium, and RNA was extracted and subjected to cDNA expression profiling analysis using the established protocols (Xue et al, 2004). Two independent RNA preparations were used to hybridise to two microarrays one on which wildtype was labelled with Cy5 and with Cy3 and the other with dye swap. Data normalized with 'Lowess' per chip per spot normalization.
