TITLE
Tup11D,12D/WT

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We have performed a genome wide expression profile study of the transcriptional co-repressor proteins tup11,12 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The expression of a double knock out strain (tup11,12D) was compared against the expression in a WT strain under normal conditions YES-media at 30 degrees (Xue et al, 2004). Keywords: DeletionMutant/WT
