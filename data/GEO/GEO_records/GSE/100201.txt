TITLE
Hilpda deficiency effect on brown adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus

SUMMARY
Analysis of interscapular brown fat tissue of fasted mice to identify the possible impact of the lipid droplet protein Hilpda on thermogenesis. Tissues were isolated from genetically engineered mice with the Hilpda gene knocked out and Luciferase knocked in, and Hilpda WT counterparts.

DESIGN
We analyzed brown adipose tissues from 4 HILPDA KO mice and 4 WT mice using the Affymetrix Clariom S solutions. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Expression Console and Transcriptome Analysis Console . No techinical replicates were performed.
