TITLE
N6-methyladenosine in Flaviviridae viral RNA genomes regulates infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We use MeRIP-seq and PAR-CLIP in liver cell lines to detail the role of m6A in positive strand RNA virus infection. We find that hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and Zika virus all contain m6A within their genomes, with some conservation between viruses in methylation sites.

DESIGN
Study of m6A methylation in HCV, dengue, WNV, YFV, and Zika virus with two replicates using a polyA prep (m6A antibody, Synaptic Systems; 202 003). Identification of YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3 binding sites on the HCV RNA genome using PAR-CLIP
