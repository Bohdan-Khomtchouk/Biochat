TITLE
Copy number variation in inbred and wild mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Mus musculus domesticus ; Mus spretus

SUMMARY
Copy number variants were determined in 3-5 males from 13 inbred laboratory mouse strains and 21 Mus musculus individuals caught in various geographic locations, using Nimblegen 385k arrays. CopyMap was used to predict CNVs.

DESIGN
3-5 males from 13 inbred strains and 21 Mus musculus caught in various geographic locations were compared to a single C57BL/6J individual by array comparative genome hybridisation.
