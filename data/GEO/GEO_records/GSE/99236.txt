TITLE
Transcriptional changes induced in human CD4+ cells upon ectopic expression of FOXP3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human CD4+CD45RA+CD25- cells were lentivirally transduced with wild-type or mutated (A384T or R397W) FOXP3, or an empty vector (EV). Transduced cells were sorted 14 days post-transduction based on GFP expression, and were restimulated with soluble anti-CD3 (30 ng/mL) and irradiated PBMCs (3x) for 14 more days. Cells were then activated with 0.5 μg/ml of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in the presence or absence of SGF003 (8 μg/mL), and total RNA was extracted for microarray analysis. Overall, this study highlights the functional impact of TIP60 in FOXP3-driven Treg biology and provides a novel target for manipulation of human Treg activity. This study analyzes the transcriptional changes induced by the ectopic expression of FOXP3 in human effector T cells. It also assesses the impact of the enhancement of TIP60/FOXP3 interaction using the TIP60 modifier SGF003

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from FOXP3-transduced human CD4+CD25- cells
