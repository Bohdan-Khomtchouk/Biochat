TITLE
OsDDM1 regulated genes in rice: Control (wt: cultivar " Nipponbare " ) vs. Transgenic (antisense OsDDM1)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of young leaves of rice (Oryza sativa) comparing control wild-type plants with transgenic plants transformed with a pBI-nptII-OsDDM1 gene. The latter makes the methylation level of the genomic DNA decreased. Goal was to determine the effects of decreased level of genomic DNA on global rice gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Control vs. Transgenic plants. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 transfected replicates.
