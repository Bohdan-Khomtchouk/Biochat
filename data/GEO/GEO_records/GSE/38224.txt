TITLE
Expression data from Ring1A(-/-);Ring1B(fl/fl);R26::CreERT2 ES cells expressing either of mock, WT or mutant Ring1B construct before or after OHT treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate the restoration of repression of PRC1 target gene expression in Ring1A/B-dKO ES cells stably expressing either of mock, WT or mutant Ring1B construct.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from the respective ES cells, and were subjected to microarray analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 arrays
