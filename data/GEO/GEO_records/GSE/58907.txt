TITLE
RepliSeq of HT-1080 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of replication timing by RepliSeq of HT-1080 Human Connective Tissue Fibrosarcoma Cells. HT-1080 subclone +4 cell line as described in “Human gene targeting favors insertions over deletions.”  Russell, D.W., and Hirata, R.K. (2008). Hum Gene Ther 19, 907-914.

DESIGN
RepliSeq of HT-1080 cell line was used to determine the impact of DNA replication on targeted adeno-associated virus sites  by mapping replication forks, which revealed a consistent preference for recombination at target loci transcribed towards an incoming fork.
