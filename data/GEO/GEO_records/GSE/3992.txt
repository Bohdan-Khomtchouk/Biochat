TITLE
si RNA interference of Hepatitis B viral gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling comparisons of HepG2.2.15 or PLC/PRF/5 cells either mock (M) transfected or transfected with 0.2 microM S2 RNA or Scrambled (SCR) siRNA were carried out in duplicate 48 hours after transfection. The experiments were carried out in duplicate (a and b). The following combinations of RNA were used on 2 slides each: 1. 2.2.15 cells: mock transfection (reference) versus S2 treatment (test) 2. 2.2.15 cells: mock transfection (reference) versus Scr treatment (test) 3. 2.2.15 cells: Scr treatment (reference) versus S2 treatment (test) 4. PLC/PRF/5 cells: mock transfection (reference) versus S2 treatment (test) 5. PLC/PRF/5 cells: mock transfection (reference) versus Scr treatment (test) 6. PLC/PRF/5 cells: Scr treatment (reference) versus S2 treatment (test) A stimulus or stress experiment design type is where that tests response of an organism(s) to stress/stimulus. e.g. osmotic stress, behavioral treatment Keywords: stimulus_or_stress_design
