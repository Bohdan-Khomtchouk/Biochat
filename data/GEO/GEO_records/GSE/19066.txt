TITLE
Small RNA sequencing in mouse cardiomyocytes after siRNA mediated knockdown of Srf

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed two independent siRNA mediated knockdowns of Srf (Srf si1 & Srf si2) and an unspecific siRNA (siNon) in mouse cardiomyocytes HL-1 cells. Small RNAs were sequenced by Illumina/Solexa next-generation (single-end) sequencing technology. The sequence reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome (NCBI v37, mm9) using MicroRazerS. MicroRazerS searches for the longest possible prefix-match of each read, i.e. the longest possible contiguous match starting at the first base. Hence, it is robust to possible adapter sequence at the 3' end of a read and requires no adapter trimming.
