TITLE
Expression data from ethanol and saline exposed mice [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse models of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder can be used to assess molecular changes underlying the disorder. Neonatal ethanol exposure in mice can be used to model third trimester ethanol exposure in humans.

DESIGN
Mice were injected with 2.5 g/kg twice on each of postnatal days 4 and 7. Mice were allowed to reach postnatal day 70, at which time whole-hippocampus was isolated and snap frozen. Tissue was thawed and RNA was isolated. RNA run on affymetrix gene expression array according to standard protocol.  Each array was a pool of three mice, for a total n=9 ethanol-exposed and 9 control mice. All mice were male.
