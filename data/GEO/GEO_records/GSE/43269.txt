TITLE
Genome wide-DNA methylation analysis of articular chondrocytes reveals a cluster of osteoarthritic patients (methylation)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to identify, for the first time, the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of human articular chondrocytes from OA and healtly cartilage samples. Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and osteoarthritic samples. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in cartilage knee samples. Samples included 18 healthy controls and 23 OA patients.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 31 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
