TITLE
Gene expression profiling of asbestos-related lung squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify gene expression biomarkers associate with asbestos-related lung squamous cell carcinoma, we analyzed gene expression profiles for a total of 56 lung squamous cell carcinomas using 44K Illumina Gene Expression microarrays. Twenty-six cases had lung asbestos body counts above levels associated with urban dwelling (ARLC-SCC: asbestos-related lung cancer-squamous cell carcinoma) and 30 cases had no lung asbestos bodies (NARLC-SCC: non-asbestos related lung cancer- squamous cell carcinoma). Genes differentially expressed between ARLC-SCC and NARLC-SCC were identified on fold change and P-value, and then prioritised using gene ontology.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from fresh frozen lung tumour tissue and stratified by asbestos phenotype. Gene expression profiling was performed to identify differences in the gene profiles of asbestos-related and non-asbestos related lung squamous cell carcinomas.
