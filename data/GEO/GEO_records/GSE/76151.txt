TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of hnRNP A2/B1 and A1 depleted cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kits to prepare RNA-seq libraries of total RNA from hnRNP A2/B1 and A1 depleted A549 cells. Pro-seq libraries were prepared from A549 cells using Illumina adapters

DESIGN
hnRNP A2/B1 and A1 depleted A549 cells were generated by lentiviral infections of shRNA constructs. RNAs were isolated using Trizol.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
