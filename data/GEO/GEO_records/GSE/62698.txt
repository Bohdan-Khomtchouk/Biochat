TITLE
Spinal cord injury (RNA sequencing data)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the gene expression profile of monocyte-derived macrophages and microglia following spinal cord injury. Moreover, we investigated the gene expression profole of M-CSF induced macrophages and new-born derived microglia following TGFb1 treatment.
