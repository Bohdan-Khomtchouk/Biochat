TITLE
Myeloid derived suppressor cells enhance stemness of cancer cells by inducing miRNA101 and suppressing the corepressor CtBP2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The work identifies an immune associated cellular, molecular and clinical network involving MDSCs-microRNA101-CtBP2-stem cell core genes, which extrinsically controls cancer stemness and impacts patient outcome.

DESIGN
Primary ovarian cancer cells (5 x105) were co-cultured with freshly sorted ovarian cancer associated-MDSCs, peripheral blood lin-CD45+CD33+ cells (5 x105) or medium in a transwell (Corning) for 24 hours.  Then, RNA was extracted from the cancer cells by Trizol reagent. The RNAs were applied for microRNA profiling using OpenArray system (Applied Biosystems, Cat# 4470187) (Mestdagh et al., 2008) at University of Michigan Sequencing Core
