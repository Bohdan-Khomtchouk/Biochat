TITLE
Soybean cultivars,Soybean Hydrophobic Protein(HPS) comparison

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
The Hydrophobic protein from soybean (HPS) locus is polymorphic among soybean cultivars and copy-number changes in the tandem array at this locus are directly correlated with expression level and seed coat luster phenotypes. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
The indentity for HPS on the array is AW156395, Gm-r1070-2255. ExptI Mukden(shiny) vs OX281(dull) biological rep 1;ExptII Mukden vs OX281 biological rep 2;ExptIII Harosoy 63(dull) vs Sooty(bloom) biological rep 1 6 slide hybridizations including dye swap,6 genomic DNA samples,4 soybean cultivars
