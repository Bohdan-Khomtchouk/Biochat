TITLE
Identification of cranial-specific neural crest genes by comparative transcriptomics

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We employ RNA-seq of FACS sorted cell populations to identify genes that are enriched in cranial neural crest in relationship to the trunk.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of delaminating cranial and trunk neural crest subpopulations.

PLATFORM
GPL16133 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Gallus gallus)
