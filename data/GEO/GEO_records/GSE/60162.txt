TITLE
Microrray expression data of Osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts (OASF) transfected with TBX5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TBX5 is hypomethylated in Rheumatoid Arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASF). Hypomethylation increased the TBX5 expression in RASF. We performed a microarray expression analysis upon TBX5 overexpression to find TBX5  molecular targets.TBX5 belongs to the T-box transcription factor family all of which possess a T-box DNA binding domain in their sequence. It has been shown to play an important role in tissue development and cancer.

DESIGN
We were interested in identifying a possible role of TBX5 overexpression in RA. To that end, OASF were transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)_TBX5 or pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector as a negative control. After 48h, RNA was extracted  and cDNA was generated by reverse transcription. The labeled cDNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix microarray.
