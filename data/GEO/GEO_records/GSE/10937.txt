TITLE
Gene expression differences between matched tumor and normal samples of NSCLC patients (qRT-PCR)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression differences between between matched tumor and normal samples were analyzed using paired t-test. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
he NSCLC patient collective was composed of the histological subtype adenocarcinoma (n=42) and squamous cell carcinoma (n=18). We subjected gene expression profiles of 34 AC and 11 SCC matched normal and tumor samples into qRT-PCR analysis. Expression analysis of 30 cell adhesion and EMT associated genes revealed strong differences between matched tumor and normal samples of NSCLC subtypes.
