TITLE
mRNA profiling at various time points during adipocyte differentiation of human Multipotent Adipose-Derived Stem (hMADS) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
human Multipotent Adipose-Derived Stem (hMADS) cells constitute a highly interesting in vitro model to study adipocyte development in vitro. Using a chemically defined medium with several hormonal inducers, these cells can be differentiated into mature adipocytes within ~2 weeks. To gain a global view on transcripts which are induced or downregulated at various stages of adipocyte differentiation, we performed a microarray analysis with samples harvested at the stem cell stage, the terminally differentiated stage, as well as various time points in between.

DESIGN
Analysis used proliferating hMADS cells as control sample for comparison to hMADS cells at confluence and at various time points after induction of adipocyte differentiation. Biological replicates: 2, indepently grown and harvested. All hybridizations were repeated with reversed dye assignment (dye-swap) as technical replicates.
