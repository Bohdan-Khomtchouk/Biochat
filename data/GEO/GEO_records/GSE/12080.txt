TITLE
Gene expression signature involved in estrogen receptor status and prognosis of breast cancers.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) of breast cancers were taken before and after surgeries from 16 patients. The cDNA microarray data were used to determine the gene expression profile responding to patient's clinical finding and tumor's pathological changes. A gene profile was generated as Estrogen Receptor Gene Signature (ERGS). The ERGS was verified in a reference dataset and correlated with patient's prognosis significantly. Keywords: Breast cancer, fine needle biopsy, estrogen receptor, prognostic gene signature

DESIGN
Dye-swap technical replicates were included both FNABs taken before and after surgeries for every patient, then the four replicated array data per patient were combined for analysis.
