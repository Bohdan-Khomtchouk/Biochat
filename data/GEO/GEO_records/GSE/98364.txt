TITLE
Expression data in HCT-116 colon cancer cell treated with SCD1 inhibitor or in SCD1 knocked out HCT-116 cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand molecular mechanisms underlying the growth inhibitory ativity of Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) inhibitor, we performed microarray analysis using HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells, in which SCD1 was pharmacologically blocked or genetically ablated.

DESIGN
HCT-116 cells treated with DMSO or SCD1 inhibitor, and SCD1 knocked-out cells were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarray (n = 1 each). The DMSO-treated sample was used as a control.
