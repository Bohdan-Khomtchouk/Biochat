TITLE
Effects of the soluble cytoplasmic tail (D2-domain) of CD45 on human T-cell activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human peripheral blood T cells (total CD3+) were stimulated for 12 and 24 h with plate bound CD3/CD28 or CD3/CD63 mAbs in the presence or absence of the D2-domain of the cytoplasmic tail of CD45. Total RNA was purified and gene expression profiles were obtained.

DESIGN
A total of 8 samples consisting of CD3+ T-cells from healthy volunteers were stimulated for 12 and 24 hours with plate bound CD3/CD28 or CD3/CD63 mAbs in the presence or absence of the D2-domain of the cytoplasmic tail of CD45 (aa942-1226 fused to an Fc-backbone as previously described by Kirchberger et al. in Blood 112(4):1240-1248). Total RNA was isolated from the samples and compared by full transcriptome profiling using Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 GeneChips.
