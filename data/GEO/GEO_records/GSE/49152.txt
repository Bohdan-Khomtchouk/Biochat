TITLE
miRNA expression in human chondrocyte subtypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Frozen blocks of human embryonic limb tissue were sectioned and laser capture microdissected to collect three human chodrocyte tissues - precursor, differentiated and hypertrophic chondrocytes.Total RNA including miRNAs was isolated and analyzed using Applied Biosystems OpenArray® Real-Time PCR system.

DESIGN
RT-PCR miRNA expression profiling. miRNA expression from three chondrocyte sub types - precursor, differentiated and hypertrophic  chondrocytes were analyzed using TaqMan® OpenArray® Human MicroRNA Panel.

PLATFORM
GPL17485 TaqMan® OpenArray® Human MicroRNA Panel (miRBase v14)
