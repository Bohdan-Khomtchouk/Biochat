TITLE
Zebrafish embryos: Control vs. 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treated

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of 24 hours post-fertilization zebrafish embryos comparing control untreated embryos with embryos raised in 75uM 5-azadC. 5-azadC blocks methylation. The goal was to determine genes regulated by methylation during development.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, 24 hour untreated embryos vs. 5azadC-treated embryos. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 5azadC-treated replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL7302 Agilent-015064 D. rerio (Zebrafish) Oligo Microarray 4x44K G2519F (Probe Name version)
