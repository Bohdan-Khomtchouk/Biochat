TITLE
Overexpression of splicing factor SRSF6 in mouse skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Many biological processes involve post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Here, we show that an alternative splicing factor SRSF6 affects tissue homeostasis of the skin. In this dataset, we study effects on gene expression and alternative splicing upon SRSF6 overexpression (+doxycycline) in mouse skin using inducible R26-rtTA+/-, ColA1-TREtight-SRSF6+/- transgenic mice

DESIGN
4 mixed-background strain samples (2 SRSF6-induced skin samples and 2 uninduced skin control samples)
