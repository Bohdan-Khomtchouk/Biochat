TITLE
The effect of TIM-3 stimulation on the gene expression profile of B16-F10 melanoma cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The effect of TIM-3 stimulation was studied on B16F10 mouse melanoma cells, in vitro.

DESIGN
Cy3: B16F10 mouse melanoma cells, treated by unspecific goat IgG (control) for 2 hours. Cy5: B16F10 mouse melanoma cells, in vitro, treated by an agonist goat polyclonal anti-mouse TIM3 antibody (RnD Systems) for 2 hours. Four biological replicates were used (in this study, biological replicate means different passage numbers of the same cell line). In each case, the treated sample (Cy5) was compared to its control one (Cy3) in Agilent dual-color microarray experiments.

PLATFORM
