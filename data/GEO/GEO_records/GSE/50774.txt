TITLE
DNA methylation alteration and gene expression sigature in brainstem, thalamic, and supratentorial gliomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gliomas arising in the brainstem and thalamus are devastating tumors that are difficult to surgically resect due to their proximity to eloquent brain structures. Here, we performed a comprehesive genomic and epigenomic study, using gene expression and methylation microarrays, to research on th different genomic and epigenetic signatures between brainstem, thalamic, and supratentorial gliomas.

DESIGN
Comparison of brainstem, thalamic and supratentorial gliomas
