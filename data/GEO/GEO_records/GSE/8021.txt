TITLE
Expression data from human donor lung biopsies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profile of human donor lungs that have developed primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after lung transplantation and those that have not. In this study, we attempt to further our understanding of PGD by observing the changes in gene expression across donor lungs that developed PGD versus those that did not. Keywords: stress response
