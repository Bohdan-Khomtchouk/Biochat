TITLE
Expression data from human donor lung biopsies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profile of human donor lungs that have developed primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after lung transplantation and those that have not. In this study, we attempt to further our understanding of PGD by observing the changes in gene expression across donor lungs that developed PGD versus those that did not. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
The 50 donor lung samples were divided into two groups - those that developed PGD after transplantation (PGD positive) and those that did not (PGD negative). PGD was defined as T0 Grade III dysfunction according to International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria, that is, a ratio (referred to as the P/F ratio) of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) less than 200 in the first arterial blood gas in the intensive care unit after transplantation (generally 4-6 hours after actual reperfusion).
