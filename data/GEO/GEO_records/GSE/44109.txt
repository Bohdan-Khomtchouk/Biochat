TITLE
Actinonin induced changes in gene expression profiles in MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retrograde signaling induced remodelling of nuclear gene expression from mitochondrial ribosomal dysfunction was analyzed. Global expression profile changes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts were assesed under actinonin treatment 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours post drug addiction.

DESIGN
Control and four different time points with two labels and two replicates each
