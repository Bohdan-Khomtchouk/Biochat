TITLE
Host response and dysfunction in the CNS during chronic simian immunodeficiency virus infection

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Molecular basis for CNS dysfunction in simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus monkeys. We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes in chronic simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus monkeys.

DESIGN
Frontal lobe samples were obtained from control and SIV infected animals for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to better understand the gene that changes in gene expression with SIV infection in the frontal lobe.
