TITLE
The transcriptional landscape of basidiosporogenesis in mature Pisolithus microcarpus basidiocarp

ORGANISM
Pisolithus microcarpus

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from Pisolithus microcarpus basidiocarp compartments.   Unconsolidated, young, and mature peridioles, as well as internal and free spores from three basidiocaps were harvested and used for RNA extraction.   Paired-end reads of 100 bp were generated and aligned to Pisolithus microcarpus ( http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Pismi1/Pismi1.home.html ) reference transcripts using CLC Genomics Workbench 7.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Pisolithus microcarpus basidiocarp compartments were generated  by Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing (2x100bp). Three biological replicates were sequenced from unconsolidated, young, and mature peridioles, as well as internal and free spores.
