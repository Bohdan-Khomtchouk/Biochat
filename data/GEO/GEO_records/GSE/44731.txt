TITLE
Differential miRNA profiles of pregnancy tissue in ectopic pregnancies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Abstract Objective: To investigate the physiology of ectopic pregnancy by analyzing the miRNA profiles of the pregnancy tissue from both ectopic and control pregnancies (voluntary termination of pregnancy). Design: Research study. Setting: Academic research institute in collaboration with a university hospital. Patients: Patients suffering from tubal EP and patients with a normal ongoing pregnancy scheduled for a voluntary termination of pregnancy (VTOP) were recruited. Interventions: Pregnancy tissue samples were analyzed by miRNA microarray and further validated by qPCR. Main Outcome measures: Gene expression profiles and quantitative PCR measurements. Results: Four miRNAs were found to be downregulated in EP compared to healthy trophoblast tissue, and three miRNAs were upregulated in EP trophoblast compared to control tissue samples. All genes were validated by q-PCR. We found three statistically significant miRNAs, all of which were upregulated in the EP sample group. Conclusion: We describe the alteration of seven miRNAs in EP samples that could alter pathways which are critical for correct implantation such as extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, or mucin biosynthesis, thus resulting in ectopic pregnancies.

DESIGN
This study was authorized by the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee of the Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain. Eight patients suffering from tubal EP and another eight patients with a normal ongoing pregnancy scheduled for a VTOP were recruited.
