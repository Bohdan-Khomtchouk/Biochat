TITLE
Gene expression profile of classical Hodgkin lymphoma according to Epstein-Barr infection status

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Human Hodkin Lymphoma lineages infected or not by Epstein Baar Virus (EBV).  We compared EBV infected lineage L591 and not EBV infected lineages L428, L1236 and KMH2.  Goal was to determine presence versus absence of EBV infection on global gene expression of Hodkin Lymphoma cell lines.
