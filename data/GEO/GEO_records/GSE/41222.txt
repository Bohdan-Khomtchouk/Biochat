TITLE
Deciphering the genetics of mammalian limb growth

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have used DGE-SAGE, a digital transcriptomics tool, to determine the expression profile of E14.5 mouse forelimbs and hindlimbs. The forelimb, hindlimb developmental lag combined with the analysis of these datasets allow us a better insight into the dynamics of the limb growth genetic network, in particular the characterisation of genes that are differentially expressed and are putative modulators of limb growth and or candidates for limb malformation syndromes. Conclusions: The datasets and results presented in this study allow us to extend the current knowledge of the limb development and constitute an extremely relevant resource for research into the genetics of organ growth and thus ontogenesis.

DESIGN
