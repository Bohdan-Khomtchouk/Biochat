TITLE
LIN-42, the Caenorhabditis elegans PERIOD homolog, negatively regulates microRNA transcription

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq analysis of LIN-42 from extracts obtained from staged late L4 hermaphrodites. We found 413 high confidence peaks that are predominately found at promoter regions and transcription start sites of mRNA and microRNA genes.

DESIGN
ChIP assays using a functional GFP tagged transgene of LIN-42 using an anti-GFP antibody, as well as using an antibody raised agans the endogenous LIN-42 protein.

PLATFORM
