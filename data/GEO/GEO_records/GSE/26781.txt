TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of cellular SMD or NMD substrates that regulated by Upf1 or PNRC2 in HeLa cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of cellular SMD or NMD substrates that regulated by Upf1 and/or PNRC2 in HeLa cell. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that endogenous SMD or NMD substrates may co-regulated by Upf1 and PNRC2. Results provide important information that vast range of cellular SMD or NMD substrates are reqired PNRC2 for decay.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HeLa cells with downregulation of Upf1 or PNRC2 by siRNA. The up- or down-regulated transcripts were compare to control siRNA treated HeLa cell RNA extract. Significant transcripts were confirmed by replication
