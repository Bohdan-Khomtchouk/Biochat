TITLE
Effect of conditional deletion of S6 ribosomal protein following partial hepatectomy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Deletion of the RPS6 gene in mouse liver results in the inhibition of 40S ribosome biogenesis and the failure of hepatocytes to enter S-phase following partial hepatectomy. This microarray experiment was designed to assess the effects of RPS6 deletion on the expression of genes involved in liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy. Keywords: time course, liver

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from mouse livers at different time-points following partial hepatectomy. Conditional deletion of the RPS6 gene was perfomed by injecting polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid in mice harbouring a floxed version of the RPS6 gene and a cre recombinase under the regulation of an interferon responsive promoter (MX-CRE). The mice used a control have also a floxed version of the RPS6 gene but lack the cre recombinaste transgene.
