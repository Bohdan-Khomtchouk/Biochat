TITLE
Expression data from melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression analysis of parental and resistant sub-lines of melanoma cell lines treated or untreated with PLX4032 Using microarray we sought to obtain a genome-wide profile of differentially expressed genes in parental melanoma cell lines and resistant sub-lines in response to PLX4032 vs DMSO control treatment.

DESIGN
Representative parental melanoma cell lines and resistant sub-lines were treated with PLX4032 at 1 uM or DMSO control for 6h. Total RNA was extracted and cDNAs were generated and hybridized onto GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix).
