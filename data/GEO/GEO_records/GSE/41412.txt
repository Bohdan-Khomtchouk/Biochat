TITLE
Gene expression data in mouse fetal lungs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray data of mouse postnatal lungs between day 1 and 6 weeks of age. The results provide a general insight into the gene expression profile during the alveolar phase of lung development.

DESIGN
We obtained lung tissue of healthy postnatal mice, 4-5 replicates at each time point. Time points were day1, day4, day7, day14, and day 42.
