TITLE
Gene expression changes during murine mucosal mast cell in vitro differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to find novel genes highly upregulated in mouse mucosal mast cells. To carry it out, differentiating progenitor cells were isolated on day4 of culturing and compared to mature mucosal mast cells obtained by day20. Keywords: cell differentiation stage comparison

DESIGN
The experiment was carried out on two microarrays. Array2 is a biological and technical replicate (dye-swap) of array1. In both cases, 3-3 samples were pooled, but of different origin.
