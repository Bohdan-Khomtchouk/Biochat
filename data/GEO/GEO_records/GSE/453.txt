TITLE
fhCMV-H vs fhCMV-T

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) strains with different in vivo and in vitro characteristics may induce different patterns of cellular gene expression. CMV strain fhCMV-H, which spreads rapidly through cell culture, was isolated from a hematopoetic stem cell transplant patient who died of CMV-mediated marrow failure. In contrast  fhCMV-T was isolated from a patient who survived CMV complications and does not spread rapidly in vitro. Fibroblasts were infected with both strains, which had been engineered to express GFP upon cellular infection, and the cellular gene expression profile was compared to that of noninfected controls at 24h.  The gene expression profile of HFF exposed to UV-inactivated virus from the 2 strains was also tested, to differentiate the effects of the initial engagement with virus coat proteins such as glycoprotein B and gene modulation by active virus. Keywords = cytomegalovirus, glycoprotein B Keywords: repeat sample
