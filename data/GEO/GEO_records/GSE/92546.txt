TITLE
Transposon mutagenesis of the Zika virus genome highlights regions essential for RNA replication and restricted for immune evasion

ORGANISM
Zika virus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq of Zika virus libraries

DESIGN
To investigate Zika virus (ZIKV) genetic flexibility, we used transposon mutagenesis to add 15-nucleotide insertions throughout the MR766 ZIKV genome and deep sequenced the viable genomes. The ZIKV transposon library was constructed and rescued as described before: Heaton, N.S., Sachs, D., Chen,C.J., Hai, R., and Palese, P. (2013).
