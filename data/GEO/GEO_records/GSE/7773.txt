TITLE
Foxp3-dependent programme of regulatory T-cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
Thymocyte RNA (GSE7770) was processed with Affy and Enzo reagents whereas peripheral cell RNA (GSE7280) was processed with Ambion reagents, which amplified the cRNA more robustly. As a result, the two data sets don't normalize very well to each other and shouldn't be compared directly to each other.
