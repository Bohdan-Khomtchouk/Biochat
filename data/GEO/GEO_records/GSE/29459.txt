TITLE
Expression data from human cord blood CD34+ CD38- cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to observe the global gene expression in hematopoietic stem and projenitor cells during ex vivo culture with DMSO (Blank) or with Garcinol (GAR) and identified distinct classes of up or down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
CD34+ cells were cultured ex vivo with DMSO (Blank) or with Garcinol (GAR) for 7 days. CD34+ CD38- cells were sorted from cultured cells (blank and GAR) with a FACS and total RNA were extracted from the sorted cells (blank and GAR), respectively. Blank represents a control sample.
