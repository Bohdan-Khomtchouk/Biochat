TITLE
Expression data from phenotypically discordant monozygotic twin lymphoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human intelligence demonstrates one of the highest heritabilities among human quantitative traits. Phenotypically discordant monozygotic twins provide a way to identify loci responsible for normal-range intelligence. We conducted array-based genome-wide gene expression analysis aiming to identify genes displaying significant difference among monozygotic twin pairs manifesting between-co-twins IQ differences.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and applied to Affymetirx arrays after reverse transcription. 17 twin pairs (34 subjects) were recruited in this study.
