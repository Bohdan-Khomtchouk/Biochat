TITLE
Expression data from adult Shh-responding astroglia cells in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signals via Gli transcription factors to promote maintenance and proliferation of neural stem cells in the adult mouse forebrain.  We have analyzed the gene expression pattern in neurogenic Shh-responding astroglia (= neural stem cells ) in the subventicular zone of the lateral ventricle and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in comparison to the non-neurogenic Shh-responding glia (=Bergman glia) in the cerebellum to identify the genes specifically involved in neurogenic function downstream of Shh signaling. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from FACS-sorted Gli1+ GFAP+ cells from microdissected SVZ, hippocampus and cerebellum. GFAP expression is based on hGFAP-GFP reporter line and Gli1 expression is lineage marked using Gli1-CreER;ROSA26-tdTomato mice.

DESIGN
15 Total samples were analyzed. We compared expression levels of SVZ vs. Cerebellum, Hippocampus vs. Cerebelllum to identify genes which had more than 4 fold change in expression levels with p < 0.01. From this  narrowed list, we compared between SVZ and Hippocampus to identify the common genes up and down regulated.  In addition, we also identified commonly expressed genes in hippocampus and SVZ at high level.
