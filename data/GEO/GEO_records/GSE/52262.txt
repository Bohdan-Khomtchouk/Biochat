Expression data of CD24-CD44+ and ALDH+ cells

SUMMARY
It has been suggested that breast cancers are driven and maintained by a cellular subpopulation with stem cell properties. These breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) mediate metastasis and by virtue of their resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, contribute to relapse.  Although several BCSC markers have been described, it is unclear whether these markers identify the same or independent BCSC populations. Based on established breast cancer cell lines, as well as primary tumor xenografts, we show that BCSCs exist in distinct mesenchymal-like (epithelial-mesenchymal transition, EMT) and epithelial-like (mesenchymal-epithelial transition, MET) states characterized by expression of distinct markers, proliferative capacity and invasive characteristics. The gene expression profiles of mesenchymal-like and epithelial-like BCSCs are remarkably similar across the different molecular subtypes of breast cancer and resemble those of distinct basal and luminal stem cells found in the normal breast. We propose that the plasticity of BCSCs allowing them to transition between EMT- and MET-like states endows these cells with the capacity for tissue invasion, dissemination and growth at metastatic sites.

DESIGN
Breast cancer cell lines, primary xenografts and normal breast cells from patient were sorted using flow cytometry to select for cells that were CD24-,CD44+ and ALDH+. Gene expression profiles of CD24-CD44+ cells were compared with non-CD24-CD44+ cells. Gene expression profiles of ALDH+ cells were compared with ALDH- cells.
