TITLE
Testing the effects of nitric oxide (oxidative) stress on Caulobacter transcription

ORGANISM
Caulobacter vibrioides

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to measure the effects of nitric oxide exposure (using DETA NONOate as a nitric oxide donor) on transcription in Caulobacter.

DESIGN
Untreated Caulobacter crescentus were grown to a density of 0.3 (at OD660) in PYE medium (pH 7) in rolled culture tubes.  DETA-NONOate treated  Caulobacter crescentus were grown to a density of 0.3 (at OD660), and then treated with 100 mM DETA NONOate for 30 minutes.
