TITLE
Gene expression signatures for mESC treated by RNAi strategy on down regulation of gene  Mtf2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further explore the function of Mtf2, the homolog of Drosophila Polycomb group gene PCL, we have employed the mouse whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes mediated by Mtf2. Oligos of 2 different RNAi target sites on gene Mtf2 were cloned into RNAi Vector pSuper and transfected individually into Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell line E14. Empty Vector pSuper and plasmid containing RNAi target against gene Luciferase (Firefly) were performed in the same way as negative controls. The down regulation effect of gene Mtf2 was quantified by real-time PCR in the same RNA samples subjected to microarray analysis.

DESIGN
mESC was transfected by RNAi plasmids with resistence of puromycin and selected by Puromycin(1mg/ml) for 2 days. 4 independent experiments were performed for vector pSuper, plasimd pSuper-Luci-RNAi, pSuper-Mtf2-RNAi-1, pSuper-Mtf2-RNAi-3.
