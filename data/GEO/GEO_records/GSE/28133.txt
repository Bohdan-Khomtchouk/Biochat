TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of human retinal detachment (RD) reveals both inflammation and photoreceptor death

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used surgical specimens to perform a differential analysis of the transcriptome of human retinal tissues following detachment. Data analysis reveals major involvement of the immune response in the disease and interindividual variation was monitored to unravel a second crucial aspect of the pathological process, the death of photoreceptor cells.

DESIGN
In total 38 surgical specimens (samples) were analyzed, 19 represent biopsies from patients with retinal detachment (RD) and 19 represent contral samples without retinal detachment.
