TITLE
Salmonella wild type and mutant sdiA in LB and 2mM indole

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 wild type and deletion of the sdiA regulator-encoding gene grown to OD600=1 in LB alone or in LB supplemented with 2mM indole. The goal is to determine Salmonella response to indole and to define the SdiA-regulated genes in these conditions.

DESIGN
4 different conditions tested (wild type in LB, wild type in LB + 2mM indole, sdiA mutant in LB, sdiA mutant in LB + 2mM indole), 4 replicates for each condition. The reference on each hybridisation is the chromosomal DNA of the wild type strain.
