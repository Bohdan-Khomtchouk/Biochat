TITLE
Investigating RDX neurotoxicity in rat brain using gene expression analysis and transcriptional network modeling

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
ABSTRACT: The central nervous system is remarkably plastic in its ability to recover from trauma. We examined recovery from hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitrotriazine  (RDX) induced seizures in rat through changes in transcriptional networks. Transcriptional networks from time series experiments provide a good basis for organizing and studying the dynamic behavior of biological processes. The goal of this work was to identify networks affected by chemical exposure and track changes in these networks as animals recover. We examined brain microarray data from rats exposed to 0, 1.2, 12, 24, and 47 mg RDX/kg body weight at different time points after exposure (24hr, 48hr, 7d, 14d, 28d and 90d).  RESULTS  A credible transcriptional network was constructed from the gene expression microarray data, which predicts the role of some key genes such as heat shock proteins, neuropeptide Y, thyrotropin-releasing hormones, growth factors, and ion channels in neurotransmission and neuroprotective mechanisms. Examination of the dynamic changes in expression within this network over time provided insight into CNS protective mechanisms from traumas.

DESIGN
Single RDX Exposure with Various Time Points, Brain Tissue Investigation:  Sprague-Dawley female rats were exposed to a single oral gavage of one of four concentrations of RDX or vehicle control with sampling periods of 24h, 48h, 7d, 14d, 28d, or 90d.  Brain tissue was investigated for differential expression in response to RDX exposure and provide insight into CNS protective mechanisms associated with RDX exposure.
