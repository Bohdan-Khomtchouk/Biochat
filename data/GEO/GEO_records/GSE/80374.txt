TITLE
RNA sequencing of sheep infraspinatus muscle after tendon release and repair under concomitant nandrolone administration

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Transcripts were measured in infraspinatus muscle before (PRE) and after 16 weeks of tendon release (TR) and 6 weeks of subsequent repair (END) in the operated and contralateral (END-CC) muscle. A group of animals received intramuscular injections of nandrolone starting with the surgery (N22W). In another group injection of nandrolone was started at the time of tendon repair (N6W). The CONTROL group received no nandrolone.

DESIGN
Eighteen two-year-old female Swiss Alpine sheep were subjected to release of the infraspinatus tendon in three interventional groups of six animals each (CONTROL, N22W, N6W). After 16 weeks, repair was performed in all groups by reattaching the tendon to the greater tuberosity. N22W received weekly injections of 150mg nandrolone decanoate starting immediately after tendon release. N6W received weekly intramuscular injections of 150mg nandrolone decanoate starting at the time of tendon repair. Prior to tendon release (PRE), 16 weeks after tendon release at tendon repair (TR), 6 weeks after repair (END) and in contralateral control muscle at the end of the experiment (END-CC), biopsies were collected from the operated infraspinatus muscle. Biopsies were subjected to the characterization of muscle composition and transcript expression.
