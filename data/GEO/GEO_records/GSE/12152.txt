TITLE
Genome scale transcriptome analysis of shoot organogenesis in poplar

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
Regeneration of transgenic cells remains a major obstacle to research and commercial deployment of transgenic plants for most species. Our aims are to improve knowledge of gene regulatory circuits important to meristem organization, and to identify regulatory genes that might be useful for improving the efficiency of regeneration during transformation. We analyzed gene expression during poplar regeneration using an Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® array representing over 56,000 poplar transcripts. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
We focused on callus induction and shoot formation, thus sample RNAs were collected from tissues: prior to callus induction, 3 days and 15 days after callus induction, and 3 days and 8 days after the start of shoot induction. Two biological replicates were used for each of the five time points.
