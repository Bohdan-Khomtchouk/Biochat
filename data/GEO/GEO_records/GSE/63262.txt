TITLE
iCLIP seq reveals distribution of genome-wide SR protein-RNA binding

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We identified the precise genome-wide binding sites for all SR proteins, using iCLIP-seq

DESIGN
SR proteins were encoded on stable transgenes, transfected in S2 cells, FLAG-tag immunopurified, and the bound RNA purified and subjected to RNA-seq.  The resulting reads (CLIP tags) were aligned to the Drosophila genome and generated 38,695-5,900,000 unique CLIP tags for each SR-protein replicate.
