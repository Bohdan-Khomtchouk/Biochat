TITLE
Asf1/HIRA facilitate global histone deacetylation and associate with HP1 to promote nucleosome occupancy at heterochromatic loci (expression)

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Expression profile of Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome  in asf1-1 and âˆ†hip1 cells. Expression profile of mutant cells compared to wild-type cells.

DESIGN
Agilent 60mer oligonucleotide custom array containing probes spanning large portion of chromosome 2 at 50bp resolution was used to profile expression levels in mutant cells and to compare them to levels in wild-type cells.
