TITLE
Mitochondrial biogenesis induced by PGC-1alpha

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray time-course of mouse myotubes transduced with the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1alpha, which is known to induce mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle cells. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Cultured mouse myoblasts (C2C12 cells) were differentiated into myotubes and on day 3 were infected with an adenovirus expressing either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or PGC-1alpha.  Gene expression was measured at three time points (days 0, 1, 2, 3) in biological triplicate.
