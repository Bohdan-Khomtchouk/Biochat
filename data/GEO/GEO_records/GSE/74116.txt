TITLE
Chinese lung ADC adjacent normal sample exon-level expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chinese lung ADC adjacent normal sample exon-level expression

DESIGN
In order to search for novel gene fusions which may play important roles in lung ADC initiation and progression, we performed Exon array on lung ADC and adjacent normal samples.
