TITLE
Gene expression profile of in vitro produced bovine blastocyst with and without Thyroid hormone supplementation

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Bovine IVP blastocysts (day 8) were produced with and without thyroid hormones and gene expression profiles were compared.

DESIGN
The IVC media (SOF) was supplemented with 50ng/ml of each T3 and T4. Four independent IVF run, each gave 1 control and 1 treated sample. Each sample is a pool of 5 blastocyst. Total Rna was extracted from each sample, amplified, labeled (also with dye swap) and hybridized to the EmbryoGene custom Agilent array (GPL13226). FlexArray software was used for data analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL13226 Agilent-028298 Embryogene Bovine 45K microarray
