TITLE
cDNA microarray analysis of splenic B220+CD138+ plasma cells from K/BxNsf and K/BxN mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) develop under the help of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells and reside mainly in the bone marrow. However, these cells are unusually abundant in the spleen of several autoimmune models including K/BxNsf mice, yet their pathogenic impact remains unknown. To investigate a previously unappreciated role of splenic LLPCs, we sorted splenic plasma cells (PCs) from K/BxNsf and K/BxN mice, corresponding to LLPCs and conventional short-lived PCs, respectively, and compared their transcriptomes.

DESIGN
The B220+CD138+ fraction from K/BxNsf and their control K/BxN mice were sorted by FACSariaIII.
