TITLE
Identification of putative targets of AP3/PI

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify genes regulated by AP3/PI, we carried out microarray experiments using an Arabidopsis whole genome GeneChip array (ATH1 GeneChip, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) in conjunction with an inducible AP3-GR system. For these experiments, we used 35S::AP3-GR transgenic plants in a 35S::PI, ap3-3 null mutant background for various dex or mock treatments. RNA was extracted from inflorescences at 0 and 4 hours after dex or a mock treatment and used as probes for our microarray experiments. Three biological replicates of each were hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays. We used the Affymetrix Microarray Suite software (MAS) to identify genes whose expression profiles changed only after dex-treatment and are likely targets of AP3/PI. Keywords: time course
