TITLE
Single-cell RNA-seq reveals dynamic paracrine control of cellular variation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we use a microfluidics-based approach to prepare single-cell RNA-Seq libraries from over 1,700 primary mouse dendritic cells (DCs) stimulated with three pathogenic components and examine variation between individual cells exposed to the same stimulus and general strategies that multicellular populations use to establish complex dynamic responses.

DESIGN
RNA seq libraries from 1775 single cells and population controls with SMARTer

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus) GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
