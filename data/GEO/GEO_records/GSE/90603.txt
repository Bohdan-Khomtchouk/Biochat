TITLE
miRNA Expression data from Glioblastoma Multiforme patient tumor samples, healthy brain tissue (partly from GBM patients) and NHA cell line and Human fetal astrocyte cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although glioblastoma multiforme is a common brain tumor, there is a need to elucidate underlying mechanisms behind its initiation and progression and identifying key molecular pathways for improving treatment. Here, we used combined miRNA-mRNA transcriptome analysis to discover novel genes and networks in GBM

DESIGN
16 fresh-frozen glioblastoma multiforme samples and 7 healthy brain tissues were analyzed by using miRNA and whole transcriptome microarray chips. Data was filtered and analyzed
