TITLE
Evaluation of CGH changes in different metastatic populations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For many breast cancer (BCa) patients, symptomatic bone metastases appear after years or even decades of latency. How metastatic cells disseminate, and how micromet­astatic lesions remain dormant and undetectable, are major questions in cancer research. Here we identify and func­tionally analyse a molecular mechanism involved in the bone metastatic latency of estrogen receptor (ER)+ BCa.

DESIGN
Cells growing in the mouse for 170 days were compared with the initial population using Human CGH 3x720K Whole Genome Tiling 3.0 array

PLATFORM
GPL22785 HG18 WG CGH Nimblegen array
