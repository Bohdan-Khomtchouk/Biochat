TITLE
Expression data from embryonic rat kidney timepoints and a budded WD-MM recombination tissue

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Here we compared the expression of an engineered kidney tissue, created by recombining an in vitro budded Wolffian duct with fresh E13 metanephric mesenchyme, with that of three in vivo rat embryonic kidney timepoints (E13, E18, and week 4) Keywords: time course

DESIGN
The global gene expression of recombined tissue (non-branched in vitro-formed UBs and MM) was analyzed and compared to the gene expression of early, late, and post developmental kidneys in order to determine whether normal developmental pathways were being followed. Genes with at least a 3-fold difference in expression between any of the 4 conditions (E13, E18, Wk4, recombined tissue) were analyzed and grouped into one of ten expression patterns. The expression of each group of genes was analyzed in the recombined tissue to compare the recombined tissue gene expression levels to the three in vivo time points.
