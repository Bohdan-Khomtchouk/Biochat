TITLE
A fully validated blood stem/progenitor cell regulatory network reveals mechanisms of cell state stabilisation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to determine the genomic binding sites of important haematopoietic transcription factors in haematopoietic cell lines.

DESIGN
416Bs cells were fixed with either 1 or 0.4 % formaldehyde for 10 mins. Chromatin was isolated, sonicated for 7 mins (30 sec on, 30 sec off), and specific antibodies were used to pull down the transcription factors of interest after a pre-clearing step. Chromatin was washed, de-crosslinked, amplified, size selected by gel purification and sequenced.

PLATFORM
