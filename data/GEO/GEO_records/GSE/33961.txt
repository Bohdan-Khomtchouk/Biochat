TITLE
miRNA array in  colorectal carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To search for potential miRNAs associated with prognosis in colorectal carcinoma, miRNA expression profiles were analyzed in patients with stage III colorectal carcinoma. miRNA expression levels were compared between long and short time survival after surgery with standard chemotherapy.

DESIGN
Two groups of colorectal carcinoma tissues for miRNA array. Long time (L) survival (â‰¥5 years) group and short time survival (S) ( < 5 years) group.
