TITLE
Transcriptomic profile of the homeodomain protein CEH-23 under mitochondrial ETC stress in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profile of the homeodomain protein CEH-23 under mitochondrial ETC stress in C. elegans by comparing gene expression profile between isp-1(qm150) vs. ceh-23(ms23);isp-1(qm150) mutants

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, isp-1(qm150) and ceh-23(ms23);isp-1(qm150): 3 biological replicate and 1 technical dye-flip replicate. Synchronized mid-L4 staged worms grown at 20C on 10cm NGM plates with seeded OP50 E. coli were collected for the experiments

PLATFORM
GPL10094 Agilent-020186 C. elegans (V2) Gene Expression Microarray (Feature Number version)
