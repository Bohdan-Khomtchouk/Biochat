TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of the rat adipose tissue response to TCDD

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rodents exposed to the environmental contaminant, TCDD, suffer from a number of acute and chronic toxicities, including lethality and a wasting syndrome. Hypothesizing that the wasting syndrome may be caused by changes in adipose tissue -- either in its hormonal regulation or in homeostatic effects -- we profiled the transcriptional response of rat white adipose to TCDD. We employed two separate rat strains: the Long-Evans strain is sensitive to TCDD toxicities while the Han/Wistar strain is over four orders of magnitude more resistant. One day after TCDD exposure few genes were altered in either strain, but after four days a modest number of transcriptional alterations were observed. Strikingly, TCDD had far fewer effects than did a feed-restriction protocol intended to mimic the wasting syndrome itself. Notably several classic TCDD-responsive genes were modulated at all time-points, including Cyp1a1, Cyp1b1, and Nqo1. We therefore concluded that rat adipose tissue is unlikely to be the primary driver of the wasting syndrome, and that another tissue is likely involved.
