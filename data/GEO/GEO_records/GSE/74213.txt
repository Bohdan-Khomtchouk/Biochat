TITLE
Global gene expression changes associated with miR-375 overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine gene expression changes assoicated with miR-375 overexpression, MCC26 (merkel cell carcinoma cell line) were transfected with 5nM of miR-375 mimics. RNA was isolated 72 hours post-transfection and subjected to gene expression analysis using Agilent human 4X44 whole genome microarrays. Analysis was performed on microarray data corresponding to two independent experiments (n=2)

DESIGN
5nM of mirVana miR-375 or neg cntrl mimics (Invitrogen) was transfected into MCC26 cells using lipofectamine 2000. Cells apporimately 30% confluence when transfected and RNA was collected 72 hours post-transfection. miR-375 overexpression was confirmed, and then RNA was subjected to whole genome microarray analysis using Agilent human 4x44 chip. Experiment was repeated (n=2).

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
