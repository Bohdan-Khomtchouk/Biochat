SUMMARY
0dpa Fibre vs epidermal laser capture microdisection comparison Keywords: Development

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from each cell type (fibre initial or non-fibre epidermal pavement cell) from both Plant 1 and Plant 2.  Hence, there were two biological replicates of each cell-type.  Sub-samples of each cell type, designated here as technical replicates, were taken as separate batches of cells from different groups of ovules, but each from the same pair of plants.  In particular, there were four sub-samples of fibre initial cells from plant 1 and two from plant 2 and two sub-samples of non-fibre epidermal from plant 1 and four from plant 2. The complete experiment involved three dye-swap pairs using a total of 6 arrays.
