TITLE
Analysis of circulating microRNAs in adrenocortical tumours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential diagnosis of adrenocortical adenoma and carcinoma is of pivotal clinical relevance, as the prognosis and clinical management of benign and malignant adrenocortical tumours is entirely different. Circulating microRNAs are promising biomarker candidates of malignancy in several tumours. In the present study we investigate circulating microRNAs in adrenocortical tumours and to evaluate their potential applicability as biomarkers of malignancy.

DESIGN
For the miRNA profiling, 8 preoperative plasma samples obtained from patients with adrenocortical adenomas and carcinomas and were studied by microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL8786 [miRNA-1] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-1 Array
