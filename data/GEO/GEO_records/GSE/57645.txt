TITLE
Gene expression profile of rice leaf from selected cultivars

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
The genome structrure of domesticated species is influenced by complexity of breeding practices exercised by humans. Hokkaido is the northern-most regio of Japan, and one of northern limit of rice cultivation of world. The climatic conditions of Hokkaido are considered to be unsuitable for rice cultivation. Rice breeding programs of Hokkaido have focused on adaptability to specific local environmental condiitons (such as short growth period, low temperature conditions). These specific selection pressures have generated the unique genetic structures of Hokkaido rice cultivars. The genotype of sixty-three Hokkaido rice varieties were already analyzed by SSR marker, and the results showed that Hokkaido rice varieties were classified into six groups (Shinada et al, 2014). The unique genomic structures of six groups may have related to specific gene expression. This study analyze the gene expression profiles of Hokkaido rice variety.

DESIGN
Akage, Hayayuki, Sorachi, Yukara, Norin No15, Hoshinoyume and Kitaake are classified into group I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, V and V, respectively. Full-expanded third leaf blade was used for this study. Biological replicates; 2 (Yukara, Kitaake) , 3 (Akage, Hayayuki, Sorachi, Norin No.15, Hoshinoyume). 1 samples derived from 5 plants grown under same conditons

PLATFORM
