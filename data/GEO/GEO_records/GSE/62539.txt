TITLE
Barley leaf dark-induced senescence

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Time-course transcriptional profiling of senescing barley leaves. In this model, the senescence process was induced by continued incubation of the seedlings in darkness. Plant samples for the expression analysis were collected before senescence induction (Day 0) and after 3,7 and 10 days of incubation in the dark. The goal was to find the genes differentially expressed during the senescence process . Additionally, a list of the genes with the invariant expression was generated as a resource for selecting references suitable for qPCR or ddPCR experiments.

DESIGN
Time-course experiment, two-color, common reference design. All of the data were obtained from material collected in three independent, time-separated leaf senescing experiments (biological replicates). In each replicate, samples from senescing leaves (3 Days, 7 Days, 10 Days) were compared to samples collected before the senescence induction (Day 0). 3 biological replicates.Cy5-labeled samples of interest (Day 0, Day 3, Day 7 and Day 10 from each biological replicate) were each hybridized against a Cy3-labeled common reference (RNA pool of all samples) on a total of 12 microarrays.
