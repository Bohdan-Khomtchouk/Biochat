TITLE
normal human CFTR overexpression in mouse lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of Genes Responsive to the Expression of Normal Human CFTR Keywords: genotype comparison

DESIGN
To discern the effects of increased expression of normal human CFTR, lung mRNA levels were assessed in mice expressing the normal human CFTR cDNA under control of the Sftpc gene promoter in respiratory epithelial cells of adult mice. Triplicate samples from SP-C-hCFTRtg/tg, SP-C-hCFTRtg/-, and wild type mice were compared.
