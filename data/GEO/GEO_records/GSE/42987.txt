TITLE
Hippocampal expression data from WT, KO, R270X, and G273X mice at 4 and 9 weeks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mecp2 loss-of-function has been associated with altered gene expression in many tissues. We characterized gene expression changes within the hippocampi of 3 different Mecp2 loss-of-function mouse models. These studies were used to identify transcriptional differences between these mutants when the mice are largely asymptomatic (4 weeks of age) or have developed overt phenotypes (9 weeks).

DESIGN
Hippocampal expression data from WT (Mecp2+/y), KO (Mecp2-/y), R270X (Mecp2-/y,R270XTg), and G273X (Mecp2-/y,G273XTg) mice at 4 and 9 weeks At total of 32 microarrays were performed: 4 animals of each genotype at both 4 weeks and 9 weeks of age.
