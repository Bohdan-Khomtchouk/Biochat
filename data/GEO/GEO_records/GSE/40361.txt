TITLE
Gene expression profiles for hyperglycemia induced tumors and mammary glands compared to those in euglycemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hyperglycemia-induced tumor progression at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that hyperglycemia contributes to tumor growth and metastasis. Results provide important information of the response of hyperglycemia, such as specific NRG1 pathways, HER2-3 pathways, NF-kB pathways and anti-apoptotic related genes, up- or down-regulated.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from tumor tissues of 10-week-old PyMT/PANIC and PyMT mice as well as mammary glands of 10-week-old PANIC-ATTAC and WT mice.
