TITLE
Gene expression profiling of cell lines derived from classical Hodgkin lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hodgkin lymphoma is derived from germinal center / post-germinal center B cells.

DESIGN
To determine differentially expressed genes between Hodgkin Reed Sternberg cells and their presumed cell of origin we investigated the expression profiles of 5 commonly used Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines as compared to reactive germinal centers.
