TITLE
BCLAF1 Chip-chip control (siGFP) and BRCA1 depleted (siBRCA1) 293T cells in the absense or presense of Etoposide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BCLAF1 is a serine-arginine (SR) protein implicated in transcriptional regulation and mRNA splicing.  We have recently identified BCLAF1 as part of a novel mRNA splicing complex that is recruited to different genetic promoters by the breast cancer susceptiblity protein, BRCA1 in response to DNA damage. This ChIP-chip study was designed to identify genes/promoters regulated by the BRCA1/BCLAG1 mRNA splicing complex by identifying promoters bound by BCLAF1 in the absense and presense of BRCA1 in control cells and cells treated with etoposide to induce DNA damage.  This study includes tripicate BCLAF1 ChIP-chip experiments in untreated and etoposide treated (1uM 16 hours) control cells (siGFP) and cells depleted of BRCA1 (siBRCA1).

DESIGN
Chromatin Immunoprecipitaitons were performed in triplicate with BCLAF1 antibodies in control 293T cells transfected with siGFP siRNAs and BRCA1 siRNAs (siBRCA1 to deplete BRCA1).  Immunoprecipitated genomic DNA was labelled with Cy3 and Input genomic DNA was labelled with Cy5 and hybridized to NimbleGen human 3x720k RefSeq promoter arrays to identify BCLAF1 boundgenomic DNA regions.
