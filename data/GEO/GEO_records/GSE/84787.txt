TITLE
Human gastric cancer_Tumor samples_Paired normal samples_10 replicates

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the lncRNA profiles of gastric cancer samples, we performed microarray analysis using tumor samples and paired normal samples. 66 lncRNAs were statistically dysregulated more than 2-fold.

DESIGN
The samples were divided into two groups, paired normal samples (negative control group_Rep10) and tumor samplea (Experiment group_Rep10).
