TITLE
Gene expression profiles in leaves of rice plants treated with plant-activators in field

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Plant-activator is known as a chemical inducer to activate disease resistances in plants without direct antibacterial activities. To identify plant-activator responsive genes, we analyzed temporal expression changes of the genes when treated with some plant-activators (e.g., isotianil and probenazole) in Japonica rice cv. Nipponbare in a field at Tsukuba in Japan.
