TITLE
Gene expression profiles in leaves of rice plants treated with plant-activators in field

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Plant-activator is known as a chemical inducer to activate disease resistances in plants without direct antibacterial activities. To identify plant-activator responsive genes, we analyzed temporal expression changes of the genes when treated with some plant-activators (e.g., isotianil and probenazole) in Japonica rice cv. Nipponbare in a field at Tsukuba in Japan.

DESIGN
The submitted samples were field transcriptome data in rice leaves obtained from chemical treatment experiments. In a paddy field experiment, leaf samples were harvested before treatments (0 day) and in 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30 days after treatments, respectively. Leaf samples from plants transplanted in containers placed in the field were harvested in 1 and 3 days after treatments, respectively.
