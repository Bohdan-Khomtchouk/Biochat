TITLE
Gene expression profile analysis in myelodysplastic syndromes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The pathogenesis-related signaling pathways in MDS could be screened using high throughput bioinformatics analysis based on the gene expression profile network. Here, we tried to identify the mRNAs-regulated pathways through a mRNA microarray in CD34+ cells from MDS patients.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile analysis was performed in 12 MDS patients and 6 normal controls using GeneChip® PrimeView™ Human Gene Expression Array, and diffirential genes were identified.

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
