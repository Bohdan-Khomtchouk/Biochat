TITLE
SVG cells infected with Zika virus for 24, 48 and 72 hr post infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human astrocyte cells (SVG) infected with Zika virus. Goal was to identify temporal changes in gene expression post infected by Zika virus.

DESIGN
Triplicates were pooled and compared between infected and control cells at each time point. A total of 3 time points were investigated (24, 48 and 72 hours post infection). Dye swaps were performed for each condition.

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
