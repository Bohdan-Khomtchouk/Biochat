TITLE
Deep sequencing of small RNA libraries reveals dynamic expression patterns of miRNAs in multiple developmental stages of Bactrocera dorsalis

ORGANISM
Bactrocera dorsalis

SUMMARY
Four developmental stage small RNA libraries including Eggs, Larvae, Pupae and Adults were constructed, where a lot of known miRNAs were identified and many novel miRNAs were predicted. Comparison of their expression profiles in the four libraries suggested that Bactrocera dorsalis miRNAs are dynamically regulated throughout the life cycle.Further analysis of the expression and function of these miRNAs could increase our understanding of regulatory networks in the insect and lead to novel approaches to its control.

DESIGN
The total RNAs from eggs, larvae, pupae and adults stages of Bactrocera dorsalis were used to construct small RNA libraries for Solexa sequencing.The data from Solexa sequencer (Illumina) was compared to identify small RNAs in different stages of Bactrocera dorsalis.
