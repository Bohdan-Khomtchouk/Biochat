TITLE
Expression data from human induced pluripotent stem cells derived retinal pigment epithelium (hiPSC-RPE)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated hiPSCs from patients fibloblast with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) using retrovirus and Sendai virus vectors, which we differentiated into hiPSC derived retinal pigment epithelium using two different methods (SDIA and SFEB methods). We investigated whether these hiPSC-RPE colonies, which were differentiated from various cell lines and methods, showed similar gene expression patterns to those of native RPE.

DESIGN
We classified hiPSC-RPE, hiPSCs, and fibroblasts from RP patients, hRPE (commercially available human fetal RPE, Lonza) , ARPE19 (a human RPE cell line), and other human tissues from 54,675 probe sets using microarray data.
