TITLE
Rat cardiomyocyte: control vs diclofenac treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of diclofenac-treated rat cardiomyocytes vs non-treated rat cardiomyocytes. Goal of study is to identify changes on genes expression induced by diclofenac. The data analysis focused on genes that might be related to cardiotoxicity; genes expression ion channels and pathways.

DESIGN
two control samples vs 6 diclofenac-treated samples. Variables of treatment included two time points (6h or 24h) and three reference concentrations (1, 1/5 and 1/25). Each group had 3 replicates.
