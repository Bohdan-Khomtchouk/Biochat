TITLE
Transcriptional response of soybean plants to soybean mosaic virus infection

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Transcriptional changes in soybean plants infected with Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) was assessed at 7, 14 and 21 days post inoculation (dpi). Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
Two separate cDNA labeling reactions (Cy3 and Cy5), one for the RNA from SMV-infected leaf tissues and the other for the RNA from the mock-inoculated leaves, were carried out. A total of 18 microarray slides were used for this study: 6 array hybridizations including three reciprocal labeling experiments from three independent biological replications of either SMV-infected or mock-inoculated leaf at each of the three time points. Dye swaps were performed to ensure that the results were not biased by dye effects.
