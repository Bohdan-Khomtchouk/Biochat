TITLE
Gene expression data of regenerated human epidermis overexpressing control LACZ or SOX2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SOX2 is not expressed in normal human epidermis but its expression is elevated in pre-neoplastic epidermis suggesting that it may have a role in the tumorigenesis process. The goal of this study is to determine the impacts of SOX2 overexpression in regenerated human epidermis. Global gene expression profiling using U133 plus 2.0 arrays were used to deteremine the genes perturbed by overexpression of SOX2.

DESIGN
For gene expression profiling, cultured primary human keratinocytes were transduced to overexpress LACZ or SOX2. These genetically modified keratinocytes were used to regenerate human epidermis.RNA was harvested from regenerated human epidermis 6 days post-seeding of the cells. Microarray analysis using Affymetrix HG-U133 2.0 plus arrays was performed on duplicate samples.
