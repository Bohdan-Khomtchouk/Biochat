TITLE
Transcriptome of healthy gingival tissue in aggressive periodontitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study evaluated the transcriptome of healthy gingival tissue in patients with a history of generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) and chronic periodontitis (CP) and in subjects with no history of periodontitis (H), using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Healthy gingival tissue was taken from GAgP (n = 4), CP (n = 4) and H subjects (n = 4). Total RNA from 12 tissues samples (4 per group) was employed in microarray analysis. Data from H subjects were used as control.
