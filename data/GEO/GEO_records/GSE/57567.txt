TITLE
Identification of Novel Post-Transcriptional Features in Olfactory Receptor Family mRNAs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Olfactory receptor (Olfr) genes comprise the largest gene family in mice.  Despite their importance, most Olfr mRNAs are uncharacterized.  Using RNA-seq analysis, we annotated the repertoire of mouse Olfr mRNAs expressed in the olfactory epithelium and found that they have several atypical features suggesting how post-transcriptional regulation impacts their expression.  First, many Olfr mRNAs are intronless and those with introns typically have a single intron at the 5’ end.  Second, Olfr mRNAs, as a group, have dramatically higher average AU content and lower predicted secondary structure than do control mRNAs.  Third, Olfr mRNAs have a higher density of AU-rich elements (AREs) than control mRNAs.  Fourth, Olfr mRNAs have much shorter 3’ UTR regions and fewer predicted binding sites for neurally expressed miRNAs than control mRNAs.  Fifth, Olfr mRNAs have a significantly greater number of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5’ UTR than control mRNAs.  All of these novel properties correlated with higher Olfr expression.  Finally, we identified striking differences in the mRNAs from the two classes of Olfr genes, a finding consistent with their independent evolutionary origin.  Our study suggests that the Olfr gene family has encountered unusual selective forces that have driven these unique post-transcriptional regulatory features.
