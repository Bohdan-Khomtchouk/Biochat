TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Escherichia coli K12  strain JM109 under 200 mM glyphosate shock

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Glyphosate (GLY) is an effective antimetabolite that acts against the shikimate pathway 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase,  However, little is known about the genome-scale transcriptional responses of bacteria after glyphosate shock. To investigate further the mechanisms by which E. coli response to a glyphosate shock, a DNA-based microarray was used for transcriptional analysis of E. coli exposed to 200 mM glyphosate.

DESIGN
RNA extracted from cells of E. coli K-12 JM109 cells after 4 h of growth to OD600 achieve 0.4, or cells after 200 mM glyphosate shock for 1 h when their OD600 achieved 0.4.
