TITLE
Gene expression profiling of prostate cells with CHD1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of prostate tumor cells comparing cells that have CHD1 knockdown by shRNA (RWPE-1, OPCN2) or siRNA (LNCaP) with cells treated with non-targeted control.

DESIGN
Prostate cell lines had CHD1 knockdown via shRNA or siRNA were hybridized against cells that were targeted with non-targeting control.  OPCN2 and RWPE-1 RNA were dye-swapped in replicate experiments.
