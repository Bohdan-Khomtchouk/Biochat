TITLE
Polycomb-dependent H3K27me1 and H3K27me2 characterization in mouse ES cells (E14 and E36 with H3K27me1/2 and H3)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These data include the genome wide location analysis of H3K27me1/2/ac and H3K4me1/3  by ChIP in mouse ES cells.

DESIGN
Precipitation of formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin prepared from mouse ES cell using specific antibodies against Histone H3 and its specific modifications. Rabbit IgG were used as control.
