TITLE
Streptococcus mutans UA159 control vs. Streptococcus mutans UA159 supplemented with 20 uM 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentadione (DPD) at 3 different pH values

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of  early logarithmic phase culture (O.D=0.2-0.3) of  Streptococcus mutans UA159 comparing control of untreated Streptococcus mutans UA159 bacteria  with Streptococcus mutans UA159 bacteria spplemented with 20ÂµM synthetic DPD (pre-AI-2) which regulates gene expression via AI-2 quorum sensing system.Three compairisons  were performed at pHs of  7,6 and 5.

DESIGN
Six-condition experiment, control bacteria vs. bacteria supplemented with DPD at different ph. Biological replicates: pH 7: 4 control, 4 DPD-supplemented independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.pH 6:  4 control, 4 DPD-supplemented independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array. pH 5: 2 control, 2 DPD-supplemented independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL4745 S. mutans UA159 v2
