TITLE
Engineered human pluripotent stem cell-derived intestinal tissues with a functional enteric nervous system

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The enteric nervous system (ENS) of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract controls many diverse functions including motility and epithelial permeability. Perturbations in ENS development or function are common, yet a human model to study ENS-intestinal biology is lacking. We have used a tissue engineering approach with pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to generate human intestinal tissue containing a functional ENS. We recapitulated normal intestinal ENS development by combining PSC-derived neural crest cells (NCCs) with developing human intestinal organoids (HIOs). When cultured alone, NCCs had full differentiation potential in vitro, however when recombined with HIOs they differentiated into neurons and glial cells. NCC-derived ENS neurons self-assembled within the developing intestinal mesenchyme and exhibited neuronal activity as measured by rhythmic waves of calcium transients. ENS-containing HIOs grown in vivo formed neuroglial structures similar to a myenteric and submucosal plexus, formed interstitial cells of Cajal, and had an electro-mechanical coupling that regulated waves of propagating contraction. This is the first demonstration of a human PSC-derived intestinal tissue with a functional ENS.

DESIGN
We examined 4 conditions (3 replicates per condition) of HIO in vitro that include mRNA profiles of HIO (Control); HIO with NCCs (HIOs+ENS); HIO with PHOX2B-/+ NCCs (HIO+ENS_Phox2b_Het); HIO with PHOX2B-/- NCCs (HIO+ENS_Phox2b_Homo). Samples were sequenced using Illumina TruSeq RNA sample prep kit.
