TITLE
Centromere-Like Regions in Budding Yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Accurate chromosome segregation requires centromeres (CENs), the chromosomal sites where kinetochores form, to bridge DNA and attach to microtubules.  In contrast to most eukaryotes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses sequence-defined point centromeres.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) of four kinetochore components reveals regions of overlapping, extra-centromeric protein localization upon overproduction of the centromeric histone, Cse4 (CENP-A or CenH3). These identified sequences enhance proper plasmid and chromosome segregation, and are termed Centromere-like Regions (CLRs).  CLRs form in close proximity to S. cerevisiae CENs and share characteristics typical of point and regional centromeres.  CLR sequences are conserved among related budding yeasts, suggesting a role in vivo.  These studies provide new insights into the origin and evolution of centromeres.
