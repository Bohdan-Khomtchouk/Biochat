TITLE
CPDR tumor-benign 80 genechip dataset

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
From over 300 patients two groups were selected which had prostate tumors with either well differentiated (WD) or poorly differentiated (PD) after radical Prostatectomy. The PD group had Gleason score 8-9, seminal vesicle invasion, and poorly differentiated tumor cells; the WD group had Gleason score 6-7, no seminal vesicle invasion, and well to moderately differentiated tumor cells. LCM compatible specimens were selected from age and race (Caucasians) matched PD or WD patients with no family history of CaP. Matching normal epithelal cells were also selected for the analysis.

DESIGN
From 40 patients specimens were obtained under an IRB-approved protocol from patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC).
