TITLE
Impact of heat stress on  transcriptional adaptation of mammary epithelial cells in riverine buffalo (Bubalus bubalis)

ORGANISM
Bubalus bubalis

SUMMARY
The primary mammary epithelial cells of riverine buffalo were exposed to thermal stress condition at 42C for one hour. The cells were subsequently allowed to recover at 37C and harvested at different time intervals (30 min to 48 h) along with control samples (un-stressed). The study has identified several genes from different functional classes and biological pathways which could be termed as heat responsive in buffalo MEC

DESIGN
The study has utilized 4x44K Agilent chip using single color matrix  to generate transcriptome data of buffalo MEC at different time points (30 min, 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 16h and 24h) post heat stress and compared with unstressed cells

PLATFORM
GPL11649 Agilent-023647 B. taurus (Bovine) Oligo Microarray v2 (Probe Name version)
