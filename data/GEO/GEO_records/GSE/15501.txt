TITLE
Identification of transcription factor DPY-27 binding sites

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
We identified the DNA binding sites of DPY-27 in C. elegans. DPY-27 was C-terminally tagged with GFP and the expression pattern was examined through fluorescent microscopy. The binding sites were determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody followed by illumina high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq).
