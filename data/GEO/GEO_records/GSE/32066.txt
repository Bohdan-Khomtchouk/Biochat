TITLE
Role of SIRT1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the specific roles of SIRT1 in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, we employed large-scale gene expression analysis to identify the molecular signature that may affect enabling characteristics of cancer cells. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed on the SNU-182 cells transfected with SIRT1 siRNA and recapitulated molecular signatures that related to hallmarks of cancer.

DESIGN
SIRT1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma was analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot. RNA interference-mediated protein knockdown method was used to investigate oncogenic potential of SIRT1 in hepatocelluar carcinoma
