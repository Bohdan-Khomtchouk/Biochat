TITLE
Expression data from Tp80-Treated HCV replicon cell, Huh7/RepFeo.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tp80 is a novel antiviral compound. Antiviral mechanism of Tp80 is the inhibition of the viral genome replication through the recoverly of GPx2 expression downregulated by HCV infection. We used microarrays to evaluated the effect of Tp80 on the transcriptome of HCV replicon cells, compared with Non-infected host cells or non-treated HCV replicon cells.

DESIGN
Huh7/RepFeo cells were incubated withTp80 or DMSO at the concentration of 10ÂµM for 48 hours, and cellular RNAs were collected and subjected to microarray analysis. DMSO treated Huh7 cells were used as the noninfected control.
