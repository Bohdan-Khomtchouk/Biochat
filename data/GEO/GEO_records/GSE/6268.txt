TITLE
Differential gene expression in the bone marrow of 15 week old layer and broiler chickens

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Osteoporosis is a major problem for the laying hen industry due to welfare issues and economic losses related to bone fractures.  The objective of this research was to better understand genetic influences on bone integrity by comparing gene expression profiles from bone marrow of chickens expressing phenotypic differences for a number of bone characteristics.  Global expression profiles of genes included on the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) Chicken 13K array were assessed in broiler and layer chickens. Keywords: Gene expression comparison between two chicken lines at 15 weeks of age

DESIGN
Twelve hybridizations (6 dual-channel slides) are included in this dataset. Three 15 week old layer and three 15 week old broiler samples were labeled with each dye to control for dye bias.

PLATFORM
GPL2863 FHCRC chicken 13K
