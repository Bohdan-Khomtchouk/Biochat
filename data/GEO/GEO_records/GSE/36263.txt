TITLE
Array CGH of Drosophila translocations on heterochromatin custom array-2Rhet.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Mapping the Drosophila melanogaster 2R heterochromatin by CGH analysis of embryos lacking specific regions of 2R.

DESIGN
Seven translocations with breakpoints in 2R heterochromatin were tested: 2219 (T(2;3)ftz[Rpl]), 130058 (T(Y;2)B[SV5]), 130093 (T(Y;2)B63), 130112 (T(Y;2)B238), 101579 (T(2;3)bxd[68]), 101988 (T(Y;2)G10), and 107387 (T(2;3)E(da)). To generate embryos deficient for smaller regions of 2R heterochromatin, T(2;Y) or T(2;3) translocation males were crossed to C(2)EN females. One eighth of the embryos that lack 2R were identified according to their failure in forming the ventral furrow during early gastrulation. All embryos were collected at room temperature.
