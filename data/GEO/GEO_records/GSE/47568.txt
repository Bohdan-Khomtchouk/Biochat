TITLE
Gene expression changes in  Apc-mutant mouse intestinal organoids with and without deleting the Prox1 transcription factor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We isolated and selected intestinal adenoma organoids from villin-CreER; Apcflox/flox and villin-CreER; Apcflox/flox; Prox1flox/flox mice and added tamoxifen to induce the deletion of the Apc and Prox1 genes in the intestinal epitheliul ex vivo.  Microarray experiments were carried out 7 days after the addition of tamoxifen.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from  villin-CreER; Apcflox/flox and villin-CreER; Apcflox/flox; Prox1flox/flox organoids were compared 7 days after the addition of tamoxifen and 5 days after the selection for Apc-mutant organoids in the absence of the Wnt-agonist R-Spondin1.
