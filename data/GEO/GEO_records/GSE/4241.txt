TITLE
Mesothelioma differential expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the molecular events controlling malignant transformation of human pleural cells, we compared constitutive gene expression of mesothelioma cells to that of pleural cells. Using cDNA microarray and high-density filter array, we assessed expression levels of > 6500 genes. Most of the highly expressed transcripts were common to both cell lines and included genes associated with stress response and DNA repair, outcomes consistent with the radio- and chemo-resistance of mesothelioma. Interestingly, of the fewer than 300 genes that differed between cell lines, most functioned in (i) macromolecule stability, (ii) cell adhesion and recognition, (iii) cell migration (invasiveness), and (iv) extended cell division Keywords: c-DNA array from Incyte Pharmaceuticalsâ„¢, cell line comparison
