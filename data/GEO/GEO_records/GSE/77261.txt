TITLE
Genome-wide expression change by SHARPIN knockdown in MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aim to investigate the role of SHARPIN in breast cancer progression. MCF-7 cells were used as the model and SHARPIN was silenced by siRNA.SHARPIN (SHANK-Associated RH Domain Interactor) is also named as SIPL1 and HSIPL1. The  gene is located in Chr 8. SHARPIN protein is shown to regulate cell adhesion and migration. Besides, SHARPIN is proved to the component of the LUBAC complex and is necessary for NKFB function, while SHARPIN KO mice will lead to chronic dermatitis and immune deficiency in B cells.

DESIGN
The MCF-7 cells were treated with 50nM scramble siRNA and siSHARPIN. After 48 hours, cells were harvested and the total RNA was extracted by Qiagen kit. The RNA sample was sent to BGI for RNA expression analysis.

PLATFORM
