TITLE
A global transcriptome analysis of keratinocytes upon suppression of endogenous microRNA-31

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MiR-31 is one of the most highly overexpressed miRNAs in psoriasis skin; however, its biological role in the disease has not been studied. Here we show that miR-31 is markedly overexpressed in psoriasis keratinocytes. To study the biological role of miR-31 in keratinocytes, we transfected miR-31 hairpin inhibitor (anti-miR-31) into primary human keratinocytes to inhibit endogenous miR-31. We performed a global transcriptome analysis of keratinocytes upon suppression of endogenous miR-31 using Affymetrix arrays.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of primary human keratinocytes transfected with 10nM miR-31 hairpin inhibitor (anti-miR-31) or control hairpin RNA (anti-miR-Ctrl) for 48 hours (biological triplicates in each group) was performed using the Affymetrix GeneTitan system.
