TITLE
Gene expression response of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis phage type 8 to subinhibitory concentrations of trans-cinnamaldehyde and eugenol

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles of mid-exponentially growing Salmonella enterica sv Enteritidis PT8 cultures in response to exposure to trans-cinnamaldehyde (0.01%; 0.75mM) or eugenol (0.04%; 2.46mM)

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from three biological replicates of mid-exponentially growing Salmonella enterica sv Enteritidis PT8 cultures before or after 15min or 30 min exposure to plant-derived compounds trans-cinnamaldehyde (0.01%) or eugenol (0.04%) at subinhibitory concentrations.
