TITLE
Comparison of gene transcription in Ly49G versus Ly49I positive splenic NK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report RNA seq of mature, freshly isolated splenic NK cells sorted for the expression of Ly49G or Ly49I.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of sorted Ly49G+/Ly49I- versus Ly49I+/Ly49G- NK cells prepared from the spleens of 20 C57BL/6Ncr mice
