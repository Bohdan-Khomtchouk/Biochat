TITLE
Spotted long oligonucleotide arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Both spotted long oligonucleotide arrays and Affymetrix GeneChips were used to measure differential gene expression in two RNA samples (K562 erythroleukemia RNA and the Stratagene Universal Human Reference RNA). For Affymetrix technology, the two RNAs were analyzed separately. There are two replicates for K562 RNA (GSM4843 and GSM4844) and three for the Stratagene Universal reference (GSM4845-GSM4847). Two types of spotted long oligonucleotide arrays were used. These arrays were used to do two-color hybridizations to directly compare K562 and Universal reference RNAs. One array (GPL273) was made with probes from the Operon Human Genome Oligo Set Version 1. These arrays were used with unamplified cDNA probes (6 replicates, GSM4848-GSM4853), with aRNA probes produced by one round of T7 RNA polymerase-based amplification (6 replicates, GSM4854-GSM4859), and with aRNA probes produced by two rounds of amplification (2 replicates, GSM4860-GSM4861). Keywords: parallel sample
