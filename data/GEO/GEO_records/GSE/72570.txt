TITLE
Sequence-Targeted Nucleosome Sliding in vivo - Nucleosome Mapping

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Nucleosome positions were determined in wild type cells, cells lacking Isw2 or Ume6, and cells containing a hybrid Chd1-Ume6 chimeric remodeler

DESIGN
Matched MNase digests from W303 strain variants during log growth (OD600=0.4-0.6) were subject to paired-end sequencing for nucleosome mapping. For effects of the engineered fusion remodeling protein, a catalytically inactive (ATPase dead D513N) variant was included as a control.
