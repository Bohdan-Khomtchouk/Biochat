TITLE
Identification of HP0244 regulon at different pH conditions

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Helicobacter pylori comparing 26695 wild-type strain and a HP0244-deficient mutant 26695/âˆ†HP0244::km treated at three different pH conditions (pH 7.4, pH 4.5 without urea, or pH 2.5 with 30 mM urea) for 30 min to define the HP0244 acid-responsive regulon Keywords: Genetic modification and stress response
