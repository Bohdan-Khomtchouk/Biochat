TITLE
ETV5 transcription program links BDNF and promotion of EMT at invasive front of endometrial carcinomas.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have characterized the transcriptional program regulated by ETV5 at the invasive front of endometrial carcinomas, by comparing it with non-invasive areas of the same tumor samples.

DESIGN
In total 12 samples; 6 superficial (non-invasive) tumor areas and the corresponding invasive tumor zones.
