TITLE
Decapped mRNAs during Arabidopsis Early Flower Development

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The composition of the transcriptome is regulated by both mRNA synthesis and degradation.  One route for mRNA decay is through 5â€™ decapping, which can be initiated by decapping enzymes and small RNAs.  Although decapped RNAs are an important intermediate for mRNA decay, their identity and abundance have never been studied on a large scale.  Here we present an experimental method for transcriptome-wide profiling of decapped mRNAs.  We applied the method to study the prevalence of decapped transcripts during the early stages of Arabidopsis thaliana flower development.  Decapped transcripts were identified for the majority of expressed genes, although at different levels.  By comparing decapped RNA levels with steady-state overall transcript levels, our study provides evidence for widespread decapping-mediated mRNA degradation control in numerous biological processes and for genes of varied molecular functions, implying that mRNA decapping is a dynamically regulated process.  Sequence analyses identified structural features of transcripts and cis-elements that were associated with levels of decapping.

DESIGN
Four sets of biologically independent tissue samples were collect 0,1,2,3,4, and 5 days after activation of the AP1-GR fusion protein. Decapped mRNA and total mRNA of each time point from each set were co-hybridized to micoarrays. Dyes used for labeling the RNA populations derived from the individual samples were switched in the replicate experiments to reduce dye-related artefacts.
