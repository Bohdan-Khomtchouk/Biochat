TITLE
Histone ChIP-chip of adult hippocampus tissue from fetal alcohol exposed mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this experiment, we exposed mice to ethanol injections on postnatal days 4 and 7. We then extracted whole-hippocampus on postnatal day 70. We performed two ChIP-chip experiments on all mice form the same tissue using antibodies against H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. We found alterations in both modifications at many sites, including CTCF motifs of protocadherin genes and imprinted loci. We also found many affect lipid metabolism pathways.

DESIGN
Comparision of neonatal ethanol-injected  with saline injected C57BL/6J mouse hippocampus in adulthood (day 70)
