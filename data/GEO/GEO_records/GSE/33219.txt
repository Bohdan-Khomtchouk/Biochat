TITLE
Hydroxymethyl DNA-IP of genomic DNA for many different normal human tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
5-hmC is a novel epigenetic mark derived from oxidation of methylcytosine. We profile this mark in several normal human tissues 5-hmC patterns are highly tissue specific and enriched in the body of transcribed genes 5-hmC patterns are highly tissue specific and enriched in the body of transcribed genes

DESIGN
comparison of six normal human tissue types
