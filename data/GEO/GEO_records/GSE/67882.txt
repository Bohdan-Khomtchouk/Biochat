TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed microRNAs in liver tissue of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global expression profiling of miRNAs in liver tissue of HBV infected HCC and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with no fibrosis was evaluated. A total of 40 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in HCC. Top 10 miRNAs are validated in more numbers of HCC tisuues by qRT PCR. Finally six miRNAs (miR-15a, miR-16, miR-21,miR-29b-3p, miR-126, miR-142-3p, miR-193a-5p) showed similar expression pattern in both microarray and qRT PCR

DESIGN
Differential expression analysis of microRNAs in HBV infected HCC (n=4) compared to CHB patients with no fibrosis (n=8) as control.
