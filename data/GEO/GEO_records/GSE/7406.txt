TITLE
Effect of PACAP treatment on Bovine chromaffin cells

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The effect of PACAP treatment on the bovine chromaffin cells in vitro were investigated using mouse Mm36kd3 arrays. Although chromaffin cells have indigenous PACAP, the experiment was designed to find out the effect of additional PACAP on additional activation or suppression of transcription. Keywords: compound treatment design

DESIGN
cy5 labelled RNA from PACAP treated bovine chromaffin cells were paired with cy3 labelled RNA from control chromaffin cells for hybridization. Four biological repeats were carried out.
