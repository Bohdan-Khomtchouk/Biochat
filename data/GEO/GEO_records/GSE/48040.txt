TITLE
A global profiling of  gene expression under cold stress in Brachypodium

ORGANISM
Brachypodium distachyon

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq was performed to study the change of gene expression before and after cold treatment  in Brachypodium. Different change patterns were identified. We have provided a complete view of  transcriptome under cold stress condition, which will deepen our understanding of gene expression regulation in cold stress response as well as cold stress response mechanism for monocot plants.

DESIGN
The mRNA profiles of 12-day-old Brachypodium seedlings with and without cold treatment  (4 °C for 24 h)  were generated by deep sequencing using  Illumina HiSeq™ 2000.

PLATFORM
