TITLE
Gene expression profile of wildtype glioblastoma cell lines and their resistant subclones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify factors involved in TMZ-resistance, we engineered different TMZ-resistant glioblastoma cell lines. Wildtype cells were treated twice a week in duplicate with a clinically relevant concentration of TMZ (33 ÂµM) for multiple weeks, until two individual resistant subclones were generated. Gene expression profiling was performed to identify differentially expressed genes in the resistant cells compared to their wildtype cells.

DESIGN
three wildtype glioblastoma cell lines (U87, LNZ308, Hs683) and their resistant subclones, two of each wildtype, were analyzed The experiments were performed technically as dual channel but processed/normalized as single channel (i.e. two sample records per one raw data file). The raw data file for each sample is indicated in the sample description field but linked as Series supplementary file.
