TITLE
The effects of the global loss of DNA methylation on the functional cancer epigenome (Bisulfite-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compare the global DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy patterns of HCT116 colon cancer cells with its genetic derivatives DKO1 cells which lack DNMT3B and DNMT1 activity

DESIGN
Simultaneous genome-wide mapping of DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy of HCT116 and DKO1 cells using NOMe-seq, rep2

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
