TITLE
Expression data for T47D cells treated with 2mM hydroxyurea

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RAD51B, a paralog of RAD51, have been associated with breast cancer risk in genome-wide association studies. The underlying biological mechanism through which germline genetic variation in RAD51B confers susceptibility to breast cancer is not well understood. Here we investigate the molecular function of RAD51B in breast cancer cell lines. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression to identify classes of genes that are regulated  differnetly post DNA damages as a result of RAD51B depeletion.

DESIGN
T47D cells were first transfected with either non-targeting (control; siCON) or RAD51B-targeting (experimental; siRAD51B) siRNA, then followed by 24hr treatment of 2mM hydroxyurea (HU). Total RNA were extracted at the end of the treatment for microarray analysis. Three biological replicates were carried out for both control and experimental samples.
