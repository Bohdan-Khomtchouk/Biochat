TITLE
Expression Data from wild type and E2F4 null MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have used primary MEFs derived from wild type and E2F4 null mice growing asynchrounously in serum to generate a signature for E2F4 pathway activation.  10 wild type and 10 E2F4 null samples were each assayed using the Affymetrics Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 array. Keywords: Primary MEFs from wild type and E2F4 null mice
