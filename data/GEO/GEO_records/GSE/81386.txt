TITLE
iCLIP-Seq analyses of DDX46-bound RNAs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DDX46 is identified to be required at the early step of pre-spliceosome assembly,but the potential roles of DDX46 in RNA editing and whether DDX46 could regulate antiviral innate immunity by editing antiviral transcripts in the nucleus remain elusive.

DESIGN
iCLIP-Seq analyses of DDX46-bound RNAs from uninfected and VSV-infected RAW264.7 cells
