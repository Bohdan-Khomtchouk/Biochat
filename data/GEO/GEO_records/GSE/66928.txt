TITLE
GRO-seq analysis of control and Myc-induced U2OS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used GRO-seq to examine the effect of Myc activation on RNA transcription in U2OS cells.

DESIGN
We measure in duplicates gene transcription rates in U2OS cells containing an inducible Myc expression vector that were induced or mock-treated in duplicates for 5 hours.
