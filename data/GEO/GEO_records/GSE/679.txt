TITLE
yeast filamentous-form growth

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Wild-type diploid cells were shifted from yeast-form growth in SHAD liquid (plentiful glucose and ammonium) to filamentous-form growth on SLAD agar (low ammonium). Samples of filamentous-form cells were collected hourly for 10 hours. Filamentous-form and yeast-form exponential-phase targets were co-hybridized. Keywords: time-course
