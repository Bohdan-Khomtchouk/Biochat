TITLE
Gene expression of mouse embryonic gonad [wild type male]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze the gene expression profiles of the developing embryonic male gonad, we performed expression microarray analysis of the wild type male gonads from E12.5 to E15.5.

DESIGN
Biological duplicates were examined at each stage for each experiment.
