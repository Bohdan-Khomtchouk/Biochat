TITLE
Changes in gene expression during acinar morphogenesis of normal-like human mammary epithelial cells in a 3D basement membrane cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we examined temporal changes in gene expression during acinar morphogenesis of normal-like human mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A) in a three-dimensional (3D) basement membrane cultures.

DESIGN
Changes in gene expression in 3D culture of MCF-10A cells were measured at 4, 8, and 12 days.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
