TITLE
Gene expression-based identification of differential expression genes on gastric cancer samples with or without lymph node metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study, gene expression microarray was utilized to screen the differentially expressed genes between metastatic and nonmetastatic gastric cancers.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, differential expression analysis of global gene profiling were performed in gastric tissues, including 2 cases of nontumorous gastric tissues, 5 cases of primary gastric cancer tissues without lymph node metastasis and 5 cases of primary gastric cancer tissues with lymph node metastasis.

PLATFORM
GPL15314 Arraystar Human LncRNA microarray V2.0 (Agilent_033010 Probe Name version)
