TITLE
Complement activation in the peripheral nervous system following the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Neuroinflammatory and neuroimmune mechanisms, as exemplified by infiltrating immune cells and activation of resident endothelial/glial cells, respectively, are known to be involved in the establishment and maintenance of chronic pain. An immune system pathway that may be involved in the activation of both immune and glial cells is complement. The complement pathway is made up of a large number of distinct plasma proteins which react with one another to opsonize pathogens and induce a series of inflammatory responses to help fight infection. Cleaved products and complexes produced by complement activation are responsible for a range of effects including mediation of immune infiltration, activation of phagocytes, opsonization/lysis of pathogens and injured cells, and production of vasoactive amines such as histamine and serotonin. Gene-expression microarray-analysis was performed on the rat spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain Keywords: organ type comparison, disease state analysis and drug treatment
