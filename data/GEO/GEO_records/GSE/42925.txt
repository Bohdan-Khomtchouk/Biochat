TITLE
Expression data from human antigen presenting cells expressing HIV-1 Tat alleles and mutants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIV-1 Tat induces the expression of interferon (IFN)-inducible genes in immature dendritic cells (iDC) in the absence of IFN production. We evaluated how three alleles of Tat and some Tat mutants differ in cellular gene modulation and whether a similar gene induction pattern could be detected by treating cells with IFN’s.  The three alleles and mutants, with the exception of mutants TatSF21-47 and TatSF2G48-R57A that do not localize in the nucleous, modulated to different degrees IFN-inducible genes without concomitant induction of IFN’s. The first exon TatSF21-72 and the minimal transactivator TatSF21-58, all induced genes to a significantly greater extent than full-length Tat. The 2nd exon appears to diminish the gene modulation that can be observed when the first exon alone is expressed. To investigate what domain of Tat are critical to the host-pathogen interactions that are Tat-dependent during HIV infection, we evaluated a variety of Tat-mutants and found that in antigen presenting cells, blood-derived myeloid iDC and macrophages, the second exon of Tat reduces innate immunological responses which are maximal when a Single exon Tat is expressed.

DESIGN
1X10e6 macrophages were infected with  HIVBal (20 ng of p24/ 106 cells) for 10 days and with adenoviruses expressing TatHXB2 or LacZ control (5 pfu per cell). Cells infected with Ad-Tat or Ad-LacZ were collected at 24 hours and cells infected with HIV or treated  with medium were harvested at 7d and 10d post-infection. THP-Mac were infected with Ad-Tat or Ad-tTA control  for 24 hours. RNA was isolated and mRNA expression levels were analyzed by microarrays. adenovirus expressing HIV Tat  for 30 hours.  and  then RNA was isolated, labeled, and prepared for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
