TITLE
Sepula lacrymans interacting with tree roots

ORGANISM
Serpula lacrymans var. lacrymans S7.9

SUMMARY
This study characterizes the transcriptomic alterations of Serpula lacrymans in contact with tree roots compared to the transcriptome of free-living mycelium.

DESIGN
We performed 6 hybridizations (NimbleGen) with samples derived from Picea sylvestris root tips inoculated with Serpula lacrymans (three biological replicates).  These samples were compared to free-living mycelium from Serpula lacrymans (three biological replicates). All samples were labeled with Cy3.
