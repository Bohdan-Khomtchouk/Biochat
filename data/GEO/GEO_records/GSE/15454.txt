TITLE
Profiling of filarial induced genes in lymphatic endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To observe the global changes in the lymphatic endothelial cells upon exposure to filarial antigens or parasites, LECs were stimulated for 24, 48, and 72hrs and the expression profiles were carried out.

DESIGN
Human filarial parasites Brugia malayi and Wuchereria bancrofti habitat the lymphatics and cause lymphatic dilatation and lymphedema. In order to evaluate the effect of various stage specific effects on the lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) and understand how they modulate the lymphatic dysfunction, LECs were stimulated in antigens derived from the Brugia malayi. These are preliminary time course data towards understanding how the filarial antigens induce lymphangiogenesis.
