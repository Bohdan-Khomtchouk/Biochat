TITLE
Trichoderma reesei transcript levels during mycoparasitism

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
To investigate the potential role in mycoparasitism, microarrays were used to examine T. reesei transcript levels when confronted with a potential prey (the plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani) before contact, during first physical contact and during overgrowth of the host.
