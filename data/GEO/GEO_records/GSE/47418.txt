TITLE
Expression data of Enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 (EHEC) strain 86-24 when cultured with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli 8624

SUMMARY
Regulation of EHEC gene expression by the gut commensal bacterium B. thetaiotaomicron. EHEC is a human pathogen that colonizes in the colon where B. thetaiotaomicron is a predominant commensal. We used microarrays to evaluate global regulation of EHEC when cultured with B. thetaiotaomicron.

DESIGN
EHEC and B. thetaiotaomicron were co-cultured in vitro under strict anaerobic conditions in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Total RNA from bacteria grown to mid-logarithmic phase was extracted and hybridized to an Affymetrix E. coli 2.0 gene chip according to manufacturer's specifications: http//www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/expression_manual.affx
