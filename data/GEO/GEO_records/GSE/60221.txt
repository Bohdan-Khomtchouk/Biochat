TITLE
The Nuclear Exosome is Active and Important during Budding Yeast Meiosis

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We have analysed the activity of the nuclear exosome during meiosis by deletion of TRF4, which encodes a key component of the exosome targeting complex TRAMP. We find that TRAMP mutants produce high levels of CUTs during meiosis that are undetectable in wild-type cells, showing that the nuclear exosome remains functional for CUT degradation. Lack of TRAMP activity stabilises ~1600 CUTs in meiotic cells, which occupy 40% of the binding capacity of the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC).

DESIGN
One sample each of Cbc2-associated RNA from wild-type and trf4-deleted cells at 6 hours of meiosis
