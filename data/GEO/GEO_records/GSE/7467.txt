TITLE
ENCODE Transcript Mapping for Human HeLa Total RNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcript Mapping on Affymetrix ENCODE arrays for 3 different biological replicates of HeLa Total RNA Keywords: other

DESIGN
Experiments were done with 3 biological replicate samples each hybridized to replicates arrays in parallel. Array data was processed by combining the replicate arrays and integrating data using sliding genomic windows.

PLATFORM
GPL3111 Affymetrix ENCODE Tiling Array - ANTISENSE - NCBI build 35
