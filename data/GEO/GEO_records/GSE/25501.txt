TITLE
Sox10 controls migration of melanoma cells through multiple regulatory target genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It is believed that the inherent differentiation program of melanocytes during embryogenesis predisposes melanoma cells to high frequency of metastasis. Sox10, a transcription factor expressed in neural crest stem cells and a subset of progeny lineages, plays a key role in the development of melanocytes. We show that B16F10 melanoma cells transfected with siRNA specific for Sox10 display reduced migratory activity which in turn indicated that a subset of transcriptional regulatory target genes of Sox10 are likely to be involved in migration and metastasis of melanoma cells. We carried out microarray-based gene expression profiling using Sox10-specific siRNA to identify regulatory targets and found that multiple genes including melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1R) partake in the regulation of migration. We provide evidences that a significant portion of the effect of Sox10 on migration is mediated by Mitf, a transcription factor downstream to Sox10. The involvement of Mc1R in migration was studied in detail in vivo using a murine metastasis model. Specifically, B16F10 melanoma cells treated with a specific siRNA showed reduced tendency in metastasizing to and colonizing the lung after being injected in the tail vein. These data reveal a cadre of novel regulators and mediators involved in migration and metastasis of melanoma cells that represent potential targets of therapeutic intervention.
