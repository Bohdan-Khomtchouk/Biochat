TITLE
Macrophage reponse to triple-negative breast cancer cells in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of monocyte-derived macrophage polarised by triple-negative breast cancer cell conditioned medium

DESIGN
Human donor monocyte-derived macrophage, MDA-MB-231(ATCC® HTB-26™) and MDA-MB-468(ATCC® HTB-132™) were maintained in the respective medium with the harvestation of the medium for 24 hours before exposing the cancer cell conditioned mediums on monocytic-derived macrophage. Total RNAs were extracted and expression profiles were generated for each sample by RT² Profiler™ PCR Arrays(Qiagen).
