TITLE
Gene expression profiling under exposure to high altitude hypoxic environment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Understanding molecular mechanism associated with high altitude exposure during acclimatization/adaptation/maladaptation. Data reveals specific components of the complex molecular circuitry underlying high altitude pulmonary edema.

DESIGN
Individualized outcome prediction were constructed through expression profiling of 39400 genes in sea level sojourners who were acclimatized to high altitude and grouped as controls (n=14), high altitude natives (n=14) and individuals who developed high altitude pulmonary edema within 48-72 hours after air induction to high altitude (n=17).
