TITLE
The telomere-binding protein Tbf1 demarcates snoRNA gene promoters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The majority of Saccharomyces cerevisiae snoRNA promoters contain an aRCCCTaa sequence motif located at the upstream border of a TATA-containing nucleosome-free region. Genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis showed that these motifs are bound in vivo by Tbf1, a telomere-binding protein known to recognize mammalian-like T2AG3 repeats at sub-telomeric regions. Tbf1 has over 100 additional promoter targets, including the TBF1 gene itself. Tbf1 is required for full snoRNA expression, yet it does not influence nucleosome positioning at snoRNA promoters.

DESIGN
Analysis of Tbf1-binding sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by ChIP-seq of a Myc-tagged strain and a control untagged strain. 1 sample per strain, 1 lane per sample.
