TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling of quiescent and activated muscle stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression profiling during muscle stem cell activation. Quiescent muscle stem cells from uninjured muscles and activated muscle stem cells from injured muscles at indicated time points were isolated by FACS.

DESIGN
MicroRNA expression profiling during muscle stem cell activation using real-time PCR based miRNA arrays. Muscle stem cells were harvested at indicated time points (0hr, 36hr, 60hr and 72hr) after injury. 3 technical replicates were performed. Supplementary files: Raw data (Ct) and complete processed data (dCt, ddCt, fold-change) by platform.
