SUMMARY
Dr. Clausen's laboratory is interested in the structure, biosynthesis and genetic regulation of glycoconjugates, with a major focus on mucins. This laboratory is studying the glycosylation and secretion process of mucins and biological functions involving mucins. This lab is also interested in receptor modulation mediated by glycosylation or through glycosphingolipids. RNA samples from two human pancreatic cell lines. The relevance of the variable expression levels of isoforms belonging to the polypeptide GalNAc-transferase gene-family is still a puzzle to us. The polypeptide GalNAc-transferase gene family is estimated to contain 24 gene-members all participating in the initiation of mucin-type O-glycosylation. It has become apparent that each of these individual isoforms have different tissue distribution profiles and kinetic capabilities. Mucin-type O-glycosylation is thus controlled, and dependent upon the repetoir of expressed GalNAc-transferases in any given organ and cell type at any given time. We have been trying to contribute to the understanding of the ordered process controlling mucin-type O-glycosylation in both normal and malignant models, and are currently investigating a pancreatic cell line model in the lab. The pancreatic tumor cell line ASPC-1 has been found to possess low metastatic potential in mouse models, in contrast to the pancreatic tumor cell line Suit-T2 possessing high metastatic potential. Immunohistochemical analysis of both cell lines, ASPC-1 and Suit-T2, using our monoclonal antibodies to 7 isoforms has revealed great differences in the expression profile of these 7 isoforms in theses two cell lines, and for instance GalNAc-T3 has been found to be highly expressed in Suit-T2 but completely lacking in ASPC-1.
