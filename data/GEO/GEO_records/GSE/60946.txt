TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of the effects of a longitudinal dietary intervention on human adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained from obese individuals before, after an 8-week low calorie diet and after an ad libitum 26-week weight control phase. Clinical investigations including subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were performed at baseline and at the end of each phase. Main clinical outcome measures were body weight, body composition, energy intake, metabolic biochemistry. Adipose tissue gene expression profiling and lipidomics from the same samples were also assessed.

DESIGN
135 adipose tissue RNA samples were analysed before, after low calorie diet and after weight maintenance phase
