TITLE
Screening of deafness-causing DNA variants that are common in patients of European ancestry using a microarray-based approach

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to provide a faster, more comprehensive and cost effective assay, we constructed a DNA fluidic array, CapitalBioMiamiOtoArray, for the detection of sequence variants in five genes that are common in most populations of European descent. Our results show 100% concordance between the fluidic array biochip-based approach and the established Sanger sequencing method, thus proving its robustness and reliability at a relatively low cost.

DESIGN
The microarray is composed of a fluidic manifold made of polycarbonate glued on the glass slide to introduce a dynamic hybridization for signal enhancement and acceleration of reaction kinetics. The tag probes containing a poly (dT) spacer and a 5' amino group are spotted with a SmartArrayer 136 spotter (CapitalBio) on the aldehyde-functionalized glass slides to capture the allele-specific PCR products. 100 deaf individuals and 59 normal individuals were analyzed.
