TITLE
Gene regulation by full length human adiponectin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptionnal profiling of 4 human cell lines treated during 3 hours with human adiponectin Keywords: transcriptionnal analysis

DESIGN
Four human cell lines (Hela, HepG2, Panc-1, Hek293) were grown until confluence. These cell lines were serum depleted during 2 hours and then treated with human adiponectin (2,5 Âµg/ml) during 3 hours. Each adiponectin stimulated cell line was compared to depleted cell line. Depleted cell line was considered as control.
