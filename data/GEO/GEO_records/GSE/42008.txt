TITLE
Expression data from NcGFP ki/+, NcGFP ki/ki and wt (W4) ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated a gene replacement allele of the E-cadherin locus that express an N-cadherin-GFP fusion in ES cells. Expression profiles of homozygous and heterozygous knock-in ES cells were analyzed in comparison to wt ES cells. The GEO Samples were compared to published data of E-cadherin knock-out ES cells (ArrayExpress, accession number E-MEXP-2836). The comparison data are linked below.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from two independent experiments per genotype, data analysis was performed using the R/Bioconductor Limma software. Quality of the data set was controlled by the simpleaffy package and normalized by quantile normalization with the GCRMA alogrithm.
