TITLE
Differentially expressed genes in Reamuria soongorica leaf under multiple stresses.

ORGANISM
Hololachna songarica

SUMMARY
In this study, the DEGs in leaves of R. soongorica in response to PEG-induced drought stress, UV-B radiation, combined stress by UV-B radiation and PEG-induced drought, and combined stresses by UV-B radiation, PEG-induced drought and NaCl in contrast to control group were examined, respectively, using DGE tag profiling technology. Analysis of gene expression related to stress response should provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance in R. soongorica. Based on the putative functions of the identified genes, some important genes may be cloned. Moreover, the cloning of stress tolerance genes and determination of their expression patterns may offer some attractive candidate genes and valuable information for improving stress tolerance of plants through genetic engineering.
