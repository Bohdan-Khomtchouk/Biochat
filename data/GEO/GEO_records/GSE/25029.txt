TITLE
Ionizing radiation in GI tract of Tweak KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TWEAK/Fn14 signaling may regulate the expression of genes involved in epithelial repair and mucosal inflammation. Comparing the gene signatures in WT and TWEAK KO mice will inform the biology of TWEAK/Fn14 pathway in the GI tract.

DESIGN
Mice were treated with 3 Gy of ionizing radiation. After 6h and 24h mice were sacrificed, and whole colon and jejunum were harvested, and RNA was isolated from these tissues. Each CEL file represents a different mouse.
