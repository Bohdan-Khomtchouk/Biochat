TITLE
Penicillium marneffei:  Gene expression profiling during the dimorphic switch

ORGANISM
Talaromyces marneffei

SUMMARY
Penicillium marneffei (Talaromyces marneffei) is an opportunistic human pathogen that can grow in a multicellular hyphal form at 25°C or a unicellular fission yeast form at 37°C, and can switch between these two forms in response to temperature. The yeast form is found in infected individuals and represents the pathogenic phase. In response to specific environmental cues, the hyphal form can undergo asexual development (conidiation) the produce a differentiated multicellular structure called a conidiophore which produces dormant spores (conidia). Inhaled conidia initiate infection. To identify genes that are important during the early stages in the transition from hyphal to yeast and yeast to hyphal cells transcriptional profiling was performed with a custom microarray consisting of ~42% of the predicted P. marneffei genes and RNA from P. marneffei hyphal cells switched to growth at 37°C for 6 hours (hyphal-yeast switch) and yeast cells switched to growth at 25°C for 6 hours (yeast-hyphal switch).

DESIGN
A custom microarray consisting of short, random genomic fragments from P. marneffei (~42% of the predicted genes) was generated using PCR products of the inserts from two independent DNA libraries constructed from genomic DNA of the P. marneffei type strain FRR2161. PCR products from previously cloned P. marneffei genes with known expression profiles were included as controls on the microarray. Total RNA from hyphal cells before and after switching to growth at 37°C for 6 hours (hyphal-yeast switch) and yeast cells before and after switching to growth at 25°C for 6 hours (yeast-hyphal switch) were used in pairwise combinations on the microarrays. Three biological replicate cultures were prepared for each experiment.
