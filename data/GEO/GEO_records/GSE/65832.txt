TITLE
RNA-Seq atopic dermatitis transcriptome profiling provides insights into novel disease mechanisms with potential therapeutic implications

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: provide evidence that RNA-seq can add information to transcriptome profiling already discovered by other technologies for atopic dermatitis Methods: mRNA profiles of 20 atopic dermatitis were analyzed to compare lesional and non-lesional skin, then transcriptomes found by reads were compared to Microarray and RT-PCR Results:RNA-seq provided complementary genes to AD transcriptome IL-36 and TREM-1 Conclusions: Our study represents the first analysis of lesional AD tissue by RNA-seq and comparison to microarray and RT-PCR

DESIGN
paired biopsies from lesional and non-lesional tissue of 20 patients sequenced by RNA-seq
