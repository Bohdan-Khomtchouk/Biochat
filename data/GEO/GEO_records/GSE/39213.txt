TITLE
Gene expression profiles in the adult liver, fetal liver and bone marrow

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We speculate that the genes that acquired mutations in liver cancer  tissues might be preferentially and actively transcribed in hepatic lineage cells. Therefore, to examine whether the mutated genes in liver cancer tissues in mice were transcribed at relatively higher levels in liver-lineage cells compared with hematopoietic lineage cells, we aim to analyze and compare the gene expression profiles in the adult liver, fetal liver and bone marrow.

DESIGN
The gene expression levels of the adult liver, fetal liver and bone marrow are compared.
