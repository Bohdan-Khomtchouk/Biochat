TITLE
Identification of a microRNA signature for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify changes in miRNA expression profiles (miRNome) of fibromyalgia patients for the development of a quantitative diagnostic method of FM. 20% of the miRNAs analyzed (233/1212) showed down-regulation of at least 2-fold in patients. Hsa-miR223-3p, hsa-miR451a, hsa-miR338-3p, hsa-miR143-3p, hsa-miR145-5p and hsa-miR-21-5p were at least 4-fold inhibited.

DESIGN
miRNA content of PBMCs (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) from either 11 fibromyalgia patients or 10 healthy controls isolated with Ficoll-Paque Premium (GE Healthcare) was examined by microarray analysis. Inhibition of hsa-miR223-3p, hsa-miR451a, hsa-miR338-3p, hsa-miR143-3p, hsa-miR145-5p was further confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis.
