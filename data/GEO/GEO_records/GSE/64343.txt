TITLE
T cell responses to H1N1v and a longitudinal study of seasonal influenza vaccination - 2011

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Systems biology approach to examine effects of seasonal flu vaccination in adults of different ages on gene expression, cytokine stimulation and serum cytokines with parameters such as immune senescence to uncover new markers and mechanisms behind failure of immune function in many older people.

DESIGN
1. Combinatorial tetramer analysis by FACS and/or CyTOF; Phosphoflow. 2. Luminex; Gene expression profiling (Affymetrix microarray). 3. Luminex; Gene expression profiling (Affymetrix microarray); Microneutralization assays. 4. Gene expression profiling (Affymetrix microarray); Immune phenotyping by CyTOF. 5. Gene expression profiling (Affymetrix microarray). 6. Immune phenotyping by CyTOF; Luminex. 7. ELISA
