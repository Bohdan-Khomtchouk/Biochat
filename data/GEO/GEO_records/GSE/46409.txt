TITLE
GRH-inducible genes in rice plants

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The green rice leafhopper (GRH), Nephotettix cincticeps Uhler, is a major insect pest of cultivated rice in temperate Asia. GRH2-near-isogenic line (NIL) TGRH11, GRH4-NIL (TGRH16) and GRH2/GRH4-pyramided line (PYL) TGRH29 were developed by introducing the GRH2 and GRH4 from indica rice (DV85). We identified GRH-inducible genes in respective rice lines. Furthermore, we compared the gene expression levels between NILs/PYL and control plants (T65).

DESIGN
The gene expression changes in respective rice lines were detected by comparison between GRH-infested and pre-infested plants. Seedlings at the second-leaf stage were infested with 10 to 15 first- or second-instar nymphs in test tubes and shoots were collected at 30 h after GRH infestation. Detached-leaf blades at heading stage were infested with 10 to 15 first- or second-instar nymphs in test tubes and samples were collected at 30 h after GRH infestation. For each treatment, two biological replicates were performed.
