TITLE
Analysis of differential miRNA expression profiling in Namalwa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze the differential miRNA expression profiling in human lymphoma cells (Namalwa cell line) before and after treatment by DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Decitabine; 5-aza).

DESIGN
Six total samples were analyzed, two groups, and triplicate for each group. The abbreviation of Con represents Namalwa cells without the treatment of 5-aza, and Add represents Namalwa cells after treatment by 5-aza for 3 days.
