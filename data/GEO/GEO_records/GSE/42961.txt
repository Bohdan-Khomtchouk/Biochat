TITLE
Determination of the spatial organization of the FXN gene locus by using Chromosome Conformation Capture technique coupled with High-throughtput sequencing (3C-seq).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Accumulating data from different groups have demonstrated that alteration of post-translational histone modifications is an important underlying mechanism for FXN silencing in FRDA. The relationship between chromatin architecture and histone modification marks in the FXN gene locus is likely to be important for understanding the silencing mechanism. We therefore investigated the spatial organization of the FXN gene locus using the 3C-sequencing method.

DESIGN
EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from patients (GM15850, GM16234 and GM16798) and Healthy control (GM14664 and GM15851) were used for generating 3C-seq libraries.

PLATFORM
