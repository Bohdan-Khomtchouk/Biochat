TITLE
Differences in the transcriptomes of organically and conventionally grown potatoes.

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed on a well-defined set of potato tuber samples grown under different, well-recorded environmental conditions. The data were analysed to assess the potential of transcriptomics to detect differences in gene expression as a result of these environmental conditions. Differences were found for both factors, both in PCA and in ANOVA analysis.

DESIGN
Factorial design; 1 potato cultivar (Sante); 2 fertilizers (organic, conventional); 2 crop protection treatments (organic, conventional), 4 biological replicates, 16 samples.  Raw data files: columns 1 - 11 is Cy3, 12 - 21 is Cy5
