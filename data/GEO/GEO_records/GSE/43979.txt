TITLE
CGH analysis of monkey PG-haESCs (parthenogenic haploid embryonic stem cells)

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
The genomic DNA sample of monkey PG-haESCs were compared to the female adipose cells by comparative genomic hybridization. The data confirmed that these haploid cells sustained genome integrity.

DESIGN
The analysis was performed on a Agilent aCGH G3 Rhesus Macaque 4x180K array to analyse the copy number variations in monkey PG-haESCs, and the genomic DNA of femal monkey adipose was used as control, which had the same background with haploid ESCs.
