TITLE
TM4SF20 is reduced by TGF-β in A549 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To find out genes regulated by TGF-β in A549 cells, we compared gene expression of cells treated with 1ng/ml TGF-β versus non-treated cells and find out that expression of  one transmembrane protein, TM4SF20, is reduced by TGF-β.

DESIGN
A549 cells were treated with or without 1ng/ml TGF-β for 12h. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays
