TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of Arabidopsis exposed to E-2-hexenal

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plants are known to be responsive to volatiles, but knowledge about the molecular players involved in transducing their perception remain scarce. Here the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to E-2-hexenal, one of the green leaf volatiles that are produced upon wounding, herbivory or infection with pathogens is studied. We have taken a transcriptomics approach to identify genes that are induced by E-2-hexenal but not by defense hormones.

DESIGN
In three independent biological experiments, Arabidopsis plants, ecotype Columbia (Col-0), were exposed either to 3 ÂµM aerial E-2-hexenal or to the carrier MeOH for the mock treatment and rosette leaves were harvested after 1h, 3h and 24h.
