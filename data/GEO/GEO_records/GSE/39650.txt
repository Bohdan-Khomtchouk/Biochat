TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between MEFs and induced embryonic Sertoli-like cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare the the genomic profile of MEFs and induced embryonic Sertoli-like cells following 2 weeks of dox withdrawal.

DESIGN
ieSCs (from MEFs and from TTFs) and MEF control were grown in F12/DMEM medium without dox for two weeks.
