TITLE
EZH2 over-expression is associated with gain of chromosome arm 7q and essential for cell cycle progression and a marker of poor prognosis in neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neuroblastoma is an often aggressive childhood cancer with several large chromosomal regions showing recurrent gains or losses. Chromosome 7q is gained in 40-60% of neuroblastomas, but despite being the second most frequent genomic aberration, no oncogenes have been linked to 7q gain.
