TITLE
Expression data from non-small cell lung cancer cell line DV90 after Bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) inhibitor JQ1 treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) inhibition reduces occupancy of BET-family proteins at promoter and enhancer sites resulting in changes in the transcription of specific genes. We used microarray profiling to investigate the transcriptional changes induced by BET inhibitor JQ1 treatment in DV90 cells to identify the underlying changes of gene regulation that lead to JQ1 sensitivity.

DESIGN
DV90 cells (JQ1 sensitive non-small cell lung cancer cell line) were treated with 135 nM (IC50) or 785 nM (IC90) of JQ1 for 4h and 24h. DMSO treated controls served as reference and at least four replicates per condition were collected. RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix HuGene-2.1ST microarrays to identify treatment induced transcriptional changes.
