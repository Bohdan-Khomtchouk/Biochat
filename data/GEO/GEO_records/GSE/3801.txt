TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Ulcerative Colitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Through laser capture microdissection and microarray analysis combined with slightly modified RNA extraction and amplification.   we could analyze the subtle differential expression between colon normal cell and ulcerative colitis. Keywords: Ulcerative Colitis, amplification, microdissection

DESIGN
GSM87318 is control sample and  GSM87319  is Ulcerative Colitis sample.

PLATFORM
GPL1352 [U133_X3P] Affymetrix Human X3P Array
