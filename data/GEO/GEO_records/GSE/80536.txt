TITLE
Identification and characterization of sex-biased microRNAs in Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel)

ORGANISM
Bactrocera dorsalis

SUMMARY
We constructed four small RNA libraries from whole body of females, males (except ovaries and testes) and ovaries, testes of B. dorsalis for deep sequencing. The data analysis revealed 314 known and 221 novel miRNAs from these libraries. 14 female-biased and 12 male-biased miRNAs that may be involved in sexual differentiation were found by comparing the miRNA expression profiles in the four libraries.

DESIGN
Small RNA profiles from whole body of females, males (except ovaries and testes) and ovaries, testes of 12-day old adult Bactrocera dorsalis were generated by Illumina deep sequencing.
