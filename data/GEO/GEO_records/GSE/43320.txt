TITLE
Characterization of Pythium transcriptome and gene expression analysis for different fermentation stage

ORGANISM
Pythium splendens

SUMMARY
We performed transcriptome assembly and gene expression analysis using short-read sequencing technology combined with a tag-based digital gene expression (DGE) system. The results generated a total number of 13,288,892 reads (accumulated length of 1,196,000,280 nt), 169,579 contings and 23,796 unigenes. Based on similarity search with known proteins, a total of 9,398 unigenes were identified with a cut-off E-value of 10-5. Assembled sequences were annotated with gene descriptions, such as gene ontology (GO) and clusters of orthologous group terms (COG). In addition, we obtained approximately 6 million raw tags and a larger number of genes at different fermentation stages (48 h, 100 h and 144 h). The related genes of growth characteristic and lipid biosynthesis were analyzed in detail. Some genes associated with the lipid biosynthesis were selected randomly to confirm digital gene expression (DGE) results by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The transcriptome improves our genetic understanding of Pythium splendens RBB-5 greatly and makes a large number of available gene sequences for further study. Notably, the transcriptome and DGE profiling data of Pythium splendens RBB-5 provide the comprehensive insight into gene expression profiles at different fermentation stages and lay a foundation for further study of optimizing lipid content and growth speed at the molecular level.
