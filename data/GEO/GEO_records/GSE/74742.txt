TITLE
Expression data from EP300 was subjected to knockdown by siRNA interference

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We knocked down EP300 and examined the expression of lncRNA625 target genes. Gene expression profiling of knockdown samples on cDNA microarrays indicated that EP300 affected expression of several lncRNA625 downstream target genes

DESIGN
Stably-transfected KYSE150, transfected with shlncRNA625 or shscramble, were collected and lysed in TRIzol (Life technologies). Microarray experiments were performed following the Affymetrix protocol at the Shanghai Biotechnology Corporation.

PLATFORM
GPL17586 [HTA-2_0] Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 [transcript (gene) version]
