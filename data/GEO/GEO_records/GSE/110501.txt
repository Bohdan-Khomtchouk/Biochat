TITLE
Single-cell transcriptome analyses reveal endothelial cell heterogeneity in tumors and changes following anti-angiogenic treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand tumor stromal cell heterogeneity focusing on tumor endothelial cells and tumor-associated fibroblasts, we isolated single cells from COLO205 tumor xenograft grown sub-cutaneously in SCID mice. To enrich stromal cell content, we removed vast majority of tumor cells by a depletion protocol using anti-CD24 and anti-E-Cadherin antibodies. The remaining single cells were profiled by single cell RNAseq

DESIGN
Tumors were dissociated, sorted into single cells, and profiled by 1 chromium. Single cell 3' library, Gelbeads and multiplex kit were made by using 10x Genomics platform.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus) GPL19415 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens; Mus musculus)
