TITLE
Screening for altered plasma miRNAs in traumatic brain injured patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we examined if the composition of plasma miRNAs is altered in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), and if these changes can be used as diagnostic markers.  A microarray containing 875 human miRNAs was used to compare the miRNA profile of plasma collected from severe TBI patients (GCS â‰¤ 8) to that of age-, gender-, and race-matched healthy volunteers.  This screen identified 108 miRNAs in the plasma of healthy volunteers. Of these, 52 were found to be altered in plasma samples from persons with severe TBI, and an additional 8 miRNAs were detected only in the plasma of TBI patients.

DESIGN
Plasma samples from 10 patients from either severe TBI (experimental group) or healthy volunteers (reference group; age-, gender-, and race-matched ) were pooled, the total RNA extracted in parallel, eluted in 100ul, and dried to 30 ul.  Equal volumes of extracted plasma RNAs were assayed for global miRNA content using a service provider (LC Sciences, Houston, TX).  There were no replicates performed for this screen.  Healthy volunteer group served as the reference.
