TITLE
Gene expression profile of chicken lung in response to Avian influenza virus challenge in broiler chickens

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To determine the host response to AIV in chicken lungs, a whole chicken genome array was used to analyze RNA isolated from chicken lungs infected with AIV (4dpi) or medium control (NS). Dual-color, direct comparisons were carried between AIV infected and non-infected controls. Each comparison includes four biological replicates. There were 508 mRNAs (347 down-regulated) were differentially expressed following AIV infection. From the results, MX1, IL-8, IRF-7, TNFRS19 are identified as strong candidate genes involved in regulating the host response to AIV infection in the lungs of broiler chickens. Further gene specific knock-down assay is warranted to elucidate underlying mechanism of AIV infection regulation in the chicken.

DESIGN
Dual-color, common reference comparisons were carried between AIV infected and non-infected controls. Four biological replicates, with dye swap labeling, were included in the comparisons. Background subtracted signal intensity were collected from 4 arrays and normalized before data analysis.
