TITLE
Diurnal gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 rosette leaves

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
How do the transcript levels of leaf-expressed genes change in a normal day-night cycle? The interest is in genes that are regulated by the circadian clock and the diurnal component (i.e. light, metabolite changes). Plants were grown on soil in a 12/12 h light/dark rythm at 20Â°C day and night. 5 weeks after germination the rosettes of the non-flowering plants were harvested, 15 plants per sample. Plants were harvested at 6 timepoints every 4 hours beginning with the end of the night (still in darkness). Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of the diurnal time series (6 times) were analyzed that were separately grown
