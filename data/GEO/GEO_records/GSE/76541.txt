TITLE
Microarray of NFAT1-shRNA (KD) vs Non-targeting shRNA (NT) metastatic melanoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The metastatic melanoma cell line A375SM was stably transduced with NFAT 1 shRNA utilizing the pSIH-HI-  5     copGFP lentiviral vector. A non-targeting (NT) shRNA construct with no known homology to any human gene was was created and transduced into A375SM cells as a control. These two sets of cells were then subjected to microarray profiling using the Human OneArray microarray (version HOA 6.1, GEO Platform GPL19137) from Phalanx Biotech Group.

DESIGN
NFAT shRNA A375SM cells vs. NT-shRNA A375SM cells were subjected to microarray analysis. 3 biological replicates for each cell type were used.
