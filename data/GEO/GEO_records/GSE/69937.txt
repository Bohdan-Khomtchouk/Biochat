TITLE
PRMT5 is essential for sustaining normal adlut hematopoiesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Examining the effects of PRMT5 loss on the gene expression profile of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells

DESIGN
We established the PRMT5 conditional KO mice, and bred the mice with Mx1 cre transgenic mice to delete PRMT5 in hematopoietic cells. We isolated hematopoetic stem and progenitor cells 3 days after PRMT5 deletion, and examined the gene expression files using RNA-sequencing.
