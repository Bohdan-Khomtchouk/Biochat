TITLE
[E-MTAB-636] Plasmodium yoelii RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Plasmodium yoelii

SUMMARY
Plasmodium yoelii YM asexual blood stage parasites express multiple members of the py235 gene family, part of the super-family of genes including those coding for Plasmodium vivax reticulocyte binding proteins and Plasmodium falciparum RH proteins. Dr Tony Holder's laboratory (NIMR, London) has been successful in deleting one of the RH family genes (Py01365) by transfection and insertion of the TgDHFR gene, and cloned the resulting parasite in YM background. The gene expression patterns of the mutant parasite line were compared to that of the wild type YM parasite.
