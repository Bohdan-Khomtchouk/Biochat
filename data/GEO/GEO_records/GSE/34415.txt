TITLE
The transcriptome of embryos of the green anole, Anolis carolinensis, at 28 and 38 somite pair stages

ORGANISM
Anolis carolinensis

SUMMARY
Anolis carolinensis embryos were collected 0-1 days post egg laying, and total RNA was extracted for RNA-Seq analysis (Illumina Hi-Seq2000). Transcriptome sequence from these stages in the green anole, equivalent to mouse 9.5-10.5 dpc embryos, will help to improve gene annotations in A. carolinensis and provide expression level information for key organogenesis and patterning processes.

DESIGN
Anolis carolinensis embryos were collected 0-1 days post egg laying for RNA-Seq analysis. The two embryos collected were at 28 somite-pair (28S) and 38 somite-pair (38S), equivalent to mouse 9.5 dpc and 10.5 dpc embryos, respectively. Total RNA was extracted using the total RNA component of the mirVana (Ambion) kit, RNA-Seq library prep was carried out using the NuGEN Ovation RNA-Seq kit, and sequencing was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq 2000, following the manufacturer's protocol.  The untrimmed data was then aligned to the Anolis carolinensis reference genome (Anocar2.0) using tophat.
