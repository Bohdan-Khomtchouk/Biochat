TITLE
Biofilm matrix regulation by Candida albicans Zap1

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
The Zap1 ChIP-chips were performed in a/alpha cell types using C-terminally Myc-tagged proteins and Myc antibodies. ChIPs were performed on 48 hour biofilm cells grown in Spider medium.  Two biological replicates were performed, and normalized data is reported in matrix.

DESIGN
Myc tagged strains were compared to untagged control strains.
