TITLE
Expression data from The human glioblastoma cell culture resource: validated cell models representing all molecular subtypes (exon)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To meet the present shortage of relevant GBM cell (GC) lines we developed a library of annotated and validated cell lines derived from surgical samples of GBM patients, maintained under conditions to preserve GSC characteristics. This collection, which we call the Human Glioblastoma Cell Culture (HGCC) resource, consists of a biobank of GC lines and an associated database containing high-resolution molecular data.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from GC lines using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) was labeled and hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays.  Expression levels were RMA-normalized employing the Affymetrix Expression Console software.
