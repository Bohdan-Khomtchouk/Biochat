TITLE
Gene expression profiling in acute myeloid leukemia with mutated NPM

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Approximately one third of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) are characterized by aberrant cytoplasmic localization of Nucleophosmin (NPMc+ AML), consequent to mutations in the NPM putative nucleolar localization signal.  These events are mutually exclusive with the major AML-associated chromosomal rearrangements, and are frequently associated with normal karyotype, Fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) mutations and multilineage involvement. We report the gene expression profiles of 78 de novo AMLs (72 with normal karyotype; 6 with non-major chromosomal abnormalities) that were characterized for the subcellular localization and mutation status of NPM. Unsupervised clustering clearly separated NPMc+ from NPMc- AMLs, regardless of the presence of FLT3 mutations or non-major chromosomal rearrangements, supporting the concept that NPMc+ AML represents a distinct entity. The molecular signature of NPMc+ AML includes up-regulation of several genes putatively involved in the maintenance of a stem cell phenotype, suggesting that NPMc+ AML may derive from a multipotent hematopoietic progenitor.

DESIGN
78 de novo AMLs, negative for AML-associated chromosomal translocations at the cytogenetic and/or molecular level.
