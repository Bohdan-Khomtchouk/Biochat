TITLE
C1 evolved adaptive clones M1-M5

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Chemostat evolution experiment C1 under glucose-limited condition at 30C.  Gene Expression profiles of adaptive clones M1-M5 in evolved conditions compared with original parents. An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract. Genotype: Evolved clones.  The genotype is not necessarily complete. Keywords: all_pairs
