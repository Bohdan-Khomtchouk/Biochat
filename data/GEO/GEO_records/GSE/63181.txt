TITLE
DNA methylation status of Individual 4T1 Clonal Populations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The methylation profiles of 6 cell lines derived from single clones of the 4T1 cell lines were assessed based on genomewide methylation levels The the promoters of genes that were overexpressed in intravasating clones were found had lower methylation levels for those clones relative to the others.

DESIGN
Clone_Methylation 1) 23 clonal lines were established using single cell FACs sorting from the 4T1 mammary cancer cell line. 2) After establishing the lines the clones were assesed (in a pooled setting) for their capacity to intravasate the vascular system. 3) DNA methylation profilling was carried out on a genomewide scale on two intravasting clones and four non-intravasating clones. 4) The methylation levels of the gene promoters and hypomethylated regions of the intravasating clones were then compared with the same regions of non-intravasating clones.
