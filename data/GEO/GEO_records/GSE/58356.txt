TITLE
AxiomÂ® Exome 319 Array data to identify susceptible genetic variations of gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To efficiently identify genetic susceptibility variants for gastric cancer, including rare coding variants, we performed an exome chip-based array study. We found that a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block containing 2 significant variants in PSCA gene increased the risk and two blocks that included 15 suggested variants including TRIM31, TRIM 40, TRIM 10, and TRIM26 regions, and included one suggested variant and OR2H2 gene showed protective associations with gastric cancer susceptibility. In addition, the PLEC region (rs200893203), FBLN2 region (rs201192415), and EPHA2 region (rs3754334) were associated with increased susceptibility

DESIGN
We performed an exome chip-based array study in 329 gastric cancer cases and 683 controls.
