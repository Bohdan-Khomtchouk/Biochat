TITLE
AKAP95 regulates splicing through scaffolding RNAs and RNA processing factors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs significantly contributes to the complexity of gene expression in higher organisms, but the regulation of the splice site selection remains incompletely understood. We have previously demonstrated that a chromatin-associated protein, AKAP95 (AKAP8), has a remarkable activity in enhancing chromatin transcription. In this study, we have shown that AKAP95 physically interacts with many factors involved in transcription and RNA processing, and functionally regulates pre-mRNA splicing. AKAP95 directly promotes splicing in vitro and the inclusion of a specific exon of an endogenous gene FAM126A. The N-terminal YG-rich domain of AKAP95 is important for its binding to RNA processing factors including selective groups of hnRNP proteins, and its zinc finger domains are critical for pre-mRNA binding. Genome-wide binding assays revealed that AKAP95 bound preferentially to proximal intronic regions on a large number of pre-mRNAs in human transcriptome, and AKAP95 depletion predominantly resulted in reduced inclusion of many exons. AKAP95 also selectively coordinates with hnRNP H/F and U proteins in regulating alternative splicing events. We have further shown that AKAP95 directly interacts with itself. Taken together, our results establish AKAP95 as a novel and mostly positive regulator of pre-mRNA splicing and a possible integrator of transcription and splicing regulation, and support a model that AKAP95 regulates pre-mRNA splicing via through scaffolding RNAs and RNA processing factors and facilitating the splice site communication.

DESIGN
Samples 1-8 are RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP)-seq to determine AKAP95 binding to the transcriptome. Samples 9-15 are mRNA-seq to determine effect of AKAP95 knockdown in human 293 cells (9-11) or mouse ES cells (12-15).
