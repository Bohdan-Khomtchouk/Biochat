TITLE
Synthetic lethality/slow growth with acs2-Ts8

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Obtain synthetic lethality/slow growth gene interactors of acs2-Ts8 Keywords: gene mutation

DESIGN
The DNAs from one control single YKO population and one experimental double YKO acs2-Ts8 were labeled with Cy5 and Cy3. These labeled DNAs were hybridized to obtain the signal ratio Cy5/Cy3 (C/E).
