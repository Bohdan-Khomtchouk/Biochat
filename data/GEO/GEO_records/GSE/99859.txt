TITLE
Expression data from mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Assisted reproductive technologies, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), are now frequently used, and increasing evidence indicates that IVF causes gene expression changes in children and adolescents that increase the risk of metabolic diseases. Although such gene expression changes are thought to be due to IVF-induced epigenetic changes, the mechanism remains elusive. We tested whether the transcription factor ATF7, which mediates stress-induced changes in histone H3K9 tri- and di-methylation, the typical epigenetic silencing marks, is involved in the IVF-induced gene expression changes. We investigated the liver transcriptome in 3-week-old mice generated by IVF and normal mating.

DESIGN
This series contains four sets of exression array data. For all sample, we use three CEL files generated by three independent biological samples.
