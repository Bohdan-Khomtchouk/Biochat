TITLE
Genomewide analysis of PTEN deletion in mouse lung epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Triple transgenic mice harboring a conditional Pten allele were developed  and Pten was conditionally deleted in vivo from the lung epithelial cells using the doxycycline dependent Cre/LoxP approach. Microarray analysis of lung RNA isolated from Pten-deleted lung epithelial cells (PtenΔ/Δ) and control mice was performed to identify potential PTEN responsive genes.

DESIGN
Compound-transgenic mice harboring Pten gene with loxP-flanked exon-V (Ptenflox/flox), SP-C–rtTAtg/−; and TetO-Cretg/- were generated. Mice harboring SPC-rtTA/Ptenflox/flox, TetO-Cretg/-/Ptenflox/flox, SPC-rtTA, or TetO-Cretg/- as controls. Likewise, Dox treatment (E6.5 to E14.5) induced tumors in CCSP-rtTA/TetO-Cretg/-/LSL-KrasG12D/PtenΔ/Δ mice between 10-12 weeks of age.  Mice expressing rtTA, or bearing TetO-Cretg/- alone, were normal controls
