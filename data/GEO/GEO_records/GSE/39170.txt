TITLE
Molecular Rejuvenation of Gene Expression Pattern of Photoaged and Intrinsically Aged Human Skin by Broadband Light Treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Studies in model organisms suggest that aged cells can be functionally rejuvenated, but whether this concept applies to human skin is unclear. Here we apply deep sequencing of RNA 3' ends ( " 3-seq " ) to discover the gene expression program associated with human photoaging and intrinsic skin aging (collectively termed " skin aging " ) and the impact of broadband light (BBL) treatment. We find that skin aging was associated with the significantly altered expression level of 2,265 coding and noncoding RNAs, of which 1,293 became " rejuvenated " after BBL treatment, i.e. more similar in expression level of youthful skin. Rejuvenated genes (RGs) included several known key regulators of organismal longevity and their proximal long non-coding RNAs. Skin aging is not associated with systematic changes in 3' end mRNA processing. Hence, BBL treatment can restore the gene expression pattern of photoaged and intrinsically aged human skin to resemble young skin. In addition, our data reveals a novel set of targets that may lead to new insights into the human skin aging process.

DESIGN
Examination of broadband light treated and untreated human skin transcriptomes of 5 women aged 50 years or more. They were compared to the skin transcriptomes of 5 young women aged 30 years or less.
