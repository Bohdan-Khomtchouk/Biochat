TITLE
CG Methylation of Col, Van and reciprocal hybrids using HpaII and MspI digestion

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
CG Methylation of Col, Van and reciprocal hybrids using HpaII and MspI digestion followed by bioprime random labeling, and hybridization to AtTILE1 forward array. Study on constitutive and ploymorphic CG methylation between arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col-0 and Van-0. Study on the inheritance of CG methylation in reciprocal hybrids. Keywords: genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Each genotype by enzyme combination has four replicates, Single chanel. Total four genotypes (Col, Van, Col female x Van male, Van female x Col male). Two enzyme treatments (HpaII, MspI). Total 32 samples.

PLATFORM
GPL1979 AtTile1F to Arabidopsis Tiling 1.0F
