TITLE
CG Methylation of Col, Van and reciprocal hybrids using HpaII and MspI digestion

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
CG Methylation of Col, Van and reciprocal hybrids using HpaII and MspI digestion followed by bioprime random labeling, and hybridization to AtTILE1 forward array. Study on constitutive and ploymorphic CG methylation between arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col-0 and Van-0. Study on the inheritance of CG methylation in reciprocal hybrids. Keywords: genomic hybridization
