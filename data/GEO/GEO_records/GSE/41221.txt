TITLE
Candidatus Liberibacter americanus induces significant reprogramming of the transcriptome of the susceptible citrus genotype

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
This study evaluated the transcriptional reprogramming of a susceptible genotype (Pera sweet orange) challenged with the pathogenic bacteria Candidatus Liberibacter americanus (CaLam), using a customized 385K microarray containing about 32,000 unigene transcripts.

DESIGN
For the microarray experiment were used symptomatic leaves from two Pera sweet orange plants inoculated with either bark or bud pieces infected with Candidatus Liberibacter americanus and two non-infected control plants.
