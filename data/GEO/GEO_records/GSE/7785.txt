PANC-1 cell differentiation

SUMMARY
Multiple commercial microarrays for measuring genome-wide gene expression levels are currently available, including oligonucleotide and cDNA, single- and two-channel formats. This study reports on the results of gene expression measurements generated from identical RNA preparations that were obtained using three commercially available microarray platforms. RNA was collected from PANC-1 cells grown in serum-rich medium and at 24 h following the removal of serum. Three biological replicates were prepared for each condition, and three experimental replicates were produced for the first biological replicate. RNA was labeled and hybridized to microarrays from three major suppliers according to manufacturers’ protocols, and gene expression measurements were obtained using each platform’s standard software. For each platform, gene targets from a subset of 2009 common genes were compared. Correlations in gene expression levels and comparisons for significant gene expression changes in this subset were calculated, and showed considerable divergence across the different platforms, suggesting the need for establishing industrial manufacturing standards, and further independent and thorough validation of the technology. Keywords: Differentiation

DESIGN
PANC-1 cells were grown in serum-containing media followed by exposure to serum-free media for 24 hours. In both groups, RNA extracted from the first biological replicate was derived from 3 culture dishes producing enough sample for three technical replicates, whereas RNA from the second and third biological replicates were derived from one culture dish each.
