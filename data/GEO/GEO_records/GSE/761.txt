TITLE
Long oligonucleotide arrays verse short oligonucleotide arrays -IMR32 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Both in situ synthesized long oligo arrays from Agilent Technologies and short oligo arrays from Affymetrix were used to measure differential gene expression in RNA samples generated from human neuroblastoma cells treated with vehicle (EtOH, 0.01%) and tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ, 10ÂµM) for 24h. For Affymetrix technology, RNAs from vehicle or tBHQ treated groups were analyzed separately. There are three replicates (GSM 11865, 11866, 11858, 11857, 11870, and 11871) which represent the RNA preps harvested at three different time (April 17, 2001, March 15, 2001, and Feb 21, 2001). For Agilent arrays, amplified cRNAs generated from vehicle or tBHQ treated groups were labeled with cy3 or cy5 and were competitively hybridized with Hu 1A oligo arrays. The RNA prep used for Agilent array analysis was not the same as the one used for Affymetrix array analysis. Finally, three replicates (GSM 11828, 11831 and 11835) were generated. Keywords: parallel sample
