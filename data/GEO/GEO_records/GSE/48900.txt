TITLE
RNAseq data from wild type and evolved Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 strains

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25

SUMMARY
We report mRNA expression data from Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 wild type and two evolved strains (Beaumont et al., 2009).  The evolution of one of these strains saw the emergence of colony switching; 1B4 switches rapidly between two different colony phenotypes. These two phenotypes were found to be genetically identical. Thus, in order to gain insight into epigenetic mechanisms of switching, we were interested in identifiying gene expression differences between ancestors and the 1B4 colony phenotypes.

DESIGN
Measuring the expression levels of the wildtype (SBW25), the evolved strain 1A4 and the evolved strain 1B4. 1B4 exists in two different phenotypic states (CAP+, CAP-); these were seperated by centrifugation prior to individual analysis. This means there are four datasets in total.
