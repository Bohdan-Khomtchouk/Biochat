TITLE
mmu-miR-709 gene targets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed miRNA profiles in normal liver and identified miR-709, a highly abundant miRNA in this tissue. Through microarray analysis, gene targets were identified. Thirty-six genes were significantly down-regulated > 2-fold in the miR-709-treated relative to the control group, and at least three of them, including Ras-related protein 11b (Rab11b), phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (Pctp), and carboxylesterase 1g (Ces1g), are direct targets. miR-709 regulates genes implicated in cytoskeleton organization, extracellular matrix attachment, cell proliferation and fatty acid metabolism, suggesting a coordinated response during cell division, when cytoskeleton remodeling requires substantial changes in gene expression.

DESIGN
Mouse primary hepatocytes were transfected with miR-709 or the control miRNA Cel-239b (1 Âµg) (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO), and harvested 24 hours later. Gene expression profiles were then generated using Affymetrix mRNA microarrays.
