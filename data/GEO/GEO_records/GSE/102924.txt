TITLE
Glioblastoma stem cells infected by ZIKA virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We repoted the Glioblastoma stem cells(GSCs) infected by two strains of ZIKA virus, the Brazil and Dakar strains. The ZIKV was added into the medium of GSCs for 48 hours, the RNA was harvested after ZIKV infection. We found that the GSCs up-regulated the Type 1 & 2 interferons after infected by ZIKV

DESIGN
3 GSCs in two status(GSCs vs DGCs) were infected by ZIKV-Brazil and Dakar strains for 48 hours

PLATFORM
