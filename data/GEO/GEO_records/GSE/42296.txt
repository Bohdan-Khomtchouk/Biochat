TITLE
Distinct, non-overlapping gene panels of peripheral blood gene expression predict response to infliximab therapy in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify markers predicting responder status in infliximab treatment in 19 rheumatoid arthritis and 20 Crohn's disease patients at week 0 and week 2 of treatment.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood samples were obtained at week 0 and week 2 of inxliximab treatment and global gene expression profiling identified markers of responder status.
