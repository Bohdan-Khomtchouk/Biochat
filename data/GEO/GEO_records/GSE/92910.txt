TITLE
Gene expression profiling of histone deacetylase inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of changes in gene expression levels after after prolonged exposure of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines to low doses of Panobinostat (LBH589), a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing was performed after 96 hours and 4 weeks of incubation 10 nmol/L of LBH589 of two triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (HCC1806 and MDA-MB-231). All the expreiments were performed in biological triplicates

PLATFORM
