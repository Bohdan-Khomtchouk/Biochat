TITLE
Microarray-based species identification of Streptomyces spp. isolated from potato scab lesions in Norway

ORGANISM
Streptomyces scabiei ; Streptomyces turgidiscabies ; Streptomyces europaeiscabiei

SUMMARY
28 Streptomyces strains isolated from common scab lesions of potato tubers from a wide geographic range in Norway, were selected for microarray analysis. The selected strains were subjected to species identification by microarray, 16S phylogenetic analysis and PCR; and microarray-based comparative genome analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. turgidiscabies and S. europaeiscabiei in Norway.

DESIGN
28 Norwegian Streptomyces strains were hybridized in duplicates, one S.turgidiscabies strain (St32) and one S.scabies strain (ATCC49173) were hybridized in 4 replicates. Two out of 64 hybridizations failed (replicate hybridizations of Norwegian strains 33 and 44), for a total of 62 samples. Normalization was based on log-ratios against reference strain.
