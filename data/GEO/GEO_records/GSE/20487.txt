TITLE
Microarray-based species identification of Streptomyces spp. isolated from potato scab lesions in Norway

ORGANISM
Streptomyces scabiei

SUMMARY
28 Streptomyces strains isolated from common scab lesions of potato tubers from a wide geographic range in Norway, were selected for microarray analysis. The selected strains were subjected to species identification by microarray, 16S phylogenetic analysis and PCR; and microarray-based comparative genome analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. turgidiscabies and S. europaeiscabiei in Norway.
