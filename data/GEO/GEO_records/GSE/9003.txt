TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of melanoma cell lines using high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although a number of genes related to melanoma development have been identified through candidate gene screening approaches, few studies have attempted to conduct such analyses on a genome-wide scale. Here we use Illumina 317K whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to define a comprehensive allelotype of melanoma based on loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number changes in a panel of 76 melanoma cell lines. In keeping with previous reports, we found frequent LOH on chromosome arms 9p (72%), 10p (55%), 10q (55%), 9q (49%), 6q (43%), 11q (43%), and 17p (41%). Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) can be identified through homozygous deletion (HD). We detected 174 HDs, the most common of which targeted CDKN2A (n = 33). The second highest frequency of HD occurred in PTEN (n = 8), another well known melanoma TSG. HDs were also common for PTPRD (n = 7) and HDAC4 (n = 3), TSGs recently found to be mutated or deleted in other cancer types. Analysis of other HDs and regions of LOH that we have identified might lead to the characterization of further melanoma TSGs. We noted 197 regional amplifications, including some centered on the melanoma oncogenes MITF (n = 9), NRAS (n = 3), BRAF (n = 3), and CCND1 (n = 3). Other amplifications potentially target novel oncogenes important in the development of a subset of melanomas. The numerous focal amplifications and HDs we have documented here are the first step toward identifying a comprehensive catalog of genes involved in melanoma development, some of which may be useful prognostic markers or targets for therapies to treat this disease.
