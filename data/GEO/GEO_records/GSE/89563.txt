TITLE
Expression data from patients with different stages of clear cell renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of renal cancers, which forms tumors strongly supplied with blood vessels, here we wanted to check the exprresion of genes on different stages of tumor progression, and find which of them changes significantly with increased grade.

DESIGN
Tumor samples from patients were divided into four grades by hospital pathologists. I- grade refers to the first stage of disease, II- grade to second, III- grade to third and IV- grade to fourth. Each patient received unrepeatable number. RNA extraction were performed using Eurx kit, and then microarrays were performed using Affymetrix GeneChip WT PLUS Reagent Kit.
