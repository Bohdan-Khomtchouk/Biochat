TITLE
Human BE(2)-C neuronal responses to type I IFN stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human neuronal differentiation alters responsiveness to innate immune stimuli and virus infections. We used microarrays to examine the transcriptional responses of the human BE(2)-C neuroblastoma cell line to retinoic acid-induced differentiation and type I IFN stimulation.

DESIGN
Cultured BE(2)-C cells were differentiated with 10 uM all-trans retinoic acid (RA) for 3 weeks, incubated with universal type I IFN (IFNa-A/D) for 6 or 12 h, and Affymetrix Human Genome Array U133 Plus 2.0 chips were used to analyze transcript levels.
