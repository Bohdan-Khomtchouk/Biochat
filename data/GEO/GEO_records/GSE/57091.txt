TITLE
Gene based expression changes in glioblastoma cells after downregulation of MPS1 kinase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes were analyzed in U251 GBM cells after downregulation of MPS1 by RNA interference technology at different time points

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was used to compare the mRNA expression profile of siMPS1 silenced U251 cells compared to siNegative (siNeg) and untransfected (Control) cells at 6, 24 and 48 hours post tranfection
