TITLE
Gene expression in the mouse brain following early pregnancy exposure to ethanol [Hippocampus_Females_P87]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exposure to alcohol during early embryonic or fetal development has been linked with a variety of adverse outcomes, the most common of which are structural and functional abnormalities of the central nervous system. Behavioral and cognitive deficits reported in individuals exposed to alcohol in utero include intellectual impairment, learning and memory difficulties, diminished executive functioning, attention problems, poor motor function and hyperactivity. The economic and social costs of these outcomes are substantial and profound. Improvement of neurobehavioural outcomes following prenatal alcohol exposure requires greater understanding of the mechanisms of alcohol-induced damage to the brain. Here we use a mouse model of relatively moderate ethanol exposure early in pregnancy and profile gene expression in the hippocampus and caudate putamen of adult male offspring. The effects of offspring sex and age on ethanol-sensitive hippocampal gene expression were also examined.

DESIGN
Hippocampus, female, 12 weeks old Two groups, ethanol-exposed (EtOH) and Control, with 6 replicates per group.
