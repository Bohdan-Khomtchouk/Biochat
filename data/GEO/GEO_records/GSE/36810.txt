TITLE
Expression data from mouse lungs exposed in-utero and/or as an adult to second-hand smoke (SHS)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure during pregnancy has adverse effects on offspring. We used microarrays to characterize the gene expression changes caused by in-utero exposure and adult exposure to SHS in adult mouse lungs.

DESIGN
Left lungs from Balb/c male mice were collected at 15 weeks of age for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 microarrays. Based on their smoke exposure status, there are 4 groups of mice, each exposed in-utero to filtered-air or SHS and as an adult to filtered-air or SHS. We extracted RNA from 4 animals from each group for microarray analysis (N = 16 samples).
