TITLE
Comparative analysis of gene expression identifies distinct molecular signatures of bone marrow- and periosteal skeletal stem/progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genetic comparison between periosteal skeletal stem cells and bone marrow skeletal stem cells in mice

DESIGN
Microarray was performed on periosteal derived skeletal stem cells and bone marrow derived skeletal stem cells in Mx1-cre; Ocn-GFP and Mx1-cre; Nestin-GFP mice, respectively. We used Affymetrix array.

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
