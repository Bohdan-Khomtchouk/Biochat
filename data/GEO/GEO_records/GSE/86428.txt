TITLE
A High Resolution Profile of NMD Substrates in Yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report a high resolution catalouge of NMD substrates using RNA-Seq. We discovered several hundred new substrates for NMD. Using published ribosome footprint profiling data, we measured ribosome densities of normal-looking NMD substrates and non-NMD substrates. NMD substrates exhibited a striking difference in normalized ribosome occupancy in wild-type and UPF1ÔÅÑ cells. We also found that normal looking NMD substrates have higher ratio of out of frame reads, lower codon optimalites and a higher propensity to have long stretches of non-optimal codons.

DESIGN
Total RNA profilies of 7 different yeast strains grown in rich media.
