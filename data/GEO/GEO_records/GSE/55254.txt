TITLE
Microarray analysis of the testis from the aromatase overexpression transgenic and WT mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To futher find the gene expression due to the aromatase overexpression in the mouse testis,we have employ whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes compared to the wild type mice. The testes were taken from 5 month old aromatase overexpression  mice and  WT mice as control.

DESIGN
We investigated  genes that were significantly upregulated or downregulated in AROM+ mouse testis compared with WT testis. Two groups: 1) total RNA from three 5 month old  AROM+ overexpression transgenic mice testes were collected and processed for microarray;2) total RNA from three 5 month old WT mice testes as control.
