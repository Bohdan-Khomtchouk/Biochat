TITLE
Response of Phaeocystis antarctica under changing iron conditions

ORGANISM
Phaeocystis antarctica

SUMMARY
The study aims at deciphering the response of Phaeocystis antarctica under iron limitation and iron supplementation at a transcriptomic level.

DESIGN
Phaeocystis antarctica strain #25, isolated from Ross Sea, was acclimated under iron limitation. From that stock culture, 4 replicates were inoculated under iron limitation for 48h 16:8 light:dark. After 48h, Ferric chloride was added to the 4 replicates. Samples were taken at 0h (before iron supplementation), and at 14h, 24h and 72h (after iron supplementation), in all 4 replicates except 14h (3 samples). BioProject accession: PRJNA395466, SRA Study accession: SRP113407 Please note that the processed data identifiers belong to TSA project GFUQ00000000 (status: processing).  The lookup table of the gene IDs and TSA IDs is available at the foot of this record.
