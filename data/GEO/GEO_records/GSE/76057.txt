TITLE
m1A marks translation initiation sites in human and mouse messenger RNA [microarray]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed a novel approach, m1A-seq, for high-resolution mapping of the transcriptome-wide m1A landscape, based on antibody-mediated capture followed by massively parallel sequencing. Using this method we performed immunodepletion of methylated transcipts to assess the average methylation level

DESIGN
Immunodepletion of m1A modified transcripts in human compared to the input, allows for estimation of the fraction of methylated transcripts. We compared the expression levels of sup (immunodepleted) and input methylated transcripts to deduce the fraction of m1A methylation.
