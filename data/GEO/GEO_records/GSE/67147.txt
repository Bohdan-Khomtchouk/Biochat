TITLE
Expression data from intravaginal Chlamydia-infected mouse T lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Intravaginal infection of C57BL/6 mice with Chlamydia muridarum promotes activation and migration of effector lymphocytes to the genital tract mucosa. Among up regulated genes related to the specific immune response 7 days after infection we aimed to detect adhesion molecules associated with migration to this mucosa. We used microarrays to determine the global gene expression changes underlying homing to genital tract mucosa and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during effector T lymphocyte migration to this tissue.

DESIGN
Circulating TEM cells were sorted from three 7d Chlamydia-infected mice (VAG group) and three contemporary sham-treated mice (controls). Blood samples (≈500µl) were immediately lysed using a RBC lysis buffer. T cells were identified as CD3+ and finally sorted as CD3+ CD62L- CD44+ activated T effector memory cells. Total RNA from each of the six samples was analyzed with an individual Affymetrix  HT MG-430 PM Strip Array.
