TITLE
RNA sequencing of Mycobacterium abscessus under infection-relevant conditions

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium abscessus

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of Mycobacterium abscessus in four infection-relevant culture conditions: hypoxic stress, artificial sputum medium, kanamycin-treated medium, and erythromycin-treated medium.

DESIGN
Triplicate cultures of M. abscessus were grown in (1) Artificial Sputum media, (2) hypoxic conditions, (3) the presence of kanamycin, and (4) the presence of erythromycin. Triplicate controls were prepared for sample (1) and samples (2-4).
