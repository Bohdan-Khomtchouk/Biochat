TITLE
Characterization of the small RNA content of Trypanosoma cruzi extracellular vesicles

ORGANISM
Trypanosoma cruzi

SUMMARY
A growing body of evidence in mammalian cells indicates that secreted vesicles can be used to mediate intercellular communication processes by transferring various bioactive molecules, including mRNAs and microRNAs. Based on these findings, we decided to analyze whether T. cruzi-derived extracellular vesicles contain RNA molecules and performed a deep sequencing and genome-wide analysis of a size-fractioned cDNA library (16â€“40 nt) from extracellular vesicles secreted by noninfective epimastigote and infective metacyclic trypomastigote forms. Our data show that the small RNAs contained in these extracellular vesicles originate from multiple sources, including tRNAs. In addition, our results reveal that the variety and expression of small RNAs are different between parasite stages, suggesting diverse functions. Taken together, these observations call attention to the potential regulatory functions that these RNAs might play once transferred between parasites and/or to mammalian host cells.

DESIGN
Small RNAs profiles (16-40 nt) of epimastigote-derived extracellular vesicles, metacyclic trypomastigote-derived extracellular vesicles and metacyclic trypomastigote parental cells.
