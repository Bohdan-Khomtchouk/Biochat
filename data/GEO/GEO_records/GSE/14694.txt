TITLE
Computational and Analytical Framework for Small RNA Profiling by High-Throughput Sequencing (reproducibility)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The purpose of this work was to describe a computational and analytical methodology for profiling small RNA by high-throughput sequencing.  The datasets here were used to assess the reproducibility of small RNA datasets produced using Illumina sequencing-by-synthesis technology (SBS).

DESIGN
We analyzed the reproducibility of small RNA SBS datasets by comparing libraries generated for biological replicates (rep1 and rep2) and technical replicates (rep2 and rep3).

PLATFORM
GPL9062 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Arabidopsis thaliana)
