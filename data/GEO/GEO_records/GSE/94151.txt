SUMMARY
Myocardial infarction (MI) is a highly prevalent cardiac emergency, which results in adverse left ventricular remodeling exacerbating progressive heart failure. Inflammation in post-MI is necessary for myocyte repair and wound healing. However, it is also a key component of subsequent heart failure pathology. Myoblasts transplantation after MI have been fulfilled a good effect on cardiac repair, but the occasion, complications of transplantation, and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we found that myoblast transplantation decreased the expression of many pro-inflammatory genes and the activation of inflammation-related signal pathway in heart tissue of pig post MI, which mainly contributed to the improved heart function and attenuated damage of myocardial cells.

DESIGN
We constructed a minipig surgical model of myocardial infarction. Myoblasts were intramyocardially injected into the infarct and border zone of heart. The infarct and border zone heart tissues from minipigs treated with myoblast transplantation or untreated control (one sample for every group) were submitted for gene expression array analysis.
