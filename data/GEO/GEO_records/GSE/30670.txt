TITLE
Context-Specific Regulation of NF-κB Target Gene Expression by EZH2 in Breast Cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Both EZH2 and NF-κB contribute to aggressive breast cancer, yet whether the two oncogenic factors have functional cross-talk in breast cancer is largely unknown. Here, we uncover an unexpected role of EZH2 in conferring the constitutive activation of NF-κB target gene expression in ER-negative basal-like breast cancer cells.  This function of EZH2 is independent of its histone methyltransferase activity but requires the physical interaction with RelA/RelB to promote the expression of NF-κB targets. Intriguingly, EZH2 acts oppositely in repressing NF-κB targets in ER-positive luminal-like breast cancer cells by interacting with ER and directing repressive histone methylation. Thus, EZH2 function as a double-facet molecule in breast cancers, functioning either as a transcriptional activator or repressor of NF-κB targets, in a cell context-dependent manner. These findings reveals an additional mechanism by which EZH2 promotes breast cancer progression and also underscore the need for developing context-specific strategy for therapeutic targeting of EZH2 in breast cancers.
