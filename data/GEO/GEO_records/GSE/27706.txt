TITLE
CD69-dependent gene expression in activated CD4 T cells from the spleen of Mus musculus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD69 is a transmembrane protein expressed on the surface of activated leukocyte. The ligand for CD69 and the intracellular signaling pathway of this molecule are yet unknown. It is widely used as a marker of activated lymphocyte, but its function in immune system is not known. We used micro-array to define genes whose expression is regulated by activation antigene CD69.

DESIGN
CD4 T cells were isolated from the spleen of wt B6 and CD69-deficient B6 mice and in vitro activated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads. On one groupe of wt B6 cells, CD69 was activated using a anti-CD69 and secoundary antibody. RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays was performed for wt B6, CD69-activated wt B6 and CD69-deficient B6 CD4 T cells.
