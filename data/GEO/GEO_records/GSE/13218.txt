TITLE
Gene expression profiling of YAP wild-type or mutants overexpressing MCF10A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study compares gene expression change upon expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP) wild-type or mutants in order to establish the importance of TEAD binding and WW domains in the gene-induction function of YAP. The results indicate that gene-induction is seriously comprised in YAP-S94A (TEAD binding domain mutant) expressing cells. And mutantion of WW domains (YAP-W1W2) also affect a fraction of YAP induced genes. Therefore both TEAD binding domain and WW domains are required for the full function of YAP in gene-induction.
