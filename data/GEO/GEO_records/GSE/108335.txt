TITLE
Diferential Gene Expression of CAR T cell Derived from Naïve mice vs Tumor Bearing mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CAR T cell derived from tumor bearing mice show positive correlation with T cell exhausion, TH17 penotype and T cell activation, and upregulated in Cholesterol, carbohydrate matabolism, over expression in hypoxia, deminished in IL12-family cytokines, IFN signalling

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global differeential gene expression of these CAR T cells derived from Naïve or Tumor Bearing mouse.
