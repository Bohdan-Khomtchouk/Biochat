TITLE
Gene expression data of BCR-ABL1 transformed B cell precursors from BCL6 wild-type and BCL6 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the mechanism of BCL6-mediated pre-B cell survival signaling, we investigated the gene expression pattern in BCR-ABL1-transformed BCL6+/+ and BCL6-/- B cell precursors. Pharmacological inhibition of BCR-ABL1 was performed with the BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitor STI571 (Imatinib).

DESIGN
BCR-ABL1 transformed B cell precursors of BCL6 wildtype and BCL6 knockout mice were either treated with 10ÂµM STI571 (Imatinib) for 16 hours or cultured in absence of STI571. Three samples for each condition were processed.
