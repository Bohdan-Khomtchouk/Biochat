TITLE
Development of NUP98-HOXA9 gene expression signatures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular mechanisms induced by the leukemic fusion protein NUP98-HOXA9, we performed gene expression analysis of human hematopoietic progenitors and primary samples of patients that express NUP98-HOXA9. By combining these data with ChIP-seq results, we observed that the fusion protein is able to both activate and repress the expression of its target genes.

DESIGN
Three independent experiments were performed using different clones of the human hematopoietic progenitor model (hHP-NH) and control model (hHP-empty vector). On the other hand, RNA from seven primary samples was analyzed.
