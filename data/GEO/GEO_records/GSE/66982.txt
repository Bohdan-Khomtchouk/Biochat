TITLE
Transcriptional landscape of XYR1 in Trichoderma reesei during the degradation of cellulosic material

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
Hypocrea jecorina (anamorph Trichoderma reesei) is one of the most well studied fungi used in biotechnology industry. This fungus is today a paradigm for the comercial scale production of different plant cell wall degrading enzymes, mainly cellulases and hemicellulases. The objective of this study was to analyze the transcriptional profiling of T. reesei (Δxyr1) grown in presence of cellulose, sophorose and glucose as the carbon source using RNA-seq approach.

DESIGN
T. reesei (Δxyr1) was grown in Mandels-Andreotti medium, supplemented with 1% of cellulose, 2% of glucose or 1mM of sophorose. The cultures were incubated on an orbital shaker (200 rpm) at 28°C for 8 and 24 hours using cellulose as carbon source; for 24 and 48 hours with glucose as the carbon; and 2, 4 and 6 hours with sophorose as the carbon source. In the latter, the mycelium was previously grown on glycerol for 24 hours and then transferred to 20 mL of Mandels-Andreotti medium without peptone. All experiments were performed in three biological replicates. The resultant mycelia were collected by filtration, frozen and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. After growth, total RNA was isolated from the mycelia using TRIzol® reagent. RNA-seq experiments were performed by LGC Genomics GmbH (Berlin/Germany) using the platform Illumina/HiSeq2000.
