TITLE
Pregnancy changes expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: pregnancy is associated with reduced activity of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the biological mechanisms underlying this pregnancy-related decrease in disease activity are poorly understood. This data series contains the subset of data used to generate a healthy donors signature comparing female healthy specimens before pregnancy with respect to female healthy specimens at ninth month pregnancy.

DESIGN
Subjects were followed in the outpatients clinic and blood was collected before pregnancy and at the following time points during pregnancy: first trimester (gestational age at sampling 12 weeks), second trimester (24 weeks), and third trimester (36 weeks). Before-pregnancy samples were obtained in a treatment-free period and after anticonceptional drug withdrawal. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from 11 women (7 healthy donors before pregnancy and 4 healthy donors at 9th month pregnancy) were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarray technology.
