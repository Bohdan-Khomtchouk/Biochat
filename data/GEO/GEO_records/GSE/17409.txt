TITLE
Pregnancy changes expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: pregnancy is associated with reduced activity of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the biological mechanisms underlying this pregnancy-related decrease in disease activity are poorly understood. This data series contains the subset of data used to generate a healthy donors signature comparing female healthy specimens before pregnancy with respect to female healthy specimens at ninth month pregnancy.
