TITLE
Gene regulation of candidate cancer gene DIP2C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: The disco-interacting protein 2 homolog C (DIP2C) gene is an uncharacterized gene found mutated in breast and lung cancers. We want to understand the role of DIP2C in tumor development. Methods: We engineered human DIP2C knockout cell systems by genome editing, and then use next-generation sequencing to identify the genes affected by the loss of DIP2C. Results: Inactivation of DIP2C triggers substantial gene expression changes, cellular senescence and epithelial to mesenchymal transition in cancer cells.

DESIGN
To investigate if loss of DIP2C affects gene expression we performed RNA sequencing and compared gene expression levels in the DIP2C knockout cells to those in parental RKO cells.
