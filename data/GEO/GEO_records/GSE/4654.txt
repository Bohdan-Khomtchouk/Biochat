TITLE
Genetic reconstruction of a functional transcriptional regulatory network

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Although global analyses of transcription factor binding provide one view of potential transcriptional regulatory networks, regulation also occurs at levels distinct from transcription factor binding. Here, we use a genetic approach to identify targets of transcription factors in yeast and reconstruct a functional regulatory network. First, we profiled transcriptional responses in S. cerevisiae strains with individual deletions of 263 transcription factors. Then we used directed-weighted graph modeling and regulatory epistasis analysis to identify indirect regulatory relationships between these transcription factors, and from this we reconstructed a functional transcriptional regulatory network. The enrichment of promoter motifs and Gene Ontology annotations provide insight into the biological functions of the transcription factors. Data values are X scores and corresponding p-values derived using an error model. Keywords: X scores and corresponding p-values derived using an error model

DESIGN
We profiled transcriptional responses upon the individual deletion of more than 260 TFs. We used a directed-weighted graph modelling approach and regulatory epistasis analysis to identify indirect regulatory relationships, and thus constructed a refined, functional transcriptional regulatory network.
