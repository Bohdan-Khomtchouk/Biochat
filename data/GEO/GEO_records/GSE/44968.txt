TITLE
Expression data from human multiple myeloma cells with or without IRE1-XBP1 silencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to develop gene signatures for XBP1 and IRE1 in myeloma cells to explore the role of this UPR/differentiation pathway in proteasome inhibitor resistance.

DESIGN
RPMI-8226 and JJN3 human myeloma cells were infected with lentivirus expressing non-targeted (NT) shRNA, shIRE1 or shXBP1 and processed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Cells without lentiviral infection were processed as controls for gene expression changes related to the cellular response to lentivirus.
