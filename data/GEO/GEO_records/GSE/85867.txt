TITLE
Comparative Methylome Analyses Identify Epigenetic Regulatory Loci of Human Brain Evolution [SNP]

ORGANISM
Macaca ; Macaca fascicularis ; Pan troglodytes ; Homo sapiens ; Hoolock leuconedys

SUMMARY
We report the application of DNA sequencing technology for high-throughput sequencing of mix candidate genes' PCR products totally 38 based on DNA from human, chimpanzee, gibbon, macaque and crab eating macaque  profrontal cortex tissues.

DESIGN
Mix candidate genes PCR products from 1 tissues, 22 individual humans, 2 individual chimpanzees, 1 individual gibbons,15 individual rhesus macaques and 5 crab eating macaques were sequenced by using MiSeq
