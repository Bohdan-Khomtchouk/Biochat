TITLE
Human Adrenocortical Tumors: normal cortex vs inactive adenoma vs cortisol secreting adenoma vs adrenocortical cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human adrenocortical tumors. Gene expression profile of normal adrenal cortex, hormonally inactive adenoma, cortisol-secreting Cushing-adenoma and primary adrenocortical cancer tissues were compared. The goal of this study was to identify significant differences in the gene expression of these groups. Further aim was to reveal biologically relevant pathogenetic pathways altered at transcriptional and posttranscriptional level, as well.

DESIGN
mRNA expression profiles of normal adrenal cortex, inactive adenoma, cortisol secreting adenoma and primary adrenocortical cancer tissues were compared. Biological replicates: 4 samples per each experimental group were investigated. Whole genome expression analysis was performed in a two-colour microarray design by comparing individual samples to a uniform reference pool of all samples examined on Agilent Whole Human Genome 4x44 K microarray platform.
