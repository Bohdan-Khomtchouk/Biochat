TITLE
The differential expression pattern of human dental epithelial cells vs non-dental epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify the genes that are specific to the ameloblast phenotype, we collected epithelial cells differentiated from HESCs (ES-EC), human fetal oral epithelia cells (OE), and presecretory ameloblasts (PAB) and SAB, and conducted the microarray to compare the overall transcription patterns of these four cell types. Stage specific ameloblasts did exhibit distinctive gene expression patterns as comapred to non-dental epithelia cells ES-EC and OE. There were 908 genes in PAB and 1203 genes in SAB that were either down-regulated or upregulated more than 2.0-fold as comapred to the non-dental epthelial cells ( average of ES-EC and OE)

DESIGN
Stage specific secretory ameloblasts (SAB) and maturation ameloblasts (MAB) were laser microdissected from mandibular incisors of control and 50 ppm F treated mice.
