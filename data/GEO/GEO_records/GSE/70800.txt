TITLE
Molecular signatures of neural connectivity in the olfactory cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose:This work aimed to identify the genetic profiles of piriform projection neurons and characterize their spatial organization within the piriform cortex. Methods: We microdissected the three layers of pirifrom cortex by laser capture (LMD) and performed RNA deep sequencing in order to identify layer-specific molecular markers, we then validated these data by using RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.We next performed anterograde neural tracing experiments to identify piriform target regions, and retrograde neural tracing experiments to analyze how piriform projection neurons are organized within piriform cortex.We then combined the analysis of patterns of gene expression with retrograde tracing experiments to identify molecular signatures of the different subclasses of piriform projecting neurons. Results:We show that layers and sub-layers of the piriform cortex can be discriminated by gene expression patterns in adult piriform cortex. We observe that neurons projecting to distinct target areas are localized in distinct layers and express specific genes. We demonstrate that these molecular signatures of piriform projection neurons are maintained in reeler mice, in which cortical lamination is lost and neural positioning is scrambled, suggesting that piriform output connectivity strictly depends on the molecular programm, rather than a proper lamination of the cortex. Conclusion:These results provide important insights into the principles underling the piriform connectivity.

DESIGN
3 replicates per each layer (three layers) of piriform cotrex were used for the RNA deep sequancing
