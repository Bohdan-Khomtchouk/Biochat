TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Hepatic Genes Differentially Expressed in the Presence of the Maslinic Acid in Olive Oil

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Two olive oils only differing in the presence of maslinic acid were prepared. Using DNA microarrays, hepatic gene expression was analysed in apoE-deficient mice with a C57BL/6J genetic background Keywords: diet study
