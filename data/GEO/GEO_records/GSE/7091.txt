TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Hepatic Genes Differentially Expressed in the Presence of the Maslinic Acid in Olive Oil

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Two olive oils only differing in the presence of maslinic acid were prepared. Using DNA microarrays, hepatic gene expression was analysed in apoE-deficient mice with a C57BL/6J genetic background Keywords: diet study

DESIGN
The experimental animals were 12, two-month old, female, homozygous apoE KO mice with a C57BL/6J genetic background. Two study groups were established: a) one received a chow diet (Teklad Mouse/Rat Diet no. 2014, Harlan Teklad, Harlan Ib√©rica, Barcelona, Spain) supplemented with 10% (w/w) olive oil (diet OO) (n=6), and b) the other received the same chow diet but supplemented with 10% (w/w) maslinic acid- enriched olive oil (diet MAOO; n= 6 and).
