TITLE
Multivalent binding of PWWP2A to H2A.Z-marked transcriptional active chromatin regulates mitosis and organ development [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The essential histone variant H2A.Z affects various DNA-based biological processes by so far not well understood mechanisms. Using a comprehensive label-free quantitative mass spectrometry-based approach we identified the human H2A.Z nucleosome interactome providing further insights into H2A.Zâ€™s regulatory functions. Besides histone modification writer, eraser and reader complexes we identified PWWP2A as a novel H2A.Z-nucleosome binder. PWWP2A binds unprecedented strong to chromatin through a concerted multivalent binding mode. Two internal protein regions separately allow H2A.Z-specificity and nucleosome interaction, whereas the PWWP domain mediates direct DNA binding. PWWP2A is found at euchromatic regions where it preferable binds to the H2A.Z-nucleosome-containing transcriptional start sites of transcribed genes. Cellular depletion of PWWP2A results in impaired proliferation caused by a mitotic delay likely due to deregulation of involved target genes. According with the strong cellular phenotype, knockdown of frog PWWP2A leads to severe developmental cranial facial defects arising from neural crest cell differentiation and migration problems. Together, this study identifies PWWP2A as an H2A.Z-specific multivalent chromatin binder and provides a novel link between H2A.Z, chromosome segregation and organ development.
