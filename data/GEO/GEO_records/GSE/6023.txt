TITLE
Expression data of testis biopsies obtained from men with spermatogenic impairment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Testicular biopsies were extracted surgically from men presenting with different states of spermatogenic impairments. The biopsies were scored histologically according to the Johnsen score system and microarrray technology was applied in order to correlate the gene expression pattern with the morphological categorization. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Testicular biopsies were extracted surgically and fixed in RNAlater. Total RNA was extracted by GITC-method and post-purified using RNeasy columns. Arrays were hybridized overnight with 10 ug of Biotin-11-UTP-labeled cRNA, stringency washed and stained with Cy5-Streptavidin.
