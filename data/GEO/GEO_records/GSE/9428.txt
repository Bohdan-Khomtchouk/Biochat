TITLE
T cell-suppression by programmed cell death 1 ligand 1(PD-L1) on IFNg-treated retinal pigment epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adult (6- to 8-week-old) C57BL/6 purchased from CLEA Japan Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) were used as donors ocular pigment epithelium (PE). To cultivate retinal PE (RPE) eyes were cut into two parts along a circumferential line posterior to the ciliary process, creating a ciliary body-deficient posterior eyecup.  The eyecup was then incubated in 0.2% trypsin (Biowhitaker) for 1 hr.  These tissues were triturated to make a single cell suspension, and then re-suspended in the medium. Keywords: Comparison

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression pattern in Mouse Primary Cultured Cell Lines (RPE, RPE+IFNg).
