TITLE
Molecular architecture of transcription factor hotspots in early adipogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we have used digital genomic footprinting to precisely define protein localization for several adipogenic transcription factors at a genome-wide level. In combination with ChIP-seq data, these analyses reveal novel molecular insight into the organization of transcription factors at hotpot regions, which provides a new framework for understanding transcription factor cooperativity on chromatin.

DESIGN
Digital genomic footprinting and gene expression in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes by high throughput sequencing.
