TITLE
Long term culture of genome-stable bipotent progenitor cells from adult human liver

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite the enormous replication potential of the human liver, there are currently no culture systems available that sustain hepatocyte replication and/or function in vitro. We have shown previously that single mouse Lgr5+ liver stem cells can be expanded as epithelial organoids in vitro and can be differentiated into functional hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. We now describe conditions allowing long-term expansion of adult bile duct-derived bi-potent progenitor cells from human liver. The expanded cells are highly stable at the chromosome and structural level, while single base changes occur at very low rates. The cells can readily be converted into functional hepatocytes in vitro and upon transplantation in vivo. Organoids from Î±1-antitrypsin deficiency and Alagille Syndrome patients mirror the in vivo pathology. Clonal long-term expansion of primary adult liver stem cells opens up experimental avenues for disease modeling, toxicology studies, regenerative medicine and gene therapy.

DESIGN
We generated arrays from whole human liver tissue, and human liver derived cultures maintained in our defined medium. Genes 4 fold differentially expressed  were used for the clustering analsyis (see matrix 1). For the genes enriched in organoid cultures grown in ERFHNic+A compared to ERFHnic we normalized the arrays by substracting the liver tissue 1 array to the culture arrays. Then we calculated the fold difference between the ERFHNic+A and the ERFHNic samples (see matrix 2).
