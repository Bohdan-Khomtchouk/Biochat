TITLE
DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation assessment through 450K analysis of paired bisulfite and oxidative-bisulfite conversion.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of genome-wide hydroxymethylation within infant placental tissue collected at term. These samples have been collected from the RhodeIsland Child Health Study (RICHS) cohort.

DESIGN
Bisulfite and oxidative biulfite converted DNA was hybridized to the 450k platform and processed at the University of Minnesota Genomic Core

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
