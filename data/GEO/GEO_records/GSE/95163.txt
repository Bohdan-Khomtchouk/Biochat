TITLE
Empirical comparison of reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and Infinium Beadchip reproducibility and coverage of DNA methylation in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We empirically examined the strength of rapid multiplexed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (rmRRBS) and Illuminaâ€™s Infinium Beadchip. rmRRBS required less input DNA, offered more flexibility in coverage, and interrogated more CpG loci at a higher regional density. The Infinium covered slightly more protein coding, cancer-associated and mitochondrial-related genes, both platforms covered all known imprinting clusters, and rmRRBS covered more microRNA genes than the HumanMethylation450 but fewer than the MethylationEPIC. rmRRBS did not always interrogate exactly the same CpG loci, but genomic tiling improved overlap between different libraries.

DESIGN
For the current work, we used frozen peripheral blood from 10 Caucasian males normative aging study participants who were between the ages of 55 and 80 years at the time of blood draw.
