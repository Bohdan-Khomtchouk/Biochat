TITLE
The influence of Snail expression on mRNA transcription levels in II-18 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Snail is a transcriptional repressor, which induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, overall functions of Snail remain to be elucidated. This microarray was performed to investigate the influence of Snail expression on mRNA transcription levels in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line, II-18.

DESIGN
II-18 cells were infected by retrovirus vectors expressing Snail or control vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 50-100.  After 5 days postinfection, total RNA was obtained from II-18 cells expressing Snail (3 samples) or control II-18 cells (3 samples).
