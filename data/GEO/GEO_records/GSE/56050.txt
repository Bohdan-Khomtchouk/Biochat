TITLE
Gene expression data from DSS-treated crypts, normal colon crypts and tumor crypts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparative gene expression profiling between DSS-treated crypts and normal colon crypts Comparative gene expression profiling between normal colon crypts and tumor crypts

DESIGN
Colonic crypts were isolated from pooled distal colons derived from two Lgr5-lacZ male mice at day 2 after initiation of DSS treatment or two untreated controls, or from 12-pooled adenomas derived from two Lgr5-lacz male mice treated with AOM/DSS. Two independent biologic replicates were performed
