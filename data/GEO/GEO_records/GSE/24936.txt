TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of bovine IVF embryos revealed candidate genes and pathways involved in early embryonic development

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Using microarrays, genome-wide RNA expression was profiled and compared for in vitro fertilization (IVF) - derived blastocysts and embryos undergoing degenerative development up to the same time point. Surprisingly similar transcriptomic profiles were found in degenerative embryos and blastocysts. Nonetheless, we identified 67 transcripts that significantly differed between these two groups of embryos at a 15% false discovery rate, including 33 transcripts showing at least a two-fold difference. Several signaling and metabolic pathways were found to be associated with the developmental status of embryos, among which were previously known important steroid biosynthesis and cell communication pathways in early embryonic development.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates for each of blastocysts and degenerative embryos.
