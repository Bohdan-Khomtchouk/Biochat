TITLE
Gene expression changes in venous segments of overflowing arteriovenous fistulae

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study characterized the coordinated molecular changes evoked in the structure and composition of the wall of a venous segment exposed to high fistula flow.

DESIGN
Venous tissues were obtained from the venous segments of overflowing arteriovenous (AV) fistulae present in 6 hemodialysis patients and from normal cephalic veins of 4 hemodialysis patients. Total RNA was extracted from these samples, and gene expression was compared between groups using a Whole Human Genome DNA microarray 44K kit.
