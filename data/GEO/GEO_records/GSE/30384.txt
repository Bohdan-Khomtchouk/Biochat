TITLE
Comparison of Aspergillus fumigatus transcriptome grown on selected nitrogen sources

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus Af293

SUMMARY
Transcriptome of A. fumigatus shifted from ammoniumtartrate to different nitrogen sources and incubated for a defined time was compared. After 16h preculture, the fungus was transferred into fresh medium containing ammonium tartrate, sodium nitrate, proline or bsa as nitrogen source. After 1h, fungus was reisolated, RNA was prepared from fungus, transcriptome was assessed and used for further analysis.
