TITLE
Gene expression profiling of archival tongue carcinoma and normal tongue tissue (all samples)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA extracted from 78 FFPE tongue samples, 62 tongue carcinomas and 16 non-malignant controls, were succesfully analysed using the whole genome DASL array to obtain gene expression profiles. Gene expression profiles were used to identify differentially expressed genes with the ultimate goal of finding out their importance for tongue cancer development and maintenance. Sample were formalin fixed paraffin embedded biopsies taken for diagnostic purposes and had been stored between 1 and 13 years. Because of the general poor quality of RNA from archival samples a special focus were put on its effect on the detected expression levels. 28 tumours and 16 controls with a CTdiff < 5 were selected for differential gene expression analysis. Data for only these sample were normalized again and can be found in seperate data file.

DESIGN
Total RNA from formalin fixed paraffin embedded sample was extracted using the High Pure RNA Paraffin Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Quality of FFPE sample were evaluated by comparing how well a kousekeeping gene (TUBA6) could be amplified using q-PCR in each FFPE sample compared to two fresh frozen sample (Ctdiff= CTffpe-Ctff). The  DASL platform (cDNA-mediated annealing, selection, extension, and ligation assay) was used together with the whole genome arrays to obtain expression data for 20 818 genes.
