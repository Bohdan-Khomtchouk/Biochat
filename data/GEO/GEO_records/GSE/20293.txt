TITLE
miR-30e* induced gene expression alteration in glioma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment is designed to evaluate gene expression alteration following miR-30e* transfection in glioma cells. We find a significant elevation of NF kappa B transcriptional targets.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from SNB-19 and U-87MG glioma cells transfected with miR-30e* mimic oligo or miRNA mimic negative control 36 hours after transfection, two biological replications for each treatment.
