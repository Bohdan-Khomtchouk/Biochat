TITLE
Eye development in mouse and rat

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In this series the ocular primordium was microdissected from normal CD-1 (outbred) mouse embryos harvested days 8-10 post-coitus, corresponding to human development during the 3rd-4th weeks post-fertilization. The precise embryological age was ascertained by counting somite pairs to an accuracy of +/- 2 pairs per litter. Samples were pooled as follows: optic pit pooled from 48-50 embryos (6 litters) on 8 d.p.c. (4-8 somite pairs), optic vesicle pooled from 36-40 embryos (5 litters) on 9 d.p.c. (16-20 somite pairs), and optic cip pooled from 27-30 embryos (3 litters) on 10 d.p.c. (28-32 somite pairs). The common reference for this series was RNA collected from embryonic headfold microdissected on 8 d.p.c. RNA samples were collected from CD-1 rat embryos at equivalent somite stages for the headfold, optic vesicle, and opic cup.
