TITLE
Epigenetic (re)programming of caste-specific behavior in the ant Camponotus floridanus

ORGANISM
Camponotus floridanus

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptome and histone acetylation in Camponotus floridanus minor scout brains following 45 day treatment with small molecule pharmacologicals. The goal of this study was to characterize the molecular changes in gene expression and histone modification caused by ad lib feeding small molecule HAT and HDAC inhibitors

DESIGN
Treated ants: 21 individual single brain samples, generating by linear amplification of polyA+ cDNA prepared from 15% of single brains; ChIP-seq for H3K9ac and H3K27ac was also prepared from 9 of these brains; ChIP-seq for H2O and C646 treated larvae also included; RNA-seq for technical replicate subsamples of a single brain also included
