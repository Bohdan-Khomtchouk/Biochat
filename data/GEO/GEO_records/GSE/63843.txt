TITLE
RNA profiling of two endothelial cells (MPEC and AKT-HUVEC) and one human fibroblast line (BJ)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of overall gene expression in endothelial cells, MPEC and AKT-HUVEC, comparing to a human fibroblast line, BJ. We are looking for the highly abundant genes in endothelial cells comparing to fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from MPEC, AKT-HUVEC and BJ Fig 3b in publication.
