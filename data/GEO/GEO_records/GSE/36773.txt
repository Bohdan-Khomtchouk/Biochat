TITLE
Expression data from primary breast tumors (IJB+OXF)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Frozen tissue specimens from primary breast tumors were collected under IRB-approved protocols from 2 medical centers and profiled using Affymetrix U133 series expression microarrays. This cohort comprises of two subcohorts derived from the Institute Jules Bordet (IJB), Brussels (n=41) (2002) and Guys Hospital, London (n=7) (2003). Dr. Christos Sotiriou (Institute Jules Bordet) directed the microarray work in Brussels. A publication describing the generation of these data is not yet available. However, these data can be used alongside other Affymetrix breast tumour data sets to form large meta-cohorts for breast cancer research, as was done in Lasham et. al. J Natl Cancer Inst. 2012 Jan 18;104(2):133-146.

DESIGN
Frozen tumor tissues comprising of > 60% tumor cellularity were extracted for total RNA and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Clinical data was requested, but not provided by submitter

PLATFORM
GPL96 [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array
