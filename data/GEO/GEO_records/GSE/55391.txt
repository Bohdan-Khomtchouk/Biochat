TITLE
TET1-mediated hydroxymethylation facilitates hypoxic gene induction in neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine changes in hypoxia in neuroblastoma cells

DESIGN
5-hmC distribution was analyzed from cells exposed to hypoxia (1% O2) or normoxia (20% O2); mRNA was sequenced in parallel for expression analysis.

PLATFORM
