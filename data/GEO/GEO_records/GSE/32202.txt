TITLE
Expression profiles of IAA biosynthesis deficient seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To gain more information about the Kyn inhibition of TAA1/TARs, we conducted a RNA-seq analysis to compare the genome-wide gene expression profiles of WT seedlings grown on MS medium or MS plus Kyn, and wei8-/- tar2+/- progeny grown on MS. We report that Kyn treatment largely mimics the loss of TAA1/TAR2 functions.

DESIGN
RNA seq of 3 samples: Col-0 on MS medium, Col-0 on MS+Kyn medium, wei8 tar2(+/-) on MS medium.

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
