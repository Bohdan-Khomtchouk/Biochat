TITLE
Timecourse analysis of Ezh2-dependent gene expression by SVZ NSCs during differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previous work had established that Ezh2-deleted neural stem cells (NSCs) from the postnatal mouse subventricular zone (SVZ) had a deficit in both proliferation and neuronal differentiation both in vivo and in vitro.  Ezh2-deleted NSCs in an Ink4a/Arf-deleted background proliferated normally but still displayed a neurogenesis defect, suggesting that Ezh2 is necessary for the proper expression of genes responsible for neuronal differentiation.  Our results identify genes that are differentially regulated between control and Ezh2-deleted SVZ NSCs during differentiation.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from SVZ NSCs 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7 days after switching from proliferation to differentiation media.
