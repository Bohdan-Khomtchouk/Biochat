TITLE
Expression profiling of Muscle tissue from (C57BL/6J X C3H/HeJ)F2 mice on ApoE null backgrounds

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The (C57BL/6J X C3H/HeJ)F2 intercross consists of 334 animals of both sexes. All are ApoE null and received a high fat Western diet from 8-24 weeks of age.

DESIGN
Muscle from 319 F2 female and male mice (animals fed a high fat " Western " diet from 8-24 weeks of age.) derived from C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ parental strains with both on ApoE null backgrounds.  All samples were compared to a common pool created from equal portions of RNA from each of the samples.  Keywords=Genetics of Gene Expression Keywords=C57BL/6J Keywords=C3H/HeJ
