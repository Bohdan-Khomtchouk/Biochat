TITLE
Expression data from Tet2-/- and Tet2+/+ mouse macrophages without any stimuli.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the effect of ablation of Tet2, an epigenetic regulator of gene transcription, in the global programme of gene expression at baseline, without pro-inflammatory activation, in macrophages.

DESIGN
Thioglycllate-elicted macrophages were isolated from the Tet2 -/- mice and their wildtype littermates (N=3/group) and isolated for total RNA. Whole-genome transcript profiling was performed using Affymetrix microarray to identify genes that were dysregulated due to Tet2 ablation under the inflammation stimuli.
