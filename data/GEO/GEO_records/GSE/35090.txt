TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression changes in mouse keratinocytes induced by treatment with DAPT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression changes that occur in keratinocytes during reprogramming when they are treated with DAPT, a small molecule gamma-secretase inhibitor. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that Notch inhibition by DAPT treatment would promote reprogramming by inhibiting p21 activity while leaving p53 expression intact. Results provide important information of the gene expression changes in response to DAPT treatment, such as changes in the expression of p21, p21-responsive genes, p53, p53-responsive genes involved in apoptosis, and Notch-responsive genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from mouse keratinocytes transduced with reprogramming transcription factors and treated or not treated with DAPT for 4 days or 7 days.
