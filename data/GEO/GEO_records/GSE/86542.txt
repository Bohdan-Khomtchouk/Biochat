TITLE
Effect of IL-7 on CD4+ T cell and Th9 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that IL-7 pretreatment enhanced Th9 differentiation. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, we examine the gene expression profiles of CD4+ T cell and Th9 cells with or without IL-7 pretreatment. In Th9 cells, we found that Th9 related genes were greatly increased in IL-7 Th9 group, which demonstrated an enhanced Th9 differentiation.  In CD4+ T cells, we found that IL-7 treatment resulted in a global gene expression change especially on chromatin remodeling related genes, which facilitated the entry of transcriptional factor to the Il9 promoter region and promoted Il9 transcription.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from naïve CD4+ T cells or Th9 cells from C57BL/6 mice with or without IL-7 treatment; For CD4+ T cells, IL-7 treated for 0h, 6h or 24h. For Th9 cells, naïve CD4+ T cells were treated for 48h and then cultured for 3 days under Th9 condittion.
