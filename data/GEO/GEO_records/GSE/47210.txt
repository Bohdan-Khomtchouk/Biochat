TITLE
Gene expression of murine iDCs isolated from tolerized MOG35-55-infused/MOG35-55-immunized or MOG35-55-immunized mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent data from our group, demonstrate that infusion of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35-55) peptide, leads to induction of MOG35-55-specific Tregs and subsequent suppression of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Amelioration of EAE was accompanied by reduced MOG-specific Th1 and Th17 responses in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Phenotypic analysis of the dLNs of MOG-infused mice revealed a significant Treg-mediated reduction in the recruitment of 7AAD-CD3-CD19-CD11c+CD11bhighGr-1+ iDCs compared to non-infused control immunized mice. Focusing on the delineation of novel molecules/genes that are involved in the MOG-specific Treg-mediated suppression of autoimmune responses, we have isolated highly purified iDCs from MOG infused and non-infused control immunized mice.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of iDCs isolated from tolerized or immunized mice. Affymetrix MG 430 2.0 whole genome arrays were performed in triplicates for tolerized iDCs and immunized iDCs (6 arrays in total, 5 of them were analyzed). To obtain genes significantly regulated in iDCs upon tolerization with MOG35-55, the expression profiles of iDCs isolated from tolerized or immunized mice were compared to each other. After total RNA extraction, reverse transcription, cDNA extraction, the biotinylated cRNA was transcribed, fragmented, and 15 Âµg cRNA hybridized to the 6 GeneChip arrays: Group1 iDCs isolated from tolerized mice, Group2 iDCs isolated from immunized mice.
