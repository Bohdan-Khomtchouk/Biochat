SUMMARY
Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a genetic, neurocutaneous syndrome caused by a mutation in the gene encoding neurofibromin. Individuals with NF1 develop growths that define the NF1 phenotype, including Lisch nodules, cafe-au-lait spots, and neurofibromas. However, more than 50% of individuals with NF1 have cognitive deficits, such as learning disorders and attention deficit/hyperactive disorder that are neuroanatomically unrelated to the neurofibromas. The purpose of this study is to determine the molecular basis of the neurodevelopmental changes that result from the primary gene mutation using a mouse model of NF. These mice are heterozygous for the Nf1 gene (NF+/-), and develop learning and memory difficulties that mimic humans, but do not develop tumors. By applying the technique of gene expression profiling to both NF+/- and control mice, we expect get a " genetic fingerprint " of 12,000 RNA molecules expressed in different parts of the brain during development. Comparison of the " genetic fingerprints " in these mice during development may help us identify key molecular changes that eventually result in cognitive deficits. Such an understanding of the molecular changes triggered by the primary gene mutation may eventually lead to treatments that prevent the cognitive deficits in NF1. Keywords: other
