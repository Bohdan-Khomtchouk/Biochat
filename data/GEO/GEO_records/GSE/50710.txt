TITLE
LncRNA/mRNA expression profiling for 20 human samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of comparing human gatric cancerous tissue with noncancerous tissue. Goal was to determine the different  gene expression between gastric cancer and noncancerous tissue.(reference manuscript titled " Long non-coding RNA GAPLINC regulates CD44-dependent cell invasiveness and associates with poor prognosis of gastric cancer " submitted to Cancer Research)

DESIGN
Tissue based experiment: 10 gastric cancerous tissue,10 gastric noncancerous tissue

PLATFORM
