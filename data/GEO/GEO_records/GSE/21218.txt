TITLE
Genetic deletion of P2X7 receptors causes genome-wide alteration of gene expression and results in antidepressant phenotype in mice amygdale

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of the study was to explore the role of P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) in mood related behavior we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform.To identify genes affected by the genetic deletion of P2X7 receptors in the mouse amygdala we performed gene expression microarray analysis. For validation of differentially expressed genes, we performed TaqMan real-time RT-PCR.Our microarray studies have identified 7217 transcripts that were significantly affected by the deficiency of P2X7 receptor. Validation experiments revealed that among these genes at least 30 genes could be associated to synaptic signaling, neuroplasticity and thereby to the pathogenesis of depression (e.g. beta and gamma subunits of GABAA receptor, ionotropic glutamate receptors, α2 adrenergic receptor, which were down regulated in KO mice). 287 transcripts were found be more than two-fold over-expressed in the LPS treated groups which can be classified according to their inflammatory biological function: Il4ra, Saa1, chemokine ligands.

DESIGN
Intraperitoneal injection of LPS induced alteration of gene expression in mouse amygdala was measured at 6 hours after exposure to doses of 250µg/kg.  Four independent experiments were performed for each of the four experimental groups (wild type mice and P2X7R -/- KO and saline treatment and LPS treatment).
