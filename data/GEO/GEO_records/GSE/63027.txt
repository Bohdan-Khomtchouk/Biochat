TITLE
Expression data from GNMT and MAT1A knockout models that develop all the stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease including hepatocellular carcinoma [GNMT_MAT1A_3 & 8_months]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver global gene expression patterns of 9 GNMT-knockout mice histopathologically determined to have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) together with 10 MAT1A-knockout mice histopathologically determined to have steatosis and NASH. All these have their respective wild type patterns. These were analyzed to define signatures to study the pathogenesis of NAFLD-derived HCC, explore which subtypes of cancers can be investigated using mouse models and define a signature of HCC differential survival that can be used to characterize HCC subtypes of different survival derived from mixed etiologies.

DESIGN
GNMT- and MAT1A-knockout mice liver samples having steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
