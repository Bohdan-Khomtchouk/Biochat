TITLE
B cell survival and development is dependent on the coordination of NFkappaB family members RelB and cRel

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identify genes which are induced in wild type, crel ko, and relbcrle dbko B cells under  BAFF stimulation, and find the differential expressed genes which are distinct from wildtype controls.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis of wild type, crelko, relbcrel dbko follicular B cells stimulated with BAFF ligand for 6 hours and wildtype only for 27 hours

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
