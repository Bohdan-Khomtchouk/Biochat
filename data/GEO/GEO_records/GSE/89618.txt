TITLE
Etv4 and Etv5 binding sites in EpRas mouse mammary gland epithelial cell line [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We searched for roles of Etv4 and Etv5 during EMT through genome-wide analysis of their binding sites in Ras-transformed mammary gland epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Etv4 and Etv5 binding sites in TGF-beta-stimulated EpRas cells were determined by ChIP-seq.
