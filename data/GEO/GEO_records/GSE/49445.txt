TITLE
ChIP-Seq of Klf4 in NMuMG normal murine mammary gland epithelial cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation  of Klf4 in NMuMG cells identifies gene promoter sequences that are directly bound by Klf4.

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitation   using a Klf4-specific antibody in NMuMG cells followed by next  generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq).

PLATFORM
