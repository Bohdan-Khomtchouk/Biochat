TITLE
Chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis (CIOM) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chemotherapy may cause DNA damage within the oral mucosa of cancer patients leading to mucositis, a dose-limiting side effect for effective cancer treatment. We used whole genome gene expression analysis to identify cellular damage to the mucosal tissue occuring two days post induction chemotherapy and identified gene expression patterns that may or may not be predictive of oral mucositis. Keywords: Treatment effect

DESIGN
Punch buccal biopsies from healthy controls (HC, samples BRENC1, BRENC2, BRENC3, n=3) and  five AML patients pre-chemotherapy (Pre-C, samples BREN11, BREN21, BREN41, BREN51, n=4) and (Post-C, samples BREN22, BREN32, BREN42, BREN52, n=4)(Ntotal=11) gave suitable RNA integrity to perform microarray analysis. Samples Pre-C:BREN31 and post-C:BREN12 were not suitable for microarray analysis. Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used to conduct gene expression profiling.
