TITLE
Gene expression analysis of HepG2 cells by NOTUM RNAi

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified human NOTUM, a new member of beta-catenin target gene. The aim of this analysis is to examine downstream genes of NOTUM. Keywords: Gene expression analysis in response to RNA interference

DESIGN
HepG2 cells with RNAi duplexed were used. One control (control-low GC) and 2 RNAi duplexes (NOTUM RNAi#1 and #2) for NOTUM silencing were added to HepG2 cells, and total RNAs were isolated at 72 hours after transfection.
