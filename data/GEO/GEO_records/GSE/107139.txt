TITLE
Transcript levels in the normal epithelium and adenomas of the colon of Min mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to identify gene transcripts altered in level between the normal epithelium and adenomas in colon of the Apc-Min/+ mouse.  These differences in level can be compared to those observed for the colons of the Apc-Pirc/+ rat and the human.

DESIGN
Male (BTBR/Pas x C57BL/6J)F1-Min mice, were housed under conditions of 12 hour light:12 dark, and provided feed  and water ad lib.  Normal epithelial tissue and adenomas were harvested from the colon at 100 days of age.  RNA was extracted, purified and hybridized according to Agilent protocols.

PLATFORM
