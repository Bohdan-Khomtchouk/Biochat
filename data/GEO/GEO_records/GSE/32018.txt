TITLE
Gene-expression profile in a series of  non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PIM serine/threonine kinases are overexpressed, translocated or amplified in multiple B-cell lymphoma types. We have explored the frequency and relevance of PIM expression in different B-cell lymphoma types, and investigated whether PIM inhibition could be a rational therapeutic approach. Increased expression of PIM2 was detected in subsets of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBLC), follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma-MALT type (MZL-MALT), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL) cases. Increased PIM2 protein expression was associated with an aggressive clinical course in ABC-DLBCL patients. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of PIM2 revealed p4E-BP1(Thr37/46) and p4E-BP1(Ser65) as molecular biomarkers characteristic of PIM2 activity, and indicated the involvement of PIM2 kinase in regulating mTORC1. The simultaneous genetic inhibition of all three PIM kinases induced changes in apoptosis and cell cycle. In conclusion, we show that PIM2 kinase inhibition is a rational approach in DLBCL treatment, identify appropriate biomarkers for pharmacodynamic studies, and provide a new marker for patient stratification.

DESIGN
Gene-expression profiling was conducted in a series of 114 B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients (DLBCL, FL, MALT, MCL, CLL and NMZL).  Seven freshly frozen lymph nodes and six freshly frozen reactive tonsils were used as controls.
