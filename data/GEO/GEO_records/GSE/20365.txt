TITLE
Ethylamine versus succinate cells of Methylobacterium extorquens

ORGANISM
Methylobacterium extorquens AM1

SUMMARY
In order to provide global information on gene expression during growth on C2 compounds, microarray analysis of M. extorquens AM1 cells was carried out, comparing ethylamine-grown cells to succinate-grown cells. This comparison has confirmed previous observations on the inducible nature of some of the enzymes involved in C2 metabolism, such as methylamine (and ethylamine) utilization system (mau), putative enzymes for converting acetaldehyde into acetate and acetyl-CoA, and enzymes of the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway that has been proposed to operate for assimilation of acetyl-CoA into cell biomass.
