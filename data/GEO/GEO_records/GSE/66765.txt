TITLE
Differentiation-dependent changes in the epigenomic landscape of human myeloid leukemia cells implicate signaling pathways and highlight chromosomal amplifications

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess how DNA modification patterns are influenced by myelopoesis, we have mapped regions enriched for 5mC or 5hmC throughout the genome during promyelocyte to granulocyte differentiation in the HL-60 cell model.

DESIGN
MeDIP-seq and hMeDIP-seq were performed on undifferentiated and 1.5% DMSO differentiated HL-60 cells.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
