TITLE
Induction and molecular signature of pathogenic Th17 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TGF-beta3 produced by developing Th17 cells induces highly pathogenic T cells that are functionally and molecularly distinct from TGF-beta1-induced Th17 cells. The microarray data represent a distinct molecular signature for pathogenic versus non-pathogenic Th17 cells.

DESIGN
Total of seven groups with two to four samples per group from two independent experiments. The no cytokines group (Th0) was used as a control to normalize the data. 7 groups: B6: (IL-1beta, IL-6) B623: (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-23) T16: (TGF-beta1, IL-6) T1623: (TGF-beta1, IL-6, IL-23) T36: (TGF-beta3, IL-6) T3623: (TGF-beta3, IL-6, IL-23) NOCYTO: no cytokines
