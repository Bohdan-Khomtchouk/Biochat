TITLE
North American Brain Expression Consortium and UK Human Brain Expression Database: Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A fundamental challenge in the post-genome era is to understand and annotate the consequences of genetic variation, particularly within the context of human tissues. We describe a set of integrated experiments designed to investigate the effects of common genetic variability on mRNA expression distinct human brain regions. We show that brain tissues may be readily distinguished based on expression profile. We find an abundance of genetic cis regulation mRNA expression. We observe that the largest magnitude effects occur across distinct brain regions. We believe these data, which we have made publicly available, will be useful in understanding the biological effects of genetic variation. Authorized Access data: Mapping of GEO sample accessions to dbGaP subject/sample IDs is available through dbGaP Authorized Access, see

DESIGN
Because of our interest in genomic regulation of expression and neurological disorders we embarked upon a series of experiments to provide a brain region-specific contextual framework for genetic and epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We obtained frozen brain tissue from the cerebellum and frontal cortex from 396 subjects (total 911 tissue samples).
