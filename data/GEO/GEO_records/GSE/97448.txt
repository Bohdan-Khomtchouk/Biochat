TITLE
Gene expression in tissues from an immune challenged adult sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus)

ORGANISM
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus

SUMMARY
To induce an immune response, a single adult animal was injected intracoelomically with complex microbiota isolated from the gut of another adult animal (4.8 × 10^6 total bacteria). After 12 hours, phagocytic coelomocytes and gut tissue were collected for RNA-Seq experiments.

DESIGN
A single immune-challenged animal was the source of the two tissues analyzed for gene expression (coelomocytes and gut).
