TITLE
Microarray analysis to investigate the global expression of miRNAs in pediatric T1D patients in comparison to non-diabetic controls.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that target multiple mRNAs and regulate gene expression. The implication of miRNAs in T1D pathogenesis, as potential modulators of immune response genes, remains poorly defined. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression profile of miRNAs in new onset T1D to identify autoimmune associated miRNAs.

DESIGN
Total RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of newly diagnosed T1D pediatric patients and age-matched controls was screened for disease-associated miRNAs by a microarray analysis.
