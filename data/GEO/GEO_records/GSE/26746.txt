TITLE
Identifying estrogen regulated gene expression profile of pre-implantation mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of the gene expression profiles of pre-implantation embryos at day 3.5 post coitum from normal pregnant mice (control); embryos from mice treated with ICI (specific estrogen receptor inhibitor); and embryos in the oviduct that were blocked from entering the uterus by ligation. Results provide insight into the function of estrogen regulated genes and uterine factors involved in the early implantation process.

DESIGN
RNA were extracted from 3 groups of 100-120 embryos (a) embryos at d3.5 from uterus of normal pregnant mice; (b) embryos at d3.5 from uterus of ICI treated mice; and (c) embryos at d3.5 from the ligated oviduct.
