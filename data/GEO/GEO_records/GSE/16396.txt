TITLE
Differential microRNA expressions during development of mouse cornea

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression of microRNAs (miRNA) was examined in the wild type mouse cornea at postnatal day 9 (PN9) before stratification of the corneal epithelium and at 6 weeks of age when the epithelium is fully stratified.

DESIGN
Using Sanger miRBase Version 10.0, we analysed 568 miRNAs across 4 biological replicates of the developing (PN9) and mature (6-week-old) mouse cornea.
