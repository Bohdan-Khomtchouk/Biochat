TITLE
PRMT6 knockdown effects on the early zebrafish development

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zygotic genome activation (ZGA), which is according to the midblastula transition in zebrafish, is an important event during the maternal-zygotic transition in animals. Our preliminary study and other groupâ€™s works indicate that epigenetic regulations play an essential role in ZGA. Morpholino was employed to knockdown PRMT6. We used microarrays to analyze the global gene expression in prmt6 morphants.

DESIGN
prmt6 MO (0.3mM) was injected into the one-two cell zebrafish, prmt6 cMO (0.3mM) injection as a control. At 6 hpf, embryos were classified into three subtypes (normal, mild and severe) and prepared for global gene expression analysis with Affymetrix Zebrafish Genome Arrays. The severe subtype and the control were repeated three times.
