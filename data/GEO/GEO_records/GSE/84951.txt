TITLE
Hybrid poplar (P. tremula x P. alba ) outer vs inner bark transcriptome

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
The periderm of trees produces cork cells, whose cell walls are modified with suberin. We compared the transcriptome of outer bark (cork) vs inner bark (control containing secondary phloem and vacular meristem) to infer genes related to suberim metabolism.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of periderm cells at two developmental stages of wild type (WT) poplar tree stems were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate (young) and quadruplicate (older stem), using Illumina HiSeq2000.
