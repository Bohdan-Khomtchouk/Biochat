TITLE
Members of the Entamoeba histolytica transmembrane kinase family play non-redundant roles in growth and phagocytosis

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
Entamoeba histolytica contains a large and novel family of transmembrane kinases (TMK) with proposed roles that include both amebic response to the environment and immune evasion. In the later case, the process requires several elements --these include a large gene family encoding antigenically distinct surface proteins and the expression of one variant antigen at a time by a single pathogen. Laser-capture microdissection was used in conjunction with microarray analysis to demonstrate that single trophozoites express more than one TMK gene.  Overall, our data indicates that multiple members of the novel E. histolytica TMK family are utilized for non-redundant functions by the parasite.

DESIGN
For laser capture microdissection analysis, harvested trophozoites were allowed to adhere to metal framed PEN membrane slides (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) for 15 mins at 37Â°C in TYI-S-33 media.  Subsequently, single cells were captured from the PEN slides using a Pix Cell II laser capture microdissection system equipped with an Olympus microscope (Arcturus Engineering, Mountain View, CA).
