TITLE
Disease Model of GATA4 Mutation Reveals Transcription Factor Cooperativity in Human Cardiogenesis [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Heterozygous mutations in GATA4 cause congenital heart defects and cardiomyopathy through unknown mechanisms. To gain insights into the trancriptome perturbations during human cardiac development due to GATA4 heterozygosity, we performed RNA-seq of isogenic wildtype and GATA4-G296S diseased cardiac progenitors (CPCs) and cardiomyocytes (CMs).

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiling of total RNA isolated from 26 wildtype or  diseased pluripotent stem cell derived cell types.
