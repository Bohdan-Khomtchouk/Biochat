TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis seed compartments at the bending coyledon stage

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We collected bending-cotyledon seed compartments from 7 micron paraffin sections using the Leica LMD6000 system in order to identify the mRNAs present in different compartments from seeds containing bending cotyledon stage embryos. For the purposes of this study we captured 6 compartments: embryo proper, mycropylar endosperm, cellularized peripherial endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat and seed coat, in addition to serial sections encompasing the entire bending-cotyledon stage seed.

DESIGN
Bending-cotyledon stage seed compartments were isolated using the LMD6000 system. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized with Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis array for 14 samples (embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, peripherial endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat, seed coat and whole seeds, 2 biological replicates each).
