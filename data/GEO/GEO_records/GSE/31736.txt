TITLE
Gene expression in response to short and long term cAMP stimulation in the INS-1 insulinoma cell line

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Long term exposure to incretin hormones is known to have salutory effects on beta cell function and viability. While short-term cAMP induction is known to have a signature CREB-CRTC target gene response, the long-term effects of cAMP on beta cell gene expression are less well understood. We used rat microarray analysis to compare the genome-wide gene expression response to short-term (2 hours) and long-term (16 hours) stimulations of the cAMP agonist forskolin in INS-1 insulinoma cells.

DESIGN
INS-1 cells were exposed to forskolin for 2 or 16 hours in RPMI medium containing 10% serum. Control samples wer incubated for the same time without forskolin. Extracted RNA was used for hybridization on Affymetrix rat 1.0 st gene arrays.
