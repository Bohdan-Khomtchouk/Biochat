TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of HeLa cells treated with miR-29b-2-5p and control-miR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To have a global picture of the targets of the mir-29b-2-5p, we assessed transcriptome changes, by deep-sequencing, of HeLa cells transfected with this miRNA or a control miRNA (cel-miR-231).

DESIGN
Transcriptmic profiles of HeLa cells treated miR-29b-2-5p and control-miR  were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq2000.

PLATFORM
