TITLE
Mice with and without enteric flora

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although microbiota plays a critical role for the normal development and function of host immune systems, the detail of the influence, especially on those in the large intestine (LI), remains unknown. Here, we performed transcriptome analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip on LI of germ-free (GF)  and specific pathogen free (SPF) mice of IQI, an inbred strain established from ICR. Keywords: comparison of the mice with or without enteric flora
