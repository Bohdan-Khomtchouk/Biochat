TITLE
Expression Profiling Identifies Novel Gene Targets and Functions for Pdx1 in the Duodenum of Mature Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcription factor pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1) plays an essential role in the pancreas to regulate its development and maintain proper islet function. However, less is known about the function of Pdx1 in the small intestine. We aim to investigate the role of Pdx1 in mature proximal small intestine by profiling the expression of genes differentially regulated in response to Pdx1 inactivation restricted to the intestinal epithelium in mice.

DESIGN
Pdx1 was conditionally inactivated in the intestinal epithelium of Pdx1flox/flox;VilCre mice, by crossing mutant mice homozygous for loxP site-flanked Pdx1 alleles with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the mouse villin 1 gene promoter. Total RNA was isolated from the first five centimeters of the small intestine from adult Pdx1flox/flox;VilCre and littermate control mice. Microarray analysis was performed to investigate genome-wide transcriptional profiles in the proximal small intestine.
