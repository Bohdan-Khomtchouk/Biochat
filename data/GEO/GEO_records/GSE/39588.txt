TITLE
miRNA transcriptional profiling during rainbow trout ovarian development

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
The study aimed to characterize miRNA expression in rainbow trout ovary during ovarian development from immature to mature stages. Whole ovary were collected at the following stages: immature pre-vitelogenesis (IMM), mid-vitellogenesis (MV), late vitellogenesis (LV), post-vitellogenesis (PV) and mature while meiotic maturation is in progress (MAT).

DESIGN
miRNA expression in rainbow trout ovary was measured at 5 different stages (immature, mid-vitellogenesis, late vitellogenesis, post-vitellogenesis and mature).  Two to three biological replicates were used for each stages.
