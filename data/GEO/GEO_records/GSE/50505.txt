TITLE
microRNA Profiling in Wilms Tumors and Kidney Tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The IGF2-intronic miR-483 selectively enhances transcription from IGF2 fetal promoters and enhances tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
The expression levels of microRNAs were profiled in 20 human Wilms tumor samples (WT), 3 human normal adult kidney samples (AK) and 5 human fetal kidney samples (FK) using a Luminex bead platform.

PLATFORM
