TITLE
Defective NK cells in AML patients at diagnosis are associated with blast transcriptional signatures of immune evasion

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of malignancies which may be sensitive to the natural killer (NK) cell anti-tumor response. However, NK cells are frequently defective in AML. Here, we found in an exploratory cohort (n = 46) that NK-cell status at diagnosis of AML separated patients in two groups with a different clinical outcome. Patients with a deficient NK-cell profile, including reduced expression of some activating NK receptors (e.g. DNAM-1, NKp46 and NKG2D) and decreased IFN-g production, had a significantly higher risk of relapse (P = 0.03) independently of cytogenetic classification in multivariate analysis. Patients with defective NK cells showed a profound gene expression decrease in AML blasts for cytokine and chemokine signaling (e.g. IL15, IFNGR1, IFNGR2, CXCR4), antigen processing (e.g. HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, CD74) and adhesion molecule pathways (e.g. PVR, ICAM1). A set of 388 leukemic classifier genes defined in the exploratory cohort was independently validated in a multicentric cohort of 194 AML patients. In total, these data evidenced the interplay between NK-cells and AML blasts at diagnosis allowing an immune-based stratification of AML patients independently of clinical classifications.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis were performed on CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells sorted from patients with impaired or normal CD56bright NK cells (n=2 for each patients? group) and from 3 HC
