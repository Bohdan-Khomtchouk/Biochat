TITLE
Regional expression of X. tropicalis transcription factors in early gastrula embryos

ORGANISM
Xenopus tropicalis

SUMMARY
Purpose: We wished to obtain spatial expression profiles of transcription factor gene expression and expression of other genes. Methods: Embryos were dissected and RNA-seq was performed to determine expression levels of genes. Comparisons between explanted regions permits determination of spatial enrichment of gene expression.

DESIGN
mRNA-seq performed on 5 dissected regions of NF stage 10.5 X. tropicalis embryos and stage-matched sibling whole embryos. Experiment performed in duplicate.
