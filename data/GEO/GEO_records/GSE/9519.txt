TITLE
The time-dependent response of placental trophoblast stem cells to hyperosmolar stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stress induces undifferentiated stem cells to differentiate in a way that looks like normal differentiation We used hyperosmolar stress as a generic, energy-depleting stressor and tested for the global changes in the transcriptional response of placental trophoblast stem cells Keywords: Time course for stressed stem cells to assay for differentiative and homeostatic responses

DESIGN
Placental trophoblast stem cells were subjected to 0, 0.5, 2, 6, and 24 hours of hyperosmolar stress and then assayed by Affymetrix 430MOE V2 whole mouse genome arrays.
