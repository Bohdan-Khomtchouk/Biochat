TITLE
The time-dependent response of placental trophoblast stem cells to hyperosmolar stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stress induces undifferentiated stem cells to differentiate in a way that looks like normal differentiation We used hyperosmolar stress as a generic, energy-depleting stressor and tested for the global changes in the transcriptional response of placental trophoblast stem cells Keywords: Time course for stressed stem cells to assay for differentiative and homeostatic responses
