TITLE
Detailed transcriptome atlas of the pancreatic beta cell

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of the present study was to explore the transcriptome of pancreatic islets and, based on this information, to prepare a comprehensive and open access inventory of insulin-producing Î²-cell gene expression, the beta-Cell Gene Atlas (BCGA).

DESIGN
INS-1 cells, primary rat beta-cells ( > 87% beta-cells) and non-beta-cells ( < 3% beta cells, mostly alpha) were isolated by FACS mediated purification of two different rat islet preparations.
