ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified from healthy volunteers' blood and were cultured in the presence of the monoclonal antibody OKT3 or a recombinant fragment of humanized anti-CD3. After 72 hours, CD3+ T cells were isolated by negative selection using beads.

DESIGN
qPCR miRNA expression profiling.  T cell from five donors were used and treated separately as indicated in the summary. Equal amount total RNA from each donor was used to miRNA expression analysis.
