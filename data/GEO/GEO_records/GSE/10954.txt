TITLE
Transcription Profiling of Lung Adenocarcinomas of c-Myc-Transgenic Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcriptional regulator c-Myc is the most frequently deregulated oncogene in human tumors. Targeted overexpression of this gene in mice results in distinct types of lung adenocarcinomas. By using microarray technology, alterations in the expression of genes were captured based on a female transgenic mouse model in which, indeed, c-Myc overexpression in alveolar epithelium results in the development of bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma (BAC) and papillary adenocarcinoma (PLAC). In this study, we analyzed exclusively the promoters of induced genes by different in silico methods in order to elucidate the c-Myc transcriptional regulatory network. Keywords: c-myc transgenic versus non-transgenic

DESIGN
For gene expression analysis, RNA was isolated from lung tissue of either 16 c-Myc-transgenic or 16 non-transgenic control female mice. Identical amounts of RNA from 4 individuals of one group were pooled, such that 4 pools of 4 mice per group could be analyzed. Each pool was analysed in one microarray experiment.
