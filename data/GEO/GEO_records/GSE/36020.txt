TITLE
Expression data from miR-224 expressing cells versus control cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-224 is up-regulated in hepatocelluar carcinoma. We mimicked mir-224 over-expression by transfecting 50 nM of miR-224 precursor molecules or control oligos into HCT116 cells with low miR-224 endogenous levels

DESIGN
Cells were harvested 24 hours post transfection. Expression profiling was performed on three pairs of miR-224 or control transfected cells from three independent experiments
