TITLE
The transcriptome and chromatin accessbility landscape of mammalian germline

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We first isolate the PGCs from the Oct4-Gfp knock-in mice, and KIT-positive PGCs from the post-implantation human fetus. Then we use the Nome-seq (Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome Sequencing), using a in vitro GpC methyltransferase (M.CviPI) and next generation sequencing to generate the endogenous DNA methylation information and chromatin accessibility of the same DNA molecules in these mammalian germ cells.

DESIGN
Together, we isolated the E6.5 epiblast, E11.5 PGC, E13.5 PGC, E16.5 PGC and their surrounding somatic cells from mouse embryos, and week5 heart, week7 PGC, week11 PGC,  week12 PGC, week17 PGC and week26 PGC, and also their gonadal somatic cells from human fetus.
