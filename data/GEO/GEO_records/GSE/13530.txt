SUMMARY
Type I interferons were discovered as the primary antiviral cytokines and are now known to serve critical functions in host defense against bacterial pathogens. Accordingly, established mediators of interferon antiviral activity may mediate previously unrecognized antibacterial functions. RNase-L is the terminal component of an RNA decay pathway that is an important mediator of interferon-induced antiviral activity. Here we identify a novel role for RNase-L in the host antibacterial response. RNase-L-/- mice exhibited a dramatic increase in mortality following challenge with Bacillus anthracis and Escherichia coli; this increased susceptibility was due to a compromised immune response resulting in increased bacterial load. Investigation of the mechanisms of RNase-L antibacterial activity indicated that RNase-L is required for the optimal induction of proinflammatory cytokines that play essential roles in host defense from bacterial pathogens. RNase-L also regulated the expression of the endolysosomal protease, cathepsin-E, and endosome-associated activities, that function to eliminate internalized bacteria and may contribute to RNase-L antimicrobial action. Our results reveal a unique role for RNase-L in the antibacterial response that is mediated through multiple mechanisms. As a regulator of fundamental components of the innate immune response, RNase-L represents a viable therapeutic target to augment host defense against diverse microbial pathogens.
