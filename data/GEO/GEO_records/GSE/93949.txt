TITLE
Oncogenic activation of the RNA binding protein RDBP and c-Myc signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Here, we analyze the RNA-binding preferences of the human RDBP protein using RNAcompete.

DESIGN
In the RNAcompete assay, purified GST-tagged RDBP (contains the RRM and 50 amino acids of flanking sequence) is incubated with an excess of RNA pool and bound RNA from individual pulldown experiments are directly labeled and hybridized to a custom Agilent 244K microarray.
