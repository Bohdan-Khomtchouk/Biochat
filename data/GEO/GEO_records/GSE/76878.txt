TITLE
INTS8 mutations cause severe neurodevelopmental syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Integrator (INT) is an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-associated complex that was recently identified to have a broad role in both RNA processing and transcription regulation. INT has at least 14 subunits, but INT germline mutations causing human disease have not been reported. We identified mutations in the Integrator Complex Subunit 8 gene (INTS8) causing a rare neurodevelopmental syndrome. In patient cells we identified significant disturbance of gene expression and RNA processing. Also, we show that injection of ints8 oligonucleotide morpholinos into zebrafish embryos leads to prominent underdevelopment of the head demonstrating the evolutionary conserved requirement of INTS8 in brain development.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing was carried out using RNA samples from fibroblasts from two individuals with germline bi-allelic INTS8 mutations and from two healthy individuals

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
