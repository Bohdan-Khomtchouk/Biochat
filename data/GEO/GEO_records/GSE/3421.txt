TITLE
cDNA microarray analysis of human keratinocytes irradiated by ELF-EMF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The ami of this study was to investigate the possible biological effects of ELF-EMF by cDNA microarray. Keywords: ELF-EMF, cDNA microarray, keratinocyte, cytoskeleton

DESIGN
We used a loop design for the microarray study. In this design, there are five sample sets introduced: a sample set without treatment (Ctrl), two identical sample sets with ELF-EMF exposure (EMF), a sample set with UVB irradiation (UV), and a sample set with UVB irradiation followed by ELF-EMF exposure (UE). We hybridized each slide with labeled RNA from two sample sets, the RNA of one sample was labeled with Cy3 and the RNA of the other sample was labeled with Cy5.
