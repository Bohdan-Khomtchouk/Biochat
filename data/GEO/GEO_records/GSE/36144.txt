TITLE
Characterization of chemically induced malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) in the rat by expression profiling

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Identification of differentially expressed genes in ENU induced MPNSTs and normal tissue from rat  Nervus trigeminus  by expression profiling

DESIGN
Gene expression of total RNA isolated from pooled, untreated trigeminal nerves from 85 days old rats compared to unpooled total MPNST tumor RNA  from BDIV, BDIX and hybrid strains.
