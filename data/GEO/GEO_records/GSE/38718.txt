TITLE
Sex and aging effect on skeletal muscle transcriptome in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this investigation was to develop a global view of muscle transcriptional differences between older men and women and with aging for each sex.

DESIGN
Muscle biopsies were obtained from the biceps brachii of young (age 19~28yrs) and older (age 65~76 yrs) men (7 young, 4 older) and women (7 young, 4 older). Total RNA was extracted and gene expression profiling was performed using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2 chip.
