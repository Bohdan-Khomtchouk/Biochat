TITLE
The DEAD-box protein Dbp2p is linked to non-coding RNAs, the helicase Sen1p, and R-loops [iCLIP]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp2p is highly conserved in eukaryotes and has been implicated in transcription, ribosome biogenesis, mRNP assembly, nuclear export, and lncRNA function. How Dbp2p functions in these seemingly unrelated biological roles is not known. An important step towards addressing this question is the determination of cellular RNA binding sites of Dbp2p. Here, we identify transcriptome-wide RNA binding sites of Dbp2p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae using denaturing tandem affinity purification followed by UV-crosslinking. We find that Dbp2p crosslinks to mRNAs and ribosomal RNAs, and most markedly to non-coding RNAs, including snoRNA, snRNAs, and tRNAs. In snoRNAs, Dbp2p preferentially interacts with sites near the 3â€™ ends. These sites closely correspond to regions where RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loop) form, and to binding sites of the RNA helicase Sen1p, a component of the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, which functions in transcription termination and 3' processing of non-coding RNAs in yeast. We also show that Dbp2p interacts in an RNA-independent manner with Sen1p in vivo. We further observe Dbp2p crosslinks to tRNAs and other RNAs also at sites where RNA-loops form. Collectively, our data link Dbp2p to diverse non-coding RNAs, to Sen1p, and to R-loops. The transcriptome-wide connection to R-loops provides a unifying theme for seemingly unrelated cellular roles of Dbp2p.

DESIGN
