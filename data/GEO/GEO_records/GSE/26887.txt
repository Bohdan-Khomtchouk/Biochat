TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of diabetic and non diabetic patients affected by post-ischemic heart failure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Increased morbidity and mortality associated with post-ischemic heart failure (HF) in diabetic patients underscore the need for a better understanding of the underlying molecular events. Indeed, effective HF therapy in diabetic patients requires a complex strategy encompassing the development of improved diagnostic and prognostic markers and innovative pharmacological approaches. Whole mRNAs expression was measured in the heart of patients with heart failure (HF) with or without concomitant Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  and compared it to control non-failing hearts.  We identified distinct genes modulated in HF patients compared to controls, as well as to T2DM HF  patients compared to  not diabetic HF patients.

DESIGN
Our study included left ventricle (LV) cardiac biopsies taken from the vital, non-infarcted zone (remote zone) derived from patients affected by dilated hypokinetic post-ischemic cardiomyopathy, undergoing surgical ventricular restoration procedure.  Inclusion criteria for diabetic were: GLICEMIA: â‰¥126 mg/dl, previous T2DM diagnosis  or anti-diabetic therapy, while for non diabetic: GLICEMIA: < 100 mg/dl and HbA1c:  n.v. 4.8-6.0%. Moreover, HF patients were matched for End Systolic Volume (ESV), Ejection fraction (LVEF), Age, Sex, Ethnic distribution, Smoke habits, Hypertension, Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), Body Mass Index (BMI). Genes expression was assessed by Affymetrix GeneChips Human Gene 1.0 ST array, using total RNA extracted from 7 T2DM HF patients, 12 non-T2DM HF patients and 5 controls.
