TITLE
Genome profiling of free circulating tumor DNA by oncoscan and comparison to profiles in tumor biopsies evaluated by cytoscan

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic profiles of tumor DNA obtained from biopsies were systematically compared to corresponding samples of circulating cell free tumor DNA. The aim was to investigate correspondance between numerical, segmental and focal aberrations, as well as precision in detection and resolution of oncoscan array performance on cfDNA.

DESIGN
tumor DNA from biopsies was analyzed for genomic aberrations by CytoScan HD and cfDNA from blood by OncoScan.
