SUMMARY
An experiment comparing control versus IFN-g treated skin cells (one design factor on two levels). To evaluate the biological and the experimental variability, the following experimental design was planned as shown in Figure 1: " Control " and " IFN-g stimulated " keratinocytes were cultured in triplicate using three individual petri Ã†10 culture dishes and RNA was independently extracted from each cultured replicate.  For each RNA sample, cRNA synthesis was performed in triplicate and each cRNA pool was hybridized to an Affymetrix U133 Gene Chip. Keywords: ordered
