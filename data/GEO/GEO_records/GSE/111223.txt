TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation study of Parkinson's disease in saliva samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of saliva samples in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and PD-free controls. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles. Samples included 128 PD patients and 131 controls with saliva DNA.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 259 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
