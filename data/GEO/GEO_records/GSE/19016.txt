TITLE
The metabolic responce to iron deficiency in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Iron is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in numerous cellular processes. We analyzed the metabolomes and transcriptomes of yeast grown in iron-rich and iron-poor media to determine which biosynthetic processes are altered when iron availability falls.
