TITLE
The metabolic responce to iron deficiency in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Iron is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in numerous cellular processes. We analyzed the metabolomes and transcriptomes of yeast grown in iron-rich and iron-poor media to determine which biosynthetic processes are altered when iron availability falls.

DESIGN
Saccharomyces cerevisiae DBY7286 strain was grown from very low density to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.5, approximately 18 hrs.) in defined-iron SD minimal medium containing only the supplements necessary to meet auxotrophic requirements. Defined-iron SD minimal media were prepared with yeast nitrogen base lacking iron and copper, supplemented with 1 µM copper sulfate, 25 mM MES pH 6.1, 1 mM Ferrozine (Fluka), and the indicated concentrations of ferrous ammonium sulfate 10 µM (low iron) or 300 µM (high iron). All cells were grown at 30°C with shaking and four independent cultures were prepared for each growth condition
