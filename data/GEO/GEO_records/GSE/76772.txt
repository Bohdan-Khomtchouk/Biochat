TITLE
PyMT 4 stages tumor progression RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mammary gland samples of MMTV-PyMT mouse from 4 stages (hyperplasia at week 6, adenoma/MIN at week 8, early carcinoma at week 10, and late carcinoma with lung metastasis at week 12) during tumor progression.

DESIGN
We sacrificed 3 PyMT mice and 3 FVB control mice at each of the 4 stages, extracted RNA and performed sequencing.
