TITLE
Ring1B Promotes Hepatic Stem/Progenitor Cell Expansion via Simultaneous Suppression of Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The expansion of hepatic stem/progenitor cells requires Ring1B-mediated epigenetic silencing of Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a, demonstrating that Ring1B simultaneously regulates multiple CDKI in tissue stem/progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression profiles between Ring1B KO and WT murine liver cells at E13.5
