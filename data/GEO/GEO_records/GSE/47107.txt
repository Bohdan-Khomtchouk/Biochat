TITLE
Human gastric mucosa Cells: hTERT-negative para cancerous tissue (Control) vs. hTERT-positive gastric cancer tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The miRNA expression profiles in one pair of  hTERT-positive gastric cancer tissue and an hTERT-negative para-cancerous tissue. The para-cancerous tissue is at least 5cm away from the cancer tisse. The expression of hTERT of identified by immunohistochemistry before RNA extraction for miRNA assay.

DESIGN
One pair of gastric cancer tissue and para-cancerous tissue(Control). Four replicates per array.
