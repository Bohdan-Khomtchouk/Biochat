SUMMARY
We sequenced dissected ovaries and testes (with reproductive tracts) as well as female and male carcasses in two species of Drosophila in order to validate gene predictions from the ModENCODE project.

DESIGN
Comparison of dissected reproductive tracts and remaining carcasses between D. simulans and D. pseudoobscura
