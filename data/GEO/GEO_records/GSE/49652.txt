TITLE
Enhancer landscape of mouse developing midbrain at 11.5 dpc embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the distribution of histone H3K4me1 and H3K27ac within the genome of mouse embryonic midbrain. We prepared the chromatin from 11 dpc embryonic  midbrain and made chromatin precipitation with antibody against H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (rabbit polyclonal antibody). High-throughput sequencing applied for the ChIP analysis revealed the differential distribution of modified histone within developing midbrain.

DESIGN
ChIP analysis of mouse 11 dpc embryonic midbrain and forelimb buds against anti-H3K4me1 and H3K27ac antibody.
