TITLE
Identification of genes involved in re-epithelialization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify candidate genes involved in re-epithelialization of TGF-b induced dedifferentiated hRPTEC, this experiment was designed.

DESIGN
hRPTEC incubated with TGF-b for 48h and hRPTEC incubated with or without TGF-b for additional 24h were collected. Then, they were applied in this experiment.
