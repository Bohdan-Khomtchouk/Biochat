TITLE
Widespread shortening of 3â€™ untranslated regions and increased exon inclusion characterize the human macrophage response to infection [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Changes in gene regulation have long been known to play important roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses. However, post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in mRNA processing have been poorly studied despite emerging examples of their role as regulators of immune defenses. We sought to investigate the role of mRNA processing in the cellular responses of human macrophages to live bacterial infections.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic profiles of 198 infected (Listeria and Salmonella) and non-infected samples at multiple time points.
