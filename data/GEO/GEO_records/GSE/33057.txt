TITLE
STAT1 independent control of a neurotropic measles virus challenge in primary neurons and infected mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to compare the ability of mice that lack STAT1 to resolve a neurotropic viral challenge, and to assess the ability of neurons obtained from these mice to be effectively cleared of virus by interferon gamma

DESIGN
For the array, primary neurons were isolated from embryonic mice, grown as pure cultures, exposed to recombinant interferon gamma for 3, 6 or 24 hours and harvested for microarray analysis to identify and compare the gene profiles between wild type and STAT1 knockout neurons.
