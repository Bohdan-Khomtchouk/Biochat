TITLE
Expression data from ICR mouse spinal cords - normal or injured spinal cord

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LncRNAs played a crucial role in the cell growth, development and some diseases relating to central nerve system.This study suggest that with regulating the LncRNAs expression level we might design novel therapy for spinalcord injury. In this dataset, we profiled the expression pattern of LncRNAs by microarray method after spinal cord injury (SCI). Through Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis seek LncRNAs potential function in the repair of spinal cord injury.

DESIGN
Fifteen samples were analyzed. In these sample, we divided into five groups (sham operation, 1 day post-injured, 3 days post-injured, 1 week post-injued and 3 weeks post-injured) and each group contained three mice.After RNA extraction,RNA form mice in the same group were mixed by equal mass for the preparation of microarray.Compared with spinal cord without injury, the differential expression level of LncRNAs had a few changes at 1day post-injury, reached the peak at 1 week after SCI, and subsequently declined until 3 weeks post-injury. Genes with an FDR≤0.05 and a fold-change ≥2 were selected. Subsequently we analysis the significant differential expression genes.
