TITLE
High fidelity patient-derived xenografts for accelerating prostate cancer discovery and drug development (aCGH)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer research is hampered by a lack of preclinical models which accurately reproduce clinical heterogeneity. We have established a bank of transplantable patient-derived prostate tumor xenograft lines, using subrenal capsule grafting of human tumor tissue into immuno-deficient mice. This panel includes the first lines generated from prostate cancer biopsy tissue, and also new lines from metastatic tissue. The lines retained salient features of the original patient tumors, including histopathological and molecular characteristics. Furthermore, they span major subtypes of prostate cancer, capturing diverse inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Host castration led to the development of castrate-resistant tumors, including the first model of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation. This publicly-available resource provides novel tools for the next-generation of prostate cancer research and therapy development.
