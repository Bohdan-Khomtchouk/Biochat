TITLE
The Mediator MED23 plays opposing roles in directing smooth muscle cell and adipocyte differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Mediator complex functions as a control center orchestrating diverse signalings, gene activities, and biological processes. However, how Mediator subunits determine distinct cell fates remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we show that Mediator MED23 controls the cell fate preference that directs differentiation into smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or adipocytes. Med23-deficiency facilitates SMC differentiation but represses adipocyte differentiation from the multipotent mesenchymal stem cells. Gene profiling revealed that the presence or absence of Med23 oppositely regulates two sets of genes: the RhoA/MAL-targeted cytoskeleton/SMC genes and the Ras/ELK1 targeted growth/adipocyte genes. Mechanistically, MED23 favors ELK1-SRF binding to SMC gene promoters for repression, whereas the lack of MED23 favors MAL-SRF binding to SMC gene promoters for activation. Remarkably, the effect of MED23 on SMC differentiation can be recapitulated in zebrafish embryogenesis. Collectively, our data demonstrate the dual, opposing roles for MED23 in regulating the cytoskeleton/SMC and growth/adipocyte gene programs, suggesting its “Ying-Yang” function in directing adipogenesis vs. SMC differentiation.
