TITLE
ChIP-seq of the HOXA9 and MEIS1 transcription factors in SEM cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SEM cells were established from the peripheral blood of a 5-year-old girl in relapse with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). SEM cells exhibit the t(4;11) chromosomal rearrangement, which leads to production of the MLL-AF4 fusion protein. Hematopoietic transcription factors including HOXA9 and MEIS1 are highly expressed in ALL.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq was performed against HoxA9 and MEIS1 in SEM cells. DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
