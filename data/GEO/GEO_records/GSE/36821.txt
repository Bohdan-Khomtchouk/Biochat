TITLE
A novel five-gene signature predicts overall and recurrence-free survival in NSCLC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Earlier studies had shown that side population cells isolated from established non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines exhibit cancer stem cell properties. Microarray data from side population (SP) and main population (MP) cells isolated from 4 NSCLC lines (A549, H1650, H460, H1975) were used to examine gene expression profiles associated with stemness. Total RNA extracted from SP and MP samples were used to generate cRNA targets, which were hybridized to Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 probe arrays. Raw data was processed and the mean center expression level for each gene was determined.

DESIGN
Four cell lines (A549, H1650, H460, H1975), each having 1 SP and 1 MP sample.
