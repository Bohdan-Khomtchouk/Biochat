TITLE
G-CSF plus AMD3100 mobilization in adult patients with beta-thalassemia results in effective mobilization of CD34+ cells with primitive signatures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Successful gene therapy for β-thalassemia requires optimal numbers of autologous gene-transduced hematopoietic progenitors stem cells (HPSC) with high repopulating capacity and mobilization is the optimal approach for achieving this goal. We performed a clinical study to investigate safety and efficacy of G-CSF+AMD3100 mobilization in four adult with β-thalassemia to reach a cell dose of ≥8x106 CD34+cells/Kg and to characterize the CD34+cell populations mobilized before and after plerixafor administration.  The procedure resulted well-tolerated in all patients. Three of the four patients reached the target cell dose or more in single-apheresis collections, even one patient where a significant dose reduction of G-CSF was imposed due to early hyperleukocytosis.   A significant increase in the number of circulating CD34+ cells/µl (12.1± 8.2 fold), and in the frequency of the more primitive CD34+/CD133+/CD38- cells (1.7±0.7 fold) was unanimously observed after AMD3100 addiction.  Intraindividual comparison of gene expression profile of CD34+ cells mobilized with G-CSF versus G-CSF+ AMD3100 highlighted a different expression pattern of genes involved in the processes of HSC/stroma adhesion, homing, cell motility and transcription regulation. Overall, the safety profile, the yield, and the expression of genes that potentially promote superior engraftment depict G-CSF+AMD3100 mobilized HSC as optimal graft source for β-thalassemia gene therapy

DESIGN
One experiment performed on purified CD34+ PBPC of the same patient 1  after mobilization with G-CSF + Plerixafor , and after mobilization with G-CSF alone. Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), was used as reference.
