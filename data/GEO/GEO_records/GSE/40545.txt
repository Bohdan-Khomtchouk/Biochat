TITLE
RB pathway deregulation promotes invasion and disease progression in a mouse model of MYC-overexpressing mammary tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease that is categorized into distinct tumor subtypes based on specific molecular attributes, which ultimately influence therapeutic options. Unlike ER+ and/or HER2+ cancers that are subject to specific targeted therapies, triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) do not express these receptors, which leaves patients with limited treatment options. Thus, significant focus has been placed on identifying molecular attributes of basal-like disease that could be used to develop and/or direct novel treatment regimens. Activation of MYC signaling and inactivation of the RB-pathway are frequent events in many types of human cancers. These pathways influence many biological processes, such as cell proliferation, that contribute to the aggressiveness and therapeutic response of tumors. The current study examines the interaction of the MYC and RB pathways in mammary epithelial cell tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Mouse mammary epithelial cells were isolated and sub-cultured. Adenoviral expression of Cre-recombinase was used to delete the RB and/or p53 genes, and retrovirus was used to achieve MYC overexpression (OE). Proliferating cells were harvested for each condition, and RNA was isolated for analyses.
