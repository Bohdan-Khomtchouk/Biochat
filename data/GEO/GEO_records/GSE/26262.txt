TITLE
Pin1/mutant-p53 jointly controlled genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the specific gene expression program by which mutant-p53 and Pin1 control invasion and metastasis in breast cancer cells, we compared the transcriptomic profile of control,  mutant-p53 depleted or Pin1 depleted MDA-MB-231 cells.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected twice with siRNA against Pin1, p53 or LacZ as a control. Transfections were performed by using Lifofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacture's procedure. Forty-eight hours after second transfection, samples were then processed for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Three biological replicas (A, B, C) were used for each of the three conditions, for a total of 9 samples
