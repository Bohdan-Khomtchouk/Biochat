TITLE
Genome level identification of direct Ubx targets from third-instar imaginal discs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Hox proteins are transcription factors and key regulators of segmental identity along the anterior posterior axis across all bilateral animals. Despite decades of research, mechanism by which Hox proteins select their targets and specify segmental identity remains elusive. To address this question we carried out whole genome ChIP-chip experiments to identify direct targets of Hox protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) during haltere development in Drosophila. When mis-expressed in wing segment (T2) Ubx converts its identity to that of haltere segment (T3).  We used CbxHm/+ wing discs ectopically expressing Ubx in the pouch region of discs to obtain chromatin. This helped us focus on targets of Ubx involved in pouch development without mixing with the targets involved in notum development. Polyclonal Ubx antibodies against N-terminal region (excluding homeodomain) were generated in our lab and used to pull down Ubx bound regions from CbxHm/+ wing discs. Mock DNA (No antibody) was used as control.
