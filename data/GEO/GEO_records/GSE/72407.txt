TITLE
NOTCH1 mediates a reciprocal switch between two distinct secretomes during senescence [CSM]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ER:RAS-G12V expressing IMR90 cells were treated with either 100nM 4-OHT for 6 days or 100uM Etoposide for 2 days, followed by further culture for 5 days, leading to RAS-induced senescence (RIS) and DNA-damage induced senescence (DDIS) respectively.

DESIGN
IMR90 cells expressing a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) inducible estrogen receptor (ER)-coupled RAS-G12V (ER:RAS-G12V) were treated with either 100nM 4-OHT for 6 days or 100uM Etoposide for 2 days, followed by further culture for 5 days, leading to RAS-induced senescence (RIS) and DNA-damage induced senescence (DDIS) respectively.  The total RNA was then analysed for transcriptional profiling using mRNA-sequencing. There were 8 (eight) biological replicatesfor each of the experimental conditions. Untreated ER:RAS IMR90 cells were the control condition
