TITLE
ChIP-Seq data of the Streptomyces venezualae protein Sven6563 (RsrR)

ORGANISM
Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712

SUMMARY
We report the results of ChIP-Seq experiment investigating the Rrf2 family transciptional regulator RsrR (putatively name Redox sensitive response regulator). The experiment utilized an in trans copy of rsrR with an N-terminal 3xFlag tag encoded on the plasmid pMS82 (containing a phiBT1 integration site). The experiment utilized beads associated with anti-flag antibodies, specific for the Flag tagged protein and a WT host strain. We report > 600 target binding sites for the RsrR regulon encompassing a broad range of functional targets with specific reference to those associate with NADPH and NADH metabolism and synthesis.

DESIGN
WT vs RsrR::apr mutant with an in trans 3xFlag tagged copy of RsrR. Due to the use of strain independent antibodies there is no clean negative control (as would be found with WT using mono/polyclonal antibodies specific to the WT protein.
