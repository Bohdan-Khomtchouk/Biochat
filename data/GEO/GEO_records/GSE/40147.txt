TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human microRNA-150 expression in PL21 and HL60 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression changes associated with lentiviral vector mediated expression of  pre-microRNA-150 expression in the AML cell lines PL21 and HL60 cells. To identify genes, direct putative miRNA-150 targets, biological and molecular functions and pathways that distinguish cells that express miR-150 from those that do not.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from HL60 or PL21 cells transduced with pre-microRNA-150 or empty vector control and assayed by gene expresssion analysis 20 days post transduction. Two replicates were performed for each condition (miR-150 and control) in each of two cell lines (HL60 and PL21).
