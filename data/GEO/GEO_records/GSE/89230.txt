TITLE
Nucleotide-resolution maps of nascent RNA-synthesis in human K562 cells in optimal growth conditions and upon a 30-minute heat shock at 42°C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Precision Run-On Sequencing (PRO-seq) mapping of nascent RNA synthesis at a nucleotide-resolution across the human genome. The PRO-seq data has been generated from human K562 cells that have been cultured in optimal growth conditions (NHS) or that have been exposed to an acute, 30-minute at 42°C, heat treatment (HS30). The data contains two replicates in each condition (fastq files of raw sequencing data), and bigWig files where the two replicates have been combined and the data normalized to allow direct comparison of the transcription profiles. in NHS and HS30 conditions.

DESIGN
Profile of nascent transcription in non-stressed and heat-stressed human K562 cells
