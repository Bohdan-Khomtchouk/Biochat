TITLE
Gene expression profile in Ronin (Thap11) conditional knock out retina through RNA-sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Conditional knockout of the transcription factor Ronin (Thap11) in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) results in a profound failure cell proliferation resulting in a hypoplastic adult retina that also suffers from photoreceptor degeneration. The goal of this study was to determine which genes are deregulated in response to loss of Ronin transcription factor activity in the developing retina. We generated Ronin flox/flox (Control) and Chx10-Cre::GFP+/tg; Ronin flox/flox (CKO) mice, in which Ronin loss occurs specifically within RPCs, and performed RNA-Seq analysis of embryonic day E14.5 (E14.5) retinae. Three independent pools of control and Ronin CKO retinae were collected consisting of a minimum of 10 retinae per pool and total RNA was extracted followed by polyA selection, fractionation (200-500 nucleotide range) and generation of cDNA. The resulting DNA was then used for standard Illumina adaptor ligation and sequencing. This experiment revealed decreased expression of a large group of mitochondrial genes including components of the electron transport chain (ETC), which have been recently implicated as direct regulators of the cell cycle.

DESIGN
Retinal mRNA profiles of embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) Control (Ronin flox/flox) and Ronin CKO (Chx10-Cre::GFP+/tg; Ronin flox/flox) mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate using Illumina HiSeq2500
