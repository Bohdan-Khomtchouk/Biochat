TITLE
Coxiella burnetii infects JEG trophoblastic cell line, a model of placenta infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Q fever is a zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii, an obligate intracellular bacterium usually found in myeloid cells. The infection is a source of severe obstetrical complications in humans and cattle, and of chronic evolution in pregnant women. As C. burnetii is found in the placenta of aborted foetuses in humans and ruminants, we wondered if it may infect trophoblasts. In this work, we showed that C. burnetii, infected JEG trophoblastic cells without replication and was localized within phagolysosomes. We analyzed gene expression programs induced by C. burnetii in JEG trophoblastic cell line and compared it with transcriptomic program of BeWo trophoblasts in which C. burnetii replicates. These transcriptomic programs induced by C. burnetii in JEG trophoblasts was poor and markedly different from that induced by C. burnetii in BeWo trophoblasts. Hence, the differences in transcriptomic programs may explain the different intracellular fate of C. burnetii in JEG and BeWo cells. Our results suggest that C. burnetii may use trophoblastic cells as a reservoir by interfering with gene expression.

DESIGN
Comparaison between unstimulated JEG cell line and Coxiella burnetii stimulated JEG cell line (bacterial ratio 200:1) for 6 hours
