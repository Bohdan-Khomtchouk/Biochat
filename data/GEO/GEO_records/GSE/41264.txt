TITLE
Chromatin modification by SUMO-1 stimulates the promoters of translation machinery genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We determined the occupancy of SUMO-1 on chromatin in HeLa cells by use of chromatin affinity purification coupled with next generation sequencing RNA-Seq: The goal is to compare differential gene expression in SUMO-1 depleted cells and control cells (GL2 depleted) to verify the observation in the paper, and to cross-check with RT-PCR results.

DESIGN
18 samples examined in syncrhonized HeLa cells: Cells in G1, early S (S0)/mid (S3)/ late S phase (S6), and mitosis (M), triplicates for each sample. 1 ChIP-SUMO1 sample in S0, and 1 ChIP-IgG control RNA-Seq: Six cDNA samples containing three pairs of biological replicates (three SUMO-1 depleted samples and three GL2 control samples) were barcoded, pooled together in equal concentration and subjected to sequencing in one lane of Illumina GAII
