TITLE
IL-6 overexpression-associated gene expression in cholangiocarcinoma cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
The association between chronic inflammation and the development and progression of malignancy is exemplified in the biliary tract where persistent inflammation strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma. The inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) enhances tumor growth in cholangiocarcinoma by altered gene expression via autocrine mechanisms. We therefore investigated the effect of chronic exposure to IL-6 on gene expression using malignant cholangiocytes stably transfected to overexpress IL-6. Comparison of gene expression identified several genes that were altered by enforced IL-6 expression.
