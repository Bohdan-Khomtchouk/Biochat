TITLE
A microRNA-129-5p/Rbfox crosstalk coordinates homeostatic downscaling of excitatory synapses.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Using quantitative proteomics we identified group of synaptic genes with decreased protein synthesis during homeostatic plasticity. To obtain further information about their mRNA levels/sequences (3â€™UTR) we performed polyA RNAseq. At the end, small RNAseq helped us to identify miRNAs that are increased during homeostatic plasticity and might regulate downregulated genes.

DESIGN
Picrotoxin was applied for 48h to mature hippocampal cultures. Changes in mRNA/small RNA levels were assessed by different types of RNAseq. Three biological replicates are included in all analysis. Poly RNAseq and small RNA seq were done from the same RNA preparation.
