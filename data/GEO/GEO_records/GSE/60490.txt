TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of quorum sensing-dependent genes in Burkholderia gladioli BSR3.

ORGANISM
Burkholderia gladioli

SUMMARY
In Burkholdeira gladioli BSR3, quorum sensing (QS) signal plays a pivotal role in many bacterial behaviors, including motility, toxin production and oxalogenesis. To understand transcriptional profiling of QS-dependent genes, we carried out RNA-Seq analysis of the wild type B. gladioli BSR3, and a QS-defective mutant under different culture states (10h and 24h after incubation), representing exponential phase and stationary phase.

DESIGN
2 samples examined: Burkholderia gladioli BSR3 wild type, and a QS-defective mutant, COK94 (BSR3 bglu_2g11050::lacZ). Two conditions: cultured in LB media for 10h or 24h.

PLATFORM
GPL19093 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Burkholderia gladioli)
