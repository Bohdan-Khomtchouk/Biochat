TITLE
miRNA profiles of hydroquinone-induced CD34+ cells in 5days, 8days, 12days

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify hydroquinone-associated miRNAs during blood cell development, CD34+ cells which isolated from human cord blood were tread with different dosese of hydroquinone(0, 1, 2.5 5Î¼M) for 5days, 8days, and 12days.

DESIGN
In total of 12 samples were analyzed, four different dosese of hydroquinone in three different time-point.
