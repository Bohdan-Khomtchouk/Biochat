Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The first genetic hits towards leukemia are thought often to confer to the mutant clone a slight proliferative/survial advantage. These pre-malignant clones can then be maintained under physiological cues in normal pool for long periods. We have searched for this type of first genetic hits and found that ectopic expression of novel nucleoporin 98 (NUP98)-homeodomain fusion proteins in primitive bone marrow cells can induce long-lasting hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) activity in these cells. More specifically, NUP98-CDX1/2 was able to sustain HSC activity with high frequencies despite massive in vitro expansions and in vivo residence. Continual expression of NUP98-CDX1/2 did not perturb lymphoid, myeloid or erythroid/platelet differentiation and NUP98-CDX1/2 was able to reprogram committed progenitors into cells with attributes of HSC. Switching off of NUP98-CDX1/2 expression did not lead to “return” to normal HSC but acute differentiation. Related NUP98-CDX4 induced leukemia with the shortest latency ever reported for HOX transcription factors.  In this case switching off of NUP98-CDX4 expression cured the full-blown leukemia and again the cured cells showed only transient repopulating activity in vivo. These two types of pre-leukemic cells generated here will provide useful models for elucidating the self-renewal mechanisms of HSC as well as leukemic stem cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA from NUP98-CDX lines was compared to EGFP overexpressing lines. The experiment was done in triplicate.
