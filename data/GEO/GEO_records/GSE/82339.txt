TITLE
LncRNA Chaer contributes to the transcriptome reprogramming during phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We compared the transcriptome modified by siRNA-mediated cardiac hypertrophy associated epigenentic regulator (Chaer) with negative control siRNA treated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with or without phenylephrine treatment. The results suggest that Chaer knockdown broadly blocks the phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic programming of the transcriptome.

DESIGN
Transcripts profiles from neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with or without phenylephrine and with or without Chaer-specific siRNA compared to negative control siRNA
