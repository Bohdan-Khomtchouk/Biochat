TITLE
Single cell gene expression in Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells before and after migration, 2 weeks

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the expression of selected genes associated with cortical, striatal and olfactory interneurons in hSS-derived Dlxi1/2::eGFP cells before (in hSS) and after migration (in hCS). By fusing hiPSC-derived fusions that were separately patterned to generate either human subpallial spheroids (hSS) or human cortical spheroids (hCS) we are able to model human interneuron migration in vitro. The aim of this experiment is to examine the gene expression of hSS-derived Dlxi1/2::eGFP cells before and after migration.

DESIGN
Examination of 123 cells Dlxi1/2::eGFP cells in hSS (not migrated) and 106 Dlxi1/2::eGFP cells in hCS (migrated).

PLATFORM
