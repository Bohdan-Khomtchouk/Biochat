TITLE
ChIP-chip of H3K27me3 in Drosophila at different time points of development

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains ChIP-chip data on Agilent 244K dual-color arrays for antibody: H3K27me3 at 12 different time-points of Drosophila development. Current Dataset: [GSM384769..GSM384777]: ChIP-chip of H3K27me3 in Drosophila embryos at 0-4 hours of development [GSM384778..GSM384786]: ChIP-chip of H3K27me3 in Drosophila embryos at 4-8 hours of development [GSM384787..GSM384795]: ChIP-chip of H3K27me3 in Drosophila embryos at 12-16 hours of development [GSM384797..GSM384805]: ChIP-chip of H3K27me3 in Drosophila embryos at 16-20 hours of development [GSM384807..GSM384815]: ChIP-chip of H3K27me3 in Drosophila embryos at 20-24 hours of development [GSM384817..GSM384825]: ChIP-chip of H3K27me3 in Drosophila L1 larvae [GSM384826..GSM384834]: ChIP-chip of H3K27me3 in Drosophila L2 larvae [GSM384839..GSM384847]: ChIP-chip of H3K27me3 in Drosophila pupae [GSM385341..GSM385349]: ChIP-chip of H3K27me3 in Drosophila L3 larvae [GSM418225..GSM418233]: ChIP-chip of H3K27me3 in Drosophila Adult male [GSM418239..GSM418247]: ChIP-chip of H3K27me3 in Drosophila embryos at 8-12 hours of development [GSM442006..GSM442014]: ChIP-chip of H3K27me3 in Drosophila Adult female For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
For each combination of time-point and antibody, triplicate ChIP experiments have been performed and hybridized on Agilent 244K arrays. 3 arrays per genome have been used so that each time-point is a set of 9 tiling arrays.
