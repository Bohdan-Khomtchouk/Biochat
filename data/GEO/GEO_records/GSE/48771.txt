TITLE
Spider mite responses to feeding on Col-0, myb28 myb29 cyp79b2 cyp79b3, and atr1D Arabidopsis plants

ORGANISM
Tetranychus urticae

SUMMARY
Our goal was to investigate the transcriptional response of T. urticae to different Arabidopsis plants with varying levels of indole glucosinolates.

DESIGN
Bean is the ancestral host plant for the T. urticae strain used in this study. Adult female spider mites were transferred to the three Arabidopsis lines (Col-0, qKo, atr1D) or bean, and after 24 hours, the gene expression levels were analyzed. 12 samples were investigated; 4 biological replicates for three comparisons: QKO (qKo vs. Col-0), ATR1D (atr1D vs. Col-0), and COL-0 (Col-0 vs. bean).
