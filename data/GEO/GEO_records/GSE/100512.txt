TITLE
RNA-sequencing for peel roughing disorder of Satsuma mandarin fruit.

ORGANISM
Citrus unshiu

SUMMARY
Roughing disorder (RD) is a significant quality barrier in citrus fruit, occurring more easily on easy-peeling mandarins. As RD is not yet well understood, this study aimed to examine the changes and synergic molecular processes involved. Peel with RD was induced by severely defruiting Satsuma mandarin trees. Morphology observations, RNA-sequencing and untargeted and targeted metabolic analyses were conducted.

DESIGN
Examination of differences between CK and RD peels.
