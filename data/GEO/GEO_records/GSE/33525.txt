TITLE
FREP3 is a determinant of resistance to schistosome infection in snails (part 2)

ORGANISM
Biomphalaria glabrata

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of BS-90 snails injected with a cocktail of four FREP3 specific 27-mer DSiRNA oligos and two hours later exposed to S. mansoni miricidia.  Compared to BS-90 snails injected with a cocktail of three GFP specific DSiRNA oligos and two hours later exposed to S. mansoni miricidia.  Experiments were done over the course of 49 days. Snails were collected (10each) at 2 and 4 dpe to S. mansoni for comparison.

DESIGN
Each replicate is comprised of 1 individual snail from the specified treatment group.  Ten replicates of each treatment were analyzed on the Snail oligo array.

PLATFORM
GPL9483 Biomphalaria glabrata 70-mer oligo array version 1
