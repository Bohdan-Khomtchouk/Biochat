TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for EZH2 mediated gene copy number change in breast tumor initiating cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EZH2 is shown to be involved in regulation of DNA damage repair which may contribute to development of breast tumor initiating cells. To identify genomic aberrations regulated by EZH2 expression, we performed genome wide copy number variation analysis in breast tumor initiating cells expressing EZH2 compared to the vector control. This finding suggests EZH2 contributes to oncogenic amplification in breast tumor initiating cells.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from primary breast tumor initiating cells infected with EZH2 or Vector control constructs Copy number variation analysis of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays was performed and compared between EZH2 and Vector control infected groups
