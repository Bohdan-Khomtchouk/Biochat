TITLE
Photorespiratory stress in catalase deficient plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can act as a signaling molecule that influences various aspects of plant growth and development, including stress signaling and cell death. To unravel the molecular mechanisms that regulate the response towards an impact of increased H2O2 levels in plant cells, we focused on the photorespiration-dependent peroxisomal H2O2 production in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants lacking CATALASE2 (CAT2) activity (cat2-2).

DESIGN
Unstressed and stressed samples of cat2-2 in triplicate

PLATFORM
GPL19580 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
