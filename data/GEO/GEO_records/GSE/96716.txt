TITLE
RNA_seq and Ribo_seq analyses applied to PC9 and H1933 human cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq and Ribo-seq analyses to examine translation efficiency (TE) in PC9 and H1933 cells

DESIGN
We measured expression levels (RNA.seq) and ribosome densities (ribo-seq) in PC9 and H1933 cell lines
