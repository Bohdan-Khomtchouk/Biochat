TITLE
The kinetics of gene expressions of HeLa cells treated with MT7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Uncontrolled mitosis forms basis for tumor cell proliferation. Interference with normal mitotic progression often leads tumor cells to mitotic arrest. As a consequence, cell death follows, but not at all time. Reasonably, the antimitotic therapy has been proven effective and indispensable in the clinical treatment of cancer.Recently, we generated a 6H-Pyrido[2',1':2,3]imidazo[4,5-c] isoquinolin -5(6H)-one library, several products of which had been shown to possess antimitotic activities in vitro. In an attempt to understand the antitumor mechanism of these novel chemicals, we have chosen one bioactive product of this library, MT7, as a model compound in this study We used microarrays to detail the kinetics of gene expression in HeLa cells in a time course of MT7 treatment (from 1.5 h to 12 h). The gene expression profiles were further analyzed by GSEA and Connectivity Map, respectively.

DESIGN
HeLa cells growing on the 10-cm dishes were treated with 5 mM MT7 for 0(control), 1.5(Time1), 3(Time2), 6(Time3) and 12(Time4) hours, respectively. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and the total RNA was isolated and processed for Affymetrix U133A 2.0 hybridizations.
