TITLE
American alligator tooth dental lamina RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Alligator mississippiensis

SUMMARY
Comparison of RNA profiles at different stages of tooth regeneration

DESIGN
Alligator tooth dental laminae were collected at different stages of tooth cycle. RNA-seq was performed to study changes of RNA expression through the cycle. There are 3-5 replicates in each of 4 stages.
