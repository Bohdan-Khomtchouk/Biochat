TITLE
ChIP-seq for Polycomb and associated transcription factors in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq for H3K27me3, the Polycomb protein FIE, and two associated transcription factor (AZF1 and BPC1) using epitope tags expressed in germinated seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates for each mark/factor and three biological replicate for corresponding input (C24 or Col strain for FIE, AZF1, and BPC1, and H3 for H3K27me3)

PLATFORM
GPL19580 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
