TITLE
CpG island-specific demethylation pathway in ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Following erasure in the early animal embryo, a new bimodal DNA methylation pattern is regenerated at the time of implantation in each individual through a wave of generalized de novo modification with CpG islands specifically left unmethylated. In this paper, we ask whether CpG islands are “protected” from de novo methylation or, alternatively, acquire their unmodified state through “demethylation.” Using a genetic approach, we demonstrate that ES cells indeed have the ability to specifically demethylate CpG islands through pathways involving hydroxymethylation (Tet1), deamination (Aid), glycosylation (Mbd4) and excision repair (Gadd45a) genes. Surprisingly, this demethylation system is not actually necessary for generating the overall bimodal methylation pattern in ES cells. This general activity does, however, appear to be involved both in somatic cell reprogramming, as well as the normal methylation reprogramming that takes place in the early embryo.

DESIGN
CpG-methylated genomic DNA was enriched using a methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation (mDIP) assay. DNA from the input and bound (enriched) DNA for each sample were labeled and hybridized on the array to define the methylation state of each region.
