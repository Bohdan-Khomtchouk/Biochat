TITLE
Expression data from MALP-2-stimulated macrophages from wild-type, IRAK-2-/- and IRAK-1-/IRAK-2-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IL-1R-associated kinases (IRAKs) participate in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signal transduction. MALP-2 is a TLR2 ligand, and stimulation of macrophages with MALP-2 activates expression of various genes including proinflammatory cytokines. We used microarrays to examine influence of IRAK-2 or IRAK-1/IRAK-2 deficiency in MALP-2-inducible gene expression. Keywords: Time course after MALP-2 stimulation

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages from wild-type, IRAK-2-/- and IRAK-1/IRAK-2 mice were stimulated with MALP-2 for 0, 2, 4, and 8 hours, followed by RNA extraction. Then hybridization on affymetrix microarrays was performed.
