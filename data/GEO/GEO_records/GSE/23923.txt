TITLE
Expression data from Rad21 knock-down in ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Cohesin complex has recently been described to regulate gene expression. We wanted to determine the gene expression profile specific in mouse ES cells after depletion of the Cohesin subunit Rad21. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying depletion of Rad21 and identified distinct early development related genes up-regulated and many pluripotency related genes downregulated.

DESIGN
Rad21 was depleted in R1/E ES cells for 48h using esiRNAs against Rad21. An esiRNA against non-targeting Luciferase was used as a negative control
