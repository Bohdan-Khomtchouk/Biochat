TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli O1 in chicken serum compared to LB

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli APEC O1

SUMMARY
Colisepticemia caused by avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) results in annual multimillion dollar losses to the poultry industry.  Recent research suggests that APEC may have an important role in public health as well. Generally, colisepticemia follows a respiratory tract infection in which APEC penetrate the respiratory epithelium to enter the bloodstream. From the bloodstream, bacteria may spread to various internal organs resulting in perihepatitis, pericarditis, and other conditions. The aim of this study was to identify molecular mechanisms enabling APEC to survive and grow in the bloodstream. To do so, we compared the transcriptome of APEC O1 during growth in Luria-Bertani broth and chicken serum. Selected genes that were significantly up-regulated in chicken serum were then subjected to mutational analysis to confirm their role in APEC pathogenesis. Several categories of genes, predicted to contribute to adaptation and growth in the avian host, were identified. These included several known virulence genes and genes involved in adaptive metabolism, protein transport, biosynthesis pathways, stress resistance, and virulence regulation. Several genes with unknown function, which were localized to pathogenicity islands or APEC O1’s large virulence plasmid, were also identified, suggesting that they too contribute to survival in chicken serum. This genome-wide analysis provides novel insight into processes that are essential to APEC O1’s survival and growth in chicken serum.
