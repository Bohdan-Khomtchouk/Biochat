TITLE
Whole-genome landscape PARP1 in HEK293T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) is involved in differentiation, proliferation, tumor transformation, in repair of single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) in conjunction with BRCA. PARP1 enzyme works modifying nuclear proteins by poly ADP-ribosylation. It was found that PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 bind at termini of forum domains and may play a role in coordinated regulation of genes in forum domains (Tchurikov et al., 2013). Forum domains are long DNA fragments of excised chromosomal DNA. Mostly forum domains are of 50-200 kb in length, although larger domains, up to 500 - 700 kb, are also observed. The domains are delimited by hot spots of double-strand breaks (DSBs). This ChIP-Seq is aimed to compare genome-wide binding sites of PARP1 with different genomic features, including the hot spots of DSBs.
