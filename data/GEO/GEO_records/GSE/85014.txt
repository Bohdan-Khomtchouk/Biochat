TITLE
Differentially expressed genes in longissimus dorsi by RNA-Sequencing in goats at different postnatal stages

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
Intramuscular fat (IMF) and its fatty acid composition in longissimus dorsi muscle (LM) are changed along with the growth of age, which partly determines the flavor and nutritional value of goat meat. However, unlike cattle, there is few data available on the transcriptome-wide changes at different postnatal stages in small ruminants specially for goats. In this study, the transcriptome by RNA sequencing of goat LM tissues collected from kid, youth and adult period were mapped to goat genome. Out of a total of 24689 unigenes, 20435 unigenes were annotated. Based on FPKM a total of 111 annotated differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified among different postnatal stages, which was then classified to 16 possible expression patterns by series-cluster analysis. Functional classification through GO was used for selecting the top expressed genes related to lipid metabolism. Using co-expression analysis, we identified the node genes for lipid metabolism regulation. In conclusion, these data may provide candidate genes with high probability of having functional roles in regulating goat IMF deposition during the various growth stages.
