TITLE
Comparison of precocious and non-precocious salmon brain

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
The objective was to compare gene expression in salmon precocious and non-precocious parr brain tissue.

DESIGN
Eight microarray hybridisations were carried out in total as part of this design. To compare brain samples total RNA from 10 individual brains (dissected of hypothalamus and pituitary) of precocious fish and 10 brains of non-precocious fish were pooled to give two pools each of five precocious (PA and PB) and non-precocious (NPA and NPB) brains. Each pool of precocious brains was compared in a dye swap experiment with each pool of non-precocious brains.
