TITLE
Strand-specific RNA sequencing profile of dbp2Δ  vs. wild type strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741

SUMMARY
We report widespread changes in ribosome biogenesis factor, aerobic respiration and hexose tranporter gene expression. We also identify antisense transcripts to hexose transporter genes in dbp2∆ cells.

DESIGN
Strand-specific RNA profiles of a dbp2Δ strain and a wild type (reference) strain were generated using two replicates of each strain.
