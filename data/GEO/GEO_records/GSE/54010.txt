TITLE
miRNA expression profiles in the 19 candidate urines (prostate cancer, CaP, patients and non-cancer subjects with benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aims of the study were investigated whether expression of urinary cell-free miRNAs would be different between prostate cancer (CaP) patients and non-cancer subjects with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Urinary cell-free miRNAs will provide potential benefits for detecting CaP, and virus-encoded hsv1-miR-H18 and hsv2-miR-H9-5p could be the important urinary diagnostic markers of CaP. It would be interesting because this is the first report about virus-encoded miRNAs related to CaP, and two miRNAs showed good diagnostic performance even in patients with PSA gray zone.

DESIGN
A total 14 urines from patients with CaP (7 localized and 7 advanced stage) and 5 of BPH controls were used for miRNA array analysis.
