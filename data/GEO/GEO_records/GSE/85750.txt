TITLE
Comparison of expression profiles between WT and MG-G1 adult bone marrow LSK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GATA1 is repressed in hematopoietic stem cells. To understand the significance of Gata1 gene silencing in HSC  we generated GATA1-HSC overexpressing mice (MG-G1). RNA-seq was performed to analyze the gene expression profiles between MG-G1 and WT adult bone marrow LSK cells to examine the consequence of GATA1 overexpression upon HSC.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from MG-G1 and WT LSK cells were generated by deep sequencing in triplicate.

PLATFORM
