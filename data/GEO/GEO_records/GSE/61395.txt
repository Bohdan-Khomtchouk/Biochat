TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of lung cancer cells transfected with Zeb1.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the mechanisms by which the mir-200 and the miR-183~96~182 cluster could regulate EMT and thus cellular migration, invasion and metastasis in NSCLC, we searched for common predicted targets of these microRNA families that might have a potential role in these biological processes. First we performed a cross comparison of multiple gene expression datasets from our mouse models of metastasis. We overlapped 224 genes that were elevated greater than four-folds upon Zeb1 induction in 393P cells with 210 genes that showed greater than two-fold increase in expression in the metastatic 344SQ cells compared to the non-metastatic 393P cells and 143 genes that were repressed to less than 0.5-fold in cells with exogenous expression of miR-200. This resulted in an enriched list of 45 genes that are potential miR-200 targets having a role in the process of EMT and metastasis. Next we performed an overlap of genes that were predicted targets of the miR-200 family members and the miR-183~96~182 cluster using the microRNA prediction algorithms miRanda (www.microRNA.org) and identified a list of 17 highly conserved common targets with a mirSVR score less than -6.0. The only 2 genes common in both the overlapping subsets were Zeb1 and Foxf2.

DESIGN
393P lung cancer cells with stable constitutive expression of either pCDNA vector or Zeb1 were transcriptionally profiled in triplicate cultures. two group comparison
