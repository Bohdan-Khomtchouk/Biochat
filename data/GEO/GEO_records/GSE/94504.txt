TITLE
RNA expression data from mouse endothelial cells isolated from tumors that were exposed to interferon gamma (IFNγ) in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
While it is clear that T cell derived IFNγ has to act on tumor stroma cells for rejection of solid tumors, it is not clear which tumor stroma cells are targets. We studied how IFNγ affects gene expression in tumor blood vessels in vivo. To study the effect on endothelial cells, we either used a model of ectopic IFNγ (MCA313 tumors) or IFNγ-GFP fusion protein (J558L tumors) expression in tumors, or we used T cell derived IFNγ in large vascularized 16.113 tumours. Tumors were grown in mice that were expressing the IFNγ receptor ubiquitously (J558L tumors + IFNγ-GFP treatment and 16.113 tumors + T cell treatment) or in some experiments the IFNγ-receptor was expressed exclusively in endothelial cells (MCA313 tumor + IFNγ treatment). We compared RNA expression profiles from mouse endothelial cells exposed to IFNγ (IFNγ-GFP) or not exposed to IFNγ (IFNγ-GFP). Endothlial cells were drived from tumors (or in one experimantal situation -J558L- as a control also from kidney)

DESIGN
Tumors were grown in mice (either with ubiquitous IFNγ-receptor expression -WT mice- or in transgenic mice with endothelial cell specific IFNγ-receptor expression - PIG x Pdgfb-Cre x IFNγ-del mice) to ca. the size of ca. 1.0 cm in diameter. Then tumors were exposed for 24h or 48h to IFNγ (MCA313-IFNγ-IND tumors) or IFNγ-GFP (J558L-IFNγ-GFP-IND tumors) by ectopic expression from the tumor cells. As controls we used endothelial cells from tumors which were not induced to express IFNγ(0h). To confirm that T cell derived IFNγ acts similar as in our ectopic models, we used T cells for T cell therapy of 16.113 tumors that could express IFNγ (IFNγ+/+ T cells) or could not express IFNγ (IFNγ-/- T cells).
