TITLE
C/EBPepsilon ChIP-sequencing of C57BL/6 mice bone marrow cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize the genome wide C/EBPepsilon binding sites, ChIP-sequencing with C57BL/6 mice bone marrow cells were performed. To prevent artifact from PCR amplifiation, sequencing or antibody specificity, two controls of input DNA and ChIP-sequencing of C/EBPepsilon knock-out bone marrow cells were used. Two data sets derived from two anti-C/EBPepsilon antibodies, N-terminal (GTX109155) and C-terminal (SC-158) antibody against wild type and C/EBPepsilon knock-out bone marrow cells were generated.

DESIGN
Two C terminal and N terminal antibodies against C/EBPepsilon on C57BL/6 wild type and C/EBPepsilon knock-out mice bone marrow cells

PLATFORM
