TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Myotonic dystrophy muscle and heart

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Autopsy and biopsy muscle and heart tissue was collected from consented human subjects with and without confirmed myotonic dystrophy type 1, myotonic dystrophy type 2, or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. RNA was isolated for preparation of RNAseq libraries and sequenced on the Illumina platform.

DESIGN
126 samples, comprising 103 distinct individuals, were sequenced. In some cases, several tissues from the same individual were obtained (the anonymized patient identifier can be used to link these). Samples were obtained from 4 different centers around the world (anonymized center identifiers can be used to track these).
