TITLE
Expression data from control and Phospholipid dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) null cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) and from control and Akt inhibitor treated CTL

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In cytotoxic T cells (CTL), Protein Kinase B /Akt is activated by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and the cytokine Interleukin 2 (IL2), in part by phosophorylation of Akt by Phospholipid dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). The role of PDK1 and Akt in CTL has however not been fully defined. In order to explore the relative roles of these kinases in CTL we used microarrays to profile the gene expression of control and PDK1 null CTL. In separate experiments we compared the gene expression profiles of control and Akt inhibitor treated CTL.

DESIGN
CTL were generated from 3 mice each carrying two loxP flanked PDK1 alleles plus a tamoxifen inducible Cre transgene. PDK1 was then deleted from these CTL by tamoxifen treatment and the gene expression pattern determined by microarray. Tamoxifen treated PDK1wt/wt TamoxCre+ CTL generated from 3 PDK1wt/wt TamocCre+ mice were used as a control. In separate experiments CTL were were generated from 3 wild-type mice and then half the CTL generated from each mouse were treated with the Akt inhibitor AktI-1/2. The gene expression patterns of the AktI treated and the untreated CTL were then compared by microarray.
