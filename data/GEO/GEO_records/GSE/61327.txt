TITLE
Expression Profiling E. Coli Evolved on Glucose Minimal Media

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
mRNA sequencing was performed on E. coli evolved at 37C on M9 Minimal Media with Glucose

DESIGN
Growth of evolved E. coli was characterized under the same conditions as the evolution and compared to the wild type parent strain
