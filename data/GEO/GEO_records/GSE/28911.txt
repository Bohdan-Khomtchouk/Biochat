TITLE
Replication initiation sites in cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reads from massively parallel sequencing of RNA primed, short nascent strands from asynchronously growing cancer cells (K562, MCF7, HCT116).

DESIGN
Newly replicated DNA was isolated based on size (400-800 bp) and the presence of a short RNA stretch at the 5' end using lambda exonuclease. Purified nascent strands were analyzed using massively parallel sequencing. Sheared genomic DNA was sequenced as a control.
