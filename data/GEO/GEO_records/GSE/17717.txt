TITLE
Genome-Wide Binding Sites of the MADS-domain protein AGAMOUS-Like 15 (AGL15) in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The MADS domain transcriptional regulator AGAMOUS-Like 15 promotes somatic embryogenesis by binding DNA and controlling downstream gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) has been used to identify DNA fragments with which AGL15 is associated in vivo and a low-throughput approach to identify these fragments and determine regulatory consequences has revealed a role for AGL15 in GA catabolism that is relevant to embryogenesis. However, to understand more globally the gene networks in which AGL15 is involved, higher throughput methods to identify direct and indirect targets are needed. Here we report mapping of AGL15 in vivo binding sites using a ChIP-chip approach with Affymetrix tiling arrays for Arabidopsis and find that ~2000 sites represented in three biological replicates of the experiment are annotated to nearby genes.

DESIGN
Three independent biological replicates of the ChIP experiment using anti-AGL15 specific antiserum (I) or preimmune (PI) serum as a control were performed.
