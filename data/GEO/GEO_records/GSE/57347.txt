TITLE
Regulation of p21 by TWIST2 contributes to its tumor suppressor function in human acute myeloid leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TWIST2 is deregulated in about 1/3 human acute myeloid leukemia (AML)Â patients partially due to hypermethylation. Overexpression of TWIST2 in various AML cell lines and primary AML cells leads to growth arrest, reduced colony forming cell (CFC) capacity, inhibited cell migration and tumorigenic ability in nude mice, suggesting its tumor suppressor role in AML. To explore the molecular insight of how TWIST2 acts as a tumor suppressor in AML cells, control and TWIST2 expressed THP-1 cells have been analyzed with microarray.

DESIGN
4 independent biological replicates of control and TWIST2 expressed THP-1 cells have been used for RNA extraction and microarray analysis with Agilent platform.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
