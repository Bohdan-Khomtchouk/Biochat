TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling of Hic-5 and TGFB in WPMY fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identifying the effect of the co-regulator Hic-5 (TGFB1I1) and TGFB on the transcriptional profile of WPMY human prostate fibroblast cells with view to further elucidating the broader biological role of Hic-5 and TGFB on fibroblast.

DESIGN
Isogenic WPMY-1 fibroblasts stably transfected with short-hairpin RNA against Hic-5 or transfected with non-specific negative control short-hairpin RNA, were kept in 5% hormone stripped FBS RPMI for 48 hours and subsequently treated with either ethanol vehicle control or TGFB for 16hr.  Total RNA was extracted. Five independent vehicle and five TGFB siSCR and siHic5 samples were hybrydised to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array chips.
