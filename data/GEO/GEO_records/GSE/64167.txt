TITLE
Analysis of the lung transcriptome in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected mice reveals major differences in immune response pathways between TB-susceptible and resistant hosts.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using whole genome microarrays, we compared changes in gene expression patterns in the lungs of TB-resistant A/Sn and TB-susceptible I/St mice at day 14 following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis  H37Rv. Analyses of differentially expressed genes for representation of gene ontology terms and activation of regulatory pathways revealed interstrain differences in antigen presentation, NK, T and B cell activation pathways. In general, resistant A/Sn mice exhibited a more complex pattern and stronger activation of host defense pathways compared to the TB-susceptible I/St mouse strain. In addition, in I/St mice elevated activation of  genes involved in neutrophil response was observed and confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and histopathology. Furthermore, a specific post infection upregulation of cysteine protease inhibitors was found in  susceptible I/St mice.

DESIGN
To monitor the global transcriptome patterns in the two mouse strains, gene expression was assessed using Agilent 4 x44K whole genome microarrays. Genes that changed their expression level at least two-fold compared to non-infected controls with a p-value of  0.1 were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEG).
