TITLE
Expression data from sound vibration-treated Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Sound vibration (SV) causes various developmental and physiological changes in plants. It strongly suggests the existence of sophisticated molecular mechanisms for SV perception and signaling in plants. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of SV-mediated plant responses remains elusive. Herein, we investigated the transcript changes in Arabidopsis thaliana upon five different single frequencies of SV treatment.

DESIGN
SV-treated Arabidopsis was used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Arabidopsis plants (twenty-day-old) were transferred to the soundproof chamber and subjected to 5 different frequencies of SV (250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 Hz) with constant amplitude (80 dB) separately for 1 h. For microarray analysis, samples were harvested right after the SV treatments of 1 h (0 h time point). Control plants were kept in a similar chamber without SV treatment.
