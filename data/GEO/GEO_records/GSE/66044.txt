TITLE
Transcriptome changes in Fusarium verticillioides caused by mutation in the transporter-like gene FST1

ORGANISM
Fusarium verticillioides

SUMMARY
An gene-expression comparison of the wild type and strain delta-fst1 of Fusarium verticillioides grown on autoclaved maize kernels for six days was conducted.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene-expression between the wild type and strain delta-fst1 of Fusarium verticillioides grown on autoclaved maize kernels for six days.  For each strain, RNA was isolated from four biological replicates.  Sequences was obtain by HiSeq Illumina sequencer.

PLATFORM
