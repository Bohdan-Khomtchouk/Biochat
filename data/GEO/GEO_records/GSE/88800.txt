TITLE
Gene expression analysis in the kidney following disseminated candididiasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of renal gene expression between wild type and mice deficient in IL-17 receptor signaling following disseminated candidiasis. The hypothesis to be tested in the present study was that there should be a differential renal gene expresion in the absence of IL-17 receptor signaling following disseminated candidiasis. Wild type and IL-17RA-/- mice were systemically infected with Candida albicans and 48 hour post infection renal gene expression was analyzed.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the kidney of wild type and IL-17RA-/- kidney and analyzed for renal gene expression.
