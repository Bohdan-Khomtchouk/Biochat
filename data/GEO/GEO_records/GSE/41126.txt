TITLE
Expression data of lungs of mice infected with two highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We isolated two highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) (CK10 and GS10) with similar genetic background but greatly differ in pathogencity in mice. CK10 is highly pathogenic in mice, whereas GS10 is nonpathogenic. However, the host mechanism of this differecne in pathogenicity is unclear. We used microarray analysis to evaluate the global transcriptional response in the lung of mice infected with CK10 or GS10.

DESIGN
Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were inoculated with CK10 or GS10 or mock-infected. At day 1 post infection, lungs were isolated from three mice per group for RNA extraction and hybridization on Agilent microarrays. Samples were named as follows: CK10 (CK10_1_NS,CK10_2_NS,CK10_3_NS) GS10 (GS10_1_NS,GS10_2_NS, GS10_3_NS) control (C1_NS, C2_NS, C3_NS).
