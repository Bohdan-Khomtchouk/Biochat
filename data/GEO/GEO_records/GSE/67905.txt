TITLE
Expression data in HeLa cells treated with CENP-E siRNA or Eg5 siRNA in the presence of BubR1 siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanism responsible for cell fate after mitotic slippage is unclear. We investigate the postmitotic effects of different mitotic aberrations, misaligned chromosomes produced by CENP-E siRNA (siCENP-E), and monopolar spindles resulting from Eg5 siRNA (siEg5). To determine which signaling pathways contribute to the postmitotic effect of siCENP-E in the presence of siBubR1 (siCENP-E+siBubR1) compared with siEg5+siBubR1, we performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis by microarray comparisons.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were treated with siNS (non-silencing) +siBubR1, siCENP-E+siBubR1, or siEg5+siBubR1. The siNS cells were used as a control. Each siRNA treatment was duplicated. Three days after the siRNA treatments, the siRNA-transfected HeLa cells were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
