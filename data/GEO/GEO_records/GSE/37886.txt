TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of the plant pathogen Fusarium graminearum on three cereal hosts.

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare ; Triticum ; Triticum aestivum ; Zea mays

SUMMARY
Fusarium graminearum gene expression profiles were compared during an early infection time course (1, 2, and 4d post-inoculation) of three monocot hosts (wheat heads, barley heads, and maize developing kernels).

DESIGN
Fusarium-inoculated vs mock-inoculation, 1d, 2d, and 4d post-inoculation, three biological replicates were done for each time point for each host, 2 technical replicates (dye flips) per sample.
