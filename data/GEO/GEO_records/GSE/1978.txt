TITLE
Genomic and Phenotypic Evidence for a Causative Role of Calcineurin in the Astrogliosis of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Micorarray analysis was performed on RNA samples from hippocampal cultures infected with either Ad-aCaN or Ad-LacZ or uninfected. Each sample was applied to its own GeneChip (Rat RG-U34A; n=7-9 chips/group). Chips were then processed and scanned using Agilent Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner. MAS5 was used to determine signal intensity and presence/absence calls for the data. Keywords = bioinformatics Keywords = gene expression Keywords = calcineurin Keywords = calcium Keywords = Alzheimer's Keywords = inflamation Keywords = Adenovirus Keywords = astrocytes Keywords = microarray Keywords: parallel sample

PLATFORM
