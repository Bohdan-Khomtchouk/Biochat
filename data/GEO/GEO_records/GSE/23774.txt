TITLE
Genome wide BZR1 binding site analysis in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
BR induces rapid dephosphorylation and nuclear localization of BZR1 through a cascade of signaling events thus regulates BR-responsive gene expression and plant development.  We use chromatin-immunoprecipitation microarray (ChIP-chip) experiments identified about 2200 high confidence BZR1 binding sites, which includes all previous known binding regions.  The binding sites are distributed throughout the genome but are rare in the centromere regions, which is similar to the distribution of expressed genes. The binding sites were substantially enriched in the 5’ and 3’ intergenic regions compared to the transcribed regions of genes. Combining with transcription profilling of BR regulated genes generated 953 BR regulated BZR1 targets.

DESIGN
BZR1 promoter directed BZR1-CFP transgenic tissue precipitated with YFP antibody vs. wildtype tissue precipitated with GFP antibody.
