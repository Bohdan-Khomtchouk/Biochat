TITLE
Drosophila esc mutants show Hox-derepression along the AP axis in CNS

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Mutating esc (extra sex-combs), maternal and zygotic, leads to loss of H3K27me3 and affects Hox-patterning along the AP-axis in neurogenesis

DESIGN
Control (OregonR) flies are compared to esc-maternal zygotic mutants at stage 14 and 15 in pooled bulk RNAseq, with over 200 embryos per group.

PLATFORM
GPL17275 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
