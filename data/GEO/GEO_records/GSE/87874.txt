TITLE
Long-lasting WNT-TCF response blocking and epigenetic modifying activities of withanolide F in human cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The WNT-TCF signaling pathway participates in adult tissue homeostasis and repair, and is hyperactive in a number of human diseases including cancers of the colon. Whereas to date there are no antagonists approved for patient use, a potential problem for their sustained use is the blockade of WNT signaling in healthy tissues, thus provoking potentially serious co-lateral damage.  Here we have screened a library of plant and microorganism small molecules for novel WNT signaling antagonists and describe withanolide F as a potent WNT-TCF response blocker. This steroidal lactone inhibits TCF-dependent colon cancer xenograft growth and mimics the effects of genetic blockade of TCF and of ivermectin, a previously reported WNT-TCF blocker. However, withanolide F is unique in that it imposes a long-lasting repression of tumor growth, WNT-TCF targets and cancer stem cell clonogenicity long after drug treatment

DESIGN
LS174T cells were treated with DMSO or 5uM CAP2 or ivermectin for 16h. Cells were then collected, RNA extracted and used for expression analysis.
