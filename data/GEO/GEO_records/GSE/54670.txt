TITLE
Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 data for human whole blood samples and for mixtures of purified white blood cells reconstructing human blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of the study was to utilize DNA methylation to quantify human leukocyte subsets in human blood. This file contains data from an Illumina  Infinium HumanMethlation450  for human whole blood samples as well as complex mixtures of DNA from purified human leukocyte subtypes in quantities that mimick human blood under different clinical conditions.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the  samples were hybridized to an Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
