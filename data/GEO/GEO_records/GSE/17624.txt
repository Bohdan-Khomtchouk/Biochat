TITLE
Expression data from human Ishikawa cells treated with Bisphenol A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of changes in gene expression during treatment with Bisphenol A in vitro. Ishikawa cells were maintained and grown (to confluency or at a desired cell density between 500,000 - 1 million cells/mL) in DMEM/F-12 Medium (supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum + 1X penicillin/streptomycin) in xenoestrogen-free Corning plasticware.  Cells were gently washed in warm PBS and transferred to phenol red-free DMEM/F-12 Medium (supplemented with 10% Charcoal-Stripped Fetal Bovine Serum + 1X penicillin/streptomycin) in Corning Cell Culture Cluster wells overnight and then challenged with 1pM (very low, vL), 100pM (low, L), 10nM (high, H), and 1uM (very high, vH) levels of BPA.  Prior to collection, cells were washed in warm PBS, resuspended & briefly incubated in TRI-Reagent, & finally collected (in quintuplicate replicates) at each specific time point: 8 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours.  Following RNA isolation, the best RNA yields for each quadruplicate set was selected for target preparation and GeneChip processing. Keywords: Dose Response/Time Course

DESIGN
60 total samples:  5 Doses [Vehicle Control, Very Low (1 nM), Low (100 nM), High (10 uM), Very High (100 uM)]; 3 Timepoints [8 hour, 24 hour, 48 hour]; 4 Replicates each.
