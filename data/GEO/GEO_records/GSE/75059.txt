TITLE
Transcriptional profile changes by Prox1 expression in thyroid cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human thyroid cancer cell line BCPAP was engineered for doxycyclin-mediated inducible expressoin of Prox1 and next generation sequcing was performed to study the transcriptional regulation by Prox1

DESIGN
BCPAP cells were infected with rTTA2 lentivirus. The resulting cell populations were then stably transfected either with pIRES-hygromycin vector (Clontech) to generate BCPAP-Ctr cells, or with Flag-PROX1-IRES-hygromycin vector to generate BCPAP-Prx cells. PROX1 expression was induced or not in BCPAP-Ctr and BCPAP-Prx cells with 0.5 Âµg/ml doxycycline (Dox) for 48 hours and the total RNA samples were collected for sequencing.
