TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of 100-day fetal skin revealing the differences of skin pigmentation in goats

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
We identified the mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression profiles of 100-day fetal skin between the dark and normal (white) skin in two breeds of goats using the deep RNA sequencing method.

DESIGN
Case-control. Briefly, the 100-day fetal skin sampled from the normal and hyperpigmentated goats for deep sequencing, in triplicate for each breed, using Illumina
