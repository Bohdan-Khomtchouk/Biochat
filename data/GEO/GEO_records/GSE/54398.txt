TITLE
Expression profiles of synthetic wheat lines and their parents during amphidiploidization

ORGANISM
Triticum dicoccon ; Aegilops tauschii subsp. strangulata ; Triticum dicoccon x Aegilops tauschii subsp. strangulata

SUMMARY
Gene expression levels of newly synthetic triploid wheat (ABD), its chromosome-doubled hexaploid (AABBDD), stable synthetic hexaploid (AABBDD), and their parents, Triticum turgidum (accession KU124, AABB) and Aegilops tauschii (accession KU2074, DD) were compared to understand genome-wide change of gene expressions during the course of amphidiploidization and genome stabilization. Stable synthetic hexaploid which were maintained through self-pollinations for 13 generations using the same combinations of the parents for production of synthetic common wheat.

DESIGN
Amphidiploidization event between T. turgidum ssp. dicoccum (AABB) and Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata (DD) was recreated. Gene expression levels of newly synthetic triploid wheat (ABD), its chromosome-doubled hexaploid (AABBDD), stable synthetic hexaploid (AABBDD), and their parents, Triticum turgidum (AABB) and Aegilops tauschii (DD) were compared. Total RNA of each line was extracted from three biological replicates of two leaves seedlings.
