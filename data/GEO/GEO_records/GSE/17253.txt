ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
affy_agro-bi_medicago - Identification of genes from the model legume Medicago truncatula whose expression is affected by the plant nitrogen status, with or without inoculation with the symbiotic bacteria Sinorhizobium meliloti. - Comparison of the supernodulant, nitrogen-insensitive, sunn-2 mutant with the A17 wild type genotype.-The plant root systems of plants were split into two parts, each one being installed in a separate compartment. For the “S” treatment, one part was supplied with 10 mM NH4NO3 while the other part was supplied with a nitrogen-free nutrient solution. For the “L” treatment, one part was supplied 0.5mM NO3- and the other part was supplied with the nitrogen free solution. Eight biological materials (designated AL, AS, SL, SS, IL, IS, NIL, NIS), with three biological repeats for each, were collected and analyzed. The effects of the S and L conditions were investigated on wild-type A17 (AL vs. AS) and sunn-2 mutant plants (SL vs. SS); one set of A17 plants was inoculated with Sinorhizobium meliloti (IL vs. IS), harvested at four days post inoculation and compared to non-inoculated plants (NIL vs. NIS). Keywords: growth in nitrogen-sufficient (s) vs. nitrogen-limited (l) conditions
