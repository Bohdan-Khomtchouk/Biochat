TITLE
Expression data from GSS/101LL brain regions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gerstmann Strausller Scheinker (GSS) human prion disease homogenate is i.c. inoculated into mice exhibiting a proline to leucine alteration at codon 101 of the murine prion protein gene (101LL). This results in a disease with an incubation period of approximately 291 days. Normal brain homogenate i.c. inoculated into 101LL mice which are aged matched are used as controls. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression changes occurring in individual GSS/101LL brain regions compared to NBH/101LL, but also the differences in gene expression between different GSS/101LL brain regions.

DESIGN
In this study we set out to decipher differences in gene expression between different GSS/101LL brain regions. To achieve this, we compared four different brain regions (brain stem, cerebellum, thalamus and cerebral cortex). Each file represents individual samples, but three replicates are used for each brain region of each exposure type (i.e. NBH or GSS), with the exception of GSS Cortex pool (ii) which failed quality control analysis.
