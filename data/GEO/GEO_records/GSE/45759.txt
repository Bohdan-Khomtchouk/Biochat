TITLE
Generation of hematopoietic progenitor cell lines with myeloid and lymphoid potential using a conditional form of Hoxb8

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of immune-cell differentiation and function is limited by shortcomings of suitable and scalable experimental systems. Here we show that retroviral delivery of an estrogen-regulated form of Hoxb8 into mouse bone marrow cells can be used along with Flt3 ligand to conditionally immortalize early hematopoietic progenitor cells (Hoxb8-FL cells). Hoxb8-FL cells have lost self-renewal capacity and potential to differentiate into megakaryocytes and erythrocytes but retain the potential to differentiate into myeloid and lymphoid cells. They differentiate in vitro and in vivo into macrophages, granulocytes, dendritic cells, B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes that are phenotypically and functionally indistinguishable from their primary counterparts. Quantitative in vitro assays indicate that myeloid and B-cell potential of Hoxb8-FL cells is comparable to that of primary lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors, whereas T-cell potential is diminished. The simplicity of this system and the unlimited proliferative capacity of Hoxb8-FL cells will enable studies of immune-cell differentiation and function.

DESIGN
Hoxb8 expressing immortalized cells
