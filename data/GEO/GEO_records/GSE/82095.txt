TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from bone marrow T cells of acquired aplastic anemia patients and healthy individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is an immune-mediated disease with active destruction of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells by the cytotoxic T-cells in bone marrow. Aberrant expression of microRNAs in T-cells results in development of some autoimmune diseases.Screening the potential miRNAs which may play regulatory role in T cells of AA is meaningful to explore the mechanism of AA. We used microarrays to screen the differential expression pattern of miRNAs in T cells of aplatic anemia patients to find the potential regulatory miRNAs.

DESIGN
Bone marrow mononuclear cells were obtained by aspiration of the iliac crest of patients and healthy donors and prepared with the use of lymphocyte separation medium. CD3+ cells were positively selected from three SAA patients and three healthy controls by means of immunomagnetic activated cell sorting system. Affymetrix GeneChip microRNA 2.0 Array was used for detection of miRNA expression in CD3+ T cells of the six samples.
