TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from bone marrow T cells of acquired aplastic anemia patients and healthy individuals

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is an immune-mediated disease with active destruction of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells by the cytotoxic T-cells in bone marrow. Aberrant expression of microRNAs in T-cells results in development of some autoimmune diseases.Screening the potential miRNAs which may play regulatory role in T cells of AA is meaningful to explore the mechanism of AA. We used microarrays to screen the differential expression pattern of miRNAs in T cells of aplatic anemia patients to find the potential regulatory miRNAs.
