TITLE
Dynamic re-wiring of apoptotic signaling networks enhances tumor cell killing by DNA damage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Crosstalk and complexity within signaling pathways has limited our ability to devise rational strategies for using network biology to treat human disease. This is particularly problematic in cancer where oncogenes that drive or maintain the tumorigenic state alter the normal flow of molecular information within signaling networks that control growth, survival and death. Understanding the architecture of oncogenic signaling pathways, and how these networks are re-wired by ligands or drugs, could provide opportunities for the specific targeting of oncogene-driven tumors. Here we use a systems biology-based approach to explore synergistic therapeutic strategies to optimize the killing of triple negative breast cancer cells, an incompletely understood tumor type with a poor treatment outcome. Using targeted inhibition of oncogenic signaling pathways combined with DNA damaging chemotherapy, we report the surprising finding that time-staggered EGFR inhibition, but not simultaneous co-administration, can dramatically sensitize the apoptotic response of a subset of triple-negative cells to conventional DNA damaging agents. A systematic analysis of the order and timing of inhibitor/genotoxin presentation—using a combination of high-density time-dependent activity measurements of signaling networks, gene expression profiles, cell phenotypic responses, and mathematical modeling—revealed an approach for altering the intrinsic oncogenic state of the cell through dynamic re-wiring of oncogenic signaling pathways. This process converts these cells to a less tumorigenic state that is more susceptible to DNA damage-induced cell death, through re-activation of an extrinsic apoptotic pathway whose function is suppressed in the oncogene-addicted state.
