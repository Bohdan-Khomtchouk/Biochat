TITLE
Prostaglandin E2 is required for skeletal muscle stem cell function, augmenting regeneration and strength

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the downstream signaling pathways that contribute to expansion of MuSCs by PGE2

DESIGN
Muscle stem cells isolated from 2-4 month old mice by alpha7+/CD34+ sorting. Cells were treated in culture for 24 hours with DMSO or prostagland in E2 in biological triplicates. RNA was collected from 5,000-10,000 total cells.
