TITLE
Hypoxic gene regulation on mice Quadriceps muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To address whether hypoxia contributes to muscle patho-physiology, normal, adult C57 mice were exposed to chronic, normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic environments for 2 weeks in order to simulate levels of hypoxaemia reported in DMD patients with advanced respiratory insufficiency. Control mice were maintained under normoxic conditions. Control and experimental mice were studied. Keywords: Hypoxia effect, Comparison type
