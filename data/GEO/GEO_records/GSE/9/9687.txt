TITLE
Expression patterns in time and space during P.sojae infection of soybean cultivars differing in quantitative resistance

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Four selected soybean genotypes with varying degrees of quantitative resistance that were well-characterized were selected for this study. These included two resistant genotypes (V71-370, Conrad), and two susceptible genotypes (Sloan, and VP-RIL9). A P. sojae isolate, PT2004C2.S1 , which is virulent to the soybean genotypes carrying Rps1a, Rps1b, Rps1k, Rps2, Rps3a, Rps3c, Rps4, Rps5, Rps6, or Rps7, was used in this study. Keywords: Genotypic variation on quantitative resistance
