TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Transcriptomes in PB- and PB-Gbx2-transfected 46C mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Transcriptomes in 46C mouse embryonic stem cells overexpressing PB-Gbx2 or PB empty vector at gene expression level. Results provide important information of the response of up-regulating Gbx2, such as specific mechano-responsive genes, up- or down-regulated genes that were mainly enriched in signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from Gbx2-overexpressed 46C ESCs compared to empty vector-transfected control 46C ESCs. Cells were cultured in serum medium supplemented with LIF.
