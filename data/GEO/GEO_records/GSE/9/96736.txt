TITLE
Genomic analyses reveal the influence of geographic origin, migration and hybridization on modern dog breed development

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Analysis of genotypes at 150,000 SNPs reveals patterns of allele and haplotype sharing that describes the breed relationships and development of 161 breeds of dog.

DESIGN
DNA was collected from pedigreed dogs of multiple breeds. SNPs were genotyed using the Illumina CanineHD SNP chip. These SNPs were analyzed using distance measures and haplotype sharing to build a cladogram of breeds and show across-breed hybridization. The processed and raw data is also provided in a plain text file (*matrix.txt and *signal.txt, respectively). The associated files are indicated iin the corresponding sample description field.
