TITLE
RNA sequencing data for 30 bladder cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-sequencing of a panel of urothelial cancer cells. The goal of the study is to examine the genome-wide expression profile in each of the 30 urothelial cancer cells tested in our laboratory.

DESIGN
Each of the 30 cell lines was DNA fingerprinted to confirm its real identity. Total RNA was obtained from each cell line and subjected to Illumina RNA sequencing.
