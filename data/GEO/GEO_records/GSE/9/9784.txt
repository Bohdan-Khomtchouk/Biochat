TITLE
Laccaria bicolor S238N gene expression in different tissues

ORGANISM
Laccaria bicolor S238N-H82

SUMMARY
The Transcriptome of different tissues and developmental stages of Laccaria bicolor S238N was analyzed. The array probes were designed from gene models taken from the Joint Genome institute Laccaria bicolor genome sequence version1. One aim of this study was to verify the expression of the automatically annotated gene models in various tissues and to use this transcriptional information to confirm, to correct or to reject gene models. Another goal was to identify tissue-specific gene expression, e.g. mycorrhiza up-regulated transcripts or fruiting body up-regulated transcripts, or treatment specific gene expression for further detailed analyses. Keywords: Tissue comparison
