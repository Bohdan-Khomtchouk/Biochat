TITLE
Epigenome analysis of CHAMACOS cord blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of CHAMACOS cord blood. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs. Methylation was assessed in 380 cord blood samples of members of the CHAMACOS cohort.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 380 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip
