TITLE
Expression data of LncRNA from the rat knee articular cartilage at different developmental stages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profile of sunitinib-treated primary xenograft tumors (sensitive or resistant status) with that of vehicle-treated.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from KURC1,2 xenograft tumors treated with sunitinib or vehicle. Forty mg/day of sunitinib was orally administered once a day, and KURC3 developed resistance to sunitinib.
