TITLE
Single-cell Gene Expression Analysis Reveals Transcriptional Diversity among Human Spermatogonia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two individual human OCT4-positive spermatogonia were selected for global transcriptional capture using shallow RNA-seq. Successful cDNA synthesis and amplification was confirmed as reads mapped primarily to exons. It has to be noted though, that a comparision of cell to cell data is not possible as coverage of the whole transcriptome was too low, approximately < 1.0x coverage. Nonetheless, RNA-seq data provided first information of highly abundant transcripts in individual human spermatogonia. Spermatogonia-specific expression of selected candidate genes with high RPKM values including DDX5, EEF1A1 and TSPY1 was confirmed by immunohistochemistry.

DESIGN
Human testicular biopsies with qualitatively normal spermatogenesis were used to establish human germ cell cultures. Spermatogonia were selected based on morphological characteristics via micromanipulation.
