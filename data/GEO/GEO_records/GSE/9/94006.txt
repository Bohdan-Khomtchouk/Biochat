TITLE
Analysis of the common and respective roles of CBP and p300 co-activators in human primary myoblast differentiation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression regulated by CBP and/or p300 during human primary myoblast differentiation.

DESIGN
Human Primary Myoblasts (HPM) were used to assess the respective roles of CBP and p300 in myogenesis. To this aim, HPM were grown in proliferation medium and cells were transfected at conflunce with 5nM of siRNAs (siCBP, siP300, siCBP+P300) before being inducing 24 hours later later for diffrentiation. Cells were then harvested at 24, 48, 72 and 96hrs after transfection before RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
