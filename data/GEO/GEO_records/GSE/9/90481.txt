TITLE
Gene expression signatures for Hib conjugate vaccine

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
To development of our gene expression, we have employed whole rhesus monkey genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to induce immune response. The peripheral blood from rhesus macaques, who were immunized in groups of three with the capsular polysaccharide (CPS antigen), carrier protein tetanus toxoid (TT) or conjugate vaccine via intramuscular injection (i.m.) in the anterolateral thigh on days 0, 30 and 60 using the formulations, were obtained on days 0, 30, 60 and 90. PBMCs were collected for microarray assays. Dynamic expression variations of eight genes (KLRC1, LGALS13, LTB4DH, NUAK1, VNN2, GALNT3, LOC710050 and LOC716305) were maintained in Hib conjugate vaccine group throughout experiment comparing with the CPS antigen group and carrier protein TT group.

DESIGN
Hib conjugate vaccine, Hib capsular polysaccharide (CPS) and carrier protein tetanus toxoid (TT) induced gene expression in macaque blood was measured at 0, 30, 60 days after immunized to doses of 0.5 ml. 0.5ml Hib conjugate vaccine contains 10 μg polyribosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP) and 30 μg TT, 0.5 ml Hib capsular polysaccharide (CPS) contains 10 μg PRP, and 0.5 ml carrier protein tetanus toxoid (TT) contains 30 μg TT. Two independent macaques were performed in each group.
