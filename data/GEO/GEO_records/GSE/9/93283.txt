TITLE
Response to SARS-CoV in the PreCC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to narrow candidate QTL loci into relevant genes driving disease differences, we assessed transcriptional differences across the pre-CC population used to map phenotypic QTL.  We integrate this normalized expression data with polymorphisms underneath a candidate locus to arrive at a high priority candidate gene which had genetic variants private to the causal haplotype and also had expression strongly correlated with the appropriate trait (SARS-CoV viral lung load at 4 DPI).

DESIGN
68 samples each derived from a different CC line with expression measured from lung tissue at day 4 post infection. Infection was with the mouse adapted SARS-Coronavirus MA15 strain
