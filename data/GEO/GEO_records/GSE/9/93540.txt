TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of tomato leafless (lfs) mutants and TIBA-induced pins

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to identify genes that are misregulated in tomato pin-like apices. These apices could be induced either by the lfs mutation, or by treatment with the auxin polar transport inhibitor TIBA

DESIGN
The tomato lfs mutant was compared to WT and to TIBA-induced pin. Experiment was done in two repeats for each condition.
