TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional response of an Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) Pst Mutant

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Many reports show an association between the Pst system, the Pho regulon related genes and bacterial virulence. Our previous results showed that a functional Pst system is required for full virulence, resistance to serum, polymyxin B and acid shock. However, the interplay between the Pst system and virulence has an unknown molecular basis. To understand global APEC virulent strain responses to Pho regulon activation, we conducted transcriptome profiling experiments comparing the APEC chi7122 strain and its isogenic Pst mutant grown in rich phosphate medium using the Affymetrix GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array. The Affymetrix GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains the genome of the E. coli MG1655 and three pathogenic E. coli strain (EDL933, Sakai and CFT073) representing 20,366 genes. While comparing genes expression between Pst mutant and the wild type chi7122 strain, 471 genes are either up- (254) or down-regulated (217) of at least 1.5-fold, with a p-value inferior or equal to 0.05 and a false discovery rate of 2.71%.
