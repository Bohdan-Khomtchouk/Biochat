TITLE
Expression profiles of circular RNAs in bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore circular RNA (circRNA) expression profiling and their biological functions in bladder cancer, we surveyed the circRNA expression signature of 4 pairs of matched bladder cancer and para-cancer tissues from clinical patients using microarray. Hundreds of significantly changed circRNAs were identified. Our findings provide a novel perspective on transcriptional group and lay the foundation for future research of potential roles of circRNAs in bladder carcinoma.

DESIGN
Total RNA from four pairs of human bladder carcinomas and matched para-carcinomas were used for microarray analysis.
