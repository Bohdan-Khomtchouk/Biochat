TITLE
Identification of plasma microRNA as a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in pancreatic cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified plasma microRNA as a useful biomarker for Pancrearic cancer through miRNA-based approach comparing plasma levels between PCa patients and healthy volunteers.

DESIGN
Through our strategy using genome-wide miRNA microarray analyses to detect depleted tumor suppressor miRNAs in the plasma of PCa patients, we identified a novel plasma miRNA, which has tumor suppressor functions and was significantly depleted in the plasma of PCa patients compared with healthy volunteers.
