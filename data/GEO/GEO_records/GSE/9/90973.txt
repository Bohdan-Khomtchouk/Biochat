TITLE
Effect of erythropoietin (EPO) and leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) on miRNA expression profiling in differentiating rat CG4-EPOR oligodendrocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the miRNA expression profile in differentiating rat CG4-EPOR oligodendrocytes treated with EPO, LIF or their combination for 1h or 20h

DESIGN
miRNA expression was measured in undifferentiated CG4-EPOR cells and in differentiating cells at 1h and 20h in 5 conditions: control, EPO 10ng/ml, LIF 0.2ng/ml, LIF 10ng/ml, EPO 10ng/ml+LIF 10ng/ml); 3 or 4 replicates.
