TITLE
Expression data from adolescent mice exposed with ethanol at birth and controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exposure of mice to ethanol during the first neonatal week models human trimester three fetal ethanol exposure. These mice show characteristic learning and memory impairment that may be explained by gene expression changes in the hippocampus. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Mice were injected with  2.5 g/kg of ethanol in 0.15 M NaCl spaced two hours apart on post natal days 4 and 7. On postnatal day 21, mice were sacrificed via carbon dioxide asphyxiation and cervical spinal dislocation. The hippocampus was dissected and stored at -80 degrees C until RNA and DNA were simultaneously isolated. RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix 2.0 expression arrays.
