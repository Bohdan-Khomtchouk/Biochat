SUMMARY
Early life stages are generally most sensitive to toxic effects. Our knowledge on the action of man-made chemicals on the developing vertebrate embryo is, however, rather limited. We exposed zebrafish embryos to 11 of environmental toxicants and measured the changes in gene expression profiles by microarray. Our results demonstrate that the genome of the zebrafish embryo responds to toxicant exposure in a highly sensitive and specific manner. Keywords: toxicants response genes expression profiles
