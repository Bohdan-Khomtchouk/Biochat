TITLE
Summarizing probe levels of Affymetrix arrays taking into account day-to-day variability

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Day-to-day variability in microarray experiments is a recognized source of variation that can impede the analysis of large microarray studies where samples are processed on different days. In this study, we have applied an algorithm, called D2Dsum, which is based on a log-linear fixed effect model to cope with this kind of issues on a data set of 45 microarrays. Keywords: time course
