TITLE
Salivary lnc-PCDH9-13:1 and miR-664a-5p are Novel Hypersensitive and Specific Biomarkers in Diagnosis of Early Hepatocellular Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sensitive and noninvasive biomarkers are essential for screening and treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We explored whether salivary lncRNAs and miRNAs could be robust biomarkers for HCC. Using Agilent microarray, lncRNAs and miRNAs were profiled from liver tissue with HCC and normal liver.

DESIGN
Our study consisted of there stages. Candidate lncRNA and miRNA biomarkers were selected by microarray and bioinformatics analysis. The levels of the selected candidate biomarkers in tissue, plasma and saliva samples were measured by qPCR and analyzed by biostatistics. The diagnostic performances of the selected ncRNAs were validated in three cohorts.
