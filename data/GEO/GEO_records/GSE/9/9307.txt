TITLE
DNA pooling using Affymetrix HindIII and Ilummina HumanHap arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment was based on 3 arrays (3 Illumina HumanHap300 and 3 Affymetrix Genechip HindIII arrays) of each  type being hybridized to a single pool which contained equal amounts of DNA from each of 384 individuals. The goal is to  estimate a pooling allele frequency, the average frequency of allele 1, say, in the set of 384 individuals. After processing, the raw data are summarized to give pooling allele frequency estimates for each array. Abstract from paper comparing two arrays (one affy, one illumina) is as follows; Genome wide association (GWA) studies to map genes for complex traits are powerful yet costly. DNA pooling strategies have the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of GWA studies. Pooling using Affymetrix arrays has been proposed and used but the efficiency of these arrays has not been quantified. We compared and contrasted Affymetrix Genechip HindIII and Illumina HumanHap300 arrays on the same DNA pools and show that the HumanHap300 arrays are substantially more efficient. In terms of effective sample size, HumanHap300 based pooling extracts > 80% of the information available with individual genotyping (IG). In contrast, Genechip HindIII based pooling only extracts ~30% of the available information. With HumanHap300 arrays concordance with IG data is excellent. Guidance is given on best study design and it is shown that even after taking into account pooling error, one stage scans can be performed for > 100 fold reduced cost compared with IG. With appropriately designed two stage studies, IG can provide confirmation of pooling results whilst still providing ~20 fold reduction in total cost compared with IG based alternatives. The large cost savings with Illumina HumanHap300 based pooling imply that future studies need only be limited by the availability of samples and not cost. Keywords: DNA pooling experiment
