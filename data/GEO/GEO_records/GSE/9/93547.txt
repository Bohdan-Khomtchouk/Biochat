TITLE
Differential expression analysis of a Vibrio parahaemolyticus ∆luxO mutant compared to wild-type in mouse intestinal mucus

ORGANISM
Vibrio parahaemolyticus RIMD 2210633

SUMMARY
Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the leading bacterial cause for seafood-related gastroenteritis worldwide. As an intestinal pathogen, V. parahaemolyticus competes with other commensal bacteria for the same pool of nutrients. The major source of nutrition for intestinal bacteria is intestinal mucus. We wanted to determine the expression profile of wild-type V. parahaemolyticus in mouse intestinal mucus and then perform a differential expression analysis in a ∆luxO deletion mutant, in which the high cell density quorum sensing regulator OpaR is constitutively expressed and low cell density regulator AphA is repressed.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq analysis was performed on RNA isolated from two biological replicates of wild-type Vibrio parahaemolyticus strain RIMD2210633 and three biological replicates the  ∆luxO mutant strain, grown in M9 minimal media supplemented with mouse intestinal mucus.
