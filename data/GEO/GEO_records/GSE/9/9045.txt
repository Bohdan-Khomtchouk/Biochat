TITLE
Regulation of gene expression by MafA phosphorylation in transformed cells.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Transformation of Chicken Embryo fibroblast by MafA is dependent on its phosphorylation status. Using microarray analysis, we identify a gene expression subprogram regulated by MafA phosphorylation. Keywords: phosphorylation mediated transcriptional regulation
