TITLE
microRNA expression profile of NPTr cells infected with swine H1N1/2009 influenza A virus

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
In recent years, the roles of microRNAs playing in the regulation of influenza viruses replication caused researchers' much attenion. However, much work focused on the interactions between human, mice or chicken microRNAs with human or avian influenza viruses rather than the interactions of swine microRNAs and swine influenza viruses. To investigate the roles of  swine microRNAs playing in the regulation of swine influenza A virus replication, the microRNA microarray was performed to identify which swine microRNAs were involved in swine H1N1/2009 influenza A virus infection.
