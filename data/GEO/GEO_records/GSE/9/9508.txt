TITLE
Gene expression profiling of metastatic and non-metastatic osteosarcoma biopsies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone tumour in children and young adults, and the second highest cause of cancer-related death in this age group. In spite of aggressive chemotherapy, disease-free survival has not improved significantly in the past 20 years, and 50% of patients subsequently develop fatal pulmonary metastasis. We have performed gene expression profiling of primary osteosarcoma biopsies (i) to identify prognostic markers, and (ii) to identify novel therapeutic targets. Keywords: Comaprison between disease status (metastatic vs non-metastatic) and normal
