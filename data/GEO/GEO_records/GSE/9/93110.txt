TITLE
A global transcriptome analysis of human epidermal keratinocytes upon overexpression of microRNA-19a or microRNA-19b or microRNA-20a

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Several members from microRNA 17-92 cluster, i.e. miR-19a, miR-19b and miR-20a, were found up-regulated in human epidermal keratinocytes at wound-edges compared to the intact skin; however their biological role in keratinocytes during wound repair has not been studied. To study the genes regulated by miR-19a, miR-19b and miR-20a, we transfected miRNA specific mimics, i.e. pre-miR-19a, pre-miR-19b or pre-miR-20a into human primary epidermal keratinocytes to overexpress them. We performed a global transcriptome analysis of keratinocytes upon overexpression of miR-19a or miR-19b or miR-20a using Affymetrix arrays.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of primary human epidermal keratinocytes transfected with 20nM miR-19a mimics (pre-miR-19a) or 20nM miR-19b mimics (pre-miR-19b) or 20nM miR-20a mimics (pre-miR-20a) or 20nM control oligos (pre-miR-Ctrl) for 24 hours (biological triplicates in each group) was performed using Affymetrix GeneTitan system.
