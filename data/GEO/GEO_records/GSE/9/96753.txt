TITLE
protein levels in BRAF inhibitor resistance melanoma cells treated with PF3758309

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
22 BRAF inhibitor resistance melanoma cells were treated with PAK inhibitor PF3758309 for 48 hr, the cell lysis were analyzed by RPPA  profiling by protein array (RPPA)

DESIGN
22 pair of samples were analyzed (control and PF3758309 treatment group) by RPPA, more than 200 of proteins were tested
