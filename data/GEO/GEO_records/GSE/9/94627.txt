TITLE
A phylogenetic framework to study the evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Comparative expression analysis of HOG1 KOs during osmotic stress in the ascomycete yeasts

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in  KO strains as well as WT strains of three ascomycete yeasts, S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, and S. pombe. Expression was measured in a wildtype strain of each species, as well as a sko1 knockout mutant for S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, an msn2/4 knockout mutant for S. cerevisiae, an mnl1 knockout mutant for C. albicans, and an hsr1 knockout mutant for S. pombe. Expression was measured under normal media at T=0, and under KCl stress at T=20. Two replicates were used for each experiment.
