TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of embryonic neural crest cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this research was to explore activation/deactivation of signaling pathways in neuroblastoma samples

DESIGN
Neural crest cells were used as a control for transcriptome analysis of neuroblastoma samples. Adrenal glands were taken from aborted fetuses after 25 weeks of gestation. Samples were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded.  Tissues were examined by histologist to confirm presence of neuroblasts.
