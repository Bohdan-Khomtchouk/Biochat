TITLE
Expression data of colorectal cancer HT-29 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Colorectal cancer HT-29 cell line is a comonly-used human cancer cell line. We have used this cell line for examining the effect of various anticancer compounds on gene expression and we obtained gene expression data of untreated HT-29 cells as a control data for the analysis.

DESIGN
We extracted RNA from HT-29 cells and obtained gene expression data.
