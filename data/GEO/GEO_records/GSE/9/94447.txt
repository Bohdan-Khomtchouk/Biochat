TITLE
MicroRNA-664a-5p promotes neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) belong to a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important roles in the transcriptional regulation of gene expression. A number of miRNAs are known to act as key regulator of diverse processes such as neuronal differentiation. In this study, we have attempted to identify novel miRNAs related to neuronal differentiation. 15 upregulated and 8 downregulated miRNAs were identified in SH-SY5Y cells treated with all-trans retinoic acid. We further showed that one of the upregulated miRNAs, miR-664a-5p promoted neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells. Herein, we report for first time the important role of miR-664a-5p in SH-SY5Y cells.
