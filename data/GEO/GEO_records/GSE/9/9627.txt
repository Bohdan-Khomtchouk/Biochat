TITLE
Comparison between saprotrophic and biotrophic-like mycelia of cacao WBD causal agent Moniliophthora perniciosa II

ORGANISM
Moniliophthora perniciosa

SUMMARY
Moniliophthora perniciosa is the causal agent of cacao WitcheÂ´s broom disease. This disease has been causing extensive damages to Brazilian cacao plantation, especially in Southern Bahia. Using glass slides microarrays, we analyzed the expression profile of 3872 whole genome shotgun reads from M. perniciosa genome, comparing two stages of development (Biotrophic-like mycelia and saprotrophic mycelia). Keywords: Moniliophthora perniciosa, Witches Broom Disease, Pathogenesis, Cacao
