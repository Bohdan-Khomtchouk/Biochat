TITLE
Endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondria junction is required for iron homeostasis

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The Endoplasmic Reticulum–Mitochondria Encounter Structure (ERMES) is a protein complex that tethers the two organelles and creates the physical basis for communication between them. ERMES functions in lipid and calcium exchange between the ER and mitochondria, mitochondrial protein import and maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and genome. Here we report that ERMES is also required for iron homeostasis. Loss of ERMES components activates an Aft1-dependent iron deficiency response even in iron-replete conditions, leading to accumulation of excess iron inside the cell. This function is independent of ERMES known roles in calcium regulation, phospholipid biosynthesis or mitochondrial biology. A mutation in the vacuolar protein sorting 13 (VPS13) gene that rescues the glycolytic phenotype of ERMES mutants suppresses the iron deficiency response and iron accumulation. Our study reveals that proper communication between the ER and mitochondria is required for appropriate maintenance of cellular iron levels.
