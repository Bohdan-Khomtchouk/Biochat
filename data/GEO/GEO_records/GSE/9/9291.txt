TITLE
Systems biology of gene expression of bladder papilloma cells modulated by a malignant-derived extracellular matrix

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was undertaken to identify how gene expression of the RT4 bladder papilloma cells respond to extracellular matrics (ECM) Matrigel. Gene expression profile of RT4 cells grown on Plastic was compared with expression profiles of RT4 cells grown on Matriges over 12 hours-9 days timecourse. Total 5881 hypervariable (HV) genes were found to vary significantly over the time points, indicating a response to matrix change. Correlational clustering showed these HV genes fell into distinct families, predominantly genes which became highly expressed on ECM. Another cluster show genes expressed at 12 hours after grown on Matrigel and third cluster show genes whose expression decreased below noise level on Matrigel. This indicate that processes responsible for cell adaptation to ECM happen within first 12 hours and the second cluster form last response of those active processes. Over 1-9 days of cell grows on Matrigel those genes are constantly expressed. Cell signaling and cellular growth and proliferation accounted for major functions for those genes. G-protein signaling, immune response and NF-kB signaling accounted for most dramatically affected canonical pathways. Genes sharing similar ontologies also share several overrepresented transcription regulatory elements confirmed by independent experiment on Panomics platform.Thus, rapid response for ECM orchestrated by several transcription factors was observed. Identified canonical pathways indicate possible targets for manipulating cell phenotype on ECM. Keywords: extracellular matrix, gene expression, RT4, Matrigel, microarray, time course
