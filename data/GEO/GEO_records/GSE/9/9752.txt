TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis for Pch/ Ler regulon in enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is an emerging pathogen that causes diarrhea and heamolytic uremic syndrome. Much of the genomic information that affects virulence is acquired via horizontal transfer. Genes necessary for attaching and effacing lesions are located in the LEE pathogenicity island. LEE gene transcription is positively regulated by Ler, which is also encoded by the LEE, and by Pch regulators, which are encoded at other loci. We identified genes whose transcription profiles were similar to those of the LEE genes, by comparing the effects of altering ler and pch transcript levels. We assigned these genes into two classes, according to their transcription profiles. Keywords: Genetic modification
