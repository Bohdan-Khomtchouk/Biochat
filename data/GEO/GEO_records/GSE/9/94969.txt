TITLE
Expression analysis of primary human monocytes stimulated with an anti-TLR10 mAb (5C2C5)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that engagment of TLR10 via the 5C2C5 anti-TLR10 mAb causes differential expression is a subset of inflammatory, miRNA and uncharacterized genes compared to an isotype control antibody

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression on primary human monocytes under 4 different conditions
