TITLE
Diabetic mice 21 days after streptozotocin injection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used streptozotocin to induce a model of type I diabetes in transgenic mice that express green fluorescent protein under the control of an endothelial-specific promoter (Tie2 GFP). Three weeks after treatment, endothelial cells were isolated from animals with blood glucose > 350 mg/dl. Age-matched mice received sham intraperitoneal injections. Aortae from the root to the renal bifurcation were rapidly processed by mincing and proteolytic digestion followed by fluorescent activated cell sorting to yield endothelial cell populations of > 95% purity. RNA was isolated from > 50,000 endothelial cells and subjected to oligodT amplification prior to transcriptional analysis on microarrays displaying the Operon V3 collection of long oligonucleotides representing 32,000 murine transcripts. Dysregulated transcripts were confirmed by real-time PCR, and included glycam1, angptl4, slc36a2, cidea, adam5, ces3, adipsin and adiponectin. By comprehensively examining cellular gene responses in vivo in a whole animal model of type I diabetes, we have identified novel regulation of key endothelial transcripts that likely contribute to the metabolic, angiogenic and pro-inflammatory responses which accompany diabetes.
