TITLE
Gene Expression In Drosophila Hearts Harboring Ion Channel Mutations

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Age-dependent electrical and morphological remodeling of the Drosophila heart caused by hERG/seizure mutations Sei and KCNQ mutants were compared to their control lines, Canton S-CS and KCNQ370

DESIGN
30, 3-week old hearts were isolated and RNA was extracted and prepared for arrays
