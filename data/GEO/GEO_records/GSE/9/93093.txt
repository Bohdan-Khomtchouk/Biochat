TITLE
Comparison 39ox and wt samples with or without fe-bHLH039 overexpression results in iron accumulation dependent on the FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (FIT)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au13-07_ox - comparison 39ox and wt samples with or without fe - Differential gene expression between 39Ox and WT at +Fe and -Fe - WT (Col-0) and 39Ox seeds were surface sterilized and grown directly on +Fe or -Fe Hoagland medium for 6 days. 60 whole seedlings were harvested in liquid nitrogen and grinded to a fine powder. Total RNA was extracted with the Spectrum Plant total RNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich). 8 Âµg total RNA was sent to analysis. For validation of the results, RT-qPCR was performed using the same RNA samples.

DESIGN
6 dye-swaps - normal vs. transgenic comparison, treated vs. untreated comparison.
