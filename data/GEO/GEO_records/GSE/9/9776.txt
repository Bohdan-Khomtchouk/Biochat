TITLE
Effect of INH treatment on Mycobacterium tuberculosis gene expression in various dormancy models.

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
These data represent the expression patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in progressive hypoxia, nutrient depletion, and in-vivo hollow fiber models of dormancy.  The assumptions are that the set of genes that respond to INH treatment during Log phase growth would not be differentially regulated during INH treatment in the dormancy models, and that the overall number of differentially regulated genes would be reduced do to the low metabolic state of the cells. Keywords: Dormancy Model Drug Response Comparison
