TITLE
Loss of the Caenorhabditis elegans pocket protein LIN-35 reveals  MuvBâ€™s innate function as the repressor of DREAM target genes

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The Retinoblastoma-like pocket proteins p130 and p107 act as gatekeepers of the cell cycle through their activity within the DREAM (Dp/Rb-like/E2F/MuvB) transcriptional repressor complex. The goal of this study was to address how the pocket protein contributes to DREAM complex assembly and function on chromatin by utilizing a protein null mutant of the only C. elegans pocket protein LIN-35. We performed ChIP-seq of C. elegans DRM subunits in wild-type and lin-35 null late embryos to assess the effect on their chromatin localization following loss of LIN-35.

DESIGN
Examination of 7 DRM complex subunits (DPL-1, EFL-1, LIN-35, LIN-9, LIN-37, LIN-52, and LIN-54) in lin-35(n745) (a protein null strain) and WT C. elegans late stage embryos to assess effects of loss of LIN-35 on DRM complex chromatin assembly. Study includes reanalysis of GSM1195397 and GSM1195398 (GSE49204) with an additional replicate, generating the following processed data: LIN-37.SDQ3166.N2.rep0.vsInputRep0.SES.bw LIN-37.SDQ3166.N2.IDR.0.01.narrowPeak
