TITLE
Distinct roles of Brd2 and Brd4 in potentiating the transcriptional program for Th17 cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the genome wide distributions of Brd2 and Brd4 in Th17 cells. We find that Brd2 and Brd4 have distinct genome-wide localization in Th17 cells, further experiments reveal tht Brd2 faciliates TF-complex formation in enhancers, enhancer-promoter interaction while Brd4 enhances transcriptional elongation.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq study of Brd2 and Brd4 in Th17 cells. Additional samples include Brd4 and Brd2 ChIP-Seq after JQ1 treatment, as well as ChIP-seq of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac. The Th17 cells are differentiated for 48hrs and ChIP with the corresponding antibodies and ChIP-seq libraries are made.
