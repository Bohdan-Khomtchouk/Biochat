TITLE
Single-base resolution methylome of 5-Methylcytosine in human and mouse transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNAs of siCTRL, siNSUN2 and ALYREF-RIP HeLa cells, and multiple mouse tissues were purified using oligo (dT)-conjugated magnetic beads followed by RiboMinus treatement. mRNAs were fragmented to ~200 nt and treated by Sodium bisulfite solution (pH 5.1) containing Hydroquinone. Bisulfite treated mRNAs were reverse transcribed to cDNA using ACT random hexamer primers. The cDNAs were subjected to libraries construction using KAPA Stranded mRNA-Seq Kit (KAPA) and performed sequencing on HiSeq2500 (Illumina) in pair-end mode, creating reads with a length of 125 bp. Sequencing chemistry v4 (Illumina) was used and every sample was sequenced at one lane.
