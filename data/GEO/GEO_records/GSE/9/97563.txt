TITLE
RNA-seqanalysis of deinococcus wild-type and mazEF mutant strains after MMC treatment

ORGANISM
Deinococcus radiodurans

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was used to analysis of mazEF toxin-antitoxin system mediated post-transcriptional inhibition through its endoribonuclease activity. DNA damage agents ,such as MMC, activates the mazEF system leading to cells growth arrest. In the present study, results reveal that a larger number of genes involved in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, ion transport and transcription was down-regulated in the wild-type compared with the mazEF-dr mutant.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extrated from wild-type deinococcus radiodurans and mazEF mutant strain with or without MMC treatment.
