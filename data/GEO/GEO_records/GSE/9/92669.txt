TITLE
Circular RNAs in Rat Models of Cardiovascular and Renal diseases

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to profile circular RNAs (circRNAs) in rat genetic models of cardiovascular and renal disease. Renal profiles were obtained from the Dahl Salt-Sensitive rat (S), the Dahl Salt-Resistant rat (R), the Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (SHR) and the Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY).

DESIGN
At 57 days of age,  kidneys were collected from male Dahl salt-sensitive rats (S), Dahl salt-resistant rats (R), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) (n = 3 rats  per group) and snap frozen. RNA isolated was used for microarray studies conducted by ArrayStar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA).
