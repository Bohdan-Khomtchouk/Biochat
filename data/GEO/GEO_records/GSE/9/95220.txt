TITLE
Retinal gene expression responses to aging are sexually divergent

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sex and age are critical factors in a variety of retinal diseases but have garnered little attention in preclinical models.  The current lack of knowledge impairs informed decision making on inclusion and design of studies incorporating both sexes and aging.  The goal of this study was to examine mouse retina normative gene expression in both sexes with advancing age.

DESIGN
Retinal gene expression in female and male C57BL/6 mice at 3 months and 24 months of age were compared for sex differences and aging responses through whole transcriptome microarray analysis.
