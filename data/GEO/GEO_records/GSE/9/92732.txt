TITLE
Transcriptome responses of Lactobacillus acetotolerans F28 to a short and long term ethanol stress

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus acetotolerans

SUMMARY
Exploring the mechanism of ethanol tolerance in  Lactobacillus acetotolerans F28  and finding key genes which maybe participating in protecting cells from damage during ethanol stimulation.

DESIGN
Examination of 4 different samples at different time after 12% (v/v) ethonal or water treatment. Every sample was designed for 3 replicates.
