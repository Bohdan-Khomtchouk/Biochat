TITLE
Time-course expression data from HEK293∆RAF1:ER cells stimulated with 4OHT and labelled with 4SU

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We integrate experimental data and mathematical modelling to unveil how ERK signal duration is translated to mRNA dynamics.

DESIGN
HEK293 cells were transfected with an inducible form of RAF (∆RAF1:ER), labelled with 4-thiouridine (4SU) one hour before harvesting and induced with tamoxifen (4OHT) for different periods of time (0h-8h).
