TITLE
Gene expression profiling of HepG2 cells after treatment with Brefeldin A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effects of the Golgi disruptor on liver cancer cells, we explored a global gene expression of HepG2 cells after treatment with Brefeldin A.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were treated with DMSO or Brefeldin A, followed by gene expression profiling using microarray.
