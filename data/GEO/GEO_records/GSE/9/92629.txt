TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Piscor (control) and Nap1l1-shRNA expressed neural stem cell Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of gene expression. The goals of this study are to compare the different transcripts between control or Nap1l1 knockdown

DESIGN
Methods:Neural stem cell isolated from E12 mice and cultured in vitro. RNA used for global transcriptome analysis were extracted from the lentivirus infected neural stem cells and sequenced by Hiseq 2500. Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified when we compared Normalized Reads Count between groups with p < 0.05 and |Log2FoldChange| > 1.
