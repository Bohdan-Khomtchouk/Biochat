TITLE
Gene expression profile of CD141+DNGR-1+ dendritic cells (cDC1s) derived in vitro from multipotent lymphoid progenitors (MLP) or common myeloid progenitors (CMP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD141+DNGR-1+ cDC1 have a dual origin. Both MLP and CMP can differentiate in CD141+DNGR-1+ cDC1s. Using Affymetrix microarrays (GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST) we compared gene expression of CD141+DNGR-1+ cDC1s originating either from MLPs or CMPs

DESIGN
The Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST arrays were used to define gene expression profiles in CD141+DNGR-1+ cDC1s
