TITLE
Dynamics of mRNA abundance and translation in response to short and prolonged hypoxia and reoxygenation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of 7d-old Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to short term (2 h) hypoxia, long term (9 h) hypoxia, and 1 h reoxygenation after long term (9 h) hypoxia to evaluate the regulation of gene expression at the level of translation. Keywords: Time Course, hypoxia recovery, polysomal mRNA, IP RNA, polysomes, hypoxia stress, reoxygenation, translational control.
