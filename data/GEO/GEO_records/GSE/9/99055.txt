TITLE
Global gene expression in Abp57-overexpressing transgenic rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
An auxin-binding protein (Abp57) was previously isolated from rice and known to activate plasma membrane proton ATPase. The Abp57 function was characterised by overexpression in the rice and Arabidopsis. The transgene expression was driven by constitutive promoter, CaMV35S. Results from physiological experiments showed that the transgenic lines were tolerant to drought and salinity stress. The global effects of Abp57 overexpression in rice were studied using microarray platform from Affymetrix.
