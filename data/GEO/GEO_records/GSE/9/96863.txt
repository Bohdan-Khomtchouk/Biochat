TITLE
Gene expression data for HEK-293T cells transfected with GFP control and plant derived DNA demethylase DMEΔ

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells expressing a GFP (293T-GFP) or a truncated form of Arabidopsis DEMETER (DME) 5-methylcytosine (5mC) DNA glycosylase (293T-DMEΔ) analyzed on an Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array Platform. These array data revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the 293T-GFP cells (without direct 5mC excision activity) and 293T-DMEΔ cells (with artificially implemented direct 5mC excision activity).

DESIGN
To investigate whether DMEΔ induces gene expression, GFP- and DMEΔ-expressing in HEK-293T cells were collected 48h after transfection by flow cytometry, and RNA were hybridized to Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
