X chromosome-specific Array-CGH of XLMR patient

SUMMARY
Mental retardation (MR) is a non-progressive cognitive impairment affecting 2 to 3% of the Western population.  So far, point mutations and subtle deletions and insertions have been shown to represent only a proportion ( < 40%) of genetic causes underlying X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). We have screened a subset of 300 presumable X-linked families by X chromosome-specific array-CGH and identified 6 families with overlapping microduplications at Xp11.22 containing two candidate genes;  both of which showed overexpression in the affected individuals.  Array-CGH data revealed aberrant Cy5/Cy3 log2 ratios for different but overlapping sets of clones indicating varying sizes of these duplications in the different families. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
