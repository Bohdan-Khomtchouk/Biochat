TITLE
Genome-wide DNA Methylation Analysis in Lung Fibroblasts Co-cultured with Silica-exposed Alveolar Macrophages

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In the present study, we used MeDIP coupled with next-generation sequencing to profile the whole genome DNA methylation patterns of fibroblast from the co-culture model in vitro. We analyzed the data to identify possible biological pathways for fibroblast differentiating into myofibroblast as well as the interactions of related genes.

DESIGN
The co-culture was established of AMs and fibroblasts. Seeding fibroblasts into six-well plates and incubated for one or two days until approximately 60% confluence was achieved. AMs were seeding into the inserts and placed the insert into the six-well dish and then exposed to 100Âµg/ml SiO2 for 0-, 24-, and 48 hours
