TITLE
Expression data from flowers of two isogenic lines J10AB and J03AB at different developmental stages

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Dominant genic male sterility (DGMS) is a valuable system for hybrid seed production and improvement of plant populations, but the molecular mechanism of DGMS is not well understood. To facilitate the analysis of mechanism underlying DGMS, we compared gene expression profiles between fertile and sterile flowers of two pair of Brassica napus isogenic lines: J10AB and J03AB which only differ in sterility-related locus and fertility restore-related locus respectively by using Arabidopsis thaliana ATH-1 microarray. Gene expression profiling revealed that 360 genes differed in expression between the two lines and the number of differently expressed genes increased with progressing developmental stages. Cluster analysis result indicates that most important gene expression changes occur from PMC (anther less than 1mm) to uninucleate stage (anther in 3mm). There are 182 differential expressed genes detected between fertile plants and sterile plants at same stage.  Some important pathways related to fertility control by KEGG analysis, such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and fatty acid metabolism pathway. Another abortion usually associated with suppression of gene expression of these pathways. Keywords: Time course analysis
