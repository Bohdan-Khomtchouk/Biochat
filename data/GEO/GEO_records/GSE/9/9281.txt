TITLE
Genomic profile of dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis model in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Background & Aims: Dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) induced colitis in rats is one of the most widely used models of inflammatory bowel disease. Animal models can provide new insights into the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation, which is still unknown. We have performed a genomic analysis of the DSS rat colitis including an acute and a recovery phase. Methods: Expression profile of 6 control rats were compared with colitic rats at day 1 every other day until day 23 after DSS treatment using the GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array (Affymetrix). Functional and pathways analysis were made with the differentially expressed genes. Keywords: Time course and differentially expressed genes analysis
