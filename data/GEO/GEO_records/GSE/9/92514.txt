TITLE
Chromochloris zofingiensis response to high light

ORGANISM
Chromochloris zofingiensis

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq of Chromochloris zofingiensis following the transition from medium light to high light.

DESIGN
Cultures of Chromochloris zofingiensis were grown diurnally (16 h light, 8 h dark) in 100 μmol photons m^−2 s^−1 medium light (ML). At t = 0, cultures were transferred to 400 μmol photons m^−2 s^−1 high light (HL). Samples were collected in quadruplicate at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 12 h for ML cultures and at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 12 h for HL cultures. All samples were collected during the 16hr daylight period.
