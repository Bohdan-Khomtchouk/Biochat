TITLE
miRNA profiling in monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The outcome of miRNAs were successfully constructed through a differential expression profiling of a total of 190 unique miRNA in MCT-treated mice compare to the wild-type (WT) mice.

DESIGN
The present study designed for the first time to investigate miRNA profiling in MCT-treated mice in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Untreated WT mice were used as comparative control.
