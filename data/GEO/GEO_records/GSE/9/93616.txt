TITLE
JunB overexpression effect on microvascular endothelial cell culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in immortalized human microvascular endothelial cells (TIME cells) following forced expression of the JunB. Results provide insight into a role for the JunB signaling pathway in endothelial cell.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of Tert-immortalized human microvascular endothelial cells (TIME cells) with or without JunB overexpression.
