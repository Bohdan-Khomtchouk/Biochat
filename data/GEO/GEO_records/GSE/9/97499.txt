TITLE
Genome-wide binding analysis of Arabidopsis GATA transcription factors GNC and CGA1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
GATA transcription factors are involved in multiple processes in plant growth and development. Two GATA factors, nitrate-inducible, carbon metabolism-involved (GNC) and CYTOKININ-RESPONSIVE GATA FACTOR 1 (CGA1, also named GNL) are important regulators in greening, flowering, senescence and hormone signaling. However, their direct target genes in regulating these biological processes are poorly characterized. Here, we report a genome-wide identification of the target genes of Arabidopsis GNC and CGA1.

DESIGN
INPUT DNA and ChIP-DNA from 2 biological replicates of Arabidopsis myc-GNC and myc-CGA1 transgenic lines were subjected for sequencing.
