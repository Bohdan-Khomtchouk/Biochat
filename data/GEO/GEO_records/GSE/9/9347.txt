TITLE
Gene expression profiling of prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better understand the molecular mechanism that underlay tumorigenesis and progression of prostate cancer (PCa), we studied the gene expression profiles of sixteen PCa compared to their matched normal tissues. Using Significance Analysis of Microarrays, we identified 53 genes differentially expressed that were more than 2 fold up- or down-regulated in at least 50 % of the tumors. Keywords: disease state analysis
