TITLE
wild type 6 hours exposure to congo red

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
S. cerevisiae was grown on YEPD. For Congo Red experiments, yeast cells were grown overnight at 24 °C to an optical density 0.8 - 1 (A600). The culture was refreshed to 0.2 O.D and grown at 24 °C for 2h 30min. Next, culture was divided into two parts. One continues growing under same conditions (non-treated culture) while the other was supplemented with Congo Red to a final concentration of 30 μg/ml. Cells were collected at 6 hours of growth, frozen at -80 °C and processed for RNA extraction. Keywords: repeat sample
