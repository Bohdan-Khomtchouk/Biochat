TITLE
Identification and analysis of brown planthopper-responsive microRNAs in the resistant and susceptible rice plants

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate a spectrum of development and defense response processes in plants. The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most devastating insect pest of rice, BPH resistance gene BPH15 has a strong resistance to BPH. In this study, we analyzed six miRNA profiles of BPH15 introgression line (P15) and susceptible recipient line (PC) in 3 time points (0h, 6h and 48h) after BPH attacked, and identified 464 known miRNAs and 183 novel miRNAs. Before BPH feeding we identified 23 miRNAs expressed differently in P15 and PC. Then after BPH feeding, 104 miRNAs were found expressed differently in P15, and 80 miRNAs were found expressed differently in PC. Among them, miR167, miR444d, miR1846e, miR3979-3p, miR531 were found to be involved in BPH stress response. The response to BPH of P15 was much wider and more rapidly than PC. The levels of a subset of miRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR. The targets of miRNAs were predicted and validated by gene expression profiling. Additionally, the target genes of 2 differently expressed miRNAs (miR160f-5p and miR167a-5p) were confirmed by detecting YFP fluorescence and western blotting. Our data provide an important basis for evaluating the role of miRNA in the regulation of BPH interactions in rice.
