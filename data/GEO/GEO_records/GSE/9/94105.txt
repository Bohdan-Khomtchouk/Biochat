TITLE
Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic to characterize cold stress response in Nicotiana tabacum

ORGANISM
Nicotiana tabacum

SUMMARY
We checked the difference of CB-1 and K326 by transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis and found some important genes related to cold stress

DESIGN
4 RNA-seq samples for CB-1 and K326 of WT and cold treatment
