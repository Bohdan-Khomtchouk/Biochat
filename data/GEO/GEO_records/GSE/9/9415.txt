TITLE
Arabidopsis plants exposed to combined heat and drought stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
One of the eminent opportunities afforded by modern genomic technologies is the potential to provide a mechanistic understanding of the processes by which genetic change translates to phenotypic variation and the resultant appearance of distinct physiological traits.  Indeed much progress has been made in this area, particularly in biomedicine where functional genomic information can be used to determine the physiological state (e.g., diagnosis) and predict phenotypic outcome (e.g., patient survival).  Until now, ecology has lacked an analogous approach where genomic information can be used to diagnose the presence of a given physiological state (e.g., stress response) and then predict likely phenotypic outcomes (e.g., stress tolerance, fitness).  We demonstrate that a compendium of genomic signatures can be used to classify the plant abiotic stress phenotype in Arabidopsis according to the architecture of the transcriptome, and then be linked with gene coexpression network analysis to determine the underlying signaling pathways and ultimately the genes governing the phenotypic response. Here, we release microarray data from an expression profiling study where plants were exposed to heat and drought alone, and in combination with each other.
