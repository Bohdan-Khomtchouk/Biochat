TITLE
RNA-seq Analysis of Tcf1-regulated Genes in Human ESCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose:The goal of this study is to analyze the candidate genes motified by Tcf1 to regulate the human embryonic stem cell (ESC) fate through RNA-seq approach.

DESIGN
HES2 human ESCs expressing PB or PB-Tcf1 were cultured in 10% KSR basal media supplemented with 10 ng/ml FGF2, 10 ng/ml Activin A and 4 ÂµM IWR1 for two passages and then collected by using Trizol . These samples were sent to BGI (China) company to do deep sequencing by using BGISEQ-500.
