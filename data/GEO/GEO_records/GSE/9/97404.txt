TITLE
Gene and transcript expression in a G1S Cell Cycle Phase Marker (G1S-CCPM) recombinant U2OS cell line that stably expresses the Cas9 nuclease from a CAG promoter

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment is to determine the gene/transcript expression levels in the G1S-CCPM-Cas9 cell line to help interpret gene editing experiments.

DESIGN
Two replicate samples were sequenced from the G1S-CCPM-Cas9 cell line
