TITLE
Expression data from C17.2 progenitor cells during neural differentiation for 5 and 10 days with NGF and BDNF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarray to study the change in gene expression during differentiation in the C17.2 progenitor cell line. The cells were either undifferentiated or differentiated for 5 or 10 days. The goal was to identify genes important for differentiation of the C17.2 cell line

DESIGN
The C17.2 progenitor cells were isolated either as undifferentiated progenitor cells or differentiated for 5 or 10 days with NGF and BDNF.
