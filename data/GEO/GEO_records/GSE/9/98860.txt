TITLE
Mtor knockout in PDAC cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line was isolated from a Pdx1-Flp, FSF-KRasG12D/+, Rosa26-CreERT2/tdEG, Mtor-lox/lox mouse. Cultured cells were treated with 4-Hydroxytamoxifen to induce CreERT2 mediated excision of floxed Exon 3 of Mtor.

DESIGN
Tamoxifen induced knockout of Mtor in a Pdx1-Flp, FSF-KRasG12D/+, Rosa26-CreERT2/tdEG, Mtor-lox/lox pancreatic cancer cell line
