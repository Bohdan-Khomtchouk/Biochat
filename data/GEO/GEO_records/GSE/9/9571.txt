TITLE
Effects of Sxl on gene expression in the male head of Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Sex-lethal (Sxl), a feminizing switch gene in Drosophila, also generates male-specific proteins and non-sex-specific mRNAs, despite the fact that deleting the gene from males causes no obvious phenotypic abnormalities.  We specifically investigate how Sxl may affect gene expression in the male head, where SXL isoforms have been detected.  The information may help us understand how Sxl acquired its functional roles in sex determination during evolution in Drosophila Keywords: Comparative expression, genetic modification
