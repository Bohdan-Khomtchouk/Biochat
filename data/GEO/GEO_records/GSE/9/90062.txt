TITLE
Expression data from healthy donors and AML patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the top 20 up-regulated genes in CD34+ cells from AML patients in comparison with healthy donors, we examined the microarray gene expression profile of CD34+ blasts from patients with newly diagnosed AML vs CD34+ normal cells from healthy donors. Despite the fact that combined therapy of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with arsenic trioxide (ATO) or chemotherapy dramatically improves the prognosis of patients with APL, these regimens can cause systemic infections and secondary leukemias. Here we report that expression of the pseudokinase Tribble 3 (TRIB3) associates positively with APL progression and therapeutic resistance. The elevated TRIB3 expression promotes APL by interacting with PML-RARa and suppressing its sumoylation, ubiquitylation and degradation. This represses PML nuclear body assembly, p53-mediated senescence, cell differentiation, and supports cellular self-renewal. Genetically inhibiting Trib3 expression or disturbing the TRIB3/PML-RARa interaction produces potent therapeutic efficacy against APL and has synergic anti-APL effects when used in combination with ATRA or ATO by promoting PML-RARa degradation and PML expression. Our study provides new insight into APL pathogenesis and a new therapeutic option against APL.

DESIGN
Total RNA of CD34+ cells from bone marrow from newly diagnosed AML patients and healthy donors  was obtained, and RNA quantity and quality were measured by NanoDrop ND-1000. RNA microarrays were performed.
