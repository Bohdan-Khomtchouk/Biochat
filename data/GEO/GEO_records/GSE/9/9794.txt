TITLE
Progression of heart failure induced by tachycardia

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Analysis of changes of gene expression profiles in the left ventricle (LV) during the progression of heart failure (HF) in the canine tachypacing induced HF model. Gene expression profiling was performed on samples collected at different time points representing various stages of LV dysfunction, i.e. tachypaced for 3 days (Day-3), 1 week (Week-1), 2 weeks (Week-2), 3-4 weeks (End stage), and unpaced controls (Day-0). Results provide insights into molecular mechanisms of heart failure progression. Keywords: time course
