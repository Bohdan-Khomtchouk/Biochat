TITLE
Sequencing of ponatinib-resistant LC-2/ad derivatives (PR1 and PR2) and parental LC-2/ad cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sequencing of ponatinib-resistant LC-2/ad derivatives (PR1 and PR2) and parental LC-2/ad cells was performed in order to determine mechanisms of acquired resistance in the PR1 and PR2 cell lines. NRAS p.Q61K mutation identified in PR1 cells. Upregulation of wild-type EGFR signaling identified in PR2 cells.

DESIGN
Sequencing of ponatinib-resistant LC-2/ad derivatives (PR1 and PR2) and parental LC-2/ad cells was performed.
