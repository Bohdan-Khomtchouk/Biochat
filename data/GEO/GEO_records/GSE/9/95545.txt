TITLE
A transcriptional program for arbuscule degeneration during AM symbiosis is regulated by MYB1

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
The array experiment compares gene expression in roots of Medicago truncatula A17 and Medicago truncatula mutant mtpt4-1 colonized with Gigaspora gigantea. This experiment enabled the identification of a plant transcriptional program associated with arbuscule degeneration. The experiment and data are described in Floss et al., Current Biology (in revision).
