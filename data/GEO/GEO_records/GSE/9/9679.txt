TITLE
Drosophila pole cell transcriptome in early embryogenesis (stage 4).

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To screen transcripts enriched in pole cells, primordial germ cells of Drosophila, during early embryogenesis, we compared transcriptome between pole cells and whole embryos at stage 4 by a microarray analysis. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate pole cells from the embryos carrying the transgene, EGFP-vasa, which expresses GFP specifically and continuously in the germline throughout the life cycle. Keywords: cell type comparison
