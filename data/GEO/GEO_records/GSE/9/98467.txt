TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of Caulobacter crescentus wild-type and delta_hfq (CJW5477) strains

ORGANISM
Caulobacter vibrioides

SUMMARY
We report the global changes in the gene expression profile of Caulobacter crescentus in the absence of Hfq.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic profiles were generated from cultures grown in PYE until exponential phase at 30C
