TITLE
Time series RNA profiling of endotheilal cells in response to atheroprone and atheroprotective flows

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To profile shear stress-regulated endothelial transcriptomes, we performed RNA-seq with HUVECs subjected to different shear flow conditions, including atheroprotective pulsatile shear (PS, 12±4 dyn/cm2) and atheroprone oscillatory shear (OS, 0.5±4 dyn/cm2), or kept as static control (ST) for four time periods (1, 4, 12 and 24 hours)

DESIGN
HUVECs cultured on collagen I-coated slides were exposed to PS, OS  or ST.  RNA were extracted with TRIzol and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq platform.
