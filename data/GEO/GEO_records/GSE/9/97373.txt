TITLE
Genome-wide nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation profiling in endometriosis cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We show that knocking down ARID1A in an immortalized endometriosis cell line leads to phenotypic changes  in vitro.  Additionally, we find strong increases in the active H3K27ac mark in promoter regions but decrease of H3K27ac at potential enhancers with targeted DNA methylation-independent alterations in nucleosome occupancy.

DESIGN
Simultaneous examination of nuclesome-occupancy and DNA methylation in endometriosis control and ARID1A knockdown cell lines.
