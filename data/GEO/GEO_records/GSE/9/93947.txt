TITLE
Oncogenic PIK3CA(H1047R) and CTNNB1(stab) in intestinal organoids

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Goals of the study was to compare transcripional and phenotypic response of mouse intestinal organoid cultures to the PIK3CA(H1047R) and CTNNB1(stab) oncogenes.

DESIGN
Two biological  replicates of organoids with transgenic tdTomato-Luciferase, tdTomato-PIK3CAH1047R, tdTomato-CTNNB1stab or td-Tomato-PIK3CAH1047R-CTNNB1stab were analysed by RNA-Seq By comparing 7-10 x 10E7 50bp paired end reads per library we identify transcriptional alterations in the intestinal epithelium following expression of each or both oncogenes,
