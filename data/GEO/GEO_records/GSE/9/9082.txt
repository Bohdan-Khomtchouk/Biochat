TITLE
DNA  validation of LAB 2k v2

ORGANISM
Leuconostoc mesenteroides

SUMMARY
To study their metabolic potential in natural ecosystems, we developed a species-independent LAB microarray, containing 2,269 30-mer oligonucleotides, and targeting 406 genes that play a key role in the production of sugar catabolites, bacteriocins, exopolysaccharides, and aromas, in probiotic and biosafety characteristics, and in stress response. Also, genes linked to negative traits such as antibiotic resistance and virulence are represented.  This experiment is a validation experiment, where we hybridized labelled DNA from 20 LAB strains, covering 86% of all oligos. Keywords: Platform validation experiment
