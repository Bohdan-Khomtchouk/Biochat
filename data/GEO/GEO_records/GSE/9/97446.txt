TITLE
Auxin responsive genes in the Arabidopsis stem

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
15-20 cm tall 35S::Myc-GR-bdl plants were dipped headfirst in 15 µM dexamethasone or mock solution and after three hours of incubation second internodes were harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen plant material was pulverized with pestle and mortar and RNA was isolated by phenol/chlorophorm extraction as described previously  (Mallory & Vaucheret 2010, PlantCell) with the modification of two additional concluding 70% EtOH washes

DESIGN
RNA from three samples was pooled and analyzed by RNAseq.
