TITLE
Hippocampus-dependent learning and memory deficits by abnormalities in presynaptic plasticity in LSD1 knock-in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the molecular and cellular mechanism for memory deficit in LSD1 knock-in mice.

DESIGN
Compare gene expression profiles between wild-type and LSD1 knock-in mutant using RNA-Seq (Illumina platform: Hi-Seq 2000)
