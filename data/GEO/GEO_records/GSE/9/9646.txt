TITLE
Expression data for drought-, cold, high-salinity and ABA treatment in Arabidopsis plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We applied the tiling arrays to study the Arabidopsis whole-genome transcriptome under drought, cold, high-salinity and ABA treatment conditions and idenfied many stress- or ABA- responsive putative functional RNAs and fully-overlapping sense-antisense transcripts in Arabidopsis genome. Keywords: stress response
