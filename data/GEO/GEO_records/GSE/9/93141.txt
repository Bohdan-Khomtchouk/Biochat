TITLE
809094 Biomarker Identification in Fracture Healing (experiment #3303 performed 2010 Mar)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The specific genes that distinguish normal fracture healing from abnormal healing or nonunion in humans are unknown.  This study was an exploratory investigation of peripheral blood from  acutely injured fracture patients collected over multiple days compared to age and sex matched healthy volunteers. We used microarrays to do a global comparison between acutely injured (AI) subjects (AIS) vs age and sex matched healthy volunteers (HV).
