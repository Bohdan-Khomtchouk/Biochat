TITLE
Genotype data from early passage UACC melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
eQTL is a powerful method to detect genotype-expression correlation. To be able to identify the genes whose expression levels are correlated with melanoma-associated common variants, eQTL analysis was performed in 59 early passage melanoma cell lines

DESIGN
To perform eQTL analysis, 67 early passage melanoma cell line collected through University of Arizoan Cancer Center (UACC) were grown in culture and harvested at log phase. DNA was extracted following the protocol described below and genotypes were detected using Illumina Infinium OmniEpress array Cancer Genome Research Laboratory at NCI (A contributor to this study).
