TITLE
Wild type (WT), partial hepatectomy, and lncHand2 KO chip

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify differential genes after partial hepatectomy, we performed gene chip analysis of livers from wild type (WT) mouse and PHx 36h mouse livers To find differential genes regulated by lncHand2, we performed gene chip analysis from WT and lncHand2 deficiency livers.

DESIGN
We used one wild type, one partial hepatectomy, and one lncHand2 knockout mice.
