TITLE
Genome-wide analyses for the cellular and chemical development regulator WetA in Aspergillus flavus

ORGANISM
Aspergillus flavus

SUMMARY
Linking cell reproduction and survival is a key task of all life forms. All fungi in the genus Aspergillus reproduce by forming asexual spores called conidia, of which formation is governed by the central regulatory circuit, BrlA- > AbaA- > WetA. Here, we report that WetA is a key multi-functional regulator that bridged spore differentiation, long-term survival, and chemical development in Aspergillus flavus.

DESIGN
2-day old conidia mRNA profiles of  wild type (NRRL3357) and wetA deletion mutant were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2500.
