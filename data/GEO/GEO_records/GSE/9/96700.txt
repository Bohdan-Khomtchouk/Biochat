TITLE
The Stability of the Transcriptome during the Estrous Cycle in Four Regions of the Mouse Brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptome of the C57BL/6J mouse hypothalamus, hippocampus, neocortex, and cerebellum to determine estrous cycle-specific changes in these four brain regions.  We found almost 16,000 genes are present in one or more of the brain areas but only 210 genes, ~1.3%, are significantly changed as a result of the estrous cycle.  The hippocampus has the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (82), followed by the neocortex (76), hypothalamus (63), and cerebellum (26).  Most of these DEGs (186/210) are differentially expressed in only one of the four brain regions.  A key finding is the unique expression pattern of growth hormone (Gh) and prolactin (Prl).  Gh and Prl are the only DEGs to be expressed during only one stage of the estrous cycle (metestrus).  To gain insight into the function of the DEGs, we examined gene ontology and phenotype enrichment and found significant enrichment for genes associated with myelination, hormone stimulus, and abnormal hormone levels.  Additionally, 61 of the 210 DEGs are known to change in response to estrogen in the brain.  50 genes differentially expressed as a result of the estrous cycle are related to myelin and oligodendrocytes and 12 of the 63 DEGs in the hypothalamus are oligodendrocyte- and myelin-specific genes.  This transcriptomic analysis reveals that gene expression in the female mouse brain is remarkably stable during the estrous cycle and demonstrates that the genes that do fluctuate are functionally related.

DESIGN
Hypothalamus, hippocampus, neocortex, and cerebellum mRNA from adult female C57BL/6J (B6) mice were analyzed by RNA sequencing of 3 biological replicates for each of the 4 stages of the estrous cycle using an Illumina HiSeq 2500
