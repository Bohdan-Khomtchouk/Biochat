TITLE
Expression data of early skin development mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice with the spontaneous uncv mutation are hairless.  We utilize the uncv null mouse to investigate the underlying mechanisms giving rise to the relevant phenotypes and reveal significant changes in certain signaling pathways by microarray. Keywords: RNA expression study
