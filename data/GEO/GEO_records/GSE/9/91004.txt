TITLE
Investigating mixotrophic metabolism in the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum.

ORGANISM
Phaeodactylum tricornutum

SUMMARY
Diatoms are prominent marine microalgae, interesting not only from an ecological point of view, but also for their possible use for biotechnology applications. They can be cultivated in phototrophic conditions, using sunlight as the only energy source. Some diatoms, however, can also grow in mixotrophic mode, where both light and external reduced carbon contribute to biomass accumulation. In this study, we investigated the consequences of mixotrophy on the growth and metabolism of the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, using glycerol as a source of reduced carbon. Transcriptomic, metabolomic and physiological data indicate that glycerol affects the central-carbon, carbon-storage and lipid metabolism of the diatom. In particular, glycerol addition mimics some typical responses of nitrogen limitation on lipid metabolism at the level of TAG accumulation and fatty acid composition. However, this compound does not diminish photosynthetic activity and cell growth, at variance with nutrient limitation, revealing essential aspects of the metabolic flexibility of these microalgae and suggesting possible biotechnological applications of mixotrophy.

DESIGN
Phaeodactylum tricornutum cultures were growing in 12L/12D cycles in presence and absence of glycerol and harvested after 5 days. Cells grown using only light as source of energy (reference cells) represented the control condition and were compared with cells grown in presence of both light and glycerol (test cells). Three biological replicates were sampled for the two conditions.
