TITLE
Molecular biomarkers for weight control in obese individuals subjected to a multi-phase dietary intervention

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Subcutaneous adipose tissue transcriptomes were compared between 21 obese individuals that either maintained weight loss (good controllers) or regained weight (poor controllers) during a 2-phase dietary Intervention. Dietary intervention: Individuals underwent 8-weeks of calorie-restriction, then 6-months of ad libitum diet.

DESIGN
Two groups,good- and poor-controllers; two conditions for each individual, baseline (before dietary intervention) and after dietary intervention.
