TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of HD and control iPSCs and derived NPCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Huntington disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in HTT. In this study, we corrected HD human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) using a CRISPR-Cas9 and piggyBac transposon-based approach. To explore transcriptional differences amongst the HD, the corrected lines and the non-related healthy control lines, we performed genome-wide microarray gene expression analysis on the hiPSCs and neural progenitor cells derived from them.

DESIGN
Total of 24 samples were used for the analysis, with 3 replicates per line per cell type
