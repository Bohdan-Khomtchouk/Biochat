TITLE
Whole genome expression profiling of melanoma-derived induced pluripotent cancer cells in comparison to the parental melanoma cells and to human induced pluripotent stem cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reprogramming of HT144 melanoma cells to pluripotency. Aim of the study was to demonstrate the amenability of melanoma cells to reprogramming. Results demonstrate that iPCCs cluster closer to iPSCs than to their parental cells of origin.

DESIGN
Total RNA from reprogrammed HT144-induced pluripotent cancer cells compared to parental HT144 melanoma cells and two iPSC lines.
