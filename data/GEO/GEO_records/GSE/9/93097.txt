TITLE
Loss of a CDR1as, a conserved mammalian circRNA, causes miRNA de-regulation and a psychiatric phenotype [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly expressed in mammalian brains, with oftentimes conserved expression patterns. However, so far no circRNAs loss-of-function has been reported. The circRNA CDR1as has been proposed to function as a sponge for microRNA miR-7. We removed the CDR1as locus from the mouse genome, and performed a series of high-throughput experiments to characterize the gene expression in wild type and knockout mice. Our data reveal the first in vivo loss-of-function phenotype for a circRNA and show that interactions between circRNAs and miRNAs are important for healthy brain function.

DESIGN
We performed polyA-selected RNA sequencing for three knockout and three wild type replicates in four brain regins - cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus and olfactory bulb.
