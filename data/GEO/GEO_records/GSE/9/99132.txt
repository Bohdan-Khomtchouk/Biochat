TITLE
Expression data from colorectal cancer cell line HCT-116

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression in cell line with or without M1 virus infection.

DESIGN
Cell line with or without M1 virus infection were for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
