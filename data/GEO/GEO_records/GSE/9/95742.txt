TITLE
Effects of anti-complement component 5 antibody targeting MG4 domain on the normal retina

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aims to investigate the effects of anti-complement component 5 antibody targeting MG4 domain on normal retina.

DESIGN
Mice were treated with intravitreal injection of anti-C5 antibody (1 or 10 μg/1 μL PBS). At 7 days after the injection, retinas were prepared from the enucleated eyes. Four retinas from 4 mice were put into a microcentrifuge tube for further analyses. 'Control', 'Therapeutic' and 'Toxic' groups mean that the mice received intravitreal PBS, 1 μg of anti-C5 antibody and 10 μg of anti-C5 antibody. Three biological replicates were included for each group.
