TITLE
Galectin-3 binding protein (Gal-3BP), coronary artery disease and cardiovascular mortality – insights from the LURIC study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gal-3BP effects on human monocyte-derived macrophages were assessed in vitro. Macrophages were treated with recombinant human Gal-3BP or control buffer and gene expression was measured using Illumina Sentrix-8 gene arrays. Gene array data were analyzed with the Local pooled error (LPE). There was significant regulation of 217 probe sets corresponding to 200 genes (115 up, 85 down). Analysis of the significantly upregulated genes identified “inflammatory/immune response” as one of the most strongly regulated gene ontologies. Our finding that Gal-3BP induces genes and proteins involved in immune and inflammatory response in human monocyte-derived macrophages is in line with previously published data on the role of human Gal-3BP.

DESIGN
Effects of Galectin-3 binding protein on human monocyte-derived macrophages were assessed (n=2 per group).
