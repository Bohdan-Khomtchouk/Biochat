TITLE
Effect of TERT and ATM on Gene Expression Profiles in Human Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was performed by use of serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) on BJ normal human skin fibroblasts, A-T cells, and BJ and A-T cells transduced with hTERT cDNA and expressing telomerase activity. Keywords = telomere Keywords = telomerase Keywords = TERT Keywords = ataxia telangiectasia mutated Keywords = ATM Keywords = serial analysis of gene expression Keywords = SAGE Keywords = fibroblast Keywords: parallel sample
