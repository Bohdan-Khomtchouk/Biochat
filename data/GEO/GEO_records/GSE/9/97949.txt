TITLE
A549 cell transcriptome responses to infection with H7N9 influenza virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA-Seq analysis was used to profile the cellular transcriptome of A549 cells at multiple time points in response to infection with influenza H7N9.

DESIGN
A549 cells were infected with H7N9(A/Anhui/1/2013 ) at MOI of 1 for 1.5h, 3h and 7h. The mRNA was derived from the total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Then the mRNA was fragmented and converted into cDNA. The adapters were ligated to the cDNA and then the fragments were amplified by PCR. Paired-end sequencing (101 Ã— 2) was performed using a Hiseq-2000 (Illumina). Each condition of the samples was sequenced in duplicate.
