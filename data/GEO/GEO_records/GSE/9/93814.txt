TITLE
Human Adult Sorted Live Cell Erythroblasts RNA-Seq.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Erythroblasts cultured from mobilized CD34+ cells from six healthy adult human donors were used to generate an erythroblast transcriptome. Cellular maturation was maintained including enucleation.  On culture day 14 total RNA was isolated (see PMID: 23798711 for details). These RNA-Seq profiles were generated after flow cytometric sorting (live cell gating of culture Day 14 erythroblasts according to forward and side scatter).

DESIGN
Human CD34+ cells from health donor cultured in serum free medium.  RNA extracted from sorted live cell gate on Day 14 using Qiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit.  1ug of RNA was used for library construction and Ribo depletion with globin subtraction.
