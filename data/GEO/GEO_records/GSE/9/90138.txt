TITLE
Gene expression profile in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microarray gene expression profiling in 16 T-ALL cell lines

DESIGN
Human T-ALL cell lines were cultured at the same density for 24 hours.  RNA samples were used for microarray gene expression analysis.
