TITLE
Expression data from ileum of adult male wild type and Slc51a knockout mice, where the basolateral membrane bile acid transporter subunit encoded by Slc51a is inactivated.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the dysregulated pathways responsible for the intestinal adaptive response in the Slc51a knockout mice. We used microarrays to detail the ileal gene expression of wt and Slc51a knockout mice and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes in Slc51a knockout mice.

DESIGN
To isolate ileal tissue to isolate RNA for microarray analysis of gene expression.
