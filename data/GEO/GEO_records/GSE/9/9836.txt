TITLE
NFkB target gene microarray during LIF-withdrawal differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An NFkB target gene array (Panomics, Inc., Redwood City, CA) was performed to profile the expression pattern of 107 NFkB-regulated genes in mouse embryonic stem cells. A small scale microarray was carried out using NFkB target gene array kit (Panomics, Inc., Redwood City, CA). A long sense-strand oligonucleotide for each of the 107 human genes that have been previously shown to be regulated by NFkB signaling pathway was spotted in duplicate on the nitrocellulose membrane. Biotinylated DNA was spotted along the right and bottom sides of the array membrane as control. The arrays were performed according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Keywords: embryonic stem cell differentiation
