TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for cord blood (CB)-derived MDSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to distinguish CB-MDSCs treated with or without combined cytokines, and CB-MDSCs cultured in complete or glucose-deprived medium.

DESIGN
Purified CD34+ cells from cord blood were cultured in HSC expansion media for 7-8 d. The expanded cells were then incubated with (GM+G) or without (Med) combined GM-CSF and G-CSF for 3 d. Cytokine-treated CB-MDSCs were cultured in comoplete or glucose-deprived medium (-Glc). Two or three independent experiments were performed at each group (Med, GM+G, -Glc) using different donors for each experiment.
