TITLE
RNA sequencing of ID4-GFP Bright and ID4-GFP Dim spermatogonia from postnatal day 8 transgenic Id4-Gfp (LT11) mouse pups and ID4-GFP+ spermatogonia from ID4 overexpression mouse model and control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice that constitutively overexpress ID4 in germ cells have impaired spermatogenic lineage development.  The transcriptome of ID4-GFP+ spermatogonia from testes of ID4 overexpression animals was compared to the ID4-GFP+ population from controls

DESIGN
Comparison of transcriptomes of ID4-GFP+ spermatogonia from animals constitutively overexpressing ID4 and control animals
