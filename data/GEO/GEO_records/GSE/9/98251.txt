TITLE
Epigenomic Atlas of Early Human Craniofacial Development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Interactions between putative enhancer region and locations on the same chromosome in mouse E11.5 craniofacial tissue

DESIGN
Circularized Chromosome Confirmation Capture with Sequecing (4C-seq) determination of long-distance interactions originating from putative enhancer region distal to the HoxA cluster and locations near and within the anterior HoxA cluster using two independent samples of mouse craniofacial tissue
