TITLE
The effect of the HDAC inhibitor OSU-HDAC42 on gene expression in esophageal tissues and adenocarcinoma cells II

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Title: In vitro and in vivo effects of the orally bioavailable phenylbutyrate-derived histone deacetylase inhibitor OSU-HDAC42 on gene expression in esophageal tissues and in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modulate nucleosomal packaging of DNA, thereby influencing gene transcription and multiple cancer-associated processes. We conducted microarray analysis on esophageal tissue from male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with OSU-HDAC42 or vehicle to assess target effect in an in vivo model utilized for EAC development. Keywords: esophageal tissue from male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with OSU-HDAC42 or vehicle
