TITLE
129, AJ and Balb CGH against C57 reference on Agilent whole genome and custom mouse long oligonucleotide arrays

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CGH comparing 3 inbred mouse strains to a C57BL/6 reference. The 3 inbred strains used have known trypanotolerance phenotypes, and these data were originally acquired as part of a study investigating the genetic mechanisms underlying trypanotolerance. These data have also been used in conjunction with the Perlegen 8 million SNP dataset to examine the effect of sequence mismatches on the log2 signal ratios acquired by these long oligonucleotide arrays. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridisation
