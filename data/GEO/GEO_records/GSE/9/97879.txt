TITLE
Transcriptomic profile of the Beauveria bassiana infection to the Galleria mellonella

ORGANISM
Beauveria bassiana

SUMMARY
The ascomycete fungus Beauveria bassiana is a pathogen of hundreds of insect species and is commercially produced as an environmentally friendly mycoinsecticide. Genome-wide insight into the infection of the fungi is critical for genetic improvement of fungal insecticides but has been poorly explored. We constructed three transcriptomes of Beauveria bassiana at 24, 48 and 72 hours post treatment of infection (BbI) and of control (Bbc).

DESIGN
1,Beauveria bassiana groewn on PDA medium. 2,Beauveria bassiana at 24 hours post treatment of infection. 3, Beauveria bassiana at 48 hours post treatment of infection. 4, Beauveria bassiana at 72 hours post treatment of infection
