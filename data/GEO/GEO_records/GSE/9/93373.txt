TITLE
Epigenome analysis of B cell and  B cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiles of B cell and  B cells infected with EBV (LCLs). The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in B cells and EBV infected B cells. Samples included 8 normal B cells without EBV, 8 normal B cells with EBV.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 16 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium Human MehthylationEPIC BeadChip
