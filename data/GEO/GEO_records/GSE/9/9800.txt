TITLE
Expression signature of cardiac muscle as a potential diagnostic or prognostic tool for dilated cardiomyopathy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There is an emerging hypothesis that dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a manifestation of end-stage heart failure (ESHF) resulting from “final common pathway” despite heterogeneous primary etiologies. We performed genome-wide expression profiling by means of high-density oligonucleotide microarrays using cardiac muscles from patients with DCM or specific cardiomyopathy as well as non-disease control hearts. Differentially expressed genes between ESHF and non-disease samples should include both genes reactive to heart failure (HF) and those responsible for ESHF. With the aid of samples with acute HF without DCM and those with DCM without HF (corrected with left ventricular assist device), we successfully distinguished ESHF genes from HF genes. Our findings implicate that transcriptional signature of cardiac muscle can be potentially applied as a diagnostic or prognostic tool for severe HF. Keywords: disease state analysis
