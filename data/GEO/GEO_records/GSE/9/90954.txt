TITLE
Effect of TGFb treatment (1 ng/ml) on gene expression in Hepa1-6 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of the study is a high-throughput evaluation of the effect of TGFb treatment on gene expression. In parallel, complex formation of Smad trimers has been evaluated to link Smad complex formation with regulation of gene expression.

DESIGN
20 samples: treated and untreated for 5 time points (0h, 1h, 3h, 6h, 10h), each of the 2x5 conditions was measured in duplicates.
