TITLE
Genes regulated by HEB and E2A during DP stage of thymocyte development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate gene targets of the E-proteins HEB and E2A during the CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) stage of T cell development.  We examined E-protein function by simultaneous removal of both HEB (Tcf12) and E2A (Tcfe2a) genes at the DP stage.  This was done by crossing mice containing HEB floxed and E2A floxed alleles to a CD4Cre background (Tcf12f/fTcfe2af/fCD4Cre mice).  Microarray analysis was used to compare gene expression in HEB and E2A double deficient DP thymocytes (Cre+) to Cre- control DP thymocytes. Keywords: genetic modification
