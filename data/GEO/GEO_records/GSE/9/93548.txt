TITLE
Myc target gene, long intergenic noncoding RNA, Linc00176 in hepatocellular carcinoma regulates cell cycle and cell survival by titrating tumor suppressor microRNAs.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a frequent form of cancer with a poor prognosis and with limited possibilities for medical intervention. Recent evidence has accumulated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of disease processes including cancer. Chromatin remodeling in cancer cells may result in an unusual expression of lncRNAs and indeed it has been shown that more than 7000 unannotated lncRNAs are expressed in HCCs. We identified a novel long intergenic noncoding RNA, Linc00176, that plays a role in proliferation and survival of HCC. Linc00176 regulates expression of more than 200 genes by the sponge function for tumor suppressor miRNAs, miR-9 and miR-185. Linc00176 is expressed at a high level only in HCC, and is activated by Myc, Max and AP-4 transcription regulators. Myc also upregulates miR-9 and miR-185. In Linc00176-depleted HCC, these miRNAs were released from Linc00176 and downregulated their target mRNAs. Thus, depletion of Linc00176 disrupted the cell cycle and induced necroptosis in HCC via released tumor suppressor miRNAs. These data indicate that atypically expressed lncRNAs may be useful targets for cancer therapy.

DESIGN
In one dual-color microarray hybridization, mRNA expression changes after depletion of Linc00176
