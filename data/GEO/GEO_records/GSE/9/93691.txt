TITLE
Gene expression profiling of cardiomyocyte-enriched populations isolated from mice subject  to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and treated with BIX-01294 for 1 week

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of the histone mehyltrasferase G9a (also known as Ehmt2) in cardiac hypertrophy has not been studied extensively. To address how G9a promotes cardiac hypertrophy, we assessed the gene expression signature defined by G9a in cardiomyocytes (CM) of mice subject to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) for 1 wk, a surgical procedure that causes cardiac hypertrophy following the induction of pressure overload. To this end, we compared the expression profiles of CMs isolated from mice treated with the G9a inhibitor BIX-01294 and control groups (untreated and DMSO-treated mice at baseline and after TAC). The expression profiles were defined by Illumina arrays  .

DESIGN
Profiling of the transcriptome of cardiomyocyte-enriched populations isolated from mice subject at transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and treated with BIX-01294 for 1 week. Two biological replicates were profiled for each cell type.
