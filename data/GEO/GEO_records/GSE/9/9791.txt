TITLE
Antibody microarrays of plasma from bone marrow transplant patients to find markers of graft versus host disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A non-invasive diagnostic test does not exist for acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD). We therefore sought to identify biomarkers for aGVHD using antibody microarrays (Schleicher and Schuell Serum Biomarker Chips, Whatman) that simultaneously assayed 120 plasma proteins. We measured these proteins in a set of 42 patient plasma samples following an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT): 21 patients with a diagnosis of aGVHD grade II-IV (+GVHD) and 21 patients without aGVHD (â€“GVHD) at similar times after transplant.  We excluded data from 2 hybridizations that had very bright dots and appeared as outliers in preliminary principal components analysis, so that we finally compared 20 +GVHD to 20 -GVHD samples. Keywords: disease state analysis, antibody microarray
