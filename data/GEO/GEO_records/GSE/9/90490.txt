TITLE
The inhibitory effect of TIAM1 on TAZ transcriptional activity [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The T lymphoma invasion and metastasis inducing protein 1 (TIAM1) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates the small GTPase RAC1 and regulates a plethora of functions such as cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and polarity. Recently, we demonstrated that TIAM1 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Nuclear TIAM1 has an inhibitory role on TAZ transcriptional activity by impairing the interaction of TAZ with TEAD. To further demonstrate the inhibitory role of TIAM1 on TAZ we performed ChIP-Seq analysis to determine the enrichment of TAZ to chromatin of parental or CRISPR-mediated TIAM1 knockout SW480 cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq qnalysis of TAZ on parental or CRISPR-mediated TIAM1 knockout SW480 cells.
