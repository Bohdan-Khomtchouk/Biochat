TITLE
Gene expression data of human chord blood hematopoietic progenitor cells subjected to myeloid differentiation and transduced with shRNAs against LINC00173

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and miRNAs have emerged as crucial regulators of gene expression and cell fate decisions. We predicted LINC00173 as a novel non-coding regulator of granulopoiesis. We knocked down LINC00173 using two independent shRNA constructs, which resulted in diminished granulocytic in vitro differentiation, myeloid colony-formation and function. In addition, both shRNA and CRISPR-KRAB mediated knock-down of LINC00173 showed reduced cell proliferation in stem cells and NB4 cells (2-3-fold, pâ‰¤0.01). Here we assess early effects of LINC00173 knockdown in human HSPC subjected to myeloid differentiation conditions.

DESIGN
Human CD34+ HSPC from chord blood were transduced with shRNAs against LINC00173 or a control shRNA. Transduced cells were subjected to myeloid differentiation conditions. We analyzed early gene expression changes of LINC00173 knockdown using Agilent-072363 SurePrint G3 Human GE v3 8x60K Microarrays
