TITLE
Paramutation of natural epialleles in tomato [sRNA]

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
By using DNA methylation of introgression lines as a marker of past paramutation, we characterise in details the paramutation of the \textit{H06} locus in crosses between Solanum lycopersicum and a range of tomato relatives and cultivars. Paramutation of H06 depends on the timing of sRNA production and conforms to the RNA-directed model of paramutation. By scanning the methylomes of tomato introgression lines for shared regions of differential methylation, thousands of candidate regions for paramutation are identified. Analysing the segregation of the methylation patterns for a subset of these regions shows variations in the penetrance of paramutation-like interactions.

DESIGN
sRNA of M82, S. pennellii and their F1 for leaf/flower/pollen, sRNA for Micro-Tom and S. pimpinellifolium seedlings, methylome data of M82 and introgression lines IL1-1, IL2-5 and IL8-3
