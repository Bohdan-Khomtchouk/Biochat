TITLE
Cooperative regulatory functions of miR858 and MYB83 in transcriptome reprogramming during cyst nematode parasitism of Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes in miR858 and MYB83 overexpression lines compared to the wild-type Col-0 plants.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of two weeks old Arabidopsis root of Col-0 (wild type), miR858 resistant MYB83 overexpression line and miR858 overexpression line were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate using HiSeq 2500 system.
