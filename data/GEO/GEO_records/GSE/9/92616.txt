TITLE
MicroRNA-24-3p is overexpressed in Hodgkin lymphoma and protects Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells from apoptosis [small RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Micro (mi)RNAs not only play important roles in biological processes such as proliferation, metabolism, differentiation and apoptosis, but also in diseases such as cancers. We identified miRNAs with deregulated expression in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and investigated their role in the pathogenesis of HL. Small RNA sequencing revealed 84 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs in HL cell lines as compared to GC-B cells. Three upregulated miRNAs, miR-23a-3p, miR-24-3p and miR-27a-3p, were derived from one primary-miRNA transcript. Loss-of-function analysis for these miRNAs and their seed family members resulted in decreased growth upon miR-24-3p inhibition in three and of miR-27a/b-3p inhibition in one HL cell line. Apoptosis analysis indicated that the effect of miR-24-3p on cell growth is at least in part caused by an increase of apoptotic cells. Argonaute 2 (Ago2)-IP revealed 1,142 genes consistently targeted by miRNAs in at least three out of four HL cell lines. Furthermore, 52 out of the 1,142 genes were predicated targets of miR-24-3p. Functional annotation analysis revealed a function related to cell growth, cell death and/or apoptosis for 15 out of the 52 genes. Western blotting of the top-5 genes showed increased protein levels upon miR-24-3p inhibition for CDKN1B and MYC. In summary, we showed that miR-24-3p is upregulated in HL and its inhibition impaired cell growth possibly via targeting CDKN1B and MYC.

DESIGN
Expression of all known and novel miRNAs was assessed in  HL cell lines, BL cell lines and GC-B cells
