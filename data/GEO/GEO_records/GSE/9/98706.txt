TITLE
In Vitro Characterization of A4573 Preclinical Radiation-Adapted Model for Ewing Sarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentially expressed genes in wild type A4573 Ewing Sarcoma cells when compared to A4573 Ewing Sarcoma cells that received six 4 Gy fractions (cumulative dose of 24 Gy) of ionizing radiation (radiation-adapted cell line). The hypothesis tested being that repeated ionizing radiation exposure of modifies radiation therapy response in Ewing Sarcoma.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from wild type A4573 cells and radiation-adapted A4573 cells.
