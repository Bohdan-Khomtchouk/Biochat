TITLE
Expression data from healthy controls and early stage CRC patient's tumor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metastasis is the major cause of cancer mortality. Up to 25% of early stage sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients succumb to metastasis after curative surgery. We used microarrays to detail  gene expression and identified a metastasis-prone signature for early stage CRC. Keywords: RNA expression
