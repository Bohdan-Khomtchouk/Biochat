TITLE
The role of ferritin heavy chain (Fth) in polymicrobial sepsis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We systematically assessed the transcriptomic changes of livers of MxCreFthD/D vs. Fthlox/lox mice after induction of polymicrobial sepsis using Cecal Ligation and Puncture. Data indicates a distinct set of genes differentially regulated between MxCreFthD/D and Fthlox/lox mice after sepsis induction reflecting altered iron and glucose metabolism.

DESIGN
RNA from murine livers in MxCreFthD/D  and Fthlox/lox mice:  (n=4 for sepsis per genotype, n=4 for untreated controls per genotype) was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis for comparison of transcriptomic responses.
