TITLE
Primary Langerhans cells in mice treated with TCDD

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of murine LC after 24 hours in vivo exposure to a moderate dose of 10 microgram 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was studied. It was found that mice, although they express the arylhydrocarbon receptor abundantly in LC, are inert to its activation. Target genes are not inducible, in contrast to many other cell types. Keywords: toxic effect, single dose
