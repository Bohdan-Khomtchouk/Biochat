TITLE
Hormone-dependent control of developmental timing through regulation of chromatin accessibility

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We identify a temporal cascade of ecdysone-inducible transcription factor gene expression during Drosophila wing development. This temporal cascade corresponds with dynamic changes in chromatin accesibility during wing development. We hypothesized that these temporally regulated transcription factors may coordinate these dynamic open chromatin changes. To test this, we investigate the ecdysone-inducible transcription factor, E93, which we determine is required for coordinating transitions in developmental stage by regulating chromatin accesibility of cis-regulatory elements.

DESIGN
FAIRE-Seq in Triplicate during wild-type drosophila wing development timecourse (3LW, 24hAPF, 44hAPF). RNAseq in duplicate in wild-type wings (3LW, 24hAPF, 44hAPF). FAIRE-seq from E93-mutant wings (3LW, 24hAPF, 44hAPF) in duplicate. ChIP-seq for E93-GFSTF from 24hAPF wings.
