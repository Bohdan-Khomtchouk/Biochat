TITLE
N6-adenine DNA methylation in Tetrahymena

ORGANISM
Tetrahymena thermophila

SUMMARY
In this study, we provided the first genome-wide, base pair-resolution map of 6mA in Tetrahymena by applying single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing.

DESIGN
Examination of N6-adenine DNA methylation on Tetrahymena MAC genome.
