TITLE
Supress under 40 MPa 25 C

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Hydrostatic pressure is one of the physical factors affecting cellular physiology. Hydrostatic pressure of a few hundred MPa decreases the viability of yeast cells, and pressure of a few tens MPa decreases the growth rate. To understand the effect of hydrostatic pressure, we employed yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DNA microarrays and analyzed genome-wide mRNA expression profiles under hydrostatic pressures. In this experiment, we selected a hydrostatic pressure of 40 MPa at 25 degrees C because the condition is not lethal for yeast cells but the growth was suppressed. Keywords: stress response
