RNA-Seq analysis of cSCC cells followed by siRNA-induced gene knockdown of AIM2.

SUMMARY
Keratinocyte-derived cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the most common metastatic skin cancer, and its incidence is increasing globally. Chronic inflammation has been recognized as a risk factor for cSCC and inflammation is a typical feature of the progression of actinic keratosis lesions to invasive and metastatic cSCC. Inflammasomes are important components of the innate immune response involved in onset of inflammation. Inflammasome component AIM2 serves as a sensor for cytoplasmic double-strand DNA, and this way plays a key role in response to bacterial and viral colonization. Activation of inflammasome by cytoplasmic DNA in epidermal keratinocytes can promote the initiation of inflammation in autoimmune and autoinflammatory skin diseases. Whole transcriptome analysis of cSCC cells (n=8) and normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs, n=4) and oligonucleotide array-based expression analysis of cSCC cells (n=8) and normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs, n=5) revealed overexpression of AIM2 in cSCC cells (GSE66412 and GSE66368, respectively). We wanted to futher study the RNA expression profile of AIM2 knockdown cSCC cells.

DESIGN
Total RNAs from negative control and AIM2 siRNA transfected cSCC cell lines (n=3) were extracted. The samples were sequenced using Illumina sequencing.
