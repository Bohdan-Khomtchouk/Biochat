TITLE
Expression data from rheumatoid arthritis synovial macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Macrophages from RA synovial fluids were compared to primary human monocyte-derived macrophages.

DESIGN
Freshly isolated RA synovial macrophages and control macrophages cultured with M-CSF for 3 days were obtained at Hospital for Special Surgery using a protocol approved by the HSS Institutional Review Board. De-identified discard specimens were obtained under a partial waiver of consent. Microarray analysis was performed at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc. using the Affymetrix platform according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
