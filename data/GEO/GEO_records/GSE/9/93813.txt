TITLE
Exploiting Prmt5-orchestrated intron detention signatures to treat splicing-addicted malignant glioma tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The presence of introns within otherwise completely spliced mRNA molecules has been associated with splicing errors. Recent evidence however suggests that intron-based transcript inactivation is widespread and regulates the cytoplasmic availability of productive transcript isoforms. The regulatory and functional details of this process have remained unclear. We here present the arginine methyltransferase Prmt5 as the top hit from an in vivo RNAi screen for therapeutic vulnerabilities of malignant gliomas. Inhibition of Prmt5 inactivates hundreds of pro-proliferative genes by increasing the inclusion of so-called “detained” introns (DIs) within mRNAs. DI-based inactivation of these genes causes cessation of cell proliferation and exhibits potent anti-tumor effects in vitro and in vivo. Gliomas become increasingly sensitive to Prmt5 inhibition upon tumor progression. Furthermore, DI-based gene expression regulation is not restricted to cancer, but contributes to cell differentiation by governing the expression levels of gene sets related to both cell cycle and cell identity.

DESIGN
2 experimental conditions (vehicle DMSO treatment, EPZ015666 treatment), in triplicate, for 72h, of human U-87 MG tumor cells.
