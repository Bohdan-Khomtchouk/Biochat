TITLE
Cytotoxic effects of radiocontrast dyes on human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Discography is an imaging procedure typically performed on patients who report extended periods of pain.Usually radiocontrast agents are used to diagnose the discogenic low back pain. This study was focused on investigating the effects of two clinically used, non-ionic radiocontrast dyes, isovue-370 and omnipaque-240, on the human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs). Human UC-MSCs were cultured and treated with various concentrations of Omnipaque and Isovue for 24 hr. The cell growth was inhibited by both the dyes. The results showed that both the dyes significantly affected the cell morphology and viability as well as caused apoptosis in UC-MSCs.  The global gene expression analysis showed that the most effected genes were those involved in the apoptosis, DNA damage and toxicity.

DESIGN
Human umbilical cord derived MSCs were cultured in vitro and treated with 1:4 (dye:medium) of either Omnipaqe or Isovue for 24 hrs. Gene expression of treated cells was compared to untreated cultured cells.
