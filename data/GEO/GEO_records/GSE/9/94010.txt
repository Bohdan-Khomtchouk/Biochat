TITLE
Neural circuit-specialized astrocytes: genomic, proteomic, morphological and functional evidence

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Khakh laboratory used Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 transgenic mouse line crossed with RiboTag mice to sequence actively translated mRNAs and compare striatal and hippocampal astrocyte transcriptomes from adults.

DESIGN
Whole striata and hippocampii were extracted from 4 adult (P63) male and female Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 x Ribotag mice. After homogenization, RNA was purified from (i) cleared lysate as the input and control, and (ii) astrocyte-specific ribosome-associated RNA precipitated via a hemagglutinin (HA) tag.
