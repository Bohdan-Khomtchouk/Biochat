TITLE
Circularized Chromosome Conformation Capture (4C) for the genome-wide characterization of mammalian promoters with distal enhancer functions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of 4C technology for the identification of interaction points between the promoters of the RNF44 and FAF2 genes and their putative distal enhancers.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 gene promoters for the interaction with putative distal promoters.
