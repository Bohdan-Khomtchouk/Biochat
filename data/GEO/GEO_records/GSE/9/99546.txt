TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Arthrobacter sp. CGMCC 3584 responding to dissolved oxygen for cAMP production

ORGANISM
Clostridium acetobutylicum

SUMMARY
Arthrobacter sp. CGMCC 3584 are able to produce high yields of extracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which plays a vital role in the field of treatment of disease and animal food, during aerobic fermentation. DNA array-based transcriptional analysis of Arthrobacter cells was conducted to elucidate the higher productivity of cAMP under high oxygen supply. Results showed that 14.1% and 19.3% of the whole genome genes were up-regulated and down-regulated notably, respectively. The largest group with altered transcriptional levels belonged to the group involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism. Other large functional groups of differentially expressed genes changed significantly included amino acid transport and metabolism, inorganic ion transport and metabolism and transcription.
