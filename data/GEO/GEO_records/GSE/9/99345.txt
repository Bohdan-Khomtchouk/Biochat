TITLE
Effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PCBs) on Arabidopsis thaliana.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The transcriptomic response of A. thaliana to 2,5-dichlorobiphenyl (2,5-DCB) and its OH-metabolite, 4'-OH-2,5-DCB, was then examined using whole-genome expression microarrays (Affymetrix).

DESIGN
A. thaliana plantlets were exposed for 21 days to 2,5-DCB (50 mg L-1) and 4'-OH-2,5-DCB (5 mg L-1). Control plantlets were grown in the presence of the solvent carrier only (acetone). Six boxes containing five plantlets each were used for each treatment.
