TITLE
Time-course analysis of astrocyte-specific RNA-seq in two severities of spinal cord injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis of astrocytes following spinal cord injury demonstrated an autologous injury-induced astroglial conversion towards neuronal lineage.

DESIGN
Astrocytes were purified by FACS in non-injured Aldh1l1-EGFP mice and at 2 time points following moderate and severe spinal cord lesion. Gene profiles were then compared.
