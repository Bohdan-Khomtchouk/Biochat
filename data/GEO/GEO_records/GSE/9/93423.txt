TITLE
Effect of UV radiation on psoriatic keratinocytes in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to investigate the apoptotic process in psoriatic keratinocytes. UV radiation was used as apoptosis stimuli. Restults provide insights into the role of UV radiation and apoptosis induction on cultured psoriatic keratinocytes compared to healthy controls.

DESIGN
We used microarray to analyze differences in gene expression between UV/Non-UV exposed psoriatic (involved and uninvolved) and control keratinocytes. Keratinocytes were established from skin from two patients and two healthy control individuals for the microarray analysis.
