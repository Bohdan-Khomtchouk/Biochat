TITLE
Esophageal adenocarcinoma gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis was conducted to determine changes in gene expression and predict signaling networks in esophageal adenocarcinomas. For this analysis we used 12 EAC samples and 9 normal esophageal tissue samples. The analysis indicated deregulation of a large number of genes. Pathway analysis demonstrated the presence of KRAS signature and predicted activation of multiple transcription networks.

DESIGN
Expression profile were obtained on 21 Samples (9 normals, and 12 tumors, 9 were tumor-normal pairs) using Affymetrix Human Gene Set St 1.0 arrays.
