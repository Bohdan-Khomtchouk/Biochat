TITLE
Characterization of spleen Z cells from na√Øve NOD-SCID mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Eight NOD-SCID mice of 6-8 weeks old were sacrificed, and spleen cells harvested. Z cells were isolated using a red fluorescent TMR-Zfra peptide in cell sorting (Oncotarget. 2015 Feb 28;6(6):3737-51). Two cell populations were isolated, which are Z(-) and Z(+) cells, or designated as ZM for negative cells and ZP for positive cells. Mouse OneArray chips (Phalanx Biotech, Inc) were used for gene expression profiling. The goal of this research is to determine the specific gene expression profile in newly isolated spleen Z cells.

DESIGN
8 spleen cells were sorted and isolated as Z(-) and Z(+).
