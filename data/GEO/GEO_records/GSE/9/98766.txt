TITLE
Detailed transcriptome analysis of the plant growth promoting Paenibacillus riograndensis SBR5 using RNAseq technology

ORGANISM
Paenibacillus riograndensis

SUMMARY
Background- The plant growth promoting rhizobacterium Paenibacillus riograndensis SBR5 is a promising candidate to serve as crop inoculant. Despite its potential regarding environmental and economic benefits, the species P. riograndensis is poorly characterized. Here, we performed for the first time a detailed transcriptome analysis of P. riograndensis SBR5 using RNAseq technology. Results- Sequence analysis of the library enriched in 5’-ends of the primary transcripts was used to identify 1,082 TSS belonging to novel transcripts and allowed us to determine a promoter consensus sequence and regulatory sequences in 5’ untranslated regions including riboswitches Conclusions- Our RNAseq analysis provides insight into the P. riograndensis SBR5 transcriptome at the systems level and will be a valuable basis for differential RNAseq analysis of this bacterium.

DESIGN
P. riograndensis SBR5 was cultivated under 16 different growth conditions and RNA was isolated from samples collected during growth experiment and combined together in order to analyze an RNA pool representing a large set of expressed genes. The resultant total RNA was used to generate two different libraries, one enriched in 5’-ends of the primary transcripts and the other representing the whole transcriptome. Both libraries were sequenced and analyzed to identify the conserved sequences of ribosome biding sites and translation start motifs, and to elucidate operon structures present in the transcriptome of P. riograndensis.
