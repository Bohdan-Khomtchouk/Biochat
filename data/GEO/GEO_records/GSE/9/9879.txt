TITLE
D.m.Third_instar_larval_midgut_normal

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Oligoarray analysis was used to determine the number and nature of genes expressed in third-instar Drosophila melanogaster larval midguts.  The majority of transcripts were associated with protein synthesis and metabolism.  Serine proteases were the main proteolytic enzymes detected. Keywords: stress response
