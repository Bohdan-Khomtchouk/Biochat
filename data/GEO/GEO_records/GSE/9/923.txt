TITLE
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This series contains 5 groups of U133A arrays with targets from Calu-3 cell line post-infection with P aeruginosa strains. Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells were seeded onto 6-well plates and grown to about 80% confluency. Epithelial monolayers were infected with 108 CFUs per ml of each bacterial strain for 60 min and then washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. The cultures were subsequently incubated in fresh RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 Âµg/ml gentamicin. After 6 h, total RNA from the cells was prepared with RNAzol and further purified with RNEasy for microarray hybridization. All arrays processed and globally scaled to 500 using MAS 5.
