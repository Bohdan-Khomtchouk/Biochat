TITLE
Transcriptome of S. acidocaldarius MW001 strain grown as biofilm or planktonic cells and transcriptomic profile of an RNaseR-treated S. acidocaldarius MW001 small RNA sample

ORGANISM
Sulfolobus acidocaldarius

SUMMARY
Total RNAs were isolated from the thermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius MW001 and subjected to Illumina sequencing. A differential gene expression analysis was performed to identify ncRNA in biofilm- associated cells and planktonically grown cells. Additionally, the small RNA subpopulation of the transcriptome was subjected to RNaseR digestion prior to Illumina sequencing. An abundant double-stranded RNA was identified.

DESIGN
S. acidocaldarius total RNA isolates from biofilm and planktonic cells were subjected to Illumina Hiseq2000 sequencing. In addition, a transcriptome enriched for small RNA sequences was subjected to RNase R digestion and the products were sequenced using Illumina Hiseq2000.
