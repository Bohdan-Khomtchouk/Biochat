TITLE
Interaction dynamics determine signaling and output pathway responses

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Study of the response to the osmotic shock and its effect on gene expression regulation in different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (WT and Sln1/Ypd1 mutants). The cells received a sodium chloride stimulation (NaCl 0.4M), and were sampled at the time of stimulation (0 min) and in 10 and 20 minutes after the stimulation.

DESIGN
24 Samples
