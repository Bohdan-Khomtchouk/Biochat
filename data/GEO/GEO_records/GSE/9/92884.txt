TITLE
High-dimensional assessment of B cell responses to quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate and plain polysaccharide vaccine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Twenty adults were randomly assigned to receive either a meningococcal plain-polysaccharide or conjugate vaccine; one month later all received the conjugate vaccine. Blood samples were taken pre-vaccination, and 7, 21, and 28 days after vaccination; B-cell responses were assessed by ELISpot, serum bactericidal assay, flow cytometry and gene expression microarray.
