TITLE
The effect of  GPAM silencing in MCF7 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GPAM is well characterized in triglyceride synthesis, but has never been implicated in cancer. Our study report a role for GPAM in cell migration. Gene expression changes after GPAM silencing was investigated to gain insight into possible mechanisms underlying GPAM's role in cell migration.

DESIGN
GPAM was silenced in MCF7 cells using two independent siRNA oligos targeting two different exons. Non-transfected cells and cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA were used as controls. Four biological replicates were performed.
