TITLE
Gene expression data from the irradiated mouse hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although IR-induced depression may cause decreased life quality of brain cancer patients after radiotherapy, investigations of its molecular mechanism and therapeutic strategies are still insufficient. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying development of radiation-induced depression and identified a variety of genes whose expression were changed during this process.

DESIGN
To elucidate targets that might be regulated by cranial irradiation in the hippocampus, we isolated total RNA from mice hippocampuses treated or not-treated with 2 Gy of cranial radiation. RNA samples were then subjected to microarray analysis.
