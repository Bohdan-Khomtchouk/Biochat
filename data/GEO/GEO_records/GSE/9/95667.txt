TITLE
Integrated analysis of long non-coding RNAs expression profiles in tumor and adjacent gastric  tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we used microarray and bioinformatics analysis to find potential lncRNAs which may be useful in gastric cancer and then investigate their potential functions.

DESIGN
Total RNA from gastric carcinoma tissues  and normal gastric adjacent tissues were extracted and analyzed , we employed Arraystar Human LncRNA Microarray v2.0  as a discovery platform to identify genes.
