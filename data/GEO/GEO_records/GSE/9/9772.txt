TITLE
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation microarray data from antiHA IP in stable LNCaP cells expressing either YFP or HOXC6-HA/YFP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor HOXC6 is upregulated in human prostate cancer. SiRNA knockdown of HOXC6 induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells while upregulation rescued LNCaP cells from siRNA-induced apoptosis. We used chromatin immunoprecipitaiton followed by microarray to identify the gene promoters that are bound by HOXC6 in LNCaP cells. Keywords: Stable expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation
