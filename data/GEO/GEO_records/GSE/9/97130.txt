TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of Su(var)3-9 distribution in chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster [RNA-Seq_SuVar]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
One of the histone modifications involved in gene silencing is H3K9 methylation, which is found in the chromosomes across different eukaryotes and controlled by SU(VAR)3-9 and its orthologs. Although SU(VAR)3-9 was discovered over two decades ago, little is known about the details of its chromosomal distribution pattern and effect on gene regulation during germ cells development. To fill in this gap, we used RNA-Seq approach to investigate the effect of Su(var)3-9 mutation on gene expression during Drosophila spermatogenesis.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq gene expression profiling in Su(var)3-9-mutant and wild-type testes of Drosophila melanogaster. Biological replicates were performed for each sample.
