TITLE
A Molecular Census of Arcuate Hypothalamus and Median Eminence Cell Types

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Drop-seq and single cell sequencing of mouse arcuate nucleus and median eminence

DESIGN
Single-cell RNA-seq was performed on Cre-dependent AAV-GFP+ cells that were manually isolated from dissociated Arc-ME of two adult male RIP-Cre mice
