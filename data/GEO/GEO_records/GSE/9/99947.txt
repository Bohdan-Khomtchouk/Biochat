TITLE
Expression data from wild type (No-0) and fbs1-1 insertion line whole Arabidopsis seedlings in cold

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The ubiquitin 26S proteasome system (UPS) selectively degrades cellular proteins, which results in physiological changes to eukaryotic cells.  F-box proteins are substrate adaptors acting within the UPS and are responsible for the diversity of potential protein targets.  Plant genomes are enriched in F-box genes, but the vast majority of these have unknown roles.  This work investigated the Arabidopsis F-box gene F-BOX STRESS INDUCED 1 (FBS1) by identifying differentially expressed genes between wild type (No-0) and an fbs1 insertion line. We used microarrays to identify candidate genes that are dependent upon the F-BOX STRESS INDUCED1 (FBS1) gene for normal expression

DESIGN
Three independent sets of Arabidopsis wild type (No-0) and fbs1 knockout seedlings were grown in normal conditions for five days and then transferred to cold for seven additional days.  RNA was extracted from seedlings, processed according to standard Affymetrix protocols, and hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays.
