Expression data of noncoding RNAs in response to genotoxic agents (UV and MMS) in HeLa cells

SUMMARY
DNA damage response and repair are key biological pathways to prevent genome instability caused by inefficient repair induced permanent mutations. Such changes may cause alterations to the normal cell cycle, the induction of apoptosis and the initiation and promotion of cancer development. Recently, the roles of ncRNAs functioning in the DNA damage response and DNA repair have gain more attention. To find out key ncRNAs involved in DNA damage response or repair pathways, we detected the transcription levels of ncRNAs in HeLa cells following ultraviolet (UV) light or methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) treatments by microarrays. This identified a variety of ncRNAs respond to UV or MMS-induced DNA damage. Therefore, further investigation on the ncRNAs in response to these genotoxic agents would help to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanism of ncRNAs functioning in the DNA damage response and repair pathways and new strategies of treatment of cancer by co-ordinately targeting ncRNA repair factors.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were exposed to 5J/m^2, 10J/m^2 of UVC light and 0.005% MMS. Untreated cells were used as a control. Total RNA was extracted after cells recovery for 12 hours and then subjected to microarray analysis.
