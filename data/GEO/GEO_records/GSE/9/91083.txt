TITLE
Structure and variation in microbiome from continuous and rotational PinelliaÂ ternata cropping soils

ORGANISM
uncultivated soil bacterium

SUMMARY
We used wheat as rotational crop to assess the influence of continuous cropping on microbiome in Pinellia ternata rhizosphere and the remediation of rotational cropping to the impacted microbiota. Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology was utilized for this method to explore the rhizosphere microbial structure and diversity based on continuous and rotational cropping.

DESIGN
Greenhouse experiment was designed to reveal the difference in microbiome of rotational and continuous cropping soil; details provided in the readme.txt and supporting figure for experimental_design.pdf files.
