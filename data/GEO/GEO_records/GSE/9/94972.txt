SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
Refer to individual Series Please note that the 170215_GEO_delasHeras_superseries_Jurkat.xls (linked below) contains two spreadsheets: a table, and an explanation of each header of the table. This table combines transcriptome data with DamID data in a gene-centric manner and forms the basis of this study's conclusion.
