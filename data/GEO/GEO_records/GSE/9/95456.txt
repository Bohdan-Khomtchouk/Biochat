TITLE
Assessing the impact of loss of MORC2 and SETDB1 on the global distribution of H3K9me3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By comparing HeLa cells lacking MORC2 or SETDB1 generated through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption to wild-type HeLa cells, the goal of the experiment was to determine the effect of loss of MORC2 on the distribution of the repressive H3K9me3 histone modification.

DESIGN
H3K9me3 ChIP-seq analysis of wild-type HeLa cells compared to MORC2 knockout and SETDB1 knockout HeLa cells.
