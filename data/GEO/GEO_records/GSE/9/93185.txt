TITLE
Expression data from transfection of an antisense oligonucleotide in 518A2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to globally profile the gene expression changes observed after 3 days when transfecting an antisense oligonucleotide in 518A2 cells

DESIGN
An antisense oligonucleotides, denoted SPC2996 (n=3) was transfected into 518A2 cells and gene expression changes relative to mock-treated controls (n=3) were measured by microarray.
