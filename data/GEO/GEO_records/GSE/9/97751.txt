TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of drug resistant cell lines (SKOV3).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this research was to uncover transcriptome changes in SKOV3 cells during the acquisition of resistance to anticancer drugs Sorafenib, Sunitinib, Pazopanib, Everolimus, Temsirolimus.

DESIGN
SKOV3 cells resistant to five target anticancer drugs were generated by growing naive cells serially treated with an increasing doses of Sunitinib up to 6 µM, Pazopanib up to 25 µM, Sorafenib up to 10 µM, Everolimus up to 20 µM and Temsirolimus up to 15 µM. Transcriptome analisys was made at the following time points: 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. Simultaneously untreated control sells were grown for the same period, transcriptome analisys was performed at 8, 10,12, 14 and 16 weeks.
