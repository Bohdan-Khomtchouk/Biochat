TITLE
Experimental assay of a fitness landscape on a macroevolutionary scale

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Characterization of the fitness landscape, a representation of fitness for a large set of genotypes, is key to understanding how genetic information is interpreted to create functional organisms. Here, we reconstruct the evolutionarily-relevant segment of the fitness landscape of His3, a gene coding for an enzyme in the histidine synthesis pathway, focusing on combinations of amino acid states found at orthologous sites of extant species. We find that the His3 fitness landscape is dominated by synergistic epistasis, such that the cumulative effect of amino acid substitutions causes a dramatic decline in fitness. Furthermore, in 63% of sites substitutions were strongly positive in one genetic background and strongly negative in another, with 41% of sites showing reciprocal sign epistasis. This sign epistasis, present in proportionally few genotypes, was caused by simultaneous interaction of multiple sites with demonstrating a complex multidimensional nature of the His3 fitness landscape.

DESIGN
PCR amplification of mutated loci inside S. cerevisiae His3 gene.
