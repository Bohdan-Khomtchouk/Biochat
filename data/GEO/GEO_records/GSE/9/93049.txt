TITLE
Expression data from root of sir1-1 and serat tko Arabidopsis mutants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Cysteine is one essential amino acid for plants and its limitation is known to have a significant impact on plant growth and yield. In this study we performed global transcriptome analyses to investigate the responses to cysteine precursor limitation.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown hydroponically under short-day conditions (8h light / 16h dark cycles) under full nutrient supply of Hoagland medium. Arabidopsis root material was harvested when the plants reached the age of 7 weeks (from sowing) and used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Three biological replicates from each condition were analyzed.
