TITLE
MicroRNA Profiling of Endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, the miRNA expression of human vascular endothelial cells from tissue-derived cells and cultured cells were profiled using miRNA sequencing. The data analysis revealed a striking switch in endothelial miRNA profile as the cells adapted from tissue to cell culture environment and the overall miRNA expression decreased significantly in cultured endothelial cells compared to tissue-derived endothelial cells. In addition to changes in mechanosensitive miRNA expression, alterations in senescence-associated and endothelial-to-mesenchymal-transition-associated miRNAs were observed in aging cells. Collectively, the data illustrates the plasticity of endothelial cells, and elucidates the multifaceted nature of the cell-specific miRNA profiles, clearly emphasising that the cellular miRNA profile consists of fluid collection of miRNAs, which mirror the prevailing cellular status.

DESIGN
The samples were collected at endothelial cell extraction from umbilical cords (S0) and from three subsequent cell passages (S1-S3). S0 samples represent the tissue-derived endothelial cells, and S1 to S3 samples are adjusted to static cell culture conditions. S2 samples are from aging cells and S3 from old cells. S0 samples originate from three different donors, S1-S3 from four.
