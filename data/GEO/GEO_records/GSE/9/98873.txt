TITLE
RNASeq analysis of Vitis vinifera (cv. Sauvignon blanc) grape berries exposed to elevated light

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
By implementing a leaf-removal treatment in the berry bunch zone, grapes were predominantly exposed to elevated light and their complete transcriptomes (as generated by RNASeq) were compared at four developmental stages.

DESIGN
Comparison of the transcriptomes of control and exposed Sauvignon blanc grape berries sampled at four developemental stages (EL31, EL33, EL34, EL38)
