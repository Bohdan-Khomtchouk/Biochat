TITLE
Expression data from CD4-CD8-(DN) thymic cells isolated from WT and Ezh2Δ/Δp53Δ/Δ mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss-of-function mutations in EZH2 are associated with poor outcomes in patients with early T cell precursor ALL (ETP-ALL).  To understand how EZH2 insufficiency is involved in the pathogenesis of ETP-ALL, we generated mice compound for both Ezh2 and Trp53 conditional deletions.

DESIGN
The total bone marrow cells isolated from Cre-ERT2 and Ezh2flox/flox;p53flox/flox;Cre-ERT2 mice were transplanted into lethally irradiated CD45.1+ wild-type recipient mice. As we deleted Ezh2 and p53 at four weeks post transplantation, we performed gene-expression analysis of CD4-CD8-CD44+CD25-(DN1), CD4-CD8-CD44+CD25+(DN2), and CD4-CD8-CD44-CD25+(DN3) cells isolated from the thymus of recipient mice at 3 months post transplantation and CD4-CD8-CD44+CD25+(DN2) leukemic cells isolated from two Ezh2Δ/Δp53Δ/Δ ETP-ALL mice (mouse id; 13 and 19).
