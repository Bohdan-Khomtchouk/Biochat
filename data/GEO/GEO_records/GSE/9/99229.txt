TITLE
Alterations in gene expression in response to different regimes of Shiga toxin 2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The microarray data provided here belong to a study that describes two different Shiga toxin (Stx) induced models of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in mice. Although several rodent models of HUS were published, it still remains difficult to reproduce all clinical features of human HUS. Here, two different Stx2 regimes combined with volume resuscitation were tested in C57BL/6J wild type mice. Animals were euthanized because of kidney injury after 3 or 7 days respectively. Kidneys were removed for histological evaluation and RNA extraction. Kidney injury was confirmed histologically and by laboratory parameters in plasma. Data for the respective vehicle treated groups are also provided here.

DESIGN
Overall, gene expression data from 16 C57BL/6J kidneys were collected. The mice were randomly subjected to 4 different groups: sham day 3, Stx2 day 3, sham day 7, Stx2 day 7.
