TITLE
Babesia Infected/Control LongSAGE libraries for Boophilus microplus ovary tissue

ORGANISM
Rhipicephalus microplus

SUMMARY
Babesia infected (and control) ovary tissue was used to construct LongSAGE libraries.   The intent was to find differential gene expression in both libraries. Details: The extraction was done using Ambion's ToTALLY RNA kit, and the concatemers where constructed using Invitrogen's I-SAGE Long kit.   The concatmer files (multiple fasta sequence files) were processed using in-house perl scripts to extract the 17bp LongSAGE tags. **Note: contact person:   Felix D.
