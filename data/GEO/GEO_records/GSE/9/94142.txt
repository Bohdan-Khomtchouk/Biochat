TITLE
Genome wide maps of H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac in Brachyury mutants and RNA-seq data of Brachyury mutants

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor BRACHYURY is the founding member of the T-box family of proteins. A conserved residue (Y88 in BRACHYURY) was previously suggested to be important for interaction with KDM proteins that demethylate H3K27me3. We generated Brachyury mutant mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines. For a wild type control (Thet) we derived an embryonic stem cell line from blastocysts, containing a single wild type copy of the Brachyury locus (T +/2J; 2J is a large genomic deletion of the entire Brachyury locus). We mutated the remaining wild type copy of Brachyury to code for Alanin instead of the conserved tyrosine (Y88) residue (T_Y88A). We derived embryos from these ESCs, compare expression profiles (RNAseq) from Thet and TY88A caudal end mesoderm of early embryos (stages: TS12 and TS13), and complement the expression data with histone methylation ChIPseq data for H3K4me3, HeK27me3 and H3K27ac. Of note: due to the different requirements of cellular material for RNAseq and ChIPseq we differentiated the same ESC used for the embryo generation (in vivo, RNA-seq) to generate early caudal end mesoderm in vitro (ChIPseq). In addition, this dataset contains a ChIPseq track for BRACHURY in wild type ESCs, differentiated into early mesoderm in vitro with the same protocol as for the histone ChiIPseq.

DESIGN
Comparison of RNAseq expression profile early mesoderm, extracted from of T_het (wild type) and T_Y88A (mutant) mouse embryos. These RNAseq data are complemented with H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac ChIPseq data from in vitro generated early mesoderm of the same genotype.
