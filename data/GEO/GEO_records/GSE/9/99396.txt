TITLE
Inhibition of RNA polymerase II allows controlled mobilisation of retrotransposons for plant breeding [Arabidopsis]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The main objective of this analysis was to investigate the methylome changes in Arabidopsis plants treated with drugs affecting DNA methylation.

DESIGN
Four samples have been analyzed. Plants were treated as follows: no drugs, amanitin, zebularine, amanitin and zebularine. After DNA purification,Bisulfite treatment was applied to determine the cytosine methylation status. Illumina reads of the four libraries were generated using an Illumina Hiseq instrument.
