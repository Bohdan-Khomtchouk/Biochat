SUMMARY
Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling occurs during tissue repair and inflammation-related pathologies with deposition of specific proteins.  White adipose tissue (WAT) was recently shown to be the site of substantial interstitial fibrosis. ECM components, such as fibronectin, and their receptors integrins control cell migration, proliferation and differentiation. Adipocyte differentiation which is under the control of a specific transcriptional network is associated with decrease of fibronectin-rich matrix. Considering macrophage accumulation in white adipose tissues from obese subjects, we recently demonstrated that macrophage-secreted factors provoke an inhibition of differentiation with a proinflammatory state of human preadipocytes. The functional analysis of gene expression measurements obtained from cDNA microarray experiments reveals that themes related to the “extracellular matrix” are among the most significantly enriched in overexpressed genes in inflammatory preadipocytes. ECM remodelling, characterized by high deposition of fibronectin, collagen I and tenascin-C and important clustering of ECM receptors integrin alpha-5, is associated with increased proliferation and migration of preadipocytes. siRNA deletion of NF-kappaB in inflammatory preadipocytes decreased fibronectin network formation and their proliferation. Cyclin D1 and FAK constitute pivotal molecular targets in the synergistic promotion of migration and proliferation of the inflammatory preadipocytes. Importantly, interactions between preadipocytes and macrophages are favoured in 3D collagen I, a microenvironment mimicking fibrosis context of obese WATs. These data suggest that inflammatory preadipocytes could contribute to the production of fibrosis components and, in the context of WAT repair, these altered properties of preadipocytes could further lead to reconstitution of new fat clusters.
