TITLE
KLF family members KLF4 and KLF7 regulate corneal epithelium [siKLF4_undifferentiated]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
While the regulatory landscape during stem cell differentiation has been well characterized, the shared and unique regulatory mechanisms in different ectodermally-derived epithelial cells have not been well described. Through defining the complement of super enhancers and typical enhancers in corneal epithelium for the first time, we show that regulatory regions are often shared between cell types of the same lineage, and that corneal super enhancers are already marked as potential regulatory domains in embryonic stem cells. Through the enrichment of KLF motifs in enhancers, we identified and defined a novel role for Kruppel family member KLF7 in promoting the corneal progenitor cell state, in many cases working antagonistically to corneal differentiation promoting KLF4. Our work highlights the importance of balance between proliferation and differentiation, both for proper tissue development and for homeostasis.

DESIGN
pooled siRNA was used to knockdown KLF4 in duplicate with 2 scramble siRNA controls. RNA was extracted and submitted for microarray.
