TITLE
Rat liver: Dexamethasone treatment vs. Control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sixteen male Sprague-Dawley rats  were randomly allocated into 2 groups (8 rats per group) as follows: the control group (CON) and the dexamethasone-treated group (DEXA). Dexamethasone-treated rats received a daily intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 mg/kg of dexamethasone for 5 days. All rats were fasted during the night following the fifth day. On the sixth day, the animals were killed by decapitation. In order to focus our investigation on metabolism-related genes, we developed a metabolism dedicated microarray tool: the Mitoligo. Using this microarray tool, we were able to determine that energy metabolism was deeply modified by dexamethasone treatment. Dexamethasone treatment to rats induces a complete switch of the metabolism toward a maximal rate of ATP synthesis. In this study, we show that substrate supplying for oxidative phosphorylation is greatly enhanced. We also confirm that oxidative phosphorylation capacity is increased by dexamethasone treatment.
