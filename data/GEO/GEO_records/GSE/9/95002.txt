TITLE
Transcriptional and accessible chromatin profiles during conversion process of alternatively activated macrophages (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Whether inflammatory macrophages can adopt features of the tissue resident niche and what mechanisms mediate phenotypic conversion remain unclear. In this study, we show by cell surface phenotyping, as well as by RNA-Seq transcriptional profiling and ATAC-Seq open chromatin regions profiling, that inflammatory monocyte can adopt a tissue resident phenotype, which is also accompanied by re-programming of the transcriptional profiles and remodeling of the open chromatin landscape. The conversion process is dependent on Vitamin A, suggesting that Vitamin A deficiency may lead to the failure to resolve inflammation, as inflammatory macrophages accumulate without adopting a tissue residency phenotype.

DESIGN
Monocyte-derived (N=3), tissue converted (N=3) and tissue resident (N=3) mouse peritoneal macrophages were FACS-sorted for RNASeq and ATACSeq.
