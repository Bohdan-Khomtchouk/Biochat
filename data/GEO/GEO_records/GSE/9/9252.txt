TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Human Endometrial Endothelial Cells Exposed to o,p'-DDT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The endocrine disrupting chemical o,p'-DDT can affect reproductive organs, tissues and cells in several species. Treatment of human endometrial endothelial cells (HEEC) with 50 ÂµM o,p'-DDT decreased the cell proliferation compared to the control. Microarray analyses revealed that o,p'-DDT affected biological processes such as the cell cycle, cell division, defence response and lipid and steroid metabolism, in cellular components such as the plasma membrane and chromosomes, with molecular functions involved in signalling, receptor and cytokine activity, confirming the results of the proliferation assay. The present study supports our previous findings of decreased proliferation and increased cell death in response to o,p'-DDT, and may offer important clues in the deduction of the mechanisms of action of o,p'-DDT. Keywords: Exposure analysis
