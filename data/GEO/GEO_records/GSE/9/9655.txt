TITLE
Whole-genome tiling array analysis in normal human bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells (NHBE)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identify transcriptionally-active regions (TARs) greater than 400 nt long across the entire human genome. A total of 578 were identified in NHBE cells. We then focused on those TARs originating from non-coding sequence and that displayed a moderate to high degree of sequence conservation. A subset of 15 non-coding transcripts were then further examined to determine if they are altered in cancer (deregulated expression in breast and ovarian cancer and sequenced for mutations in a panel of cancer samples). Only transcriptionally-active regions originating from non-coding sequence, expressing at the 99.5th percentile, and longer than 400 nt were examined so far in our studies. Keywords: whole-genome mapping, transcriptionally-active regions, tiling arrays, non-coding transcripts, bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells
