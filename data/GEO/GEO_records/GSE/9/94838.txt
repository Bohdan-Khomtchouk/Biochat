TITLE
Liver Clock Rescue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Circadian clocks drive 24-h rhythms of physiology and behavior. The circadian clock of hepatocytes has been shown to regulate glucose metabolism, and we were interested if rescuing liver clock function can reverse metabolic impairments in hyperphagic/obese Clock-D19 mutant mice. We compared transcripomte regulation in livers (at Zeitgeber time ZT10) of wild-type (C57BL/6J) and Clock-D19 mice and Clock-D19 mice with genetic rescue of liver clock function using hydrodynamic tail vein injection of a WT-CLOCK expression plasmid

DESIGN
Animals (n = 3 per group) were kept under 12h:12h light-dark cycle with ad libitum access to a 45% high-fat diet for 5 weeks and then sacrificed at ZT10 by cervical dislocation and livers isolated.
