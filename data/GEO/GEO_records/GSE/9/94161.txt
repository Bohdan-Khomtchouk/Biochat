TITLE
Shoot-to-root mobile polypeptides involved in systemic regulation of nitrogen acquisition

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plants uptake nitrogen (N) from the soil mainly in the form of nitrate. However, nitrate is often distributed heterogeneously in natural soil. Plants, therefore, have a systemic long-distance signaling mechanism by which N-starvation on one side of the root leads to a compensatory N uptake on the other N-rich side. This systemic N acquisition response is triggered by a root-to-shoot mobile peptide hormone, C-terminally Encoded Peptide (CEP), originating from the N-starved roots, but the molecular nature of the descending shoot-to-root signal remains elusive. Here, we show that phloem-specific polypeptides that are induced in leaves upon perception of root-derived CEP act as descending long-distance mobile signals translocated to each root. These shoot-derived polypeptides, which we named CEP Downstream 1 (CEPD1) and CEPD2, upregulate the expression of the nitrate transporter gene NRT2.1 in roots specifically when nitrate is present in the rhizosphere. Arabidopsis plants deficient in this pathway show impaired systemic N-acquisition response accompanied with N-deficiency symptoms. These fundamental mechanistic insights should provide a conceptual framework for understanding systemic nutrient acquisition responses in plants. We prepared total RNA from vascular tissues of wild type, CEP1-treated wild type, and cepr1-1 mutant, and used a microarray analysis to identify genes specifically induced by CEP1.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from the vascular tissues derived from 200 cotyledons of wild type, wild type grown in the presence of 1 uM CEP1 and cepr1-1 mutant were subjected to microarray analysis. Labeled complementary RNA was hybridized with an Affymetrix Genechip Arabidopsis Gene 1.0 ST array.
