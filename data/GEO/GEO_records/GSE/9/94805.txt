TITLE
Gene expression profiling: Quiescence vs. Senescence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using cDNA arrays, we compared the reversible (quiescence) and irreversible (senescence) growth arrest conditions in osteosarcoma cell line, U2OS, which resulted in certain overlapping and unique gene expression signatures.
