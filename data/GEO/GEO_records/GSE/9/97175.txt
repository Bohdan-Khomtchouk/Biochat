TITLE
Expression data from A549 cells after treatment with bradykinin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of A549 cells treated with bradyikinin. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from A549 cells after treatment with bradykinin. We confirmed that A540 cells expressed bradykinin B2 receptor. Results provide insight into the effect of bradykin on MAP kinase pathway.

DESIGN
A549 dells were treated with 100 nM bradykinin for 30min.
