TITLE
Role of the Dickeya dadantii PecS regulator during the early stages of plant infection

ORGANISM
Dickeya dadantii 3937

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes during plant infection in the PecS regulatory mutant compared to the wild type strain.  PecS is a global regulator of virulence in D. dadantii and the PecS mutant is hypervirulent.

DESIGN
Microarray study using total RNA extracted from bacteria purified out of Arabidopsis leaf material. Each chip measures the expression level of 4,753  genes from D. dadantii 3937.
