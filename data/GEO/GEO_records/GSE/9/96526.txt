Expression data that were specifically regulated by lncRNA-LFAR1 in mouse primary HSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in various biological processes; however, few have been identified that regulate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation and the progression of liver fibrosis. Through a detailed analysis of the expression of lncRNAs in various tissues, we discovered the existence of a liver enriched lncRNA-LFAR1 (lncRNA-Liver Fibrosis Associated RNA1). To identify the roles of  lncRNA-LFAR1 in liver fiboris, we systematically analyzed the regulation of mRNAs in primary HSCs infected with two separated lnc-LFAR1-shRNAs by RNA-seq, which revealed a panel of mRNAs that were specifically regulated by lncRNA-LFAR1 in mouse primary HSCs.

DESIGN
To identify the roles of  lncRNA-LFAR1 in liver fibrosis, we systematically analyzed the regulation of mRNAs in primary HSCs infected with shRNA-control (n=2), lncRNA-shRNA1 (n=2) and lncRNA-shRNA3 (n=2) by RNA-seq.
