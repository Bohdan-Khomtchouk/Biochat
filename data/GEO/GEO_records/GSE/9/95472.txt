TITLE
Gene expression data from BT549 attached/suspended cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cells grown in forced suspension culture mimic the early steps of metastasis.  In order to determine what might be driving the ability of TNBC cells to survive in suspension, a global gene expression profiling experiment was performed. Human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line BT549 was grown in attached or forced suspension conditions for 24 hours, then RNA was harvested to look for changes in global gene expression.

DESIGN
Eight samples. Two groups in biological quadruplicate.  Group one is BT549 cells grown in normal attached conditions.  Group 2 is BT549 cells grown in forced suspension conditions.
