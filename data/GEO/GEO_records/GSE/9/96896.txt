TITLE
Comparison of transcriptionnal changes in Petunia hybrida WT and ram1-2 induced by mycorrhiza

ORGANISM
Petunia x hybrida

SUMMARY
Aim: compare the transcriptionnal responses induced by mycorrhiza in wild type and GRAS transcription factor RAM1 mutant ram1-2 in roots. Results: 650 genes were upregulated in mycorrhized WT (fold change > 5; FDR < 0,05, experiment difference > 10) and 201 in the ram1 mutant. 182 genes were induced in both WT and ram1. 468 and 19 genes were induced only in WT or ram1-2 respectively. 91 genes were downregulated in mycorrhized WT (fold change < 5; FDR < 0,05, experiment difference > 10) and 51 in ram1-2. There was no overlap in the downregulated genes. Conclusion: The transcriptionnal response to mycorrhiza is more important in WT than in ram1-2. Gene induction in ram1 mostly overlap with wild type. Our results confirm that ram1 plays a central role in the root response  to mycorrhization.

DESIGN
mRNA profile comparition of control (NM) and mycorrhized (M) roots in wild type (WT) and ram1-2 Petunia, generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina.
