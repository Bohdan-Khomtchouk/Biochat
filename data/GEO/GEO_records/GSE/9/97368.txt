TITLE
Gene expression profiling of low-dose irradiated human BM-MSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In bone marrow (BM), there are two different types of stem/progenitor cells. With respect to hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HPCs) produce mature blood cells and mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) support this. The influence of exposure to low-dose radiation on human HPCs has been investigated, and generation of both immature and mature hematopoietic cells from human HPCs is compromised. On the other hand, the influence of exposure to low-dose radiation on MSCs is not known. This gene expression profiling was created for investigation how low-dose irradiation affects BM-MSCs genomically.

DESIGN
BM samples from healthy adult volunteers were purchased from AllCells (Emeryville, CA). Human BM-MSCs were isolated according to our previously published methods (Yao H, Stem Cells 2014;32:2245). BM-MSCs were exposed to 0.1 Gy of Î³-radiation (Cesium137) at 0.8 Gy/min by a Gammacell Irradiator (Best Theratronics, Ontario, Canada). 24 hours after irradiation, total RNA were collected from the irradiated BM-MSCs.
