TITLE
Gene expression profile during cardiac stress induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and myocardial infarction (MI) with or without BET protein inhibitor JQ1 in mouse hearts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: to reveal cardiac stress-inducible genes that are attnuated by BET inhibition

DESIGN
Method: Adult C57Bl/6 mice (male, 10 wks) were subjected to sham surgery and received vehicle injection for 6 weeks starting post-op week 4. Method: Adult C57Bl/6 mice (male, 10 wks) were subjected to TAC surgery with a 27 gauge needle. Starting at the beginning of post-op week 4, JQ1 at 50 mg/kg/d was adminstrated via I.P. injections and continue for another 6 weeks. Method: Adult C57Bl/6 mice (male, 10 wks) were subjected to Permanent Ligation of the Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery. Beginning from post-op day 6, JQ1 at 25 mg/kg/d or vehcle was given via I.P. for 6 days and then increased to 50 mg/kg/d for additional 16 days.
