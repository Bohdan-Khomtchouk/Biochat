TITLE
Comparison of the DNA methylation profiles of CD14+ monocytes from human peripheral blood with derived macrophages (MACs) and osteoclasts (OCs) obtained by exposure with M-CSF and M-CSF/RANKL, respectively, for 5 and 20 days

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The methylation profiles of bisulfite(BS)- and oxidative-BS-modified DNA of human CD14+ monocytes were compared with derived macrophages (MACs) and osteoclasts (OCs) following M-CSF and M-CSF/RANKL incubation for 5 and 20 days, using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA,). This platform allows the interrogation of > 485,000 methylation sites per sample at single-nucleotide resolution, and comprises an average of 17 CpG sites per gene in the 99% of RefSeq genes. 96% of CpG islands are covered, with additional coverage in CpG island shores and the regions flanking them. The samples were hybridized in the array following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

DESIGN
Total DNA isolated by standard procedures from CD14+ cells (total monocytes, MOs) corresponding to three sets of samples of monocytes (MOs) and derived MACs and OCs following incubation with M-CSF or M-CSF/RANKL for 5 and 20 days.
