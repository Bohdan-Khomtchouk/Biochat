TITLE
3dpf untreated zebrafish larvae vs. 3dpf zebrafish larvae treated with 20mM PTZ for 30 minutes and 90 minutes

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of 3dpf wild type zebrafish larvae treated with 20mM PTZ for 30 and 90 minutes compared with 3dpf wild type control untreated zebrafish larvae.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment: 3dpf untreated zebrafish larvae vs 3dpf zebrafish larvae treated with 20mM PTZ for 30 minutes; 3dpf untreated zebrafish larvae vs 3dpf zebrafish larvae treated with 20mM PTZ for 90 minutes. Biological replicates: 2 (separate mating) Technical replicates: 4 (2 of which are dye-swap)
