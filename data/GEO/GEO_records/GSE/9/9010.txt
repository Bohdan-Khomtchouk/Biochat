HOXB4 target genes in adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSC/HPCs)

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HOXB4 mediates expansion of adult and embryo-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) when expressed ectopically. To define the underlying molecular mechanisms, we performed gene expression profiling in combination with subsequent functional analysis using enriched adult HSCs  expressing inducible HOXB4. A substantial number of the identified HOXB4 target genes are involved in signaling pathways important for controlling self-renewal, maintenance and differentiation of stem cells. Functional assays performed on selected pathways confirmed the biological coherence of the array results. HOXB4 activity protected adult HSCs from the detrimental effects mediated by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha.  Furthermore, we demonstrate that HOXB4 activity and FGF-signaling are intertwined. HOXB4-mediated expansion of adult  HSCs was enhanced by specific and complete inhibition of FGF-receptors. Based on our results we propose that HOXB4 governs pivotal cell-intrinsic pathways involved in the regulation of cell cycle, differentiation and apoptosis. Our results strongly suggest that HOXB4 modulates the response of HSCs to multiple extrinsic signals in a concerted manner, thereby shifting the balance towards stem cell self-renewal. Keywords: plus/minus induction of HOXB4 activity by treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (TMX)
