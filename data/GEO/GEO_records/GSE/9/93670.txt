Transcriptomic profiling of immortalized fibroblastic reticular cells originating from gut-draining mesenteric and skin-draining lymph nodes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical for the maintenance of peripheral tolerance to self-antigens, and to non-self commensal microbiota or food-born antigens. Accordingly, gut-draining mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) are superior in peripheral de novo induction of Foxp3+ Tregs. Moreover, it has been recently shown that this can be partly attributed to lymph node stromal cells, including fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) dominating the T cell zone. To investigate molecular details of peripheral tolerance, immortalized FRCs (iFRCs) of mLN and skin-draining peripheral LNs (pLN) have been generated. Differential de novo Treg induction was observed not only in the presence of mLN- and pLN-iFRCs, but also when mLN- and pLN-iFRC-derived supernatant was added to the in vitro cultures. Transcriptional profiling of iFRCs from mLN and pLN revealed differential expression of genes encoding secreted molecules that could be responsible for the tolerogenic phenotype of mLN iFRCs. Taken together, our findings represent a novel way of intercellular communication between FRCs and T cells.

DESIGN
Identification of differentially expressed genes in immortalized fibroblastic reticular cells from mesenteric or skin-draining lymph nodes of specific-pathogen-free housed mice.
