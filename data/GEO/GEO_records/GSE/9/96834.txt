TITLE
The histone H3 variant H3.3 regulates gene body DNA methylation [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Gene bodies of vertebrates and flowering plants are occupied by histone variant H3.3 and DNA methylation. The origin and significance of these profiles remain largely unknown. The profiles of enrichments in DNA methylation and H3.3 over gene bodies are correlated and both depend similarly on gene transcription levels. This suggests a mechanistic link between H3.3 and gene body methylation. We engineered H3.3 knockdown in Arabidopsis and observed transcription reduction that predominantly affected genes responsive to environmental cues. When H3.3 levels were reduced, gene bodies showed a loss of DNA methylation correlated with transcription levels. To study the origin of changes in DNA methylation profiles when H3.3 levels are reduced, we examined genome wide distributions of several histone H3 marks, H2A.Z, linker histone H1 and nucleosome densities. We observed that in absence of H3.3, H1 distribution increased in gene bodies. This depends on levels of gene transcription. We propose that H3.3 prevents recruitment of H1, which in turn promotes chromatin folding and antagonizes access to DNA methyltransferases responsible for gene body methylation. Thus, gene body methylation is likely shaped by H3.3 dynamics in relation with transcriptional activity.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different histone modifications and 3 histones in WT and H3.3 knock down samples in replicates.
