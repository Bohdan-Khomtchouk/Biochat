ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au15-02_trx - effect of ftr mutation on arabidopsis trancriptome - Recherche nouvelles fonctions pour le syst√®me TRX plastidial. -  - Comparison Mut1 vs sauv1 at the same developmental stage (8-10 leaves) as Mut1 at the time of sampling - Comparison Mut1 vs sauv1 at the same age (11 weeks) as Mut1 at the time of sampling - Comparison Mut2 vs sauv2 at the same developmental stage (8-10 leaves) as Mut1 at the time of sampling - Comparison Mut2 vs sauv2 at the same age (9 weeks) as Mut1 at the time of sampling Mut1 = ftrb Sauv1 = Col-0 Mut2 = ftra1.a2 Sauv2 = WT segregant from crossing between ftra1 (in WS genetic background) and ftra2 (in Col background)

DESIGN
8 dye-swap - gene knock out
