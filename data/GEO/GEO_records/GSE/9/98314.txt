TITLE
Melanoma cell lines treated with dabrafenib Â± trametinib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rapid resistance to BRAF inhibitors in BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma has produced an urgent need for new treatment options. BRAF inhibitor resistance commonly involves reactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and yet inhibition of downstream kinases has not circumvented resistance, partly because MAPK is regulated via a complex network of feedback mechanisms that influence pathway rebound. To examine the transcriptome responses of melanoma cells to MAPK inhibition, a panel of 11 BRAFV600-mutant melanoma cell lines were treated with control (DMSO), 100nM dabrafenib alone (i.e BRAF inhibitor monotherapy) or 100nM dabrafenib + 10nM trametinib (i.e combination BRAF + MEK inhibition) for 24h.

DESIGN
Eleven melanoma cell lines were grown in DMEM/10%FBS and treated with either 100nM dabrafenib and/or 10nM trametinib or DMSO for 24h.
