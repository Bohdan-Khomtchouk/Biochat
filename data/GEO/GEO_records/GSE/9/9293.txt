TITLE
Genomic profile of trinitrobencenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) rat colitis is one of the most widely used models of inflammatory bowel disease, a condition whose etiology and pathophysiology are incompletely understood. We have characterized the model at the genomic level following a longitudinal approach. Keywords: Time course and differentially expressed genes analysis
