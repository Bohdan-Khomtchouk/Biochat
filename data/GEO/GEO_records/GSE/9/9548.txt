TITLE
A. fumigatus wild type and delta phoB(PHO80) strains transcriptome analysis for growth upon minimal medium 0.1 mM Pi

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
Phosphate is an essential ion for fungal growth, required for proper DNA and phospholipids biosyntesis, energetic metabolism and signal transduction. The systems for inorganic phosphate (Pi) acquisition in eukaryotic cells (PHO) have been characterized as a low-affinity (that assures a supply of Pi at normal or high external Pi concentrations) and a high-affinity (activated in response to Pi starvation). Here, as an initial step to understand the PHO pathway in A. fumigatus, we characterized the PHO80 homologue, phoB(PHO80). We showed that the delta phoB(PHO80) mutant has a severe polar growth defect and there is an interaction between PhoB(PHO80), calcineurin and calcium metabolism. Microarray hybridizations carried out with RNA obtained from wild type and delta phoB(PHO80) mutant cells showed that Afu4g03610 [phoD(PHO84)], Afu7g06350 [phoE9(PHO89)], Afu4g06020 [phoCPHO81)], and Afu2g09040 (vacuolar transporter Vtc4) were more expressed either in the delta phoB(PHO80) mutant background or in 0.1 mM Pi. Keywords: gene expression array-based (log2 ratio)
