TITLE
Expression profiling of Glycine max seed maturation by high throughput sequencing

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
A transcriptome analysis of soybean seeds harvested at different developing stages (between stage 7.1 and stage 9) was carried out to understand the molecular events occuring during the acquisition of seed longevity during maturation.

DESIGN
RNAseq from developing Glycine max seeds from stage 7.1 (mid-seedfilling) to final maturation
