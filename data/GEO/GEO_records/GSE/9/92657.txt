TITLE
Post-transcriptional regulation of adult CNS axonal regeneration by Cpeb1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression plays important roles in neuron physiology, and likely do so as well in injury response of axons We used microarray to profile expression changes in total and polysome-bound RNA upon spinal cord injury, to elucidate the role of post-transcriptional regulation towards axonal regeneration

DESIGN
Mice were subjected to either a transection injury to the spinal cord or a sham operation. 9 hours post-operation, spinal cords were extracted. From this total RNA and polysome-bound RNA (isolated via sucrose gradient fractionation) were isolated and analyzed with Affymetrix microarrays
