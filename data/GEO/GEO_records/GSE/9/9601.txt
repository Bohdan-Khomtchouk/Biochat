TITLE
Expression Data From HCMV-Infected Human Monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human cytomegalovirus induces a pro-inflammatory monocyte following infection and we have evidence that NF-κB and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI(3)K] are key mediators in this early activation.  To begin to address how these signalling pathways are responsible for the rapid activation of infected monocytes, we examined the role these pathways played in the transcriptome of infected monocytes.  Global transcriptional profiling using cDNA microarrays revealed a significant number of genes, including inflammatory genes, were regulated in a NF-κB- and/or PI(3)K-dependent manner, identifying these pathways as key cellular control points in the conversion of monocytes to an activated pro-inflammatory state following HCMV infection.
