TITLE
Identification of Lef1-dependent genes in zebrafish and mouse hypothalamus

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-seq with dissected control and Lef1 mutant hypothalami from 3 days post-fertilization (3dpf) zebrafish, embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) and postnatal day 22 (P22) mouse. We identified Lef1-dependent genes involved in an anxiolytic function in both species, but those genes are different between zebrafish and mouse.

DESIGN
Hypothalamic transcriptome of control and Lef1 mutant zebrafish and mouse at different stages were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate.
