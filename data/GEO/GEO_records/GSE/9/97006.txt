TITLE
Expression data from Burkholderia multivorans ATCC 17616 wild-type and Bmul_2557 (ldhR) gene deletion mutant

ORGANISM
Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315

SUMMARY
Within this work we identified and characterized gene Bmul_2557 (ldhR) of B. multivorans ATCC 17616, a bacterial species associated with chronic respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis patients. LdhR belongs to the LysR-type family of transcriptional regulators and its deletion from the B. multivorans genome affected considerably the formation of planktonic cellular aggregates and surface-attached biofilms.
