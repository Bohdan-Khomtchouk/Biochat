TITLE
Strand-specific RNA sequencing profile of wild type and dbp2∆ strains [re-analysis]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741

SUMMARY
By comparing differentially expressed genes in dbp2∆ to those of 700 other deletion strains from other studies, we report that CYC8 and TUP1, which form a complex and inhibit transcription of numerous genes, co-repress a common set of genes with DBP2. Functional annotation clustering analysis reveals that these co-repressed genes are related to cellular metabolism. Furthermore, we find that co-repressed genes have a higher propensity to be overlapped with long non-coding RNAs at their promoter/5' regions.

DESIGN
Strand-specific RNA profiles of a dbp2Δ strain and a wild type (reference) strain were generated using two replicates of each strain. Please note that this study represents the re-analysis of the published GSE58097 data, generating re-analyzed count matrix (.xls), edgeR results (.xls) and gene tracks (.bedgraph).
