TITLE
Genome-wide Identification and Characterization of Natural Antisense Transcripts by Strand-specific RNA Sequencing in Ganoderma lucidum

ORGANISM
Ganoderma lucidum G.260125-1

SUMMARY
We have identified and characterized the natural antisense transcripts using strand-specific (ss) RNA-seq technology.

DESIGN
Identification and Characterization of natural antisense transcripts (NATs) from three development stages in G.lucidum.
