TITLE
Alcohol Consumption and Breast Tumor Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigating the association of alcohol and gene expression of breast tumors and tumor-adjacent tissues.

DESIGN
Total of 1110 samples which includes 602 tumor and 508 tumor-adjacent tissues from participants of the Nurses' Heath Study I and II diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Limma analyses compared how alcohol intake at 0, > 0- < 10 and 10+ grams/day influenced gene expression in breast tumor and tumor-adjacent tissues.
