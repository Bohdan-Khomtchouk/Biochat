TITLE
Neonatal Transplantation Confers Maturation of PSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes Conducive to Modeling Cardiomyopathy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs) were transplanted into rats for one month to determine the change in morphology, structure, and function. Single cell RNA seq analysis was performed to compared the transcriptome of in vivo matured PSC-CMs to adult rat cardiomyocytes and in vitro cultured PSC-CMs.

DESIGN
single cell RNA seq of 3 cell types
