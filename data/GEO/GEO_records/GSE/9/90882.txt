TITLE
Th17 polarization under hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of Th17 polarization under different oxygen concentrations and environmental toxin exposure at gene expression level. Results provide important information of the response of CD4+ T cells  to low oxygen , such as genes involved in metabolism, transcriptional factor, up- or down-regulated specific cellular functions.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated CD4 cells subjected to polarization into Th17 cells and treated with environmental toxins (cigarette smoke extract) and different oxygen concentrations.
