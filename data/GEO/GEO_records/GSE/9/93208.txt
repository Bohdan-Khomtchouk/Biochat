TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of first trimester villous cytotrophoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip platform, we profiled the genome-wide DNA methylation of villous cytotrophoblasts samples isolated ex vivo from placental chorionic villi before they first come into contact with maternal blood (8-10 weeks of gestation, n = 9) and after (12-14 weeks of gestation, n = 10).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA was hybridized to Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays
