TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of human immortilized astrocytes reprogrammed into dopaminergic neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We directly reprogram human astrocytes (hIA) in vitro into induced dopaminergic neurons (iDAs). This process requires three transcription factors, NEUROD1, ASCL1 and LMX1A as well as one microRNA, mir218. This combined protocol gives rise to human astrocyte-derived iDAs with appropriate midbrain markers as defined by analyzing markers derived from human embryonic ventral midbrain samples at 7 and 9 weeks of age.

DESIGN
Four replicates of the uninduced astrocyte cell line, four replicates of astrocytes induced into dopaminergic cells, and two samples each of human embryonic midbrain tissue at 7 and 9 weeks of age
