TITLE
Regulatory NK cells: IL-18-elicited NK cells with immunosuppressive functions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cancer-induced tolerance mostly involves myeloid suppressor cells, regulatory T cells and immunosuppressive cytokines, which all subvert adaptive immune responses against tumor cells. Here, we show that a subset of innate effectors, c-kit expressing NK cells (Kit+ NK), can participate in tumor-induced tolerance by compromising the NK cell arm of tumor immunosurveillance. IL-18 produced by tumor cells can convert Kit- into Kit+ NK cells that overexpress B7-H1/PD-L1 molecules. Upon tumor inoculation, Kit+ NK cells rapidly develop in lymphoid organs in a IL-18R/MyD88 dependent manner and directly kill Kit- NK cells in a B7-H1/PD-1-dependent manner, thereby promoting the progression of NK-controlled cancers. Our data suggest that, in a tumoral context, IL-18 subverts antitumor NK cell functions. Systemic neutralization of IL-18 by IL-18-binding protein may improve the NK-mediated immunosurveillance.
