TITLE
Cellular Aging of Mesenchymal Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine gene expression changes during in vitro senescence of MSC we have analyzed differential expression of the corresponding early passage (P2) and senescent passage (PX). There were global changes in the gene expression profile that were reproducible in three independent donor samples. Keywords: Replicative senescence, time course
