SUMMARY
Anim Genet. 2009 Feb;40(1):115-8. Epub 2008 Oct 17. Differentially expressed transcripts in adipose tissue between Korean native pig and Yorkshire breeds. Moon JK, Kim KS, Kim JJ, Choi BH, Cho BW, Kim TH, Lee CK. Division of Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences & Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea. We measured and compared the transcripts of adipose tissue from Korean native pig (KNP) and Yorkshire (YS) breeds to investigate breed-specific transcription changes. We employed both the Affymetrix porcine genome array and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We found eight genes showing significant changes between the two breeds. Based on a literature review, these genes were indicative of differences in extracellular structure density and differences in the potential to metabolize xenobiotic chemicals and lipids. The differentially expressed genes indicated that KNP has a lower extracellular structure density and a lower potential to metabolize xenobiotic chemicals than YS. PMID: 18945290
