TITLE
T cell zone resident macrophages silently dispose of apoptotic cells in the lymph node

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells of the immune system. In lymph nodes (LN), they are also believed to dispose of apoptotic cells, a critical function usually achieved by macrophages (Mφ) in other tissues. We report a population of tolerogenic Mφ located in the T cell zone of LN. T zone Mφ (TZM) are long lived Mφ seeded after birth and slowly replaced by blood monocytes. We show that TZM but not DC act as the only professional scavengers clearing apoptotic cells in the LN T cell zone. Importantly, we demonstrate that TZM prevent the capture of apoptotic cells by DC and the associated potential noxious activation of T cell immunity. We thus propose a new model in which efferocytosis and T cell activation are uncoupled processes handled by TZM and DC respectively.

DESIGN
Microarray of  lymph node resident macrophages (TZM), lymph node CD8a+ DC and microglia sorted from CX3CR1 gfp+/- mice. 3 replicates for each population.
