TITLE
RNA polymerase II stalling at pre-mRNA splice sites is enforced by ubiquitination of the catalytic subunit [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Genome wide screens identified negative genetic interactions between several cofactors of the exosome nuclease complex and the Bre5-Ubp3 ubiquitin protease complex. RNA-binding was shown for Bre5 with enrichment for sites over exon 2 of spliced pre-mRNAs and close to poly(A) sites. An inducible splicing-reporter showed a requirement for Bre5 in efficient in vivo splicing and for normal RNAPII elongation, specifically on splicing-competent genes. A Bre5-Ubp3 sensitive site of RNAPII ubiquitination was mapped at Lys1246 at the entrance to the active site of the large subunit. Ubiquitinated RNAPII was depleted at the TSS but enriched at the 5â€™ end of exon 2 and upstream of poly(A) sites, similar to Bre5. Mutation of Lys1246 reduced RNAPII occupancy upstream of the poly(A) site, consistent with reduced pausing at a potential surveillance site, but increased RNAPII residence downstream of the poly(A) site. Strains expressing RNAPII with the Lys1246 mutation showed increased levels of unspliced but poly(A)+ RNA, indicating reduced cotranscriptional splicing efficiency. We propose that ubiquinitation of RNAPII is induced by RNA processing events and linked to transcriptional pausing, which is released by Bre5-Ubp3 associated with the nascent transcript.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq of the S. cerevisiae transcriptome was conducted to compare the presence of unspliced introns in strains expressing Rpo21-HTP or Rpo21_K1246R-HTP.
