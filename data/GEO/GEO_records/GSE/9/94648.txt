TITLE
Expression data from peripheral whole blood of non-IBD controls, CD and UC patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon with preiods of active disease followed by remission. We performed a whole-genome transcriptional analysis of peripheral whole blood (PAXgene tubes) from patients with endoscopically active and inactive UC and CD, as well as non-inflammatory controls.

DESIGN
Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease patients as well as non-inflammatory controls were collected for whole blood RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  All patients had undergone clinical and endoscopic evaluations at the time of sample collection. Disease activity was assessed using the endoscopic scores. For UC, active disease was defined as a endoscopic Mayo sub score > =1 and inactive disease as a endoscopic Mayo sub score =0. For CD, active disease was defined as a partial CDEIS > 3.5 and inactive disease as a partial CDEIS < =3.5 (where partial CDEIS corresponds to the CDEIS from the worst segment). Finally, a total of 97 blood samples were analyzed: 22 healthy controls, 8 inactive UC, 17 active UC, 9 inactive CD and 41 active CD. As two batches were processed, 4 samples were analyzed in both batches in order to control the batch effect.
