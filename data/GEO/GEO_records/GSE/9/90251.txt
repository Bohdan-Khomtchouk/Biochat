polyA depleted RNA-seq from SK-N-SH (ENCSR000CQP)

ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from the whole cell fraction of independent growths of cell line SK-N-SH that has been treated with retinoic acid. They are stranded PE76 Illumina GAIIx RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted and DSN normalized Poly-A- RNA > 200 nucleotides in size. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
