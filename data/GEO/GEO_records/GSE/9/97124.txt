TITLE
Expression data from DMOS- or paeoniflorin- treated human pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Paeoniflorin (PF) is an active monoterpene glycoside extracted from Paeonia lactiflora Pall. Recent studies showed that PF has anti-tumor effects in various types of cancer. However, the function of PF in pancreatic cancer (PA) is largely unexplored. Here, we showed that PF suppressed growth of PA cell lines Capan-1 and MIAPaCa-2, and profoundly sensitized these cells to X-ray irradiation. Through a microarray analysis, we identified tumor-suppressor candidate gene HTRA3 as the most increased gene upon PF treatment in Capan-1 cells. Ectopic expression of HTRA3 led to reduced cell growth and increased expression of apoptotic protein Bax, suggesting a tumor suppressive role of HTRA3 in PA cells. Together, our results provide a set of genetic and biologic proofs that PF inhibited PA cell growth by upregulation of HTRA3.

DESIGN
Capan-1 cells were with DMSO or 500 Î¼M paeoniflorin. Each treatment was performed in triplicates.DMSO treatment was considered as control group.
