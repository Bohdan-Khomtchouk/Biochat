TITLE
Hypertonic saline attenuates the cytokine-induced pro-inflammatory signature in primary human lung epithelia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HTS inhibits inflammation of lung epithelium

DESIGN
This study was designed to interrogate the global transcriptional responses induced by HTS and provides insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathways affected by HTS. In this study, RNA sequencing was employed to explore early changes in transcriptional response, identify key mediators, signaling pathways, and transcriptional modules that are affected by HTS in the presence of a strong inflammatory stimulus.
