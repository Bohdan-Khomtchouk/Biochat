TITLE
Global gene expression in P. pastoris during mitotic and meiotic growth, with and without meiotic regulator Ndt80

ORGANISM
Komagataella pastoris

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to identify the genes with increased expression during sporulation in wild-type P. pastoris, and during sporulation in cells with Ndt80 deleted.  Cells were grown unti log-phase in YPD or in sporulation media (0.5% sodium acetate, 1% potassium chloride, 1% glucose, 2% agar plates ) for 30 hours.  Each experiment was repeated three times and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000

DESIGN
P. pastoris WT meiotic expression vs. WT mitotic expression and Ndt80 del meiotic expression vs. WT meiotic expression, with three technical replicates for each.
