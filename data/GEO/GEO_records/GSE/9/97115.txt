TITLE
Ebf2 Knockout Brown Adipose Tissue [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The helix-loop-helix transcription factor Early B-Cell Factor 2 (EBF2) is required for the differentiation and function of brown and beige adipocytes. The presumptive BAT in Ebf2 knockout (KO) animals has a white-fat like morphology and molecular profile. We examined the transcriptome of WT and Ebf2 KO BAT by high-throughput sequencing.

DESIGN
Two control replicates (wildtype mice) and two experimental replicates (Ebf2 KO mice) were analyzed
