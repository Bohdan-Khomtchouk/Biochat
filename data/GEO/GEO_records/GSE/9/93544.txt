TITLE
Gene expression alterations in transporters with Pb (lead) exposure in mice tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the entry mechanisms of Pb into the cells in mice, we have employed microarray analysis. We examined gene induction of the candidates suspected to be responsible for Pb entry into cells such as STIM1, Orai1, TRP, VGCC, divalent metal transporter 1, and anion exchanger in the liver, kidney, and brain by microarray. However, no significant induction was observed in the liver, kidney, and brain. As a confirmation, the induction of metallothionein, which is known to be induced with Pb exposure, was observed to be two and eight times greater in the liver and kidney, respectively, in the high dosage groups compared with the control group

DESIGN
Two different concentrations of lead acetate (100 mg/L and 1,000 mg/L) were given to two of the groups (the low and high dosage groups, respectively) in the drinking water for three weeks. The control groups were provided with distilled water. Gene expression in the brain, kidney and liver of mice were examined.
