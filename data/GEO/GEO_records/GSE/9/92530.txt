TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of BQ.Ncf1m1J mutated and BQ wild type mice during collagen induced arthritis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Whole blood and spleen tissue was collected 15 (d15) or 44 (d44) days postimmunization from mice immunized with type II collagen on day 0 and immunostimulated on day 21. We compared the gene expression profiles of disease prone BQ.Ncf1m1J mice to that in BQ wild type mice. The samples were collected in two sets (marked I and II). The results show a pronounced interferon signature and increase in inflammatory transcripts in the BQ.Ncf1m1J mice.

DESIGN
Each sample group consisted of tissues from 12 mice per genotype. RNA was isolated and globin removal was performed for all samples. The cells were not stimulated or selected ex vivo.
