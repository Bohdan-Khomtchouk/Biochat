TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of CPSF5 dependent starvation response

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Purpose: transcriptome analysis of CPSF5 dependent starvation response Methods: Total RNA was extracted from larval fat body using TRIzolÂ® reagent (Invitrogen). After assessing RNA quality with an Agilent Bioanalyzer, libraries constructed with an Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 4000 at the Columbia Genome Center ( ). Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we identified 1933 genes responding to starvation and 585 genes were found to be CPSF5-dependent.  The gene set enrichment analyses and qPCR confirmation further suggested autophagy, changes of lipid, protein and energy metabolism is requlated by CPSF5 during starvation. Conclusions: our study identified the regulatory role of CPSF5 in autophagy and metabolisms during starvation.

DESIGN
Analysis the transcriptome changes in the fat body of the CPSF5 mutant or wild-type flies under fed or starvation condition
