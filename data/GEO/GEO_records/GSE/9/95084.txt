TITLE
Characterization of chordoma cell lines derived from the clivus region

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA profiling of three clival chordoma cell lines. The expression profiles were compared to previously published expression profiles of sacral chodomas (GEO accession number: GSE68497) to determine whether there are differences in expression that indicate stricing differences on molecular grounds.

DESIGN
mRNA profiling of three clival chordoma cell lines
