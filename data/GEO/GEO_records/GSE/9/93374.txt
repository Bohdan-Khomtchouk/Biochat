TITLE
A Molecular Census of Arcuate Hypothalamus and Median Eminence Cell Types

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Drop-seq and single cell sequencing of mouse arcuate nucleus and median eminence

DESIGN
Drop-Seq was performed on six separate days using mice in C57BL6/J background at various ages/sex noted. On day 1, Chow_1 replicate was obtained. On day 2, Chow_2 replicate was  obtained. On day 3, Chow_3 replicate was obtained.  On day 4, 10% Diet_1 and HFD_1 replicates were obtained. On day 5, Fast_1 and Refed_1 replicates were obtained. On day 6,  Fast_2, Fast_3, Chow_4, and Chow_5 replicates were obtained
