TITLE
Effect of monocrotophos on gut metatranscriptome

ORGANISM
mouse gut metagenome

SUMMARY
Purpose: To study the differential expression of gut bacterial mRNAs during chronic organophosphate treatment. Methods: Balb/c mice were treated with organophosphate (monocrotophos 28 ug/kg body weight/day) directly in drinking water for 180 days. Glucose tolerance tests indicated the induction of glucose intolerance. The total RNA was isolated by using TRIZOL from the cecal tissue that is cleared off fecal contents and subsequently the eukaryotic and bacterial rRNAs were removed by using MicrobExpress and MicrobEnrich kits (Ambion).  Subsequently, RNA library was contructed using illumina kit as per manufacturer's instructions. Results: The reads were annotated to the reference human gut microbiome database and we found differential expression of large number of genes especially those involved in organophosphate degradation. Our subsequent studies proved that gut microbial degradation of organophosphates induces glucose intolerance via gluconeogenesis. Conclusions: Chronic organophosphate-induced hyperglycemia is mediated by the organosphosphate-degrading potential of gut microbiota.

DESIGN
mRNA profile of gut bacteria was generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 1000
