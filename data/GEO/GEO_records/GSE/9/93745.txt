TITLE
Functional role and therapeutic targeting of p21-associated kinase 4 (PAK4) in Multiple Myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dysregulated oncogenic serine/threonine kinases play a pathological role in diverse forms of malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM), and thus represent potential therapeutic targets. Here, we evaluated the biological and functional role of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4), and its potential as a new target in MM for clinical applications. PAK4 promoted MM cell growth and survival via activation of MM survival signaling pathways, including the MEK-ERK pathway. Furthermore, treatment with orally bioavailable PAK4 allosteric modulator (KPT-9274) significantly impacted MM cell growth and survival in a large panel of MM cell lines and primary MM cells alone and in the presence of bone marrow microenvironment. Intriguingly, we have identified FGFR3 as a novel binding partner of PAK4 and observed significant activity of KPT-9274 against t(4;14)-positive MM cells. These data support PAK4 as an oncogene in myeloma, and provide the rationale for the clinical evaluation of PAK4 modulator in myeloma.

DESIGN
Control and 48 hours treated samples from 2 multiple myeloma cell lines
