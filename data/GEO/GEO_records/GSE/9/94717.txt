TITLE
Differentially expressed miRNAs in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury target oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive miRNA array, we screened 40 miRNAs were differentially expressed among the three groups and we explored the functions of these miRNAs in the serum by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes annotation. The enrichment results indicated that these miRNAs mainly participated in the oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction pathways. Furthermore, the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed the different expression of miRNA might potentially be used to discriminate septic AKI from sepsis-non AKI and they were correlated with the regulation of mitochondrial oxidative stress and dysfunction, including PGC-1α, SIRT1, mTOR, OXSR1 and NOX5.

DESIGN
In this study, 15 blood samples, including 6 patients with G- sepsis-induced AKI, 6 patients with G- sepsis-non AKI and 3 healthy controls were used to acquire the miRNA expression profiling and the function of the abudant miRNAs in the serum were analyzed by bioinformatic methods,finally, the different expression of miRNA might potentially be used to discriminate septic AKI from sepsis-non AKI and they were correlated with the regulation of mitochondrial oxidative stress and dysfunction, including PGC-1α, SIRT1, mTOR, OXSR1 and NOX5.
