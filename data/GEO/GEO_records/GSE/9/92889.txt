TITLE
Systematic in vitro and in vivo characterization of Leukemia-inhibiting factor (LIF)- and Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) -derived porcine induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSC) vs. embryonic stages

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Systematic in vitro and in vivo characterization of Leukemia-inhibiting factor (LIF)- and Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) -derived porcine induced pluripotent stem cells (Cell reprogramming -basic developmental studies in the pig) vs Porcine embryonic stages (Plurisys) Global gene expression analyses and comparisons  of LIF piPSC, FGF piPSC, Parental fibroblast line day 7-8 porcine embryo, day 10-11 porcine embryo, day 12-13 porcine embryo.  Gene network analyses of piPSC lines, pNF and ICM from day 7-8 porcine embryos.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq profiles of three embryonic stages with a minimum of 2 replicates. RNA-Seq profiles of piPSC and pNFs performed with 3 biological replicates for each line.
