TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of gene expression and transcription factors binding reveals new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation during Drosophila spermatogenesis [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To investigate the mechanisms of gene regulation during Drosophila spermatogenesis, we performed RNA-Seq gene expression profiling in testes from Drosophila males, bearing mutations that affect spermatogenesis.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq gene expression profiling in bam-, comr-, can-, mip40-, CG9879-, bam-/mip40-mutant and wild-type testes of Drosophila melanogaster. We generated biological replicate for each sample, thus we obtained 14 RNA-Seq gene expression profiles.
