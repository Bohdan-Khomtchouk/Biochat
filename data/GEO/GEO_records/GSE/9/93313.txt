TITLE
Expression Analysis of 2D, 3D Quiescent, and 3D Activated Pancreatic Stellate Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study used Illumina single-end RNA-sequencing to examine gene expression differences between 2 mouse-derived pancreatic stellate cell lines (PSC4, PSC5) grown either in 2D monolayers, as 3D quiescent cultures, or as 3D activated transwell cocultures with 2 mouse tumor-derived pancreatic ductal organoid lines (T4, T5). Mouse pancreatic stellate cell (PSC) lines were derived from the pancreata of wild-type C57Bl/6J mice. Mouse tumor organoid lines were derived from mouse pancreata containing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from the KrasLSL-G12D; Trp53LSL-R162H; Pdx1-Cre mouse model. We measured genes differentially expressed among 2D, quiescent, and 3D activated PSCs that may reflect the expression changes of heterogeneous CAF population in pancreatic tumors.

DESIGN
Gene expression comparison of 2 murine pancreatic stellate cell lines grown either in 2D monolayers, 3D quiescent cultures, or 3D activated transwell cocultures with 2 murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma-derived pancreatic ductal organoid lines.
