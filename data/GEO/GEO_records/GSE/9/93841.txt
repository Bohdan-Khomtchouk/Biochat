TITLE
Functional Screening in Human Cardiac Organoids Reveals a Metabolic Mechanism for Cardiomyocyte Maturation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mammalian heart undergoes maturation during postnatal life to meet the increased functional requirements of the adult. However, the key drivers of this process remain poorly defined. We developed as 96-well screening platform, using human pluripotent stem cell derived cardiac organoids, to determine the molecular requirements for in vitro cardiomyocyte maturation. Here, we describe gene expression changes resulting from culturing human cardiac organoids in standard cell culture conditions and under optimized maturation conditions. We assessed our maturation conditions by comparing transcriptional changes of human cardiac organoids to RNA isolated from human heart. Interesting, analysis of these data revealed that a switch to fatty acid oxidative metabolism is a key governor of cardiomyocyte maturation and mature cardiac organoids were refractory to mitogenic stimuli.

DESIGN
3D cardiac organoids were cultured in CTRL or MM for 11 days before collecting for RNA-seq.
