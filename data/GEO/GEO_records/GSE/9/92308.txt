TITLE
Identification of imprinted gene Grb10 to associate with the pluripotency state in nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells using high throughput sequencing technology

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the exactly syngeneic ntESCs and iPSCs with same genomic insertion generated from adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) isolated from the all-iPSC mice through the primary TF mediated reprogramming by performing the high-throughput sequencing. There were 84 genes significantly upregulated in fully reprogrammed ntESCs compared with partially reprogrammed ntESCs and 391 genes upregulated in fully reprogrammed iPSCs compared with partially reprogrammed iPSCs. An overlapping gene, Grb10, was identified to associate with the pluripotency state of ntESCs.

DESIGN
Examination of the mRNA expression in different cell types.
