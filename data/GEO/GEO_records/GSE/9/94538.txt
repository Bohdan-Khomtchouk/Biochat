TITLE
Gene expression analysis in naïve and vaccine (peptide vs. DC) primed pmel-1 CD8 Tcells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have shown that DC vaccine is superior to peptide vaccine in terms of priming and expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. DC vaccine-primed pmel-1 cells displayed better effecter functions than cells by peptide-primed cells in terms of cytokine production and externalization of cytotoxic granules. Furthermore DC vaccine-primed cells were metabolically distinct from peptide-primed cells. To confirm these findings, we performed a microarray analysis using splenic pmel-1 T cells from mice immunized with hgp100 peptide vaccine or DC vaccine. We also used splenic naïve pmel-1 T cells as a control.

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice transferred with pmel-1 splenocytes were treated with hgp100 peptide vaccine or DC vaccine twice on days 0 and 14. On day 28, pmel-1 CD8+ T cells were sorted from harvested splenocytes of immunized mice. Gene expression was measured in naïve pmel-1 CD8+ T cells and sorted pmel-1 CD8+ T cells
