TITLE
Differentially expressed mRNAs in bladder cancer stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive lncRNA array (Arraystar human lncRNA microarray), we screened the lncRNAs and mRNA abundant in bladder cancer stem cells sorted from three bladder cancer cell lines, compared to the bladder cancer cells. And the functions of lncRNAs in bladder cancer stem cells were analyzed along the following research.

DESIGN
Bladder cancer stem cells sorted from 3 bladder cancer cell lines were individually profiled the lncRNA and mRNA expression
