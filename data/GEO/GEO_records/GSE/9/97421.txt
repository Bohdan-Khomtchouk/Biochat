TITLE
A Novel Perivascular Cell Population in the Zebrafish Brain

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Purpose: RNA-seq analysis from isolated zebrafish fluorescent granular perithelial (FGP) cells in adult brains compared to endothelial cells or entire fish. Method: FGPs and endothelium were isolated by FACS sorting using transgenic line Tg(kdrl:mCherry);Tg(mrc1a:eGFP).

DESIGN
Total RNA from isolated FGPs, endothelial cells and whole fish.
