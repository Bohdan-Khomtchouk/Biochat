TITLE
Expression date from db/db mice with or without treatment of traditional Chinese medicine Tang-shen Formula

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Chinese herbal granule Tangshen Formula (TSF) has been proven to decrease proteinuria and improve estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) patients with albuminuria. Nevertheless, little was known on the underlying mechanisms of TSF on treating DN. We used microarrays to detail to explore the target genes of TSF in the treatment of DN.

DESIGN
Renal cortical tissues were selected from db/m mice, db/db mice and db/db mice with TSF-treatment for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain to identify the therapeutic target of TSF in diabetic renal injuries through microarray-based gene expression profiling.
