TITLE
Transcriptome analysis for KDM6A mutated urothelial bladder carcinoma and EZH2 inhibitor treated KDM6A mutated urothelial bladder carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose:  The goals of this study are to compare 1. The transcription profile in KDM6A wildtype and KDM6A mutated urothelial bladder carcinoma. 2. The transcriptional changes in KDM6A mutated urothelial bladder carcinoma upon EZH2 inhibitor treatment.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiling of KDM6A wildtype and KDM6A mutated urothelial bladder carcinoma were generated by deep sequencing, 10 cases in each group, using Hiseq2000. Transcriptome profiling of EZH2 inhibitor-treated KDM6A wildtype and KDM6A mutated urothelial bladder carcinoma were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Hiseq2000.
