TITLE
Control vs hyper; 25 mM glucose_Filtered fb-bg

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis upon the overexpression of the folate gene cluster on a high copy plasmid when compared to an empty vector in the lactic acid bacterium L. plantarum. The transcriptional response was determined for both strains in continuous culture in the presence of glucose thereby using the hybridisation sceme as described in the data processing section. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
