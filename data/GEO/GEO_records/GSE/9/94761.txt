TITLE
Mouse mammary fibroblast gene expression comparison between nulliparous and involution day 6.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We tested the gene expression difference between PDGFRa+ fibroblasts FACS sorted from nulliparous balb/c mouse mammary glands and 6 days post-weaning mammary glands

DESIGN
2 biological replicates of fibroblasts from nulliparous mammary glands and 3 biological replicates of fibroblasts from 6 days post-weaning mammary glands were used for comparison.
