TITLE
Features of TAP independently presented MHC ligands revealed by quantitative mass spectrometry.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The TAP transporter is responsible for transferring cytosolic peptides into the ER where they can be loaded onto MHC molecules. Deletion of TAP results in a drastic reduction of MHC surface expression and alters the presented peptide pattern. Using the TAP deficient cell line LCL721.174 and its TAP expressing progenitor cell line LCL721.45, we have identified and quantified more than 160 HLA ligands, 50 out of which were presented TAP independently. Peptides which were predominantly presented on the TAP deficient LCL721.174 cell line had a decreased MHC binding affinity according to their SYFPEITHI and BIMAS score. About half of the identified TAP independently presented peptides were not derived from signal sequences and may partly be generated by the proteasome. Furthermore, we have excluded that different HLA presentation ratios were due to varying expression of the respective protein or due to changes in the antigen loading complex. Features of TAP-independently presented peptides as well as proteasomal contribution to their generation provides an insight into basic immunological mechanisms. Keywords: differential mass spectrometry, TAP independent, antigen presentation
