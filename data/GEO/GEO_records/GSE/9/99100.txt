TITLE
Gene expression profiels from organoids.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent studies have suggested increased plasticity of differentiated cells within the intestine to act both as intestinal stem cells and tumour initiating cells. However, little is known of the processes that regulate this plasticity. Our previous work has shown that activating mutations of Kras or the NF-kB pathway can drive dedifferentiation of intestinal cells lacking Apc. To investigate this process further, we profiled organoids by gene expression analysis. Organoids were isolated from VillinCreER Apcfl/fl KrasG12D crypts  (here called CC) or Villi (here called SFV).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiments, CC and SFV organoids. Biological replicates: 3 CC and 3 SFV independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array. Each replicate represents a single mouse.
