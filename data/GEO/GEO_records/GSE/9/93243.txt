TITLE
small RNA-Seq of WT, snrk2.2/3/6, and hyl1-2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Using small RNA-Seq(sRNA-Seq) to get miRNA profiling of  WT,  snrk2.2/3/6, and hyl1-2 mutant

DESIGN
3 samples examined: WT, hyl1-2 single mutant,  and snrk2.2/3/6 triple mutant. Each sample has two replicates.
