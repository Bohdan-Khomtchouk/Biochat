TITLE
Changes in gene expression profile in mammalian cells upon Raf activation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Comparison of  the changes in the gene expression profile of cells in which there is an activation of the Raf oncogene in the absence of any other extracellular signals Keywords: Response to oncogenic activation of the MAPK pathway
