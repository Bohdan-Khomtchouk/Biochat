TITLE
Gene expression profiles of intestinal tumors originating from different cell compartments

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Introduction of mutations into intestinal stem cells leads to tumorigenesis, therefore intestinal stem cells are believed to function as cell of origin of intestinal tumors. However in the case of additional protumorigenic stimuli differentiated cells can dedifferentiate and can also give rise to intestinal tumors. Expression of stabilized Î²-catenin (CtnnbloxEx3/+) and mutant KrasG12D/+ in all the intestinal cells by using Cre recombinase driven by the villin promoter (VilCreER) leads to rapid transformation and tumorigenesis. However, when the same mutations are introduced only into the differentited cell by the help of Xbp1sCreER mice also develop tumors. In this study we wished to investigate if the cell of origin would impact the gene expression profile of intestinal tumors. Therefore we compared the gene expression profiles of early stage tumors derived from VilCreER CtnnbloxEx3/+ KrasG12D/+ mice and early stage tumors derived from Xbp1sCreER CtnnbloxEx3/+ KrasG12D/+ mice by microarray.

DESIGN
Mice were treated with 1 mg Tamoxifen on five consecutive days to induce the activity of the Cre recombinase and the expression of CtnnbloxEx3/+ and KrasG12D/+.  Both VilCreER CtnnbloxEx3/+ KrasG12D/+  and  Xbp1sCreER CtnnbloxEx3/+ KrasG12D/+  mice were sacrificed when early intestinal tumors  were already present (day 7 for  VilCreER CtnnbloxEx3/+ KrasG12D/+ and day 21 for  Xbp1sCreER CtnnbloxEx3/+ KrasG12D/+). RNA was extracted from isolated epithelial cell extracts of both genotypes.
