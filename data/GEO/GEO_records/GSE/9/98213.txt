TITLE
Immunohistochemical and transcriptional analysis uncover RasGRF2-mediated regulation of nestin-positive stem cell density and early neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of adult mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate gene expression changes in olfactory bulb and hippocampus brain regions under RasGRF2 absence.

DESIGN
Olfactory bulb and hippocampus from three GRF2 KO mice compared to olfactory bulb and hippocampus from three WT mice.
