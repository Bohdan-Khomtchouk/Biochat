TITLE
Alveolar macrophage gene expression - PIKfyve knockout

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
comparison of Alveolar macrophge gene expression in wild type and PIKfyve ko We identifed gene that important for alveolar macrophage development

DESIGN
Alveolar macrophage were isolated from wild type or PIKfyve KO adult mice  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
