TITLE
Global gene expression profiles of Oryza sativa wild type Zhonghua11 and mutant gif1 in filling stage

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of Gif1 action in the control of grain filling and yield improvement, we performed transcriptional profiling of wild type Zhonghua11 and mutant gif1 plants in early filling stage on a global scale using the Affymetrix GeneChip Rice Genome Array Keywords: Filling stage
