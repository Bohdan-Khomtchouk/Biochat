TITLE
A sister of NANOG regulates genes expressed in pre-implantation human development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the ability of human NANOGNB to regulate gene expression by ectopically expressing the gene in human dermal fibroblasts.

DESIGN
NANOGNB and an empty control vector were transfected individually to drive ectopic expression in human dermal fibroblasts, in triplicate.
