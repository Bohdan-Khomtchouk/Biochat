TITLE
RNA-sequencing of pediatric idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used NGS of rna to understand transcriptome wide changes that occur in the left ventricles of pediatric idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients.

DESIGN
Left ventricles were harvested from failed or healthy control patients and rna was sequenced
