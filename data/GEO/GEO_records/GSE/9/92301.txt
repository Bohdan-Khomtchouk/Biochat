TITLE
Gene expression profile of hedgehog-responsive stromal cells in mouse PB-MYC prostate tumor and normal prostate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of RNA-sequencing for high-throughput profiling of gene expression in hedgehog-responsive stromal cells in normal mouse prostate and mouse prostate tumors. By using the Gli1-GFP knock-in reporter mouse line, we isolated the subset of mouse prostate stromal cells undergoing hedgehog signaling to compare the transcriptomes between PB-MYC prostate tumor and normal prostate in mice at the age of about 45 weeks.

DESIGN
The mRNA profiles of hedgehog-responsive stromal cells in 45-week old wild type (WT) prostates and PB-MYC prostate tumors were generated by RNA-sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
