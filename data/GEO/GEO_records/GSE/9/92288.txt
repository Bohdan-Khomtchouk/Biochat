TITLE
An atlas and analysis of bovine skeletal muscle long noncoding RNAs

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In this study, 7188 bovine skeletal muscle lncRNAs were identified by RNA-Seq and a stringent screening procedure in four different muscle tissues. These lncRNAs shared many characteristics with other mammalian lncRNAs, such as the shorter ORF and lower expression level than mRNAs. Furthermore, the chromosomal locations and global expression patterns for these lncRNAs were also described in detail.Our results provided a global expression pattern of lncRNAs specific to bovine skeletal muscle and supplied us important targets for studying the function of lncRNAs in muscle development, which would help to better identify mechanisms underlying muscle development in bovine.

DESIGN
Analysis of lncRNA expression profiling for four types of skeletal muscle samples in bovine.
