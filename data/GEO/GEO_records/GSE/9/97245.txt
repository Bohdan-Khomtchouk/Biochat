TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas aeruginosa phosphomimetic and phosphoablative AlgR

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
The Pseudomonas aeruginosa response regulator AlgR is critical for the organism's virulence and controls up to 155 different genes. In order to determine which genes are controlled by phosphorylated and unphosphorylated AlgR, phosphomimetic and phosphoablative alleles were recombined onto the chromosome of PAO1. The algR gene was mutated at aspartate 54 to asparagine (D54N) for the phosphoablative allele and mutated at aspartete 54 to glutamate (D54E) for the phosphomimetic allele. These alleles were recombined into the PAO1 chromosome.
