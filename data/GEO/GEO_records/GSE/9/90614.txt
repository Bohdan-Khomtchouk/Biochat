TITLE
Effects of TCPOBOP on gene expression in wild type and Cyp2b9/10/13-null mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of publicly available gene expression profiling results indicated a strong coupling of CAR and Nrf2 activation. We hypothesized that the activation of CAR regulated Cyp enzymes contributes to oxidative stress that leads to Nrf2 activation. To test this hypothesis, we examined activation of both CAR and Nrf2 transcriptional biomarkers in wild type and Cyp2b9/10/13-null mice after treatment with the CAR activator TCPOBOP.

DESIGN
Eight to ten-week old WT or Cyp2b9/10/13-null male and female mice (n = 4-6) were injected with autoclaved corn oil or TCPOBOP (Sigma) dissolved in autoclaved corn oil at 3 mg/kg.  Forty-eight hours later mice were weighed and euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation, livers excised, weighed, diced, and snap frozen for RNA extraction and stored at -80oC. Gene expression in the livers of the mice was evaluated using Affymetrix mouse 430PM arrays.
