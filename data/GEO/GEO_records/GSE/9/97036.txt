TITLE
Effects of arsenic and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection on gene expression in human airway epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: To determine effects of arsenic on gene expression in polarized primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells and impact on transcriptional response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection Methods: mRNA profiles of HBE cells from 6 donors exposed to 0, 5, 10 or 50 ug/L total arsenic +/- Pseudomonas aeruginosa (48 samples) were generated using Illumina sequencing, aligned in CLC Genomics workbench and analyzed for DE in EdgeR Findings: 20-30 million reads were mapped per sample and transcripts were identifed that were significantly differentially expressed in response to arsenic and Pseudomonas aeruginosa

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of HBE cells from 6 donors exposed to three concentrations of arsenic +/- Pseudomonas were generated using mRNA sequencing
