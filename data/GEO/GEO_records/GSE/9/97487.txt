TITLE
Expression analysis of Wild-type and Ccp2-deficient CHILPs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of differentially expressed genes in  Ccp2-deficient CHILPs

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling using Lin-CD127+Flt3-CD25- a4b7 + CHILPs from CCP2 deletion mice or WT littermates. Total RNA from each sample was quantified using the NanoDrop ND-1000. The sample preparation and microarray were performed in accordance with the Affymetrix Mouse Gene2.0 analysis protocol (Affymetrix).
