TITLE
Closing Gaps in the Human Genome with Fosmid Resources Generated from Multiple Individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The published finished human genome contained 340 gaps including 250 gaps in the euchromatic region.  The reasons for these gaps were not fully understood, although subsequent analysis revealed that presence of segmentally duplicated sequences were a good predictor for the presence of gaps.  However, not all segmentally duplicated regions contained gaps.  We made a systemic effort to close euchromatic gaps and understand the nature of gap closing sequences.  Our studies clearly demonstrate that the gap closing sequences analyzed were over 2.3-fold more enriched in segmental duplications and that about 40% of the gap closing sequences were structurally variant.  The structural variant nature of gap closing sequences was verified by aCGH analysis, and by paired-end-sequence and fingerprint analysis of gap spanning clones from recently available human genome fosmid libraries from eight individuals.  Identification and characterization of gap closing sequences provides an effective approach for closing the remaining euchromatic gaps in the human genome. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
