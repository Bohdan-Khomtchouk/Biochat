TITLE
H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 profiles in the undifferentiated male germline

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Using high-throughput sequencing, we probed the H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 landscape in the bam mutant testes which are enriched with earlier stages of male germline.

DESIGN
The H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 profiles of bam- mutant testes were determined.
