TITLE
809094 Biomarker Identification in Fracture Healing (experiment #4068 performed)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The specific genes that distinguish normal fracture healing from abnormal healing or nonunion in humans are unknown. This study was an exploratory investigation of peripheral blood from acutely injured fracture patients collected over multiple days compared to age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Bone fragments were collected from acutely injured subjects during surgery through the Cooperative Human Tissue Network-Eastern Division (CHTN-ED ). We used microarrays to do a global comparison between acutely injured (AI) subjects (AIS) and chronic Nonunion (NU) subjects vs. age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (HV). We also compared tissue types by capturing bone fragments from the fracture site where possible.
