TITLE
Circular RNA profile of acute myeloid leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a widespread class of non-coding RNAs, which drew little attention in the past. Recently, limited data showed their promising future to act as biomarkers in human cancer, but the characteristics and functions remain largely unknown in hematopoietic malignancies, especially in leukemia. In this study, with the help of circRNA microarray, we demonstrated the expression profile of circRNAs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and identified a large number of circRNAs possibly expressed in a leukemia specific manner. We also described a circRNA signature related to AML risk-status based on the bioinformatics prediction.

DESIGN
4 healthy controls and 6 AML patients (3 as better-risk AML and 3 as poor-risk AML) are selected for circular RNA microarray.
