TITLE
Human Monocytes to M-CSF differentiated Macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset was created to study M-CSF dependent in vitro differentiation of human monocytes to macrophages as a model process to demonstrate that independent component analysis (ICA) is a useful tool to support and extend knowledge-based strategies and to identify complex regulatory networks or novel regulatory candidate genes. Keywords: M-CSF, Monocytes, Macrophages
