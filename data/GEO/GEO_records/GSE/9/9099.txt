TITLE
Gene Expression Changes Between 3-Month-Old Epiphycan/Biglycan Double-null and Wildtype Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epiphycan/Biglycan double-null mice develop age-dependant osteoarthritis. This study aims to elucidate the gene expression changes which happen early in the disease (3 Months) in order to identify possible contributors to disease devleopment and progression. Note: CEL files for GSM230344 and GSM230347 are not available Keywords: osteoathritis, SLRP, biglycan, epiphycan
