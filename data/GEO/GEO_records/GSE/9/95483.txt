TITLE
Core Mediator structure at 3.4 A extends transcription initiation complex model

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
2 biological replicates of three S. cerevisiae mediator mutant strains and their parent strain were 4tU labeled. After labeled RNA purification, RNA-seq libraries were produced and sequenced.

DESIGN
Examination of the effect of mediator subunit mutations in S. cerevisiae on global transcription.
