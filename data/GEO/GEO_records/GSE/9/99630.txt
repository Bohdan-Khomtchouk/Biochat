TITLE
The functional enhancer repertoire of human embryonic stem cells [STARR-RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We combined Self-Transcribing Active Regulatory Region Sequencing (STARR-seq) with an enrichment step using chromatin immunoprecipitation in a massively parallel reporter assay. We applied this assay, termed ChIP-STARR-seq, to normal (primed) and naive human embryonic stem cells, building up a comprehensive catalogue of functional enhancers. This database record describes the ChIP-seq component.

DESIGN
For each ChIP-seq library:  STARR-RNA-seq datasets after transfection into primed and/or naive hESCs = 28 datasets total
