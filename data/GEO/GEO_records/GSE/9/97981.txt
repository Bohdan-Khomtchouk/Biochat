TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 and BY4741hsp30Δ cells grown at 30°C and following exposure at 40°C for 30 min.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The Target Of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway is down-regulated in hsp30Δ cells. We compared the gene expression program of hsp30Δ cells with that of its wild type counterpart (BY4741) to identify activities associated with Hsp30.
