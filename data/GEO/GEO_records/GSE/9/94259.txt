Transcriptional dependencies in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a fatal pediatric brain tumor with limited therapeutic options. The majority of cases of DIPG exhibit a mutation in histone 3 (H3K27M) that results in oncogenic transcriptional aberrancies. We show here that DIPG is vulnerable to transcriptional disruption using either bromodomain inhibition or CDK7 blockade. We observe that targeting oncogenic transcription through either of these methods synergizes with HDAC inhibition and that DIPG cells resistant to HDAC inhibitor therapy retain sensitivity to CDK7 blockade. Furthermore, identification of super-enhancers in DIPG provides insights toward the cell of origin, highlighting oligodendroglial lineage genes, and reveals unexpected mechanisms mediating tumor viability and invasion, including potassium channel function and EPH-ephrin signaling. The findings presented here demonstrate transcriptional vulnerabilities of DIPG and elucidate previously unknown mechanisms of DIPG pathobiology.

DESIGN
RNA-seq and ChIP-seq was performed in patient-derived DIPG cell cultures in two replicates. Libraries were sequenced on Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq, 1x75 for RNA-seq and 2x75 for ChIP-seq.
