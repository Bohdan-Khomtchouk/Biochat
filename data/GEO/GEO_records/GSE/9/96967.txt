TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling of wild-type and CCR2-/- CD45RBhigh and CD45RBlow T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Runx1 is expressed in regenerating muscle, specifically in the muscle adult stem cells -- the satellite cells. Its exact role and target genes were yet to be identified. This experiment aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms by which C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) regulates T cell fate in vivo.

DESIGN
We analyzed wt C57BL/6 and CCR2-/- CD45RBhigh and CD45RBlow sorted cells by genome wide expression profiling. The different populations were activated for 2 h at 37C with αCD3/αCD28 antibodies and the different populations were compared.
