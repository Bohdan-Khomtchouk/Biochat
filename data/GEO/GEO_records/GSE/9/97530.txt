TITLE
Aberrantly Expressed Long Non-coding RNAs In CD8+ T Cells Response to Active Tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dysregulated expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been demonstrated as being implicated in a variety of human diseases. In the study we aimed to determine lncRNA profile in CD8+ T cells response to active tuberculosis (TB).

DESIGN
Thirty-four active TB subjects (ATB group) were 18 male and 16 female between 21 and 60 years of age. They were recruited from Weifang No.2 Peopleâ€™s Hospital. The diagnosis of active TB was based on compatible clinical features, together with the presence of the following microbiological evidence: (i) sputum smear positive, (ii) Mtb culture positive, and/or (iii) PCR positive for Mtb from clinical samples. Patients with other co-existing disease, such as diabetes or cancer, were excluded from the study. Gender- and age-matched 35 healthy individuals (Control group) from the staff of Weifang Medical University were also included in the study as controls. Three samples randomly selected from each group  (male/female=1:2,TT1,TT2 and TT3 for ATB group, CT1,CT2 and CT3 for controls) were used for microarray analysis and all of the samples were applied for further RT-qPCR confirmation.
