TITLE
Support for Hemangiosarcoma Mode-of-Action from Studies in Mice with Fenretinide, Troglitazone and Elmiron

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to assess key molecular elements with three compounds of varying potency for hemangiosarcoma-induction.

DESIGN
Mice were dosed with Fenretinide, Troglitazone or Elmiron for 15 and 29 days and Hemangiosarcoma target tissues were profiled.
