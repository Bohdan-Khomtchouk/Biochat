TITLE
Rice cell culture: Control vs. Rapamycin treatment

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To shed light on the TOR signaling network in crop plants, we investigated the global transcriptome changes in rice suspension cells (cultivar Kitaake) treated with the TOR-specific inhibitor rapamycin.

DESIGN
Rapamycin stock solution was prepared in DMSO. Three independent biological repetitions were included in the analysis.
