TITLE
Polymorphism and Regulation of the spxB (Pyruvate Oxidase) Virulence Factor Gene in Streptococcus pneumoniae

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae

SUMMARY
spxB-encoded pyruvate oxidase is a major virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae. During aerobic growth, SpxB synthesizes H2O2 and acetyl phosphate, which play roles in metabolism, signaling, and oxidative stress. We report here the first cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements for spxB transcription. These elements were identified in a genetic screen for spontaneous mutations that caused colonies of strain D39 to change from a semi-transparent to an opaque appearance. Six of the seven opaque colonies recovered (frequency 3x10-5) were impaired for SpxB function or expression. Two mutations changed amino acids in SpxB likely required for cofactor or subunit binding. One mutation defined a cis-acting adjacent direct repeat required for optimal spxB transcription. The other three spontaneous mutations created the same frameshift near the start of the trans-acting spxR regulatory gene. The SpxR protein contains helix-turn-helix, CBS, and HotDog domains implicated in binding DNA, adenosyl compounds, and CoA-containing compounds, respectively, and suggest that SpxR positively regulates spxB transcription in response to energy and metabolic state. Finally, microarray analyses of a spxR mutant demonstrated that SpxR positively regulates the strH exoglycosidase gene, which like spxB, has been implicated in colonization.
