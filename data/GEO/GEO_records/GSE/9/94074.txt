TITLE
Expression data of Hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells after 18h of culture with or without extracellular vesicles secreted by AFT stromal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells from bone marrow have been sorted by FACS (LSK, Lineage -, Sca1 + and cKit +) and co-culture during 18h without cytokines with or without extracellular vesicles (EV) secreted by AFT stromal cells. We used microarray to detail the modification of gene expression level of LSK cells after contact with AFT Evs

DESIGN
3 conditions were analysed for gene expression by microarrays. LSK cells after cell sorting, LSK cells cultured 18h without EV and LSK cells cultured 18h with EVs derived from AFT cells. For each conditions 5 biological replicates have been used
