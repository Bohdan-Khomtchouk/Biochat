TITLE
Resveratrol action on A549 lung cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Resveratrol, a natural phytoestrogen found in red wine and a variety of plants, is reported to have protective effects against lung cancer, however there is very little work directed towards the understanding of the mechanism of action of resveratrol in lung cancer.  In this study we used an experimental approach to understand the biological activity and molecular mechanisms of resveratrol in A549 lung cancer cells. Gene expression profiles were compiled using an oligonucleotide microarray to determine altered expression levels in resveratrol treated cells. Keywords: Genetic modification of A549 cells in response to resveratrol
