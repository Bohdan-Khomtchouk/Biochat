TITLE
Hepatic transcriptomic profiles in zebrafish exposed to surface water with pollution gradients and different industrial discharge

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To assess the impact of surface water across the Hun River, several sampling sites located in the mainstream and the tributary were selected representative of pollution gradient and different pollution source. Male adult zebrafish were exposed to surface water from seven sites for 4 days. The obiectives of the study was to evaluate the ability of transcriptomic profiles exposed to surface water to determine the potential biological effects, to differentiate different pollution source, and to identify the toxic components.

DESIGN
Gene expression in zebrafish liver was measured after 96h exposure to surface water from the Hun River. Pooled liver tissues from five zebrafish were used for total RNA extraction.
