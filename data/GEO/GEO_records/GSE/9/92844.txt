TITLE
Gene expression profiling of mouse brown and white adipose tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of supraclavicular brown, interscapular brown, inguinal white, and epididymal white adipose tissues from C57BL/6 male mice was performed by RNA-sequencing.

DESIGN
Total of 12 RNA samples (3 RNA samples from each adipose tissue type) from adipose tissues were used for RNA-sequencing analysis.
