TITLE
Expression data from a human lung metastatic cell line treated with siPGC1alpha or siControl

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand global expression changes in a knockdown of PGC1alpha (siPGC1alpha) vs control (siControl) in a lung metastatic cell line (4175) Metabolic adaptations play a key role in fuelling tumour growth. However, less is known regarding the metabolic changes that promote cancer progression to metastatic disease. Herein, we reveal that PGC-1a expression and activity are differentially regulated depending on breast cancer metastatic sites. Breast cancer cells that preferentially metastasize to lung display striking upregulation of PGC-1a expression. PGC-1a promotes breast cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and augments lung metastasis in vivo. MDA-MB-231 lung variant (4175) cells were treated with a short interfering RNA (siRNA) for human PGC-1a (PPARG1A) or control siRNA for 48hrs 24 hours post-plating cells.
