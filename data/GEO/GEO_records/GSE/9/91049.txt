TITLE
cDNA microarray analysis comparing transcription levels in the heads of control and hangAE10 mutants of D. melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To identify putative transcripts that might interact with Hang, we performed a cDNA microarray experiment in which we compared transcription levels in the heads of control and hangAE10 mutants. Experimental and control probes were simultaneously hybridized to custom-made glass cDNA microarrays (DGC Drosophila v1 6k array, GEO accession no. GPL22680) that contained 6024 PCR-amplified cDNAs (the DGC 1.0 collection of 5849 non-redundant cDNAs was kindly provided by the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project) and analysed using a GenePix 4000A Microarray Scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Values were further processed as log2-transformed ratios and analysed with Microsoft Excel, Cluster analysis (Eisen et al., 1998), and the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) software package (Tusher et al., 2001). The ratios were filtered to eliminate all values that did not produce signals above background in at least four out of the five replicate experiments. cDNA spots for which the expression between two hybridized samples of RNA with a log2 value > 0.8 differed in at least two experiments were retained for further analysis.

DESIGN
For each of the five replicate experiments, separate hybridization probes were produced from approximately 1000 fly heads. Experimental samples were generated from male hangAE10 flies, while control samples were generated from PZ[+] flies.Following Trizol (Invitrogen Inc.)-based RNA isolation, samples were labelled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores (Amersham Inc.) in a reverse transcription reaction, as described previously (Klebes et al., 2002).
