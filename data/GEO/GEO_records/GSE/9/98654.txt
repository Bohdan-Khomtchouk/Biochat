TITLE
Transcriptional Regulation by NFATc1 in CD8+ T cells [ChiP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) are effector CD8+T cells that eradicate infected and malignant cells from organism. We analyze the role of the transcription factor NFATc1 in activation and cytotoxicity of murine CD8+ T lymphocytes

DESIGN
DNA binding of NFATc1A in CD8+ T cells (derived from the spleen of C57BL/6 mice ) was analyzed by ChIP and deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq
