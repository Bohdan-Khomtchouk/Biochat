TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of MCT8-deficient and healthy control brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and neural cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCT8-deficient, healthy control and mutated/corrected isogenic iPSCs were differentiated into brain microvascular endothelial cells and neural cells. Neural cells were cultured with or without T3.

DESIGN
MCT8-deficient and healthy control iPSCs were differentiated into brain microvascular endothelial cells for 8 days and purified based on metrix preferences then total RNA was extracted. In addition, MCT8-deficient and healthy control mixed neural cells were differentiated in the presence or abscence of T3 for 32 days, then total RNA was extracted.
