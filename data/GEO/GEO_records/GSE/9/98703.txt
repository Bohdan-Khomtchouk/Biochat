Analysis of lung and liver metastases derived from M-Wnt primary tumor. Results provide insight into genes associated with progression of triple negative breast cancer to metastatic disease.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, M-Wnt (control) vs metM-Wnt(lung) or metM-Wnt (liver), M-Wnt 3 replicates, metM-Wnt(lung) 3 replicates, metM-Wnt (liver) 2 replicates
