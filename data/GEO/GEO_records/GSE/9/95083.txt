TITLE
Temporal changes in the rainbow darter (Etheostome caeruleum) liver transcriptome associated with sewage treatment plant upgrades in the Grand River, Ontario

ORGANISM
Etheostoma caeruleum

SUMMARY
In this study, adult male rainbow darter were collected from three sites in the Grand River in the fall season for four consecutive years (2011-2014), from 3 sites: a reference site (US2) located in the non-urbanized area, and two exposure sites (DSW and DSK1) located dowstrem of two secondary wastewater treatment palnts (WWTP) (Waterloo and Kitchener). Kitchener WWTP has been undergone infrastructure upgrades that were initiated in the summer of 2012. The goal of this project was to see whether  the implemented upgrades can be reflected in the liver transcriptome response indicative of recovery.The RNA from male rainbow darter was exctracted from liver tissue and used for further gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
There were 86 samples processed, 6-7 samples per site. Fish were collected in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 dowstream of Waterloo WWTP (DSW) and  Kitchener WWTP (DSK1) representing exposure sites;  US2 males were used as controls and all the comparisons in gene expression were done using fish from this site, using a one way-ANOVA within each year. There was a total of 79 microarrays subjected to bioniformatics analysis (7 arrays did not pass the quality standards).
