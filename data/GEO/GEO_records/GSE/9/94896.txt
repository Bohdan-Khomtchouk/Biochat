TITLE
Expression data from 3 different Reeler mouse models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to determine global expression differences and commanlities in three different Reeler mutant mosue models. Phenotypically mice deficient in Reelin, Dab1 or both Reelin receptors apoEr2 and Vldlr exhibit a severe Reeler phenotype. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression changes occurring in the frontal cortex of three different mouse models which each generate a Reeler phenotype.

DESIGN
Offspring from Reeler +/- matings, Dab1 +/- matings and double heterozygote apoER2 / Vldlr mice were bred and offspring were collected at 21 days after birth.
