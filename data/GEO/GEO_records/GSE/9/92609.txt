TITLE
Mechanisms involved in porcine early embryo survival following ethanol exposure

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We aimed to determine the toxicogenomic impacts and the mechanisms involved in preimplantation embryonic survival following 0.2% ethanol exposure in porcine embryos. Gene expression changes were measured with a porcine embryo specific microarray and confirmed by RT-qPCR. Compared to control, ethanol exposure led to a 43% decrease in blastocyst rate and activated pathways associated with oxidative stress and nervous system damage, such as TP53 and TGF.

DESIGN
4 pools of 10 control porcine blastocysts were compared to 4 pools of 10 ethanol-exposed porcine blastocysts in a microarray experiment.
