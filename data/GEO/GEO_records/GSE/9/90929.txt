TITLE
Transcriptional changes in the primary somatosensory cortex upon sensory deprivation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Experience-dependent plasticity (EDP) is essential for anatomical and functional maturation of sensory circuits during development and can be readily studied is the rodent barrel cortex. Using this model we aimed to uncover changes on the transcriptome level and applied RNA sequencing upon altered sensory experience in juvenile mice in a cortical column and layer specific manner. From column- and layer-specific barrel cortical tissue, high quality RNA was purified and sequenced. The current dataset entails an average of 50 million paired-end reads per sample, 75 base pairs in length.

DESIGN
Wild type mice were deprived of their C-row whiskers from P12 until P23-P24, after which acute brain slices were prepared and tissues were excised from L2/3 and L4 from specific barrel columns. RNA isolated from these tissue sections was then subjected to RNA-sequencing.
