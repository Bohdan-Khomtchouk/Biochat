TITLE
mRNA-Seq profile of gene expression in tip and stalk compartments of ureteric epithelium in developing mouse kidney

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Morphogenesis of cellecting duct system within developing mouse kidney is driven by growth at the tips of ureteric epithelium. To characterize the transcription program within the tip compartment, here we performed mRNA-Seq of tip cells (Wnt11RFP+;Hoxb7+ cells) and stalk cells (Wnt11RFP-;Hoxb7GFP+ cells) obtained from mouse embryonic kidney through FACS. We identified tip-specific genes from these data, and verified with in situ hybridization and followed up with mechanistic study for some of the intersting targets.

DESIGN
Examination of two cell types within the ureteric bud of the developing mouse kidney
