TITLE
Histone acetyltransferase OsGCN5 palys an important role in establishing programs of cell proliferation of crown root meristem

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Shoot-borne crown roots are the major root system in cereals. Previous work has shown that the Wuschel-related homeobox gene WOX11 is necessary and sufficient to promote rice crown root emergence and elongation. Here, we show that WOX11 recruits the ADA2-GCN5 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) module to activate downstream target genes in crown root meristem. OsGCN5 and OsADA2 are highly expressed in root meristem. Knockdown of OsGCN5 and OsADA2 affects crown root initiation and elongation. Here we sought to find the downstream genes of OsGCN5 in rice crown root tip.

DESIGN
Genome-wide analysis of root transcriptome of OsGCN5 RNAi and corresponding wild type.
