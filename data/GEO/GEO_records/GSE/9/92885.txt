TITLE
CHO cells: Serum free adapted cells (Control) vs. Serum adapted cells

ORGANISM
Cricetulus griseus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of CHO-K1 cells comparing to in-house serum-free and suspension adapted CHO-K1 cells in the exponential phase. Goal was to determine the effects of serum on CHO-K1 cells.

DESIGN
Two-conditions experiment: Serum free adapted CHO cells vs. Serum adapted CHO cells. Biological replicates: 4, Technical replicates: 2 (Dye Swap).
