TITLE
Transcription factor NFAT1 regulates systemic autoimmunity through modulation of dendritic cell property

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize the roles of NFAT1 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG) at a genome-wide scale, we performed gene expression microarray analysis for wild-type (WT) and NFAT1 KO bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) with or without 2h and 12h-stimulation with pam3CSK4.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from bone marrow derived dendritic cells of WT and NFAT1 KO with or without pam3CSK4 stimulation
