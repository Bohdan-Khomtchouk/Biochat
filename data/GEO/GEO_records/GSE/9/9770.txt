TITLE
Non-demented individuals with intermediate Alzheimer's neuropathologies - neuronal expression (6 regions)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Layer II stellate neurons (entorhinal cortex) and layer III cortical neurons (hippocampus CA1, middle temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate, superior frontal gyrus, primary visual cortex) were gene expression profiled.  Brain regions are from non-demented individuals with intermediate Alzheimer's disease neuropathologies Keywords: neuronal gene expression profiling
