TITLE
Transcriptome Profiling in KY1005-treated NHP HCT-recipients

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is the most common complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). However, our understanding of the molecular pathways that cause this disease remains incomplete, leading to inadequate treatment strategies. To address this, we measured the gene expression profile of non-human primate (NHP) T cells during acute GVHD.  In this study we specifically interrogated the transcriptional signatures of animals treated with KY1005 monotherapy and KY1005/Sirolimus combination therapy

DESIGN
Series of n=102 arrays taken from animal from the post transplant period including arrays from n=46 untransplanted healthy controls
