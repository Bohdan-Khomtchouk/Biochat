TITLE
Copy Number Analysis of Renal Epithelial Neoplasms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Renal tumors with complex morphology require extensive workup for accurate classification.  Chromosomal aberrations that define subtypes of renal epithelial neoplasms have been reported. We explored if whole-genome chromosome copy number and loss-of-heterozygosity analysis with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays can be used to identify these aberrations. Keywords: Chromosome copy number and LOH analysis with SNP Genotyping Arrays
