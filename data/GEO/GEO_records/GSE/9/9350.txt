TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of pancreatic cancer cell line that differ in metastatic potential

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two pancreatic cancer cell lines with different metastatic and growth potential were compared under hypoxic conditions and under normal atmospheric oxygen pressure. The FG cell lines shows very few metastases and slow growth in mouse xenograft models. L3.6pl, derived from FG by cycles re-implantation of metastatic cells obtained after orthotopic tumor growth in nude mice, shows high motility, aggressive growth and very high metastatic potential By comparison of the two cell lines under different oxygen concentration we tried to simulate in vivo conditions of tumors at different growth stages. Differentially expressed genes and transcription factor regulating coexpressed genes identified by SOTA clustering were used to identify key genes that define metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer cells Keywords: 2+2 factorial design
