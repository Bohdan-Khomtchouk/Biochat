TITLE
Reduced DNA methylation in Arabidopsis allopolyploids induces genome-specific changes in gene expression

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Changes in genome structure and gene expression have been documented in both resynthesized and natural allopolyploids that contain two or more divergent genomes.  The underlying mechanisms for rapid and stochastic changes in gene expression are unknown.  Arabidopsis suecica is a natural allotetraploid derived from the extant species A. thaliana and A. arenosa. Here we report that reduced DNA methylation in met1-RNAi A. suecica lines altered the expression of ~200 genes encoding transposons, centromeric and heterochromatic RNAs, and predicted proteins.  Reduced DNA methylation occurred frequently in promoter regions of the upregulated genes but not of the repressed genes and led to increased mobility of En/Spm-like transposons in met1-RNAi A. suecica lines.  Compared to A. arenosa centromeres, A. thaliana centromeres were hypermethylated, which correlates with higher levels of small RNA accumulation in A. thaliana centromeres than that in A. arenosa centromeres.  Derepression of the genes examined was primarily derived from A. thaliana subgenome, and A. arenosa genes are less affected by methylation defects.  Moreover, non-CG (CC) methylation in the promoter region of A. thaliana At2g23810 was maintained in resynthesized allotetraploids, and the methylation spread within the promoter region in natural A. suecica, leading to silencing of At2g23810, which was demethylated and reactivated in met1-RNAi A. suecica lines.  We suggest that a subset of A. thaliana and A. arenosa genes are differentially methylated in natural allopolyploids, and some A. thaliana genes including centromeres are subjected to transcriptional repression and genome-specific RNA-mediated DNA methylation in Arabidopsis allopolyploids.
