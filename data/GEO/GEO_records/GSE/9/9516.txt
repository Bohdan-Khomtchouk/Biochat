TITLE
A. fumigatus wild type strain transcriptome analysis upon 200 mM CaCl2 treatment.

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
CRZ is a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor activated by calcineurin, a protein phosphatase activated by calcium-calmodulin, in different stress conditions related with calcium cell accumulation. CRZ binds to a specific element on the promoter region of genes called CDRE (calcineurin-dependent response element) shown to be sufficient for calcium- and calcineurin-dependent gene expression. In order to investigate which pathways are involved under calcium stress conditions, we determined the transcriptional profile of A. fumigatus wild type strain. Conidia were incubated at 37Â°C in complete medium for 16 hours and were challenged with 200 mM calcium chloride for 10 minutes. At each time point, the mycelia were harvested by centrifugation and used for competitive microarray hybridizations. We were able to observe a decreased mRNA expression of genes encoding transcription factors and genes that encode GPI anchored proteins, an arrestin domain protein, and a fatty acid synthase beta subunit. In contrast, increased mRNA expression was observed for several genes involved in transcription, development, calcium metabolism, transport, cell cycle and signal transduction mechanisms, and lipid transport and metabolism. Keywords: gene expression array-based (log2 ratio)
