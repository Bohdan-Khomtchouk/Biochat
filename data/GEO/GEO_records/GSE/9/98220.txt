TITLE
Fip1 iCLIP-seq in Hela cells without treatment or treated with NC ASO, snoRD50a ASO

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to compare the Fip1/RNA interaction at transcriptomic level upon snoRD50a knockdown. To this goal, we utilized Fip1 iCLIP-seq protocol in both control and snoRD50a KD hela cells.

DESIGN
Fip1 iCLIP-seq were performed in control and snoRD50a KD hela in Hela cells
