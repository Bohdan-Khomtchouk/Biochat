TITLE
Genes regulated by RANK in the epithelium of Peyer's patches

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment is to identify the molecules which are regulated by epithelial RANK in Peyer's patches.

DESIGN
Epithelial mRNA profiles of Peyer's patches from Vil1-Cre RANK flox/Delta (cKO) mice and RANK flox/Delta (control) mice were generated (n=4).
