TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of hemp bast fibres at different developmental stages

ORGANISM
Cannabis sativa

SUMMARY
Cellulosic phloem fibres, also known as bast fibres, find a wide array of applications in industry, for example as eco-friendly substitutes of glass fibres in the manufacture of biocomposites. Bast fibres are cells characterized by a noteworthy length and by a tertiary cell wall (gelatinous or G-layer) mainly composed of crystalline cellulose. During their differentiation, bast fibres undergo specific developmental stages: the cells initially elongate rapidly by intrusive growth, then they cease elongation and start to thicken. In the light of their importance in fostering a bio-economy, it is desirable to widen our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation and maturation of bast fibres. The goal of the present study is to provide a transcriptomic close-up of the key events accompanying bast fibre development. The stages going from rapid elongation to cell wall thickening are here studied in textile hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), a fibre crop of great economic importance.

DESIGN
Analysis of the fibre transcriptome of hemp plants age 6 weeks. Samples were taken at the TOP, MID (with the snap point) and BOT. Bast fibres were separated using EtOH 80%, a morar and a pestle. The number of biological replicates is four with 13 plants in each replicates.
