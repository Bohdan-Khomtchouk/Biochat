TITLE
Comparison of global gene expression between Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains 383 and 2192

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
At mid-log phase (OD600 of 0.5), unique gene expression patterns were observed between these two strains with 3.4% of the transcripts (188/5570) expressed differentially. Of the 188 significantly varied ( > 1.8 fold) genes, 115 were up-regulated in 383 while 73 were up-regulated in 2192. Keywords: Different strains of bacterium
