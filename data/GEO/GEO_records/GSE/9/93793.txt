TITLE
Characterization of three Epithelial Ovarian Cancer cell lines resistant to cisplatin (mRNA).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) represents the gynecologic cancer with the highest mortality rate. Despite a high initial response to chemotherapy, the majority of patients with advanced EOC relapses and subsequently develops chemoresistance that results in treatment failure and death of the patient. AIM: we have generated an isogenic model of PT-resistance in a panel of 3 EOC cell lines. Gene Expression Profile (GEP) was used to identify new molecular pathawy that regulate chemoresistance.

DESIGN
GEP experiments were performed in 3 Epithelian Ovarian Cancer cell lines Platinum-resistant vs their parental, with Agilent platform. Bioinformatics analyses were performed by Gene Springs
