Differentially expressed lncRNAs in placentas from patients with late-onset preeclampsia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify lncRNA expression in placentas from patients with late-onset preeclampsia (LOPE), we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify differential expression of lncRNAs in placental samples from LOPE patients and normal controls. For microarray analysis, 8 randomly and blindly selected placental samples from LOPE patients and matched controls (4 samples per group) were used to extract total RNA. The expression profiles of the placental lncRNAs were detected using the Agilent Human lncRNA Microarray V4.0(OE Biotech, Shanghai, China). The threshold for a dysregulated lncRNA was set as a fold-change (FC) value of 2.0 or greater. A totle of 163 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified.  Expression of nine lncRNAs (NONHSAT145880, ENST00000587240, NONHSAT116812, NONHSAT104536, FR339600, NONHSAG018907, TCONS_l2_00014782, NONHSAT134432 and NONHSAG024318) from this microarray was quantified n placental tissues from the LOPE patients (n = 40) and controls (n = 35) delivered by caesarean section by real-time PCR, confirming low variability between the qRT-PCR results and the microarray data.

DESIGN
LOPE patients (n = 40) and controls (n = 35) delivered by caesarean section. For each sample, the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) was greater than or equal to 7, the value of 28S/18S was greater than or equal to 0.7, and the total RNA can meet 2 or more than 2 experiments.
