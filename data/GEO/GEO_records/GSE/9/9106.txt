TITLE
Gene Expression Signature in Peripheral Blood Detects Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study identified informative gene expression signatures in peripheral blood cells that can characterize TAA status and subtypes of TAA. Moreover, a 41-gene classifier based on expression signature can identify TAA patients with high accuracy. The transcriptional programs in peripheral blood leading to the identification of these markers also provide insights into the mechanism of development of aortic aneurysms, and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The classifier genes identified in this study and validated by TaqManÂ® real-time PCR assays define a set of promising potential diagnostic markers, setting the stage for a blood-based gene expression test to facilitate early detection of TAA.
