TITLE
Expression studies of HMEC exposed to lactic acidosis and hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human Mammalian Epithelial Cells (HMEC) were exposed to different environmental stresses, including hypoxia, lactic acidosis, the combination of hypoxia and lactic acidosis, lactosis , as well as acidosis. We used microarrays to examine the genomic programs of cells incubated under different microenvironments. Keywords: different environmental stresses
