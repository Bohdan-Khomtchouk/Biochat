SUMMARY
Mesangial cells (MC) respond to various insults, such as hyperglycemia, with expressive phenotypic changes. Modifications in the patterns of MC proliferation, death, and the balance between matrix production and degradation affect directly glomerular function and ultimately lead to glomerulosclerosis. MC activation by growth factors (GF) has been demonstrated to be a trigger to changes in cell phenotype, and blockade of specific systems tend to attenuate glomerular damage. The identification of elements activated following GF stimulation of MC may facilitate the comprehension of the pathophysiology of glomerular diseases. By means of DNA microarray technology we identified that three inhibitors of DNA binding (ID1, ID3, and ID4) were among the most significantly regulated genes in serum-treated MC. We extended these studies and demonstrated that ID gene mRNA expression is markedly and rapidly affected by the pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF-beta1. Of interest, bone-morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members of the TGF-beta superfamily with anti-fibrotic effects, also enhanced the expression of ID genes. Additional experiments indicate that these genes, classically described as dominant negative inhibitors of E-proteins, are regulated by TGF-beta1 and BMPs through distinct pathways and may act as immediate-early genes. Our results suggest that ID genes may play an active role in MC fate determination through undefined mechanisms. Keywords: comparative gene regulation by serum treatment
