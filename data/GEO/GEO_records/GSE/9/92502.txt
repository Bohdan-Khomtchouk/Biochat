TITLE
Liver transcriptomic response to fasting, high glucose or a high fructose challenges in wild-type C57Bl/6J male mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays experiment was performed to detail the global programme of gene expression in liver of WT male mice in response to fasting (for 24h) or challenged with high glucose or high fructose compared to mice fed ad libitum.

DESIGN
Eight week-old male mice from C57B/l6 genetic background (Charles River) were fed a chow diet ad libitum with or without 20% Glucose or Fructose for 24 hours in drinking tap water or fasted for 24 hours and sacrified at ZT16. There are 24 samples, each from an individual mouse (n=6 animals/group).
