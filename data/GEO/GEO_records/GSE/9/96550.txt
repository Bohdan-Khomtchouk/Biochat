TITLE
Differential host gene responses from infection with neurovirulent and partially-neurovirulent strains of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Kinetics of the differential gene expression between a virulent and a partially-virulent strain of VEEV in mouse brain and spleen was evaluated by using whole genome microarray.

DESIGN
Comparison between infection with 2 strains of VEEV at 3 different time points post infection in spleen and brain tissue samples. All infected samples compared with uninfected spleen and brain samples. 3 biological replicates for each condition were used.
