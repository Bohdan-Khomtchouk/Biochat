TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of the effects of BCL6-inhibiting and BCL6-degrading compounds in lymphoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment is to measure the changes in gene expression induced by small molecules that either inhibit the interaction of the transcription factor BCL6 with co-repressor proteins, or that induce degradation of BCL6, in lymphoma cell lines.

DESIGN
Treatment of various cell lines with saturating amounts of BCL6-inhibitors/degraders for 24 and 168 hours.
