TITLE
rAAVr3.45-IL10 infected human neural stem cells(hNSCs) gene expression analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The safety and efficacy(IL10 expression level) of a recombinant adeno-associated virus derivative (rAAVr3.45) were examined to evaluate its potential as a gene carrier for preparing interleukin-10 (IL10)-secreting human neural stem cells (HFT13) that can treat ischemic injuries or neurodegenerative diseases.

DESIGN
Two samples were prepared; One for control group (normal human neural stem cells) and the other for experimental group (human neural stem cells infected by AAV r3.45 IL10)
