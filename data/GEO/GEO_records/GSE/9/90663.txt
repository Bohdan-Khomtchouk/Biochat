TITLE
ChIP-Seq of constitutively expressed Ndt80-Myc in P. pastoris

ORGANISM
Komagataella pastoris

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to identify the genes bound by Ndt80 in P. pastoris when constitutively expressed. Ndt80 was tagged with c-myc, the native Ndt80 promoter was replaced with the E. gossypii Tef1 promoter and the protein was immunoprecipitated with a c-myc antibody.  Cells were grown unti log-phase in YPD.  Each experiment was repeated twice and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.

DESIGN
P. pastoris Ndt80-myc vs. untagged control, with two technical replicates for each
