TITLE
Expression data from ancestrally diverse group of prostate cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
African American men are disproportionately affected by both vitamin D deficiency and increased risk of prostate cancer. We used microarrays to quantify gene expression of vitamin D-related genes in the benign epithelium in a diverse group of radical prostatectomy patients

DESIGN
The benign epithelium from a cross-sectional group of African American and Caucasian prostate cancer patients was collected by laser capture microdissection. Vitamin D-related genes were quantified by microarray Grant: Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program Idea Award for Disparities Research PC121923 (W81XWH-13-1-0252) PI Nonn
