TITLE
Detection of Y chromosome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PCR based detection of Y-chromosome compared against results obtained by CGH microarrrays in Preimplantation Genetic Screening

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: subjects classified by PCR results as male (y-chromosome present) or female (y-chromosome absent). Biological replicates: 10 male, 11 female. Please note that the row counts for the raw data files vary from 1,755 to 2,888. Even with the standard protocol according Illumina's 24sure instructions for the microarrays, each run generates a set of analyzed probes that varies from sample to sample. However all the different combinations represent a uniform sampling of the genome.
