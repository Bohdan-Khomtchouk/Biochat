TITLE
Knock-down of Ror1 in MDA-MB-231 cell line decreases cell invasiveness

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq profiling of triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cell line with know-down of non-canonical WNT signaling receptor Ror1. The MDA-MB231 cells were either transfected with a non-sense control shRNA (shCTL) or with a ROR1 shRNA (shROR1) construct. The objective was to find expression-responsive targets of these perturbations as potential drivers of MDA-MB231 cell invasiveness.

DESIGN
Two conditions of  MDA-MB-231 cells each in 3 replicates:  1. non-sense control shRNA (shCTL),  2. ROR1 shRNA (shROR1)
