TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in neurosphere cells and breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the validation of a new epigenetic profiling technique for high-throughput profiling of histone modifications, targeted chromatin ligation (TCL), applicable to low cell numbers, that produces data comparable to ChIP.

DESIGN
Examination of four different histone marks using two cell types
