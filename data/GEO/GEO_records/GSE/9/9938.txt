TITLE
Identification of Campylobacter jejuni genes involved in the response to stomach transit

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Campylobacter jejuni causes food- and water-borne gastroenteritis, and as such must survive passage through the stomach in order to reach the gastrointestinal tract. While little is known about how C. jejuni survives transit through the stomach, its low infectious dose suggests it is well equipped to sense and respond to acid shock. In this study, the transcriptional profile of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 was obtained after exposure to in  in vivo (piglet stomach) acid shock. Keywords: acid shock; in vivo study; transit through the host stomach
