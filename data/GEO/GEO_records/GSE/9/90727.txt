TITLE
Cathelicidin-deficient mice exhibit increased survival and upregulation of key inflammatory response genes following cecal ligation and puncture

SUMMARY
Antimicrobial peptides possess a myriad of molecular properties including bacterial killing and the regulation of many aspects of innate immunity. Cathelicidins are a group of antimicrobial peptides widely investigated by the scientific community. Many studies have focused on the bactericidal and pro-inflammatory roles of cathelicidins. Because the role of endogenous cathelicidin expression remains obscure in deep-seated systemic infections, we induced sepsis in cathelicidin knockout and wild-type (WT) mice by cecal ligation and puncture, performing transcriptome screening by DNA microarray in conjunction with other immunologic assays. Cathelicidin-deficient mice showed increased survival compared to WT mice in this established experimental model of polymicrobial sepsis, in association with upregulation of certain key inflammatory response genes. Therefore, cathelicidins can exert both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities depending on the disease and cellular context.

DESIGN
We induced sepsis in cathelicidin-deficient mice, using the cecal ligation and puncture model (CLP), and compared their mortality and gene expression patterns to wild-type controls.
