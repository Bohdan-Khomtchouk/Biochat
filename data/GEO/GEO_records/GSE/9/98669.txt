TITLE
Methyl-Spec-seq control data sets

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We developed a novel in-vitro experimental method to characterize the protein-DNA interaction specificity and methylation sensitivity, we called Methyl-Spec-seq. In this data set, mouse AP1 was used as a positive control example to show that Methyl-Spec-seq can determine the relative binding energy for variants with different methylation property, i.e., unmethylated, top hemimethylated, bottom hemimethylated, duplex methylated by either chemical synthesis or enzymatic treatment.

DESIGN
Except different methylation types of DNA, the overall design is the same as conventional Spec-seq, which we have published work before.
