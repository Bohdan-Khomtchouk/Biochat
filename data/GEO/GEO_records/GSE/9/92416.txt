TITLE
The Role of a Non-Canonical Splice Variant of the Helios Gene in the Differentiation of Jurkat T Lymphoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, the ectopic overexpressions of the wild-type Helios-1, non-canonical short isoforms Helios-Δ190-1186, Helios-Δ326-1431, and control in the Jurkat cells were utilized as the routine in vitro model of the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We compared the microarray data for transcriptional analysis of the Jurkat cells with stable overexpression of full-length Helios-1, non-canonical short isoforms Helios-Δ190-1186, Helios-Δ326-1431, and mock transfected control.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed on Jurkat cells stably expressing Helios-1, as well as short variants Helios-Δ190-1186 and Helios-Δ326-1431.
