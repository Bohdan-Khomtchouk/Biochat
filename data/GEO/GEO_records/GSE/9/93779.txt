Microarray profiling of lncRNA expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs that are over 200 nucleotides in length. In the past years, those molecules have emerged as important components of the epigenetic regulatory network to influence transcription as well as other nuclear activities, and their dysregulation underlies several pathologic states including cancer. To determine which lncRNA participates in the interaction between FOXN3 and SIN3A, we performed a comparative analysis of the expression profiles of lncRNAs in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells using lncRNA microarrays.

DESIGN
Total  RNAs containing non-coding RNAs were extracted  from  MCF-7  cells  and  MDA-MB-231  cells  with  Trizol  Reagent  (Life  Technology) for reverse  transcription  in  the  presence  of   Cy3-dCTP  (GE  Healthcare).  Amplified/Cy3-labeled  cDNAs  were  hybridized  onto   oligonucleotide  microarrays  containing  40,916  probes of  lncRNAs  (CapitalBio  Human   lncRNA 4.0 Array).
