TITLE
Genomic dissection of conserved transcriptional regulation in intestinal epithelial cells [Stickleback]

ORGANISM
Gasterosteus aculeatus

SUMMARY
We profiled genome-wide accesssible chromatin data and RNA-seq from four species (zebrafish, stickleback, mouse, and human) to identify commonly regulated genes and regulatory metods in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).  We identify a group genes that are commonly expressed in IECs and genes that are commonly expressed along the length of the intestine in fish and mammals.  Using accessible chromatin data we identified enriched transcription factor binding site motifs In IECs and sites that are commonly accessible in IECs in all species.  Finally, we confirm the ability for these regions from multiple species to drive conserved expression in IECs using a zebrafish reporter assay.

DESIGN
Examination of expression levels and chromatin accessibility in intestinal epithelaial cells in stickleback
