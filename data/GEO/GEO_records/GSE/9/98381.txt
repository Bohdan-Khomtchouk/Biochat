TITLE
Genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) analysis in fission yeast.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The dynamic nature of genome organization impacts critical nuclear functions including the  regulation of gene expression, replication and DNA damage repair. Despite significant progress,  the mechanisms responsible for reorganization of the genome in response to cellular stress, such as  aberrant DNA replication, are poorly understood. Here we show that fission yeast cells carrying a  mutation in the DNA binding protein Sap1 show defects in DNA replication progression and  genome stability, and display extensive changes in genome organization.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of Hi-C experiments were done in sap1-1.
