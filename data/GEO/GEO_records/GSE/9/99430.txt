TITLE
Small RNA sequencing: EVs and the producing cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the high-throughput profiling of small RNA in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their producing mammalian cells using Illumina small RNA sequencing platform. By obtaining over 2190 miRNA expression from 18 samples, the miRNA profile in EVs and their producing cells were compared. Results provide insight into gene profile difference between EV loading and the producing cells.

DESIGN
Profile of small RNA expression in EVs and the producing cells with small RNA sequencing method.
