TITLE
Replication maps of developing C. elegans embryos.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Okazaki fragments were purified and sequenced from C. elegans embryos at various stages of development. The sequencing data was used to map the positions and efficiencies of replication origins.

DESIGN
To map the positions of replication origins in C. elegans embryos.
