TITLE
Genome-wide binding profiles of nuclear FGFR1 in Control and Schizophrenia hiPSC-dervied NPC [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the genome-wide binding patterns of nuclear FGFR1 in Control and Schizophrenia hiPSC-dervied NPC differntiated in neuronal media for two days.  We also report the genome-wide binding patterns of NOTCH in schizophrenia hiPSC-dervied NPC differntiated in neuronal media for 2 days

DESIGN
Examination of nuclear FGFR1 binding in control and schizophrenia states.  Examination of NOTCH binding in schizophrenia state
