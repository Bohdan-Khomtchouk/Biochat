TITLE
Transcriptomic profile of circulating naïve, TCM, TEM and TEMRA T cells in donors from Sri Lanka previously exposed to dengue virus and healthy controls from San Diego [Cohort 2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dengue virus is responsible for 400 million human infections each year . The characterization of exact molecular components of immune response associated may help design more effective therapeutic interventions. In this study, we aimed to characterize the immune signature of  T cells subtypes associated with previous exposure to dengue virus. Transcriptomic profiling using RNA sequencing was performed on naive, TCM, TEM and TEMRA CD4 T cells isolated from individuals with secondary dengue infections from Sri Lanka, an endemic area, as well as from dengue negative healthy controls.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing of sorted CD4 naïve, TCM, TEM and TEMRA T cells from cryopreserved PBMC of 5 subjects with secondary infection infection and 6 dengue virus negative healthy controls.
