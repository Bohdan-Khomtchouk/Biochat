TITLE
Human Yes Associated Protein (hYAP) expressing mouse liver (set 1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To check the gene expression profiles on hYAP Wild-type (WT), active-form (5SA) or inactive-form (5SA/TEAD*) expressing mouse liver

DESIGN
We analysed gene expression profiles in livers of mice expressing YAP (WT), YAP (5SA) or YAP (5SA/TEAD*) at 2 days after Hydrodynamic gene delivery.
