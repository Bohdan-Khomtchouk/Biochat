TITLE
The impact of Tcf1/Lef1 deficiency and prostagladin E (PGE) treatment on leukemic stem cell (LSC) transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of trasncriptome bewteen control LSCs and Tcf1/Lef1 deficient LSCs, LSCs treated with DMSO, PGE1 or PGE2.

DESIGN
Lineage negative BM cells were isolated from control or Tcf1/Lef1-deficient mice, and retrovirally transduced with p210-BCR-ABL retrovirus twice (at 24 hr interval), and 48 hrs after isolation, Lin-c-Kit+ Sca1+GFP+ cells were sorted as LSCs. The LSCs established from control BM cells were treated with DMSO, 20µM PGE1 or 20 µM PGE2 for 6 hrs.
