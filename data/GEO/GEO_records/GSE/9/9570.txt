TITLE
Expression data from embryonic rat kidney timepoints and a budded WD-MM recombination tissue

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Here we compared the expression of an engineered kidney tissue, created by recombining an in vitro budded Wolffian duct with fresh E13 metanephric mesenchyme, with that of three in vivo rat embryonic kidney timepoints (E13, E18, and week 4) Keywords: time course
