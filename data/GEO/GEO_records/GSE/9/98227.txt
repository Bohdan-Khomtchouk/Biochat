TITLE
T. gondii Genome Wide CRISPR Screen for Fitness-Conferring Genes

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
We provide examples of the next-generation sequencing results obtained after analyzing sgRNAs (single guide RNAs) isolated from an input library and from parasites three passages after transfection.

DESIGN
sgRNAs were isolated from parasites that had been passaged in human foreskin fibroblasts three times after transfecting the sgRNA library. The abundances of the sgRNAs can be compared to those in the input library (also provided). sgRNAs that are lost over time are presumed to cleave genes that confer fitness.
