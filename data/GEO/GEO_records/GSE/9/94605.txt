TITLE
Profiling of circulating microRNAs in patients with unstable angina pectoris

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled miRNA expression in the plasma from healthy subjects and patients with unstable angina pectoris to obtain differentially expressed plasma miRNAs. We randomly selected 25 samples from each group and combined into a sample pool. In this way we obtained 7 and 6 sample pools in control group and case group, respectively. miRNA levels in the plasma were detected with miRCURY LNATM microRNA Array, 6th gen -hsa, mmu & rno.

DESIGN
175 healthy subjects and 150 patients with unstable angina pectoris were enrolled in this study. We obtained 13 sample pools through randomly selected mixture of 25 plasma samples from each group into a sample pool.Total RNA was isolated from 0.2 mL pooled plasma sample for microarray detection.
