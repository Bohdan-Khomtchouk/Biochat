TITLE
Refractory testicular germ cell tumors are highly sensitive to the second generation DNA methlation inhibitor guadecitabine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression in cisplatin resistant testicular germ cell tumor xenografts treated with vehicle (PBS) or the DNA methylation inhibitor guadecitabine

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from flank xenograft tumors treated once per day for 4 days with 1.5 mg/kg guadecitabine or PBS.  Drug was subcutaneous injection.  Both control and guadecitabine treatments were in biological triplicates.
