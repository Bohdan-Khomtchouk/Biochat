TITLE
The genomic distribution of G9a, H3K9me2 and H3K27me3  in cardiac hypertrophy.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of the histone methyltrasferase G9a (also known as Ehmt2) in the normal heart has not been studied extensively. To identify which  genes were direct targets of G9a  in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes,  we performed ChIP-seq for G9a and H3K9me2 – the main histone methylation catalysed by the HMT – on cardiomyocytes isolated from normal mice (sham) and mice subject to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) for 1 wk, a surgical procedure that causes cardiac hypertrophy following the induction of pressure overload.  We considered the best G9a-bound genomic regions as those in which G9a and H3K9me2 peaks overlapped. Since G9a contributes to trimethylation of H3K27 at a set of developmental genes through its interaction with PRC2,  we also evaluated whether G9a had an effect on the distribution of this histone mark in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. To this end, we performed ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 in CMs isolated from sham and TAC mice.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for G9a, H3K9me2, H3K27me3 carried-out with cardiomyocyte-enriched populations isolated from mice subiect subject to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) for 1 wk  . Two biological replicates were profiled for each antibody type.
