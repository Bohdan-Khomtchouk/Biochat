TITLE
Transcriptomic (RNAseq) analysis of reovirus-induced host responses in mesenteric lymph node of interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNabR) knockout and WT mouse.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of reovirus-induced host responses at the level of gene expression. Results provide insights into how reovirus infection breaks tolerance to dietary antigens and promotes the development of celiac disease.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from mesenteric lymph node from WT and IFNabR KO mouse, and subjected to 48 hours stimulation with Reoviruses T1L or T3D-RV compared to Sham.
