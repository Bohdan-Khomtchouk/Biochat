TITLE
Expression profile of small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) in human acute myeloid leukemia with different leukemia stem cell frequency

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Leukemogenesis requires enhanced self-renewal activity, which is induced by specific oncogenes. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We measured snoRNA expression in human primary AML samples that contained determined leukemia stem cells frequency. We identified that expression of C/D box snoRNAs was closely associated with leukemia stem cell frequency.

DESIGN
We used small RNA-Seq to determine the expression profile of small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) in 20 primary AML patient samples with determined leukemia stem cell frequency (n=4 samples with high frequency, n=6 with medium and n=10 with low frequency).  Stem cell frequency and further sample information can be obtained from the following publication: Pabst, C. et al. GPR56 identifies primary human acute myeloid leukemia cells with high repopulating potential in vivo. Blood (2016). doi:10.1182/blood-2015-11-683649
