TITLE
Clock-controlled diurnal gene expression changes on a genome-wide scale

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au14-07_clock - llhh clock transcriptome - Correlate clock-controlled diurnal gene expression changes with H2Bub chromatin mark changes on a genome-wide scale. - Wild type seedlings(Col-0)have been grown under Light/Dark conditions(12 h Light:12 h Dark)and thermocycles(23°C day:19°C night).After 10 days of entrainment, the conditions were switched to continuous light and temperature (LLHH) for 2 days. Seedlings have been harvested the 2nd day after the switch at Zeitgeber time 24 and 36 that correspond to dawn and dusk, respectively. llhh clock transcriptome-LLHH clock transcriptome.

DESIGN
3 dye-swap - time course
