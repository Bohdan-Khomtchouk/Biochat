TITLE
Î±-ketoglutarate orchestrates macrophage activation through metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We conducted gene expression analysis of naive and polarized macrophages from wild type C57BL6/J mice. In this project, we also compared how glutamine deprivation and production of alpha-ketoglutarate during LPS priming affects gene expression profiles in bone marrow-derived macrophages.

DESIGN
Find unbiased transcriptomic changes affected by glutamine metabolism in endotoxin tolerant macrophage
