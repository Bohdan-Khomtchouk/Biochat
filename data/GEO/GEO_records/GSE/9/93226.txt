TITLE
Transcriptomic profiles of human foreskin fibroblast cells in response to orf virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using RNA sequencing technology, we compared speciﬁc changes in the transcriptomic proﬁles in human foreskin fibroblast cells (HFF-1) following ORFV infection. ORFV speciﬁcally upregulated and downregulated a variety of genes, including genes involved in antiviral immune response, apoptosis, cell cycle and a series of signaling pathways, such as the IFN and p53-signaling pathways. A range of genes were downregulated at early stage. In contrast, the virus up-regulates a number of cellular genes at late stage.

DESIGN
HFF-1 mRNA profiles of 0, 3, and 8 hours post infection with orf virus were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq2500.
