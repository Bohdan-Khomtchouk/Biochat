TITLE
Analysis of microRNA expression profiles in clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma compared to normal adjacent tissue.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma (CCPRCC) is a low-grade renal neoplasm with morphological characteristics mimicking both clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) and papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC). However, despite some overlapping features, their morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular profiles are distinct. To better understand the biology of this tumor, we analyze the miRNA expression profiles of a set of CCPRCC by microarrays.

DESIGN
We analyze the miRNA expression profiles of clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma (CCPRCC) compared to matched normal renal parenchyma using microarray. We further compare CCPRCC with other RCC histologic subtypes using publicly available datasets, identifying common and distinctive microRNA signatures along with the associated signaling pathways and biological processes.
