TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis in C. merolae

ORGANISM
Cyanidioschyzon merolae strain 10D

SUMMARY
RNA-seq experiment in wildtype Cyanidioschyzon merolae cultures. The aim of the experiment was the comparison of the transcriptomic activity with H3K27me3 profile. The results revealed a negative correlation between expression and H3K27me3 occupancy. The experiment contains 3 biological replicates.

DESIGN
RNA isolation, reverse-transcription, cDNA library generation and Illumina sequencing.
