TITLE
XVE AMY3C-EY induction in SAM

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To study the molecular basis for chlorotic and reticulate phenotypes, we took advantage of a time course experiment on XVE AMY3C-EY plants designed for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Twenty μM 17-β-estradiol was applied on meristems of  plants for this experiment, and plants were harvested at 1, 3, 6 hr after treatment. Plants without treatment were regarded as samples of treatment for 0 hr. Besides the time course experiment, treatment of 17-β-estradiol on XVE single transformant SAM was served as a negative control. Samples from thirty plants were collected to extract RNA for further analysis of microarray.
