TITLE
Kmt2a and Kmt2b Control Memory Function via Different Transcriptional Programs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have analyzed changes in histone 3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) and gene expression resulting either from Kmt2a or Kmt2b knockdown in adult hippocampal CA neurons in mice. We implemented Cre/loxP-mediated conditional knockout strategy in order to knockdown either of these histone methyltransferases in excitatory forebrain neurons in adult mice.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 levels, and gene expression in hippocampal CA neurons of of adult Kmt2a cKO and Kmt2b cKO mice.
