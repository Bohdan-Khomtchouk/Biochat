TITLE
Abnormal Expression Changes in AML

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common and deadly forms of hematopoietic malignancies.  We hypothesized that microarray studies could identify previously unrecognized expression changes that only occur only in AML blasts. We were particularly interested in those genes with increased expression in AML, believing that these genes may be potential therapeutic targets. Keywords: AML vs Normal hematopoietic cells
