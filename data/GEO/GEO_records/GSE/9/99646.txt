TITLE
RNASeq to identify the in vivo mechanism of anti-Ox40 mAb treatment exacerbated lupus in NZB/W F1 Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We've recently shown that we can accelerate disease in a model of SLE (the NZB/W F1 model) using an anti-Ox40 mAb treatment regimen. The disease acceleration is rapid (within 2 weeks) but its unclear, mechanistically, how OX40 functions to promote disease. To that end we want to perform RNASeq on the sorted OX40-expressing CD4 T cells during treatment to understand how they function in response to OX40 signaling in vivo

DESIGN
RNASeq was performed on FACS sorted CD4 T cells from the spleen and kidney of NZB/W F1 lupus mice following anti-Ox40 agonist mAb treatment and disease acceleration
