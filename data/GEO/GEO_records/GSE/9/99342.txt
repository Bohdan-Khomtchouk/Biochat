TITLE
microRNA data involved in Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) albinism

ORGANISM
Paralichthys olivaceus

SUMMARY
In this study, a high-throughput sequencing strategy was employed to identify the miRNAs involved in P. olivaceus albinism. High-throughput miRNA sequencing identified a total of 475 miRNAs, including 64 novel miRNAs. Furthermore, 33 differentially expressed miRNAs containing 13 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated miRNAs were identified in albino versus normally pigmented individuals (fold change ≥1.5 or ≤0.67 and p≤0.05).

DESIGN
Examination of the ocular side skin of wild type and albinism Paralichtys olivaceus
