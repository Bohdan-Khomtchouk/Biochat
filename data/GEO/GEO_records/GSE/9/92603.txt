TITLE
HFF Cells: Control vs. Toxoplasma gondii infected

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profile microarray of human foreskin fibroblast cell comparing control untreated HFF cell with HFF cell infected with ME49 strain.Study on Toxoplasma gondii infection of HFF cell LncRNAs expression, for further studies on the differential exprssion of LncRNAs in HFF cell against the infection of Toxoplasma gondii research provide the basic function.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, HFF cell vs Toxoplasma gondii infected HFFcell. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 infected replicates.
