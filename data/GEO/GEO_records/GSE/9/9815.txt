TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes in human bronchial cells(BEAS-2B) treated MTX

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methotrexate (MTX) has been widely used for the treatment of a variety of tumors as well as for inflammatory diseases and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). MTX-induced toxicity has been a serious unpredictable side effect of the treatment and an important clinical problem. Possible causes include allergic, cytotoxic or immunologic reactions to this agent. We examined the consequences of the mechanism of MTX-induced pulmonary toxicity gene expression in BEAS-2B cells, huma bronchial cell line, by microarray.  The expression of these genes are potential biomarker of methotrexate-induced pulmonary toxicity. Also, We provide a clue about mechanism of pulmonary toxic action by these clinical chemotherapeutic agents. Keywords: 48h treatment, 0.144uM (dose), MTX
