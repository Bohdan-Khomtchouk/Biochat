TITLE
Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Mouse Neurogenesis by Pumilio Proteins [RIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we employ crosslinking immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) to reveal Pum1 and Pum2 binding mRNAs

DESIGN
To unravel the molecular mechanisms mediated by Pum1 and Pum2, we performed individualÂ nucleotide resolution crosslinking immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) to identify Pum1 and Pum2 target RNAs and to delineate the Pum binding sites at the single nucleotide resolution. We used neonatal wildtype brains for Pum1 iCLIP and Pum2 iCLIP, with neonatal brains from Pum1 global knockout (P1KO) and Pum2 global knockout (P2KO) mice, as the negative controls, respectively. Two biological duplicates were carried out for each condition.
