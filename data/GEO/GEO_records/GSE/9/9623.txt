TITLE
Profiling the asexual development transcriptome of the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans

ORGANISM
Phytophthora infestans

SUMMARY
Much of the pathogenic success of Phytophthora infestans, the potato and tomato late blight agent, relies on its ability to generate from mycelia large amounts of sporangia, which release zoospores that encyst and form infection structures. To better understand these critical stages, Affymetrix GeneChips based on 15,650 unigenes were designed and used to profile the life cycle, through an analysis of RNA from hyphae, sporangia, cleaving sporangia, motile zoospores, and germinated zoospore cysts. Keywords: Developmental study
