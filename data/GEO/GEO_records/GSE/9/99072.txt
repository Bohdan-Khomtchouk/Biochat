TITLE
KMT1A (SUV39H1) prevents somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) mediated reprogramming

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
KMT1A (also known as SUV39H1)was involved in improving reprogramming efficiency during inducing pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). However, the knowledge about KMT1A regulating somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) mediated reprogramming was limited. To understand the role of KMT1A during SCNT embryos in vitro development; we performed based transcriptome profiling in SCNT embryos at 8-cell stages and KMT1A knockdown 8-cell SCNT embryos. The data show the mRNAs regulated after KMT1A was down-regulated.

DESIGN
Here we perform transcriptome profiling in SCNT embryos at 8-cell stages and KMT1A knockdown 8-cell SCNT embryos with duplicates.
