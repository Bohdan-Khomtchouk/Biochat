TITLE
Expression profiling of grass-clump dwarf in syntheitic hexaploids from triploid hybrids crossed between tetraploid wheat and Aegilops umbellulata.

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes to alter the transcript accumulation levels in a grass-clump dwarf line, which is a synthetic hexaploid line from triploid hybrids crossed between tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum cv. Langdon) and a diploid wheat relative Aegilops umbellulata (KU-4052). Up-regulation of metabolic and catabolic processes-related genes for cell wall-associated molecules was observed, and down-regulation of wheat APETALA1-like MADS-box genes, considered to act as flowering promoters, was found in the grass-clump dwarf line. Unusual expression of the branching-related SPLs and flowering time regulation-related MADS-box genes could explain the grass-clump dwarf phenotype.

DESIGN
Expression patterns were compared between the two synthetic hexaploid lines showing the wild-type phenotype (as a reference) and grass-clump dwarf. Total RNA samples were isolated from crown tissues of the plants grown at 24Â°C under long day (18-h light and 6-h dark) condition for 50 days. Two independent experiments were conducted in each exprement.
