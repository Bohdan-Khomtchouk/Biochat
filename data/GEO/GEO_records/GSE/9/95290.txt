TITLE
Mantle cell lymphoma gene expression profiling array WEHA.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset contains 12 Illumina array spots with a samples of interest from the 12 spot array Illumina HumanHT-12. The following samples was analyzed, all samples were sorted using CD19-microbeads (Miltenyi): -patient´s primary lymphoma cells obtained from malignant ascites (P2-A1, P2-A2) -patient´s non-malignant B-cells, CD19-sorted (CTRL1, CTRL2) -lymphoma cell line designated UPF4D established from the patient´s primary lymphoma cells 15 and 75 days from ex vivo culture (UPF4D-D15A, UPF4D-D15B, UPF4D-D75) -UPF4D cells isolated ex vivo from infiltrated murine kidney (UPF4D-K) and from subcutaneously growing murine xenograft (UPF4D-SC) -patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells designated WEHA established by xenotransplantation of primary lymphoma cells into immunodeficient mice isolated from the infiltrated murine kidneys (WEHA-K1, 2) and from subcutaneously growing xenograft (WEHA-SC). For xenotransplantation, NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice (referred to as NSG mice) were used.

DESIGN
Unsummarized data can be obtained from package using data(WEHA) command.
