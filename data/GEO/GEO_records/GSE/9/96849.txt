TITLE
SAGA Is a General Cofactor for RNA Polymerase II Transcription

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The SAGA co-activator has been implicated in the regulation of a smal subset of genes in budding yeast in transcriptomic analyses performed in steady-state levels of RNA. We used microarrays to analyse newly-synthesized RNA in several mutants for the SAGA complex to disclose and readdress the impact of this complex in RNA Polymerase II transcription.
