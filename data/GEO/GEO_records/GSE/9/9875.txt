TITLE
Effect of a naturally eQTN on the yeast transcriptome

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We identified a mutation that is a frameshift mutation in a mononucleotide run of eight consecutive T's in the coding region of the gene SSY1, which encodes a key component of a plasma-membrane sensor of extracellular amino acids.We introduced it into the S288c background and examined the effect on gene expression. Keywords: Total gene expression analysis
