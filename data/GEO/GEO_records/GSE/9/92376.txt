TITLE
Gene expression profile of regulatory T cell (Treg) subsets from CD28-deficient mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A comparative analysis of gene expression of CD4+ EGFP+ Nrp1+ (tTreg, thymus-derived Treg), CD4+ EGFP+ Nrp1- (pTreg, peripherally-derived Treg) and CD4+ EGFP- (Tconv, conventional T cell) in CD28-/- Foxp3EGFP and Foxp3EGFP mice.

DESIGN
Nrp1+ Treg (tTreg), Nrp1- Treg (pTreg) and Tconv were sorted from Foxp3EGFP and CD28-/-Foxp3EGFP mice. Total RNAs were extracted from whole samples and analyzed by RNA-seq.
