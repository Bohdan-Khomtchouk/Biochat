TITLE
Transcription factor Interplay between LEAFY and APETALA1/ CAULIFLOWER during Floral Initiation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The transcription factors LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1)_together with the AP1 paralog CAULIFLOWER (CAL)_control the onRep_of flower development in a partially redundant manner. This redundancy is thought to be mediated_at least in part_through the regulation of a shared Rep_of target genes. However_whether these genes are independently or cooperatively regulated by LFY and AP1/CAL_is currently unknown. To better understand the regulatory relationship between LFY and AP1/CAL during floral initiation_we monitored the activity of LFY in the absence of AP1/CAL function. We found that the regulation of several known LFY target genes is unaffected by AP1/CAL perturbation_while others appear to require AP1/CAL activity. Furthermore_we obtained evidence that LFY and AP1/CAL control the expression of some genes in an antagonistic manner. Notably_these include key regulators of floral initiation such TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1)_which had been previously reported to be directly repressed by both LFY and AP1. We show here that TFL1 expression is suppressed by AP1 but promoted by LFY. We further demonstrate that LFY has an inhibitory effect on flower formation in the absence of AP1/CAL activity. We propose that LFY and AP1/CAL may act as part of an incoherent feed-forward loop to control the establishment of a stable developmental program for the formation of flowers.

DESIGN
Two microarray experiments performed in Arabidopsis lines expressing a LFY-GR construct. The first is a timecourse series identifying differential expresion following the induction of LFY expression. The other is a single timepoint identifying differential expression following LFY activation in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. All time points in both experiments have multiple replicates. Replicates are dye swapped.
