TITLE
The expression profile of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells miRNA is altered by dengue virus serotype-3 and antibody-dependent enhancement infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare miRNA expression progiles in human PBMCs with DENV-3 and DENV-3 ADE infections using high-throughput sequencing

DESIGN
We defined the following experimental groups: DENV-3-none-0h, DENV-3-8h, DENV-3-24h, DENV-3 of ADE-8h, DENV-3 of ADE-24h,
