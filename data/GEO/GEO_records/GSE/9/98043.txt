TITLE
Circulating miRNAs for gestational diabetes mellitus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the plasma miRNA expression profiles between healthy and GDM women by microarray analysis.Our study offers new insights into circulating biomarkers of GDM and thus provides a valuable resource for future investigations.

DESIGN
Plasma from 4 pregnant women (2 from normal controls and 2 from GDM patients) were used for microarray analysis using the SurePrint human miRNA microarray
