TITLE
Effect of digoxin treatment on the gene and alternative splice expression in human pluripotent stem cells- derived mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the effect of FDA approved digoxin treatment (50nM for 48h) on the gene expression and alternative splices in control human pluripotent stem cells derived mesenchymal stem cells. Our results demonstrate the effect of digoxin treatment on alternative splice as 258 skipping exons were identified after digoxin treatment. Concerning the gene expression, our results also highlight on the large effect of digoxin treatment on the modulation of gene expression.

DESIGN
Gene expression and Alternative splices were examined in three samples of WT human pluripotent stem cells derived mesenchymal stem cells treated or not with 50nM digoxin for 48h.
