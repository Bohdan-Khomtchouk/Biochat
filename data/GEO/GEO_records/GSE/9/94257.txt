TITLE
Next generation sequencing analyses of transcriptomes of 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with DF, an anti-obesity multi-herbal composition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our study provides detailed analysis of DF-induced transcriptomes generated by RNA-Seq technology. RNA-Seq based transcriptome analyzes would elucidate complex molecular mechanisms of multi-herbal composition like DF

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of control 3T3-L1 adipocytes and DF-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were analyzed by RNA-Seq. Construction of library was performed using SENSE 3â€™ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit (Lexogen, Inc., Austria), and high-throughput sequencing was performed as single-end 75 sequencing using NextSeq 500 (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA, USA)
