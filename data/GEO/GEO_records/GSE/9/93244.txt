TITLE
Expression data from transfection of 14 different antisense oligonucleotides in HuH7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to globally profile the gene expression changes observed after 10h and 24h when transfecting antisense oligonucleotides in HuH7 cells

DESIGN
14 different antisense oligonucleotides (n=2 of each) were transfected into HuH7 cells and gene expression changes relative to mock-treated controls (n=2) were measured by microarray after 10h and 24h.
