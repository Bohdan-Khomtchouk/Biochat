TITLE
ChIP-chip in RNA Pol II mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) orchestrates dynamic recruitment of specific cellular machines during different stages of transcription. Signature phosphorylation patterns of Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 heptapeptide repeats of the CTD engage specific “readers.” While phospho-Ser5 and phospho-Ser2 marks are ubiquitous, phospho-Thr4 is reported to only impact specific genes. Here, we investigate the genome-wide occupancy of Pol II, phospho-Thr4, and key reader Rtt103 in WT and CTD-mutant strains of S. cerevisiae.

DESIGN
ChIP of Rpb3, phospho-Thr4, and Rtt103 in WT or CTD-mutant strains of S. cerevisiae.
