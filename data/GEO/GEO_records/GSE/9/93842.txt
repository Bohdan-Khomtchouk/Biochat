TITLE
Experimentally induced thiamine deficiency in neuronally differentiated SH-SY5Y cells using oxythiamine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our results provide a new information of the specific action of oxythiamine on the signaling processes of apoptosis that can apply for the development of new experimental cellular models of neurodegenerative diseases.

DESIGN
Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line differentiated with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for 72 h were followed by treatment with oxythiamine for an additional 72 h. Cells non-treated with oxythiamine were examine as control. Gene expression profiling was performed using Atlas Human Apoptosis Array (Cat. #7743-1) (BD Biosciences Clontech).
