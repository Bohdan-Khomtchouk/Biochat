TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of blood transcriptomes from managed bottlenose dolphins in Waikoloa, Hawaii, USA

ORGANISM
Tursiops truncatus

SUMMARY
Whole blood was collected as part of monthly veterinary checkups of bottlenose dolphins housed at Dolphing Quest in Waikoloa, Hawaii, USA.  Gene expression from 5 samples was analyzed for comparison to the blood transcriptome of the beluga whale.

DESIGN
Illumina based RNA-seq analyses were carried out on RNA from blood using a transcriptome assembled de novo in Trinity.  The data set was compared to a parallel analysis of the beluga whale blood transcriptome.
