TITLE
Gene expression data after acute withdrawal of TERT in mouse skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TERT is an essential protein component of telomerase, a ribonuclearprotein complex that protects chromosomal ends. Ectopic expression of TERT in mouse skin activates hair follicle stem cells and induces active growth phase of hair cycles, called anagen. This activity of TERT is independent of its reverse transcriptase function, indicating that this is a non-telomeric function of TERT. We performed time-course microarray analysis using conditional bi-transgenic mice (iK5-TERT) to understand the mechanism of this novel non-telomeric function of TERT. Keywords: Time course, 2 cohorts (control, experimental)
