TITLE
Long Noncoding RNA and mRNA Expression Profile in clear cell renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Five matched clear cell renal cell carcinoma and normal tissues were used for microarray.

DESIGN
lnRNA and mRNA expression profile in 5 pairs of clear cell renal cell carcinoma tissues and adjacent non-neoplastic tissues by lncRNA and mRNA integrated microarrays
