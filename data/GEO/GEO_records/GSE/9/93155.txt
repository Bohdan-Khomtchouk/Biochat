TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human MSC-educated macrophages vs. classical macrophages from bone marrow and blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In comparison to MØs, MEMs have increased expression of the inhibitory molecules PD-L1, PD-L2, in addition to markers of alternatively activated macrophages: CD206 and CD163. RNA-Seq analysis of MEMs, as compared to MØs, show a distinct gene expression profile that positively correlates with multiple pathways important in tissue repair. MEMs also show increased expression of IL-6, TGF-β, Arginase-1, CD73, and decreased expression of IL-12 and TNF-α. We show that IL-6 secretion is controlled in part by the COX-2, arginase and JAK1/STAT1 pathway. When tested in vivo, we show that human MEMs significantly enhance survival from lethal GVHD, and improve survival of mice from radiation injury.

DESIGN
Human macrophages were isolated from PBMCs and then exposed to MSCs. RNA was isolated then subjected to RNA-Seq.
