TITLE
Epigenomic Atlas of Early Human Craniofacial Development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromatin State Profilining using multiple histone modifications in human craniofacial tissue spanning 4.5 post conception weeks to 10 pcw The raw FASTQ sequence files are being deposited in dbGAP

DESIGN
Parallel profiling of six distinct histone modifications via ChIP-Seq in craniofacial tissue samples from individual human embryos
