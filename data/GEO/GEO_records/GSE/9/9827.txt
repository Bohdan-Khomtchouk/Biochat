TITLE
JAK2V617F mutation in CD34+ stem cells of essential thrombocythemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The JAK2V617F mutation has been reported in about 40-60% of Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) patients. However, little is known about specific molecular abnormalities of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment of ET according to JAK2 mutation. Therefore, we compared the gene expression profiles of bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells from 16 patients with and without the JAK2V617F mutation to identify differentially expressed genes. Keywords: cell type comparison
