TITLE
Genome-wide small RNAs analysis of simian virus 40 infected cells

ORGANISM
Chlorocebus aethiops

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare small RNA profiles (sRNA-seq) of simian virus 40 infection and mock infected Vero cells at 72 hours post infection.

DESIGN
Small RNA profiles of  simian virus 40 infection and mock infected Vero cells at 72 hours post infection were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform.
