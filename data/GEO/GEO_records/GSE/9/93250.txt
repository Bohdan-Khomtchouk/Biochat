TITLE
Gene expression profile in stable RCAN1-4 knockdown thyroid cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the effects of endogenous RCAN1-4 loss on thyroid cancer in vivo, we developed RCAN1-4 knockdown stable cells. Subcutaneous xenograft models demonstrated that RCAN1-4 knockdown promotes tumor growth. Intravenous metastasis models demonstrated that RCAN1-4 loss promotes tumor metastases to the lungs and their subsequent growth. Microarray was performed to understand how RCAN1-4 regulates tumor behaviors and the global effects of RCAN1-4 knockdown in these cells.

DESIGN
Transcriptome data from two thyroid cancer cell lines: FTC236 and HTh74. For each cell lines, we developed RCAN1-4 knockdown stable cells (shRCAN1-4) using RCAN1-4 specific shRNA and control stable cells (shCtrl) using nontargeting shRNA. Three biological triplicates were used for each cell line.
