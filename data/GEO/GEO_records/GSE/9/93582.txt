TITLE
RNASeq of molecular basis of ancestral vertebrate electroreception

ORGANISM
Leucoraja erinacea

SUMMARY
Elasmobranch fishes, including sharks, rays, and skates, use specialized electrosensory organs called Ampullae of Lorenzini to detect extremely small changes in environmental electric fields. Electrosensory cells within these ampullae are able to discriminate and respond to minute changes in environmental voltage gradients through an as-yet unknown mechanism. Here we show that the voltage-gated calcium channel CaV1.3 and big conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel are preferentially expressed by electrosensory cells in little skate (Leucoraja erinacea) and functionally couple to mediate electrosensory cell membrane voltage oscillations, which are important in the detection of specific, weak electrical signals. Both channels exhibit unique properties compared with their mammalian orthologues to support electrosensory functions: structural adaptations in CaV1.3 mediate a low voltage threshold for activation, while alterations in BK support specifically tuned voltage oscillations. These findings reveal a molecular basis of electroreception and demonstrate how discrete evolutionary changes in ion channel structure facilitate sensory adaptation.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression in ampullary cells, ampullary canals, body skin, and liver from one adult Leucoraja erinacea skate prepared from poly A+ RNA using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit
