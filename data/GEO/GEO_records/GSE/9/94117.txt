TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of E.coli, under multiple growth conditions

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli B str. REL606

SUMMARY
The goal of the study is to obtain rna concentrations of E.coli under different growth conditions including growth phase carbon source and salt stresses of Mg+2 and Na+

DESIGN
Mostly triple replicates of 152 samples with a time span of 2 weeks corresponding to exponential stationary and late-stationary phases, low base and high Mg+2 levels, base and high Na+ levels, and four carbon sources; glucose gluconate lactate glycerol. The reference condition to be glucose as carbon source, with 5 mM Na+ and 0.8 mM Mg2+.
