TITLE
Chromatin interaction analysis of transcription factors and IRF8 in CD4+ T cells differentiated from wild-type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that the IRF8 protein is able to interact with chromatin during Th9 differenciation

DESIGN
Examination of the interaction of IRF8 and transcription factors during early stages of Th9 CD4+ T cell differentiation
