TITLE
SLC25A25-AS1 knockdown data of two colorectal carcinoma cell lines (HT29 and SW480)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified that SLC25A25-AS1 was a lncRNA influencing radiation response. Therefore, we aimed to explore more biological roles of SLC25A25-AS1 in this process. Towards this end, we used RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of SLC25A25-AS1 in HT29 and SW480 to explore the changes of mRNA expression profiles and explore the phenotype outcomes.

DESIGN
A four sample study using total RNA collected from three cell lines (HT29 and SW480) with or without knockdown of SLC25A25-AS1.
