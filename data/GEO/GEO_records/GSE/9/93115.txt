TITLE
Gene expression analysis of PiZ mouse livers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic PiZ mice have been genetically engineered to express ATZ and have been a valuable experimental model for studing liver disease associated with AAT deficiency. ATZ accumulates in these mice within the ER of hepatocytes in a nearly identical manner to livers of affected patients. To investigate the pathogenesis of liver damage induced by ATZ, we performed gene expression analysis in livers of 6-week-old PiZ mice and strain-, age-, and gender-matched wild-type mouse controls. All samples were processed on Affymetrix Mouse 430A 2.0 arrays using GeneChip 3’-IVT Plus and Hybridization Wash and Stain kits by means of Affymetrix’s standard protocols. The analysis indicated that most genes upregulated in PiZ livers were associated with response to unfolded proteins, ER nuclear signaling pathway, and response to protein stimulus.
