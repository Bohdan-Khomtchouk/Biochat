TITLE
Effects of ATRA and ATO on expression profiles of APL cells in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize the genes that are responsive or refractory to ATRA or ATO treatment in mouse APL cells

DESIGN
Using FACS, we isolated GFP+ mouse APL cells and treated with or without ATRA or ATO in vivo. Each sample had 3 biological replicates.
