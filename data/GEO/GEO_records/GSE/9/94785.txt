TITLE
Asbestos-associated genome-wide DNA methylation changes in lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation study in lung cancer and paired normal lung with well-documented asbestos exposure

DESIGN
28 fresh-frozen lung cancer samples and their corresponding microscopically normal peripheral lung tissues were used for bead array methylation analyses. Six additional non-tumor control lung tissues were processed and analyzed in parallel. Samples (tumor, tumor-adjacent, and control tissues.) were analyzed according to asbestos exposure. Asbestos exposure was based on pulmonary fiber counts and occupational history.
