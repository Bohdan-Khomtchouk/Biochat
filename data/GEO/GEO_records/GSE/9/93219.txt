TITLE
Identification of a T cell signature associated with allergic diseases in Human

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We wish to show that Th2A cells have a distinct gene expression profile compared to Th2 cells in allergic subjects

DESIGN
We sorted conventional Th1 cells (CXCR3+ CCR4- CCR6-), conventional Th17 cells (CCR6+), Th2A cells (CRTH2+ CD161+ CD49d+ CD27- CD45RB-) and conventional Th2+ cells (CRTH2+ CD161-) from the PBMC of 3 subject pools. Each pool consisted of cells from 2-3 allergic donors. Sorted TH subsets were stimulated for 6 hours with anti-CD3/CD28 beads (Life Technologies, STIM samples) or left unstimulated (CTRL samples) prior to extraction of RNA (RNeasy Mini kit; Qiagen).
