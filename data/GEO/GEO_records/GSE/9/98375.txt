TITLE
Transcriptional alterations in mDia1-miR146a double deficient erythroblasts and  IL-6 treated erythroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of total RNA samples from FACS sorted erythroblasts To further verify the role of cytokine triggered inflammation signaling in erythropoiesis, we decided to follow the profile of gene expression in erythroblasts using DNA microarrays. To elucidated the gene expression pattern in cytokine, especially IL-6, challenged erythroblasts, in vitro IL-6 treated erythroblasts in EPO containing medium both at day 1 and day 2 were collected. We also sorted the erythroblasts at different stages (Proerythroblasts(I),Basophilic(II) and polychromatic(III) erythroblasts,Orthochromatic(IV) erythroblasts) from both DWT and DKO bone marrow cells through fluorescence activated cell sorting. Total RNA were extracted and processed to hybridize with Affymetrix mouse Clariom S microarrays.

DESIGN
We analyzed erythroblasts at different stages from 2 double WT and 2 mDia1-miR-146a double KO old mice in C57BL/6 background using the affymetrix Mouse Clariom S Array platform. In vitro IL-6 treated and non-treated erythroblasts differentiated from two wide type C57BL/6 mice were also inclued.No techinical replicates were performed.
