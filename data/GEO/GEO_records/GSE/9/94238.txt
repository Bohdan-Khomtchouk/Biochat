TITLE
RNAseq analysis of B cells inducible for murine gammaherpesvirus 68 reactivation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RTA, the viral Replication and Transcription Activator, is essential for rhadinovirus lytic gene expression upon de novo infection and reactivation from latency. LPS/TLR4 engagement enhances rhadinovirus reactivation. We developed the HE-RIT cell line, a latent murine A20 B cell inducible for Flag-RTA expression and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 reactivation.  LPS acted as a second stimulus to drive virus reactivation from latency in the context of induced expression of FLAG-RTA. We applied RNAseq to examine for genome-wide changes in viral gene expression in response to doxycycline-induced RTA-FLAG, alone or in combination with LPS.

DESIGN
6 samples total: Replicates of Mock (untreated controls), Dox (induced for RTA expression), and Dox + LPS (dual treatment)
