TITLE
The ACME and SCCmec Linkage of Virulence with Resistance in the Community Methicillin Resistant S. aureus USA300 Clone

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
The epidemic character of community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), especially the geographically widespread clone USA300, is poorly understood.  USA300 isolates carry a type IV staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) element conferring  -lactam antibiotic class resistance and a putative pathogenicity island, ACME (arginine catabolic mobile element). Physical linkage between SCCmec and ACME suggests that selection for antibiotic resistance and for pathogenicity may be interconnected.  We constructed isogenic mutants containing deletions of SCCmec and ACME in a USA300 clinical isolate to determine the role of these elements in a rabbit model of bacteremia.  We found that deletion of type IV SCCmec did not affect competitive fitness, whereas deletion of ACME significantly attenuated pathogenicity or fitness of USA300.  These data are consistent with a model in which ACME enhances growth and survival of USA300, allowing for genetic " hitchhiking " of SCCmec.  SCCmec in turn protects against exposure to Î² -lactams.
