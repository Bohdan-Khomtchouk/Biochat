TITLE
Striatal transcriptome analysis of Shank3-overexpressing mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Shank3 is a core excitatory postsynaptic protein enriched in the striatum. We have previously generated and characterized Shank3-overexpressing transgenic mice, and found that these mice exhibited manic-like behavioral phenotypes. To understand molecular mechanisms underlying the behavioral changes, we performed transcriptome (RNA-sequencing) analysis of the striatal tissues from 12-week-old wild-type and Shank3 transgenic mice.

DESIGN
Striatal transcriptome of 12-week-old wild-type and Shank3 transgenic (TG) mice.
