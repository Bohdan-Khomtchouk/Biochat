TITLE
Expression data from adult rat testes treated with 3 mg/kg b.w. cadmium chloride via i.p.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This is a study to explore the transcriptional changes after cadmium treatment in adult rat testes at three time points (control--0 hour,  8 hour and 4 day). Cadmium is an environmental toxicant that is known to affect the male reproductive system. It disrupts the blood-testis barrier irreversibly,  and affects the Sertoli-germ cells adhesion, causing germ cell depletion from the seminiferous epithelium. Keywords: Cadmium effect in rat testes
