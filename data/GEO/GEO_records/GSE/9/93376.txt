TITLE
Astrocytic calcium waves signal brain injury to neural stem and progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression patterns in the SVZ, 48 h after an ischemic lesion caused by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)

DESIGN
Adult male C57/BL6 mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion. After 48h, mice were killed and the subventricular zone ipsilateral to the lesion (and sham-surgery controls) were dissected out and RNA extracted for RNA microarray analysis
