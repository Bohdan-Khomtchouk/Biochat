TITLE
In search of genes necessary to induce cytoskeletal changes in B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to identify genes necessary to induce cytoskeletal change in B cells. Using gene expression microarray, we compared B cells stimulated with Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and anti-CD40 antibodies that induce B cell spreading, cell motility, tight aggregates, and extensive microvilli with B cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that lack these cytoskeletal changes.

DESIGN
3 animals per group were analysed in groups 1 and 3, 2 animals per group were analysed in group 2. Group 1 = C57BL6 spleen B cells stimulated with anti-CD40+IL-4 for 2 days (alfa1, alfa2, alfa3), Group 2 = non-cultured C57BL6 spleen cells (B6-1, B6-4, B6-6) and Group 3 = C57BL6 spleen B cells stimulated with Lipopolysacharide (LPS) for 2 days (LPS1, LPS2, LPS3).
