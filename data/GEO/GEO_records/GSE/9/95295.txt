TITLE
RNA-Sequencing of RCAS(A) and RCAS(A)-Wnt9a infected basilar papillas to identify genes acting downstream of Wnt9a

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
This study compared Wnt9a overexpressing basilar papillas to control basilar papillas (BP) from embryonic day 6 (E6) chicken embryos. The goal was to identify genes acting downstream of Wnt9a in the E6 BP. We used Illumina HiSeq with paired-ends and at more than 60 million reads per sample. Differentially expressed genes between Wnt9a overexpressing and control BPs include, but not limited to, genes previously shown to be involved in axon guidance, cell pluripotency, and EMT.  pathway,

DESIGN
mRNA profiles were generated from embryonic day 6 basilar papillas infected with RCAS(A) retrovirus (control) or RCAS(A)-Wnt9a retrovirus (experimental). Three biological replicates were collected for both control and experiemental groups. Each biological replicate consisted of RNA from 24 basilar papillas.
