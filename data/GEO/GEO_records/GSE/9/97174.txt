TITLE
Identification of Factors Required for m6A mRNA Methylation in Arabidopsis Reveals a Role for the Conserved E3 Ubiquitin Ligase HAKAI

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Illumina RNA-Seq of Arabidopsis virilizer-1 root tips

DESIGN
N6-adenosine methylation (m6A) of mRNA is an essential process in most Eukaryotes, but its role and the status of factors accompanying this modification are still poorly understood. Using combined methods of genetics, proteomics and RNA biochemistry, we identify a core set of mRNA m6A writer proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. The components required for m6A in Arabidopsis include MTA, MTB, FIP37, VIRILIZER and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HAKAI. Downregulation of these proteins leads to reduced m6A levels and shared pleiotropic phenotypes, which include aberrant vascular formation in the root, indicating that correct m6A methylation plays a role in developmental decisions during pattern formation. The conservation of these proteins amongst Eukaryotes and the demonstration of a role in writing m6A for the E3 ubiquitin ligase HAKAI is likely to be of considerable relevance beyond the plant sciences.
