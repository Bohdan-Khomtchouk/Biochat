TITLE
Whole blood gene expression in adolescent Chronic Fatigue Syndrom (CFS) by RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study compared whole blood gene expression in CFS adolescent and healthy controls, and explored associations between gene expression and neuroendocrine markers, immune markers and clinical markers within the CFS group.

DESIGN
Whole blood samples from 29 CFS patient samples and 18 control samples of the Nor Capital project were extracted and their RNA were subjected to RNASeq to measure global gene expression
