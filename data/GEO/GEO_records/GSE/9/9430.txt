TITLE
Microarray analysis of vegetative phase change in maize

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Vegetative phase change is the developmental transition from the juvenile phase to the adult phase during which a plant becomes competent for sexual reproduction.  Gain of ability to flower is often accompanied by changes in patterns of differentiation in newly forming vegetative organs.  In maize, juvenile leaves differ from adult leaves in morphology, anatomy, and cell wall composition.  Whereas the normal sequence of juvenile followed by adult is repeated with every sexual generation, this sequence can be altered in maize by the isolation and culture of the shoot apex from an adult phase plant; an “adult” meristem so treated reverts to forming juvenile vegetative organs.  To investigate the molecular differences between the juvenile and adult phases in maize comparisons among two juvenile samples, leaf 4 and culture-derived leaf 3 or 4, and an adult sample (leaf 9) were made using cDNA microarrays.  All samples were leaf primordia at plastochron 6.  A gene was scored as “phase specific” if it was up- (or down-) regulated in both juvenile samples compared to the adult sample with at least a twofold-change in gene expression at P-value less than or equal to 0.005. Some 221 ESTs up-regulated in juvenile and 28 ESTs up-regulated in adult were identified.  Altered patterns of expression of selected ESTs in the phase change mutants Tp2, d1 and gl15 further confirmed these genes as being phase-specific and allowed us to position these genes in the known genetic hierarchy regulating phase change.
