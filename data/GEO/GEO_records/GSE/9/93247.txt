TITLE
Transcriptional profiling on leaves of Pha21 (PATC144963) overexpressed Phalaenopsis aphrodite

ORGANISM
Phalaenopsis aphrodite

SUMMARY
To identify genes affected by Pha21, Pha21 was transiently overexpressed in leaves of P. aphrodite by agroinfiltration.  The leaves of P. aphrodite infiltrated with agrobacterium carrying empty vector (without Pha21) was used as a control. Transcriptional profiling was analyzed using a customized oligonucleotide array with RNA extracted from Pha21 and empty vector overexpressed leaves of P. aphrodite.  The sequences used for probe design were collected from the Orchidstra 2.0 database ( ). Totally, 42,973 probes were designed on this oligonucleotide array.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Empty vector (EV) vs. Pha21 transient overexpression (Pha21-OE). Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 transient overexpression replicates.
