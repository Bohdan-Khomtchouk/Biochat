TITLE
MicroRNAs expression data from two different types of human breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of microRNAs differences between MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells.Sample 1- Human breast cancer cell MCF-7,which exibits ER and PR expression, belongs to non-triple negative breast cancer cell with epithelial morphology and character.Sample 2-human breast cancer cell MCF-7/ADR,derived from MCF-7 and cultured with 1 ug/ml adriamycin for at least one year and pocesses adriamycin-resistance with mesenchymal morphology and character. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of microRNA expression between two distinct classes of breast cancer cells.
