TITLE
Time series of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) growth curve, tiling arrays

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)

SUMMARY
Experimentally mapped transcriptome structure of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) by hybridizing total RNA (including RNA species < 200 nt) to genome-wide high-density tiling arrays (60 mer probes tiled every 10 nt).

DESIGN
Five samples were taken from batch fermentations in complex LB medium (two exponential phases and one stationary phase) and minimal MR medium (one exponential phase and one stationary phase).
