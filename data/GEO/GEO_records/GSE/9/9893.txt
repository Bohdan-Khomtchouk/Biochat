TITLE
A gene expression signature predicting the recurrence of tamoxifen-treated primary breast cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A 36-gene classifier was constructed through expression profiling of 132 tumors  from tamoxifen-treated patients using 70-mer oligonucleotide microarrays. The robustness of the signature was demonstrated using expression data from 83 independent tumors. The 36-gene signature was (i) more efficient to predict disease-free survival than the traditional histo-pathological prognostic factors, (ii) as effective as the Nottingham Prognostic Index or the " Adjuvant! " software, and (iii) the only independent prognostic factor. Comparison with several already published signatures demonstrated that the 36-gene signature was among the best to classify tumors. Keywords: Gene expression profiling; supervised analysis; molecular signature predictive of recurrence; univariate and multivariate analysis in relation to disease-free survival.
