TITLE
Quantification of differential gene expression by multiplexed targeted resequencing of cDNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We present an approach for quantification of differential mRNA expression by targeted resequencing of cDNA using single-molecule molecular inversion probes (cDNA-smMIPs), which enable highly multiplexed resequencing of cDNA target regions of ~100 nt and counting of individual molecules. We show that accurate estimates of differential expression can be obtained from molecule counts for hundreds of smMIPs per reaction and that smMIPs are also suitable for quantification of relative gene expression and allele-specific expression. cDNA-smMIPs are a cost-effective tool for hypothesis-driven expression analysis in large numbers of genes (10 to 500) and samples (hundreds to thousands).

DESIGN
Analysis of differential gene expression using artificial ERCC transcripts and endogeneous transcripts from primary cells and cell lines
