TITLE
Rat liver: Caloric Restriction vs. Fasting vs. COntrol

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of rat liver after a three days caloric restriction or 3 days starvation. In the present study, we wanted to investigate the expression of multiple genes linked to pathways of energy metabolism. We developed a metabolism dedicated microarray tool: the Mitoligo. This microarray gathers genes linked to the main functions of energy metabolism, such as glycolysis or fatty acid oxidation. This biochip has also been designed to study the expression of genes encoding for all the subunits of proteins constituting the ETC. Eventually, genes coding for protein linked to ROS scavenging systems can also be studied using the Mitoligo. Keywords: Nutritional intervention
