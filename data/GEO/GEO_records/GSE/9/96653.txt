TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of differential gene expression in MDA-MB-231 cells after overnight treatment with riluzole

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MDA-MB-231 cells were used to determine genes differentially regulated by riluzole, a drug currently used to treat ALS patients

DESIGN
The triple-negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, was treated overnight with riluzole (25 uM)  or vehicle (DMSO) and genes differentially expressed were determined
