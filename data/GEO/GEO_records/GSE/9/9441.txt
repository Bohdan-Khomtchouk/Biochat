TITLE
The effect of sleep deprivation on gene expression in the brain and the liver of three inbred mouse strains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These studies adress differential changes in gene expression between 6h sleep deprived and control mice in the brain and the liver. We profiled gene expression in three different inbred strains to understand the influence of genetic background. Keywords: brain, genetic background, sleep deprivation
