TITLE
809094 Biomarker Identification in Fracture Healing (experiment #3873 miRNA performed Apr 2011)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The specific genes that distinguish normal fracture healing from abnormal healing or nonunion in humans are unknown.  This study was an exploratory investigation of peripheral blood from 2 chronic nonunion patients collected perioperatively (pre/post revision surgery) and at 3 months post revision follow up for comparison to Acutely injured subjects and Healthy volunteer cohorts analyzed separately. We used microarrays to do a global comparison between 2 chronic nonunion patients collected perioperatively (pre/post revision surgery) and at 3 months post revision follow up.
