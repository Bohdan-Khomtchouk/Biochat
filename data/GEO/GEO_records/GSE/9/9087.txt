TITLE
Drosophila Myb-MuvB/dREAM (ChIP-chip data)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Myb-MuvB (MMB)/dREAM is a nine subunit complex first described in Drosophila as a repressor of transcription, dependent upon E2F2 and the RBFs. Myb, an integral member of MMB, curiously plays no role in the silencing of the test genes previously analyzed. Moreover, Myb plays an activating role in DNA replication in Drosophila egg chamber follicle cells. The essential functions for Myb are executed as part of MMB. This duality of function lead to the hypothesis that MMB, which contains both known activator and repressor proteins, might function as part of a switching mechanism that is dependent upon DNA sites and developmental context. Keywords: Drosophila Myb-MuvB/dREAM, ChIP-chip
