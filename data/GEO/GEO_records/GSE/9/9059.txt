TITLE
MEF-CM and UM_GTA re-stimulation experiment with human ES cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic stem cells can be maintained in a basic Serum Replacement (Invitrogen) based medium that has been conditioned on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), yielding MEF-CM. Ligands secreted into the medium by the MEFs include Activin A, TGFÃŸ1, and Gremlin. This experiment served the purpose of identifying the short-term effects of MEF-CM and its substitute UM_GTA (unconditioned medium plus Activin A, TGFb1, and Gremlin) on gene expression in human embryonic stem cells. Keywords: Media / growth factor stimulation experiment
