TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A) knockdown in RPE1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression by RNA-seq upon siRNA mediated knockdown of scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A) versus control siRNA in RPE1 cells at 24 hour and 48 hour time points post transfection reveals SAF-A loss does not impact on gene transcription

DESIGN
Two control RNA-seq libraries where produced (24h and 48h) to compare to the two SAF-A siRNA knockdown RNA-seq libraries, each was a single experimental replicate.
