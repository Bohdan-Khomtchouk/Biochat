TITLE
Transcriptomes for different level of glucose

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
To characterize gene expression that is dependent on the strength of calorie restriction (CR), we obtained transcriptome at different levels of glucose, which is a major energy and carbon source for budding yeast. To faithfully mimic mammalian CR in yeast culture, we reconstituted and grew seeding yeast cells in fresh 2% YPD media before inoculating into 2%, 1%, 0.5% and 0.25% YPD media to reflect different CR strengths. We collected and characterized 160 genes that responded to CR strength based on the rigorous statistical analyses of multiple test corrected ANOVA (adjusted é value < 0.1 or raw é value < 0.0031) and Pearson correlation (|r| > 0.7). Based on the individual gene studies and the GO Term Finder analysis of 160 genes, we found that CR dosedependently and gradually increased mitochondrial function at the transcriptional level. Therefore, we suggest these 160 genes are markers that respond to CR strength and that might be useful in elucidating CR mechanisms, especially how stronger CR extends life span more.
