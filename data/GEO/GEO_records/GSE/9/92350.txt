TITLE
Ectopic Drosophila AKH overexpression effect on gene expression in the 3rd instar larval fat body

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Analysis of the larval fat bodies overexpressing AKH, which activates AKH signaling in the fat body in an autocrine manner. As a homolog of human glucagon, AKH causes dysregulation of carbohydrate metabolism and hyperglycemia. Results provide insight into the AKH effects on metabolic gene expression.

DESIGN
The fat bodies were dissected from late 3rd instar Drosophila larvae of control (R4-Gal4/+) and AKH-overexpressing (UAS-AKH/+; R4-Gal4/+) strains.RNAs were extracted for deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2000.
