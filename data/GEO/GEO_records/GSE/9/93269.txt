TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of gene (mRNA) and miRNA expression during mouse embryonic heart development [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Affymetrix whole genome gene and miRNA chips during the development period (from E10.5 to E19.5) and additionally included expression data of adult and old murine heart tissues For a more comprehensive understanding of the potential effects of miRNA for heart development, we carried out the first study of time-resolved parallel profiling of mRNA and microRNA levels in the developing murine heart and identify the dynamical activation or repression of numerous biological processes and signalling pathways

DESIGN
mRNA and miRNA (total RNA)  from mouse heart tissues of the developing embryos (from E10.5 to E19.5) and adult (10 weeks old mice) as well as old  (14 months old mice) were isolated and gene and miRNA expression was analysed by the Affymetrix (Mouse430 2.0) and Affymetrix miRNA 3.0 arrays.
