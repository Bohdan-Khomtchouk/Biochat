TITLE
expression changes by establishing metastasis

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Labeled PC3 were injected into male mice. 5-7 weeks later, cancer cells of metastasis site were extracted from bone marrow was compared with injected cell in vitro culture by microarray and pathway analysis.

DESIGN
mRNA expression of PC3 prostate cancer cells extracted from bone marrow was compared with injected cell in vitro culture
