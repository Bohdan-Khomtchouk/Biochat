TITLE
Molecular imaging of lymphoid organs and immune activation using PET with a new 18F-labeled 2â€™-deoxycytidine analog

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression between naive and activated CD8+ T cells was assessed using microarray analysis to determine target genes for new positron emission tomography (PET) probe screening, in particular for molecular imaging of lymphoid organs and immune activation. Keywords: cell activation comparison
