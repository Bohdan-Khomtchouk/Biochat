TITLE
Pentraxin-3 is a PI 3-Kinase Effector that Regulates Stem-Cell-Like Traits in Basal-Like Breast Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF10A cells: control vs. PIK3CA mutant (H1047R) Transcriptional profiling of MCF10A comparing control (expressing JP1520-PIK3CA-WT; Addgen plasmid #14570) and PIK3CA mutant (JP1520-PIK3CA-H1047R; Addgene plasmic#14572). Goal was to determine the effects of the PIK3CA H1047R mutation in the on global gene expression in MCF10A cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, ES vs. TF-ES cells. Biological replicates: 4 control replicates, 3 transfected replicates.
