TITLE
Expression data from MSC DDR2 KD and control cells, and from MDA-MB-231 cells primed with MSC DDR2 KD and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DDR2 regulates genes in MSCs and in MDA-MD-231 cells primed with MSCs

DESIGN
MDAMB231 GFP labelled cells were primed with MSCs-DsRed sh Scramble or shDDR2, then sorted for GFP+ or double + by flow cytometry and analyzed by gene expression between pairs groups. MSCs were treated with lentivirus containig shRNA for DDR2 to knock down DDR2 expression and compared gene expression with shScramble control. We isolated total RNA from all samples, after culture in complete medium. Triplicate RNA of each sample were submitted for microarray analyses.
