TITLE
Gene expression of myeloma cell line (U266) transduced with Scr or shKDM3A cultured in normoxia or hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By using a myeloma cell line U266 transduced Scrumbled shRNA or shKDM3A, we conducted whole genome gene screening against the cells that were subjected by chronic hypoxia condition.

DESIGN
We performed comprehensive gene expression analysis on the shKDM3A transduced U266 cell line and extracted several genes that have increased expression in hypoxia and downregulated by siKDM3A
