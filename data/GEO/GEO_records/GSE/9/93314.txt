TITLE
Cell cycle dynamics and complement expression distinguishes mature hematopoietic subsets arising from hemogenic endothelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptional profiling of intra-aortic clusters (IAHCs) at different time points of the hemogenic window (E10.5 and E11.5) and at different phases of the cell cycle.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiles of intra-aortic clusters (IAHCs) at E10.5 and E11.5 during the G1 and S/G2/M phase of cell cycle were generated by sorting IAHC populations (SSEA-1-CD31+CD117+ ) from FucciRed (mKO2+)and FucciGreen (mAG+)animals. 100 base pair pair-end sequencing was performed in triplicate using the Illumina Hiseq2500.
