TITLE
Gene expression data of CSF1R antibody-treated myeloma-associated macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling controls MФ differentiation and function, and blocking CSF1R exerts antitumor effects in solid tumors. We examined the effects of CSF1R blockade on multiple therapy. Our results showed that CSF1R blockade inhibited the differentiation, proliferation and survival of M2 and myeloma-associated MФs (MAMs). Microarray was used for determining CS7 effect on polarization of MAMs. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying polarizaiton of myeloma-associated macrophages by CSF1R antibody treatment and identified distinct classes of polarization-related genes during this process.

DESIGN
We cultured murine bone marrow (BM)-derived monocytes from 3 C57BL/KaLwRij mice in the presence of M-CSF for 7 days to generate BM-derived Macrophages (BMDMs). Then BMDMs were cocultured with murine myeloma 5TGM1-luc cells overnight and treated with 0.5 nM anti-mouse CSF1R antibody or IgG antibody control for 3 days. After that the BMDMs were wash for 4 times to removed myeloma cells and total RNA of BMDMs was extracted with RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen).   RNA samples were sent to CASE Comprehensive Cancer Center for quality evaluation and microarray analysis with GeneChip®Mouse Gene 2.0 ST .
