TITLE
The Histone Deacetylase Rpd3p Coordinates Transient Changes in Genomic Expression in Response to Acute Stress

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To characterize the role of chromatin remodeling proteins in mediating stress-activated expression changes, whole-genome expression was followed in wild-type and mutant cells (including strains lacking the histone deacetylase Rpd3p, associated Rpd3p proteins, and the transcription factors Msn2p and Msn4p) responding to multiple stresses including heat shock, hydrogen peroxide treatment, and salt stress, as well as stress relief. Keywords: Timecourse and single timepoint expression studies of stress response in yeast
