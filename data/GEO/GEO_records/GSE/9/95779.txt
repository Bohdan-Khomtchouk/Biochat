TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of healthy adrenal glands

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this research was to explore activation/deactivation of signaling pathways in neuroblastoma samples

DESIGN
Adrenal gland tissues cells were used as a control for transcriptome analysis of neuroblastoma samples. Adrenal glands collected from autopsies of healthy adult donors killed by accidents. Samples were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded.
