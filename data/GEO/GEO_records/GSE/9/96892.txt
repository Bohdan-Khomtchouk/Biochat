TITLE
Expression data from human osteosarcoma cells after transfected with klf-4 and treated with Adriamycin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The KHOS/NP osteosarcoma cells were seeded onto the 60mm cell culture plate, then treated with pccl vector, Adriamycin(50nM) and pccl-klf-4. Total RNA was collected from these cells using TRIzol® Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

DESIGN
Evaluate the effect of klf-4 and Adriamycin regulated gene expression in osteosarcoma cells
