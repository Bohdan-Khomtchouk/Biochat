TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the octuple jazQ mycT mutant shows that the MYC transcription factors control expression of many genes mis-regulated in jazQ, and also identifies some MYC-indepedent expression changes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The quintuple jaz mutant jazQ and the triple myc mutant mycT affect plant defense and growth. We used RNA-sequencing to query the transcriptomes of jazQ and mycT, as well as the combined jazQ mycT octuple mutatant, and examined how these mutations alter the expression of genes mis-regulated in jazQ. The data highlight how jasmonate signaling pathways are largely governed by MYC transcription factors, but also highlight some MYC-independent expression patterns.

DESIGN
Analysis of Col-0 (wildtype), jazQ, mycT, and jazQ mycT (four genotypes), with three biological replicates per genotype - 12 total samples. This series contains the re-use of 6 samples from GSE79012 (Col-0 and jazQ).
