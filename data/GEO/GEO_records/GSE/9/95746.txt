TITLE
ICF-specific DNMT3B dysfunction interferes with intragenic regulation of mRNA transcription and alternative splicing (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a transcriptomic and epigenomic study in patient-derived B-cell lines to investigate the genome-scale effects of DNMT3B dysfunction. We highlighted that altered intragenic CpG-methylation impairs multiple aspects of transcriptional regulation, like alternative TSS usage, antisense transcription and exon splicing.

DESIGN
Samples used in this study correspond to B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) derived from peripheral blood of individuals affected by ICF1 syndrome and healthy individuals
