TITLE
MLL2, but not MLL1, plays a major role to sustain leukemia survival [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the effect of Mll1, Mll2 and Mll1;Mll2 deletion on gene expression in MLL-AF9-transformed cells.

DESIGN
MLL-AF9 cells transformed from c-Kit-enriched BM cells were treated with ethanol or 100nM 4-OHT for 24 hours. After removing the drug, cells were continued to culture for 2 days and then collected for RNA extraction and RNA-seq.
