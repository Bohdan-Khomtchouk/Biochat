TITLE
Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing of WT and βRapKO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: DNA methylation has been proposed to drive functional maturation of pancreatic beta cells. To evaluate the possibility that altered methylation is involved in mTORC1-dependent beta cell maturation.

DESIGN
DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) was carried out on islets isolated from 8-week-old βRapKO and WT mice.
