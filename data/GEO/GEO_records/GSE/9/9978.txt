Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was undertaken in order to characterize the functions of Rex-1 and identify potential Rex-1 target genes.Both alleles of the Rex-1 gene were disrupted in J1 mouse embryonic stem cells. Gene expression levels in one of the resulting Rex-1 knockout cell lines was compared to that of J1 wild type cells. Keywords: cell type comparison
