TITLE
Embryonic adaptability: extensive molecular differences, few regulating cues

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Molecular differences in the view of developmental and/or time-in-culture effects while using the following criteria: i) the blastulation timing: early vs late, ii) an extended culture time for the early-formed blastocysts, iii) a detrimental IVP system: B2 + serum 5% + co-cultures 6 or 8 days with VERO cells and iv) temporary transfers to evaluate developmental abilities in utero up to D18

DESIGN
This is a three conditions experiment with blastocysts collected at day 6, day 8 and day 6+2.  Three biological replicates for each treatment and each were hybridized on one array in single color.
