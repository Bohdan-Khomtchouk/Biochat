TITLE
809094 Biomarker Identification in Fracture Healing (experiment #3218 performed 2009 Nov)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The specific miRNAs that distinguish normal fracture healing from abnormal healing or nonunion in humans are unknown.  This study was an exploratory investigation of peripheral blood from 2 acutely injured fracture patients collected over multiple days compared to age and sex matched healthy volunteers. We used microarrays to do a global comparison between acutely injured (AI) subjects (AIS) vs age and sex matched healthy volunteers (HV).
