TITLE
Expression data from overexpression and knockdown of HOXC6 in LNCaP cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor HOXC6 is upregulated in human prostate cancer. SiRNA knockdown of HOXC6 induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells while upregulation rescued LNCaP cells from siRNA-induced apoptosis. We used microarrays to identify the genes whose expression underly the anti-apoptotic and proliferative effects of HOXC6 in LNCaP cells. Keywords: transient overexpression and knockdown
