TITLE
Hybrid wine yeast strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
This experiment is the analysis of the transcriptomes of several hybrid yeast strains obtained by crossing natural (from wine) isolates of S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum. All isolations have been done from hybrid strains growing in exponential phase in YPD. Keywords: Strain comparison
