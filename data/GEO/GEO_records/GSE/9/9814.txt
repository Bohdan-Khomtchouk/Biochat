TITLE
RpoS regulation of gene expression during exponential growth of E. coli K-12

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
This study is to identify the RpoS regulon in MG1655 in early exponential growth. RNA samples from wild type or rpoS mutants were extracted using acidic hot phenol method and hybridized to Affymetrix E. coli Antisense Genome Array. Keywords: Define regulon of RpoS
