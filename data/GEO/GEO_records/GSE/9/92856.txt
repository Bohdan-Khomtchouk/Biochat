TITLE
Gene expression profiling of cultured embryonic rat cortical neurons

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Embryonic CNS neurons can differentiate in culture and provide a model for maturation-related changes. A transcriptome profile over the course of maturation was perform to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism that drives maturation and its related changes such as developmental loss of intrinsic regenerative capacity.

DESIGN
Primary cortical neurons were excised from E18 rat embryos and were co-cultured with primary rat astrocytes from P0-2 rats.  RNA were then extracted on day 1, 4, 8, 16, and 24 after plating.
