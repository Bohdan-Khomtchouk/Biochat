TITLE
Expression analysis of Wild-type and lncKdm2b-deficient ILC3s

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of differentially expressed genes in  lncKdm2b-deficient ILC3s

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling using Lin-CD45+ROR gt+ ILC3s from lncKdm2b deletion mice or WT littermates. Total RNA from each sample was quantified using the NanoDrop ND-1000. The sample preparation and microarray were performed in accordance with the NimbleGen Gene Expression Analysis protocol (NimbleGen Systems, Inc., USA).
