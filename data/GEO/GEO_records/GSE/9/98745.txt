TITLE
RNA-seq of Wistar-rat liver from young and old animals

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression level by Illumina sequencing of rat liver from young and old animals. We identified differentially expressed genes and provide functional profiles, which give insights into the aging process of short-lived rodents.

DESIGN
9 liver samples, 4-5 animals per group, 2 groups: 1) young males, 2) old males
