TITLE
Transcriptional effects of dominant-negative G784E Smarca4 mutation in mouse embryonic stem cells [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated transcriptomic effects of a Smarca4 ATPase mutant observed in primary tumors and cancer cell lines. Heterozygous expression of G784E Smarca4 mutant led to transcriptional changes compared to cells expressing only wild-type Smarca4.

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptome changes using RNA-seq in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing heterozygous mutations of the BAF subunit Smarca4. Cells express wild-type Smarca4-GFP and either wild-type or G784E Smarca4-V5. Filenames and descriptions of Smarca4 in this dataset refer to the status of the Smarca4-V5 fusion in these cells.
