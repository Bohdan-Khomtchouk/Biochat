TITLE
Role of DRH1 in C. elegans virus infection gene expression response

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of gene expression changes induced by infection in N2, drh1 and JU1580 (wild strain of C. elegans carrying a deletion of drh1) and JU1580 containing a functional drh-1 as a transgene

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression with and without virus infection
