TITLE
DEPS-1 promotes P granule assembly and RNA interference in C. elegans germ cells

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
P granules are germ-cell-specific cytoplasmic structures containing RNA and protein and required for proper germ cell development in C. elegans.  A new P-granule-associated protein, DEPS-1, whose loss disrupts P granule structure and function was analysed in this study.  Genome wide analysis of gene expression in deps-1 mutant germ lines identified additional targets of DEPS-1 regulation, many of which are also regulated by the RNAi factor RDE-3.  Our studies suggest that DEPS-1 is a key component of the P granule assembly pathway and that its roles include promoting accumulation of some mRNAs, such as glh-1 and rde-4, and reducing accumulation of other mRNAs, perhaps by collaborating with RDE-3 to generate endogenous short interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs).
