TITLE
Affymetrix Cytoscan HD 2,600K SNP array data for 9 GISTs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KIT, PDGFRA, NF1, and SDH mutations are alternate initiating events, fostering hyperplasia in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), and additional genetic alterations are required for progression to malignancy. The most frequent secondary alteration, demonstrated in ~70% of GISTs, is chromosome 14q deletion. Here we report hemizygous or homozygous inactivating mutations of the chromosome 14q MAX gene in 16 of 76 GISTs (21%). We find MAX mutations in 17% and 50% of sporadic and NF1-syndromic GISTs, respectively, and we find loss of MAX protein expression in 48% and 90% of sporadic and NF1-syndromic GISTs, and in 3 of 8 micro GISTs, which are early GISTs. MAX genomic inactivation is associated with p16 silencing in the absence of p16 coding sequence deletion, and MAX induction restores p16 expression and inhibits GIST proliferation. Hence, MAX inactivation is a common event in GIST progression, fostering cell cycle activity in early GISTs.

DESIGN
High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from 9 GISTs using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and analyzed by Affymetrix Cytoscan HD 2,600K-SNP array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite 2.0.
