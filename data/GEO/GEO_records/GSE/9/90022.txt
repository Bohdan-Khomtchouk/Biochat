SUMMARY
The study objective was to determine differentially expressed mRNA transcripts in pancreatic islets from fetal sheep with placental insufficiency-induced intrauterine growth restricted.

DESIGN
Islets were isolated for high-throughput sequencing from sheep fetuses with placental insufficiency-induced IUGR and controls.
