TITLE
Expression data from CSF1- or CSF2-induced bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs): M(CSF1) and M(CSF2) cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Femur and tibia bones were harvested from 8-week-old wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. Bone marrow was flushed out into cold PBS (Life Technologies) plus 2% heat-inactivated FBS, passed through a needle five times to dissociate the cells, and then passed through a 70-Î¼m cell strainer (Becton Dickinson) to remove cell clumps, bone, hair, and other cells/tissues. After addition of three volumes of NH4Cl solution (0.8% NH4Cl solution; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China), the mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min to remove red blood cells; the cells were then spun down and resuspended in cold PBS with 2% FBS. The harvested cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and supplemented with 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse CSF1 (R & D Systems) or 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse CSF2 (R & D Systems) for 7 days to obtain CSF1- or CSF2-induced BMDMs: M(CSF1) or M(CSF2) cells, respectively. To test the difference genes expression of TAMs obtained from M(CSF1) and M(CSF2) cells in C57BL/6 mice. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and identified M(CSF1) and M(CSF2) cells during this process.

DESIGN
To test the difference genes expression of M(CSF1) and M(CSF2) cells.M(CSF1) cells, M(CSF2) cells were processed in Trizol within 4 h after sorting and then analyzed using whole-mouse genome Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
