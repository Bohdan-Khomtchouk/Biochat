TITLE
Expression regulation by Pcgf6 in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins have an important role in controlling the expression of key genes implicated in embryonic development, differentiation and decision of cell fates. Emerging evidence suggests that Polycomb repressive complexes 1 (PRC1) is defined by the six Polycomb group RING finger protein (Pcgf) paralogs and Pcgf proteins can assemble into noncanonical PRC1 complexes. However, little is known about the precise mechanisms of differently composed noncanonical PRC1 in the maintenance of the pluripotent cell state. Here we disrupt the Pcgf genes in mouse embryonic stem cells by CRISPR-Cas9 to investigate Pcgf6 function. Microarray experiments were performed using wildtype ,Pcgf6 KO and Pcgf6 KO + Pcgf6_flag ES cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of wildtype ,Pcgf6 KO and Pcgf6 KO + Pcgf6_flag ES cells.
