TITLE
Effects of dexamethasone and KLF15 on genome-wide occupancy of the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in human airway smooth muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to determine how dexamethasone and KLF15 modify GR and RNAPII occupancy in human airway smooth muscle on a genome-wide basis.

DESIGN
This study utilized duplicate samples and the following conditions: A primary human airway smooth muscle cell line derived from a deceased donor without asthma was treated with ethanol or dexamethasone (dex) for one hour and ChIP was performed for each condition for GR and RNAPII.  The same airway smooth muscle cell line was also transduced with a KLF15 expressing adenovirus (Ad-KLF15)  or a GFP control (Ad-GFP) for 17 hours and treated with dex for one hour and ChIP was perfomed for each condtion for GR and RNAPII. In addition, RNAPII ChIP was performed on cells transduced with Ad-KLF15 for 17 hours and treated with ethanol for one hour. Input samples from ethanol treated cells (Sample 1D_input) and dex treated cells (Sample 2A_input) were used as additional controls.
