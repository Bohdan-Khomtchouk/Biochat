TITLE
Gene expression in germinal centre light zone and dark zone cells of high or low affinity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis performed on FACS sort purified GC LZ and DZ cells of either high or low affinity to identify unique gene signatures. Analysis revealed distinct transcription patterns.

DESIGN
SwHEL B cells carrying the CD45.1 congenic marker were transferred into C57BL/6J mice (CD45.2) and immunized with sheep red blood cells conjugated to the hen egg lysozyme mutant HEL3x. Day 10 post immunization high and low affinity cells of either LZ (CD86 high, CXCR4 low) or DZ (CXCR4 high, CD86 low) were sort purified from donor-derived GC B cell population (CD45.1+, CD45.2-, IgG1+, CD38 low).
