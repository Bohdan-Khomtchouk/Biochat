TITLE
HBEC-shp53-PCHD7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied the effects of ectopic expression of Protocadherin 7 (PCDH7) on Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells (HBECs).

DESIGN
Immortalised HBECs were established with overexpression of CDK4 and telomerase, and knocking down p53 in these cells was achieved using stable expression of shRNA specific for TP53 gene. PCDH7 or GFP were ectopically expressed in the resulted HBEC-shp53 cells using Lenti-virus. Stable infected cells were selected and harvested for RNA isolation in triplicates. RNA-seq was performed to study the effects of PCDH7 on the expressional profile of the HBEC-shp53 cells.
