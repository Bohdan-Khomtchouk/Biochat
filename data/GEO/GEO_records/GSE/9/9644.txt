TITLE
Glucose Pulse to sfp1delta continuous cultures

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SFP1 is required for proper regulation of ribosome biogenesis and cell size in response to nutrients. A mutant deleted for SFP1 shows specific traits among which a slow growth phenotype, which is particularly evident during growth on glucose. To assess the effects of nutrients on the activity of Sfp1 independent by growth rate related feedback we grew an sfp1Δ mutant and its isogenic reference strain in chemostat cultures, at the same specific growth rate, under glucose/ethanol-limitation. Our data show that Sfp1 is involved in the modulation of cell size and RiBi gene expression and that these two functions are differently influenced by nutrients. The continuous cultures were then pulsed with a glucose excess generating a situation of batch growth similar to shake flask cultures. The dynamic analysis of the metabolic and transcriptional response following the glucose addition suggested that Sfp1 plays a role at the crossroads of ribosome biogenesis and central carbon metabolism regulation. Finally, we show that the down-regulation of RP genes, which was observed in an sfp1Δ strain during shake flask growth, cannot be directly ascribed to the absence of Sfp1 but is most probably a secondary effect due to the low growth potential of the mutant strain.
