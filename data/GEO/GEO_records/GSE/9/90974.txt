TITLE
RNA-sequencing identifies factors that contribute to the Dengue-Refractory or â€“Susceptible phenotype in field-derived strains of Aedes aegypti

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
We used RNA-sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes in the midgut of Aedes aegypti that contribute to the field derivied dengue susceptible (Cali-S) and dengue refractory (Cali-R) phenotypes

DESIGN
We employed a full factorial design, analyzing differential expression across 1) time (24, 36 and 48 hours post blood meal), 2) feeding condition (blood or blood + DENvDENV2) and 3) strain (Cali-S (=susceptible) and Cali-MIB (=refractory)). Single end reads from 12 biological singetons were analyzed.
