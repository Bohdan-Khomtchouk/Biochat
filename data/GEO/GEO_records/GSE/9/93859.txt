TITLE
Analysis of Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP1 and Meiothermus ruber strain A co-cultured under variable light and oxygen conditions

ORGANISM
Meiothermus ruber

SUMMARY
The transcriptional response of the cyanobacteria T. elongatus to co-cultiavation with a heterotrophic partner M. ruber was examined under three varying light levels and three varying oxygen levels.

DESIGN
Three light levels were examined: low (197 µmol photons m-2 sec-1), mid (1190 µmol photons m-2 sec-1), and high (1995 µmol photons m-2 sec-1) all with oxygen at a partial pressure of zero .  Three oxygen levels were also examined: low (oxygen at 7% of atmosphere), mid (oxygen at 150% of atmosphere) and high (oxygen at 217% of atmosphere) all at a light level of 197 µmol photons m-2 sec-1.  T. elongatus was examined both axenically and with a hetertrophic partner of each of these six conditions.  The high light condition overlaps with the low oxygen condition. Each condition used two biological replicates except for HighLight_LowO2 which used 4 biological replicates for a total of 12 data points
