TITLE
Donor lung tissues: Control vs. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) continues to be a major cause of early death after lung transplantation. Moreover, there remains a lack of accurate pre-transplant molecular markers for predicting PGD. To identify distinctive gene expression signatures associated with PGD, we profiled human donor lungs using microarray technology prior to the graft implantation. The genomic profiles of 10 donor lung samples from patients who subsequently developed clinically defined severe PGD were compared with 16 case-matched donor lung samples from those who had a favorable outcome without PGD. Matched factors used were: recipient age (Â± 10 years), recipient gender, recipient lung disease, and type of transplantation (single or bilateral). Keywords: Observational case-control study
