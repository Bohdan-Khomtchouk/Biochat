TITLE
Role of CRP K100 positive charge on Escherichia coli global transcriptome

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that the positive charge of CRP K100 is important for transcription of Class II CRP-dependent genes. These data show mutations that affect K100 charge status result in genome-wide changes in transcription of both CRP-dependent and -independent genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from E.coli strains overexpressing WT CRP or a K100 variant (K100Q or K100R) grown in tryptone broth buffered to pH 7 (TB7) supplemented with 22 mM glucose. A strain overexpressing an AR1-/AR2- variant was used as a negative control.
