TITLE
An intrinsic transcriptional program underlying synaptic scaling during activity suppression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Homeostatic scaling allows neurons to maintain stable activity patterns by globally altering their synaptic strength in response to changing activity levels. Suppression of activity by blocking action potentials increases synaptic strength through an upregulation of surface AMPA receptors. Although this synaptic up-scaling was shown to require transcription, the molecular nature of the intrinsic transcription program underlying this process and its functional significance have been unclear. Using RNA-seq, we identified 73 genes that were specifically upregulated in response to activity suppression. In particular, Neuronal pentraxin-1 (Nptx1) increased within 6 h of activity blockade, and knockdown of this gene blocked the increase in synaptic strength. Notably, Nptx1 induction is mediated by calcium influx through the T-type Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel, as well as two transcription factors, SRF and ELK1. Taken together, these results uncover a transcriptional program that specifically operates when neuronal activity is suppressed, to globally coordinate the increase in synaptic strength.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles were generated from primary mouse cortical neurons at DIV12, comparing untreated neurons to neurons treated with Bicuculline or TTX for 30 m, 2 h, 4h, or 6 h, in duplicate
