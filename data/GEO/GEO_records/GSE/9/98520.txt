TITLE
Molecular Mediators of Cardiac Pathology in Cardiorenal Syndrome Type 4 [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report the changes in left ventricle mRNA abundance in response to 5/6 nephrectomy surgery

DESIGN
Ten week old male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to the excision model of 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) or sham surgery. Left ventricle tissue was collected 2, 4, 5 or 7 weeks later for mRNAsequencing.
