TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation maps of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and reprogramming cells modulated by cell cycle and Dnmt1 expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dramatic change in DNA methylation patterns and levels both globally and/or locus-specifically is associated with the process of cell linage specification and somatic reprogramming. We found the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) is tightly regulated by the features of cell cycle, which we referred as cell cycle-directed Dnmt1 expression adjustment. To further investigate how DNA methylation is affected by this mechanism, we applied reduced representation bisulphate sequencing (RRBS) to map genome-wide DNA methylation on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). To characterize how this mechanism affects somatic reprogramming, samples of MEFs induced by Yamanaka factors (Sox2, Klf4, Oct4, cMyc) was included. The cell cycle was accelerated by shRNA targeted to p53, and the expression of Dnmt1 was manipulated genetically. We find 5mC level remains constant in regardless of cell proliferation rate, a result from the adjusted expression of Dnmt1. However, repressed expression of Dnmt1 in fast-proliferating cells results in global DNA demethylation. The patterns of DNA methylation and demethylation affected by this mechanism is sensitive to CpG densities. Generally, the results demonstrate cell cycle-directed Dnmt1 expression adjustment as an mechanism for the insurance of the stability of genomic 5mC inheritance.

DESIGN
Reduced representation bisulphate sequencing in cell cycle modulated MEFs and SKOM induced reprogramming cells.
