TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in colorectal cancer cells with DGKG overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify the role of diacylglycerol kinase gamma (DGKG) in colorectal cancer, we carried out a gene expression microarray analysis using HCT116 cells infected with adenoviral vectors which express LacZ, kinase-dead mutant of DGKG (DGKG-KD) or constitutively active form of DGKG (DGKG-CA).

DESIGN
HCT116 cells were infected with an adenoviral vector for expressing LacZ, or DGKG-KD or DGKG-CA. Twenty-four hours after infection, total RNA was extracted and gene expression signatures were analyzed.
