TITLE
Genome-wide binding of condesin upon SET1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We reported the effect of condensin binding to the genome upon SET1 knockdown. ChIP-seq experiments of condensin (NCAPH2) were performed in control and SET1 knockdown cells.  We found that condensin binding was significantly reduced upon SET1 knockdown.

DESIGN
To study the role of SET1 on condensin binding
