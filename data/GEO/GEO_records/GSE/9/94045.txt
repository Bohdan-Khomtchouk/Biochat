TITLE
Analysis of the role for TgAP2IX-4 in regulating gene expression in Toxoplasma development

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
Differential expression analysis of TgAP2IX-4 knockout parasites in the developmentally competent Prugnaid delta ku80 (PruQ, Type II) genetic background. The role for TgAP2IX-4 was evaluated, in vitro, as tachyzoites (pH 7.0) and induced bradyzoites (48h pH 8.2) in three strains: PruQ-parent; AP2IX-4 knockout; complemented AP2IX-4 knockout

DESIGN
11 total samples.  Each condition presented as 2 biological replicates, with the exception of the complemented AP2IX-4 strain with has 3 biological replicates
