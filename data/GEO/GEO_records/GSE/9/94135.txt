TITLE
Characterization of murine pulmonary interstitial macrophages at steady state

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we demonstrate that the lung mononuclear phagocyte system comprises three interstitial macrophages (IMs), as well as alveolar macrophages (AMs), dendritic cells and few extravascular monocytes. Through cell sorting and RNAseq analysis we were able to identify transcriptional similarities and differences between the three pulmonary IM subtypes, with reference to the more well-characterized alveolar macrophage

DESIGN
Pulmonary Interstitial and Alveolar macrophages were FACS sorted from the lungs of steady state 8-10 week old B6 mice, in triplicate. Extracted RNA was examined by RNAsequencing.
