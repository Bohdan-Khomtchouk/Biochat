TITLE
Transcription of Nearly All Yeast RNA Polymerase II-Transcribed Genes Is Dependent on Transcription Factor TFIID

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
RNA Pol II transcription has been implied to be either regulated by the general transcription factor TFIID or the co-activator SAGA. Also, this dominancy of either SAGA or TFIID might be according to the existance, or not, of a TATA consensus sequence. We used microarrays to analyse newly-synthesized RNA in two mutants that allow conditional nuclear depletion of Taf4 or Taf5 to reevaluate whether some genes are more affected than others.
