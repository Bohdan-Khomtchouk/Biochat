TITLE
Age Dependent Decrease in Vascular Remodeling Response in LDLr-/- mice unveils a role of Quaking in Vascular Homeostasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Female C57Bl/6J LDLr -/- mice, aged 12 weeks (n=16) and 52 weeks (n=14), were put on western-type diet for 6 weeks before perivascular bilateral collar placement in the carotid artery. RNA was isolated from the carotid artery 6 weeks after collar placement. Snap frozen carotid arteries were pooled in four subgroups of three samples per age group in order to yield a sufficient amounts  of RNA. Gene expression profiles from young and old mice were compared on spotted oligonucleotide arrays containing the 22K mouse Sigma-Compugen libarary v1. A direct hybridization was used with dye swaps for each pool. Keywords: RNA expression profiling
