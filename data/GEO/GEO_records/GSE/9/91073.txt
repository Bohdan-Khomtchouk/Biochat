TITLE
RNA-seq of N2 and lin-45(n2018) mutant C.elegans responses to osmotic stress

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We profiled how animals RNA expression changes in response to osmotic stress, how lin-45 mutants have an altered response to osmotic stress, and how maternal preconditioning at 300 mM NaCl modifies progeny response to 500 mM NaCl

DESIGN
Examination of total RNAseq at 50 mM NaCl, 500 mM NaCl, and 500 mM NaCl from maternally preconditioned animals
