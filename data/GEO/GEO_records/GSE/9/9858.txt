TITLE
Monitoring the ethanol stress response of a sigZ deletion strain of B. cereus ATCC 14579.

ORGANISM
Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579

SUMMARY
The stress response of as sigZ deletion strain of B. cereus ATCC 14579 is monitored true time by use of microarrays. The sigZ regulon in ethanol stress response was determined and compared with the regulon determined by micorarray analysis of overexpression of sigZ. Keywords: stress response, comparative transcriptome study
