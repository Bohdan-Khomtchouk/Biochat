SUMMARY
ra15-07_burxcol_465 - burxcol-465 - What is the transcriptomic contrast between a TDNA-mutant and its respective wild-type from young rosette grown in precisely-controlled conditions on our phenotyping robot (Phenoscope)? - The candidate gene (AT1G36310) was identified through QTL mapping and cloning for rosette leaf growth trait in a Bur x Col RIL set. It corresponds to a medium effect on growth and a major effect on other traits (leaf colour and pigments). We are now exploiting an independent TDNA-insertion line (SALK_135308) in the Col-0 background) to study its effect in a simple genetic context. This is a simple comparison between homozygous T-DNA (2 lines) and their respective WT (2 lines).

DESIGN
2 dye-swap - gene knock out
