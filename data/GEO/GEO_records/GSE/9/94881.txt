TITLE
microRNA expression profiling among WTX low human colorectal cancer tissues and matched adjacent WTX high normal colorectal mucosa

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparing to matched normal mucosa, WTX was lost in most of human colorectal cancers (Zhang et al., 2016). We analyzed the microRNA expression profiling among WTX low human colorectal cancer tissues and matched adjacent WTX high normal colorectal mucosa. The aimed to identify the unique signature of miRNAs which related to WTX loss in human colorectal cancers.
