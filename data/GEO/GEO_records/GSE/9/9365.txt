TITLE
Expression data from barley maturing and germinating grains

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Plant seeds prepare for germination already during seed maturation. We performed a detailed transcriptome analysis of barley grain maturation, desiccation and germination in two tissue fractions (endosperm/aleurone = e/a and embryo = em) using the Affymetrix barley1 chip. Keywords: time course
