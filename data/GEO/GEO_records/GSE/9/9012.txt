TITLE
Expression data from spontaneous liver tumors of Trim24/TIF1a-null mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcriptional coregulator Trim24 (formerly known as TIF1a) functions in mice as a liver-specific tumor suppressor. Mice carrying a null mutation in the Trim24 gene all develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We used microarrays to identify the alterations in gene expression patterns associated with loss of Trim24 and consequent HCC development. Keywords: normal-tumor comparison
