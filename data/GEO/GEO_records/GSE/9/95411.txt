TITLE
Genomic characterization of murine monocytes reveals C/EBPb dependence of Ly6C-cells [RNA sequence]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We show that monocyte development is accompanied by stepwise RNA expression changes and that Ly6C+ monocytes upon transfer develop into Ly6C- monocytes indicated by a comparable expression profile to host Ly6C- monocytes

DESIGN
Examination of RNA expression changes in different monocyte populations
