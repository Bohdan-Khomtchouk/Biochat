Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The conditions of the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia and nutrient starvation, play critical roles in cancer progression. However, the role of acidic extracellular pH in cancer progression is not studied as extensively as that of hypoxia. Here, we show that extracellular acidic pH (pH 6.8) triggered activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) by stimulating nuclear translocation and promoter binding to its targets along with intracellular acidification. Interestingly, inhibition of SREBP2, but not SREBP1, suppressed the upregulation of low pH-induced cholesterol biosynthesis-related genes. Moreover, acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2), a direct SREBP2 target, provided a growth advantage to cancer cells under acidic pH. Furthermore, acidic pH-responsive SREBP2 target genes were associated with reduced overall survival of cancer patients. Thus, our findings show that SREBP2 is a key transcriptional regulator of metabolic genes and progression of cancer cells, partly in response to extracellular acidification.

DESIGN
Cells were treated for 24 h under each condition. RNA-seq reads were aligned to human transcriptome (UCSC gene) and genome (GRCh37/hg19) references respectively using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. After transcript coordinate was converted to genomic positions, an optimal mapping result was selected either from transcript or genome mapping by comparing the minimal edit distance to the reference. Local realignment was performed within in-house short reads aligner with smaller k-mer size (k=11). Finally, fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragment mapped (FPKM) values were calculated for each UCSC gene while considering strand-specific information.
