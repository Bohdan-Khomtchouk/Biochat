TITLE
Gene expression analysis on arsenic-induced malignant transformation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Arsenic is environmental risk factor and has been linked to urothelial carcinoma incidence.  Arsenic exposure-induced malignant transformed cells was established from normal urothelial cells by chronic arsenic exposure for 10 months. The purpose of the present study is to elucidate the relevant molecular alterationon on arsenic-induced malignant transformation.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from the passage-matched un-exposed cells, arsenic exposed cells, and BFTC 905 cells that was establsihed from arsenic exposed patient, as a series of process from normal to arsenic-induced cancer.
