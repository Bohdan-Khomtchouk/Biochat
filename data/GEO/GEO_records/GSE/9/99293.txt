TITLE
Repurposing tofacitinib as an anti-myeloma therapeutic to reverse growth-promoting effects of the bone marrow microenvironment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The myeloma bone marrow microenvironment promotes proliferation of malignant plasma cells and resistance to therapy. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and downstream JAK/STAT signaling are thought to be central components of these microenvironment-induced phenotypes.  In a prior drug repurposing screen, we identified tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor FDA-approved for rheumatoid arthritis, as an agent that may reverse the tumor-stimulating effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells.  Here, we validated both in vitro, in stromal-responsive human myeloma cell lines, and in vivo, in orthotopic disseminated murine xenograft models of myeloma, that tofacitinib showed both single-agent and combination therapeutic efficacy in myeloma models.  Surprisingly, we found that ruxolitinib, an FDA-approved agent targeting JAK1 and JAK2, did not lead to the same anti-myeloma effects.  Combination with a novel irreversible JAK3-selective inhibitor also did not enhance ruxolitinib effects.  RNA-seq and unbiased phosphoproteomics revealed that marrow stromal cells stimulate a JAK/STAT-mediated proliferative program in myeloma plasma cells, and tofacitinib reversed the large majority of these pro-growth signals.  Taken together, our results suggest that tofacitinib specifically reverses the growth-promoting effects of the tumor microenvironment through blocking an IL-6-mediated signaling axis.  As tofacitinib is already FDA-approved, these results can be rapidly translated into potential clinical benefits for myeloma patients.

DESIGN
Single-end 50 bp RNA-seq of MM.1S myeloma cell line either grown alone in monoculture, MM.1S isolated after 24 hr co-culture with immortalized HS5 bone marrow stromal cells, or HS5 bone marrow stromal cells grown alone
