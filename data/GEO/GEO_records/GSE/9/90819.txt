TITLE
Candida albicans: Control vs. sulfite-treated cells

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Candida albicans cells comparing control untreated C. albicans cells with sulfite-treated C. albicans cells. Sulfite is a toxic molecule that C. albicans encounters in its human host. Both wild type and ∆zcf2 mutant cells were used. The goal was to determine the effects of sulfite on C. albicans gene expression, and to determine which of the genes areZcf2-depedent.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, C. albicans cells vs. sulfite-treated C. albicans cells. 2 strains used: wild type and ∆zcf2 mutant cells. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates for each strain, 2 sulfite-treated replicates for each strain. Two technical replicates for each biological replicate in which the flourescent dyes were swapped.
