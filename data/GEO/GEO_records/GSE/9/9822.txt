TITLE
Expression profiling in lymphoblastoid cell lines of family with maternally inherited non-syndromic hearing loss.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed samples from fourteen deaf individuals (Affected 1 through 14), fifteen hearing maternally related family members (Unaffected 1-15), six marry-in controls (Controls 1-6) from extended pedigree from Arab-Israeli village, and nine individuals from another Arab-Israeli village (Controls 7-15). All affected and unaffected maternally-related individuals carry homoplasmic mutation in the 12S rRNA gene of the mitochondrial DNA, associated with both non-syndromic and aminoglycosides-induced deafness. Keywords: Comparison of genome-wide expression in cell lines of maternally-related individuals with mitochondrial mutation and controls carrying wild-type mitochondrial chromosome.
