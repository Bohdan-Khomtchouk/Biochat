TITLE
MCMV Infection of Developing Central Nervous System, Developmental and Immunological Response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prenatal Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection often causes CNS maldevelopment.  In a murine model, we detect Murine Cytomegalovirus (MCMV) in brain following intra-peritoneal inoculation at birth. Infected mice show impaired cerebellar development and impaired neurologic function on a beam balance test as adults. Among developmental genes differentially regulated, hindbrain expression of the homeodomain transcription factor HOXa5 was reduced with infection, and fewer HOXa5 expressing neurons were found in vestibular nuclei.  Based on the hypothesis that immune activation connects focal viral infection and global CNS maldevelopment, we defined the components of CNS immune response.  Flow cytometry showed a large increase in both number and activation of CNS monocytes.  Monocytes were found in close association with infected cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Oligonucleotide microarrays contained herein identified many differentially expressed genes related to innate immune response.  Chemokines, cytokines, cell surface receptors, and proteases are some of the many immunological genes shown to be differentially regulated by MCMV infection. These results together show that MCMV infection induces a complex immune response associated with changes in developmental gene expression and lasting neurologic defecit. Keywords: disease state comparison (virus infection) and competetive hybridization for expression analysis
