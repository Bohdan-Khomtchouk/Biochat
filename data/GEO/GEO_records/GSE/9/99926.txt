TITLE
Gene expression data from primary human hepatocytes treated with GGF2 for 6, 24, or 72 h or 24 h with a 48 h washout.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GGF2 is a recombinant human neuregulin-1Î² in development for chronic heart failure. Phase 1 clinical trials of GGF2 were put on hold when transient elevations in serum aminotransferases and total bilirubin were observed in 2 of 43 subjects receiving GGF2. However, aminotransferase elevations were modest and not typical of liver injury sufficient to result in elevated serum bilirubin. Several translational approaches were used to understand the liver response associated with GGF2. Gene expression profiling was performed in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes treated with GGF2 (0-3760 pM) for up to 72 h. Prior cytochrome P450 induction studies had unexpectedly demonstrated suppression of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) mRNA in primary human hepatocytes exposed to GGF2 for 24 h. Although no direct cytotoxicity was observed in response to GGF2, the suppression of CYP3A4 transcript levels in primary hepatocyte cultures had a temporal profile consistent with the transient bilirubin elevations observed in vivo. While downregulation of CYP3A4 alone should not influence serum bilirubin levels, it was reasoned that concomitant alterations in the expression of other liver proteins, such as those involved in bilirubin transport, could help to explain the liver response.

DESIGN
92 samples were analyzed representing N=1 per donor, time point, and treatment except 2 samples (Donor 4: 6 h: 0.376 pM GGF2 and Donor 5: 24 h: 0.1% GGF2 Buffer) that failed QC and 6 samples (Donor 1: 6 h) that clustered together and were > 3 SD away from the mean on a PCA plot suggesting that these samples may also be aberrant and were therefore omitted from analysis.
