TITLE
The role of Tmub1 protein in the regulation of hepatic cell transcription

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Tmub1 is involved in liver regeneration and functions as a bridging protein in tumor cell proliferation. To investigate the transcriptional profile and potential biological processes affected by Tmub1 expression in normal rat hepatocytes, microarray and bioinformatics experiments were used to identify 127 mRNAs differentially expressed between Tmub1-overexpression, Tmub1-knockdown and normal BRL-3A cells (fold change ≥ 2.5, P < 0.05).

DESIGN
Tmub1-overexpression, Tmub1-knockdown, 2 Negative Control and normal  BRL-3A cells (fold change ≥ 2.5, P < 0.05). Five independent.
