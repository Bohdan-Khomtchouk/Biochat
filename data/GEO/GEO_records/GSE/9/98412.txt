TITLE
Role of JunB in Th17 cell effector stability [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we identify the activator protein-1 (AP-1) factor JunB as an essential regulator of Th17 cell identity. JunB activates the expression of Th17 lineage-specifying genes, and coordinately represses genes controlling Th1 and Treg fate. Through regulatory analysis, we find that JunB is a core regulator of global transcriptional programs that promote Th17 cell identity and restrict alternative CD4+ T cell potential.

DESIGN
Examination of JunB and JunD occupancy in Junb+/+CD4cre and Junbfl/flCD4cre 48 hour in vitro polarized Th17 cell cultures
