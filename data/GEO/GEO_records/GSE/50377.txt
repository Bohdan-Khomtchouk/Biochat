TITLE
Mining gene expression data for low doses of radiation and pollutants (dioxin, toluene, formaldehyde)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of  Drosophila melanogaster in response to ionizing radiation, formaldehyde, toluene, and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis on 25,415 transcripts to measure the change in gene expression in males and females separately. An analysis of the genes unique to each treatment yielded a list of genes as a gene expression signature. In the case of radiation exposure, both sexes exhibited a reproducible increase in their expression of the transcription factors  sugarbabe  and  tramtrack.

PLATFORM
