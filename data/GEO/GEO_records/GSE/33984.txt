TITLE
KSHV regulation of gene expression in the human endothelial cell line EAHY

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KSHV promotes endothelia to mesenchymal transformation (EntMT) in EAHY cells We have used Affymetrix Gene Arrays to investigate the patterns of regulation of gene expression in EAHY cells infected with KSHV in comparison to uninfected EAHY cells

DESIGN
EAHY cells were infected with rKSHV.219 virus (derived from the virus-producing VERO cells). 12 days after infection and in puromycin selection to achieve greater than 90% infection RNA was exctrated from KSHV infected and control non-infected cells.
