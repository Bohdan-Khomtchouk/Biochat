TITLE
Hypoxia transcriptome sequencing of blind mole rat (BMR, Spalax galili) and rat (Rattus norvegicus)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus ; Nannospalax galili

SUMMARY
Deep sequencing of mRNA from Spalax galili and Rattus norvegicus

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from the brain of female BMRs under various oxygen concentrations (3%, 6%, 10%, 14%, and 21%) for 6 hours. We also got RNAs from the brain of rats under 6%, 10%, 14%, and 21% oxygen conditions.
