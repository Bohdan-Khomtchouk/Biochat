TITLE
Microglia-specific microarray analysis at early symptomatic age in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of microglia in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis identified the dysregulation of Brca1.

DESIGN
Microglia were purified by FACS in SOD1 G93A mice and control littermates at P90 days of age. Gene profiles were then compared.
