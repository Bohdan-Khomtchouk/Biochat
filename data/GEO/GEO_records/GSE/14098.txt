TITLE
Gene expression profiles obtained from laser-microdissected human choroid plexus papilloma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles generated from human tumor cells laser-microdissected from surgical samples of seven choroid plexus papillomas (Grade I WHO) as eight samples of epithelial cells lasermicrodissected from normal choroid plexus obtained at autopsy.

DESIGN
Choroid plexus tumors are rare pediatric brain tumors derrived from the choroid plexus epithelium. Gene expression profiles of lasermicrodissected tumor cells from 7 individual choroid plexus tumor samples obtained at surgery were compared to gene expression profiles from non-neoplastic choroid plexus epithelial cells lasermicrodissected from normal non-neoplastic choroid plexus obtained at autopsy (Am J Surg Pathol. 2006 Jan;30(1):66-74.) in order to identfy genes differentially expressed in choroid plexus tumor cells.
