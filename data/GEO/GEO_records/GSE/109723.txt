TITLE
Analysis of transcriptome of Reaumuria songarica and differentially expressed genes in UV-B stressed plants

ORGANISM
Hololachna songarica

SUMMARY
Reaumuria soongorica (Pall.) Maxim., a typical species of desert plant, presents excellent tolerability to adverse environment. Until yet, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance in R. soongorica. Herein, we used the RNA-seq to study the transcriptome of R. soongorica leaves

DESIGN
The experiment was arranged with two groups (untreated,and UV-B radiation treated)

PLATFORM
GPL24548 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Hololachna songarica)
