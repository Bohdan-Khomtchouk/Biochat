TITLE
Methylation profiling defines a widespread field defect in histologically normal prostate tissue associated with prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We evaluated the presence of genome-wide epigenetic differences at 385,000 loci using Encode HG18 DNA methylation arrays in 5 non-tumor-associated (NTA) and 4 histologically undistinguished tumor-associated (TA) prostate tissues. We identified 615 probes to be differentially methylated (p < 0.05) in TA prostate, with 537 (87%) hypomethylated and 78 (13%) hypermethylated.

DESIGN
comparison of methylation in NTA to TA prostate tissue

PLATFORM
