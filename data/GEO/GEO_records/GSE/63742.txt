TITLE
Expression data from rat liver tissue during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The liver has extraordinary powers of regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH). Changes of gene expression play a key role in cell proliferation and differentiation during liver regeneration (LR). To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying LR, this study was designed to assess the changes of rat hepatic gene expression in a timely manner. We used microarrays to further highlight the regulatory role of rat liver tissue in liver regeneration at gene transcription level.

DESIGN
Rat liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH) is a good model to study the regulation of cell proliferation. We gained regenerating liver at 9 time points (2, 6, 12,24, 30, 36, 72, 120, and 168h) after PH and measured gene expression profiles of rat liver tissue from 2h to 168h with rat Genome 230 2.0 gene chip. Each sample corresponding to one time point was hybridized onto one array. The experiment was repeated 3 times for each time point. In total, 10 time points were measured and 0h was used control group. After careful quality control analyses of each chip, Affymetrix GCOS 2.0 software was used to analyze the data. The relevance of gene expression profiles and biological processes was analyzed by bioinformatics and systems biology.
