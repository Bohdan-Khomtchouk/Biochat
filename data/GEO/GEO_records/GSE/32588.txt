TITLE
Expression analysis of channel catfish anterior kidney at 48h post immersion challenge of vaccinated fish (28 days post vaccination with attenuated Edwardsiella ictaluri) with virulent E. ictaluri

ORGANISM
Ictalurus punctatus

SUMMARY
To determine the global gene transcriptional changes in vaccinated channel catfish anterior kidney after immersion challenge with a virulent Edwardsiella ictaluri compared to sham vaccinated catfish control. The attenuated Edwardsiella ictaluri used for vaccination was Aquavac-ESC which was commercially available, the virulent strain of Edwardsiella ictaluri is the AL93-58 strain.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA samples including 3 controls (no vaccination, no challenge) and 3 treated groups (challenge after vaccination). Each RNA sample used for microarray was pooled fish anterior kidney samples (5 fish anterior kidney samples were pooled as one). Each chip measrues the expression level of 65,182 genes. For each sequence, 3 probes were selected. Two copies were prepared on arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL14562 AAHRU_Channel catfish_65K array
