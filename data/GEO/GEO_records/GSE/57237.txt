TITLE
Gene expression in the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN) of hyperglycemic 16-week-old Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice compared to expression the PLN of euglycemic 16-week-old NOD mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These experiments were performed to identify differentially expressed genes in the pancreatic lymph nodes of hyperglycemic NOD mice with high levels of destructive insulitis compared to euglycemic mice with lower levels of insulitis.

DESIGN
The pancreatic lymph nodes of 16-week-old hyperglycemic and euglycemic NOD mice were isolated and homogenized in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).  Total RNA was extracted from the aqueous phase using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 Nano Reagent Kit (Agilent). Total RNA from the PLN of hyperglycemic mice (n=2) were labelled with Cy5 and run individually against a pool of Cy3-labeled total RNA isolated from euglycemic mice (n=2). Microarrays were performed using the Whole Mouse Genome Microarray Kit, 4Ã—44K 2-color arrays (Agilent Technologies).
