TITLE
LncRNAs expression profiles in the livers of C57Bl/6 mice after partial hepatectomy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver regeneration has important implications because many therapeutic strategies for the surgical treatment of liver diseases, such as removal of liver tumors and liver transplantation, depend on the ability of the liver to regenerate physically and functionally. Recent studies reported that lncRNAs control cell proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of lncRNAs in liver regeneration and the overall mechanisms remain largely unknown. To address this issue, we carried out a genome-wide lncRNA microarray analysis during liver regeneration in mice after 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH) at various time points. The results revealed differential expression of thousands of lncRNAs during liver regeneration.

DESIGN
Six-week-old male wildtype C57Bl/6 mouse liver samples were obtained at 0, 1.5, 12, and 24 hours after 2/3 PH, and three mice were analyzed for each time point. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol.Mouse Stringent LncRNA Array (4 x 44K, ArrayStar, Rockville, MD) were used to monitor the expression level of approximately 14000 lncRNAs identified from the NCBI RefSeq, UCSC, RNAdb2.0, NRED, Fantom3.0 and UCRs. LncRNAs differentially expressed were identified by comparing expression levels during liver regeneration in mice after 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH) at various time points.
