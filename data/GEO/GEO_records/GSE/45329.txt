TITLE
Leukocyte gene expression variation as a function of perceived family stress and psychological well-being

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Individual differences in basal leukocyte gene expression profiles as a function of child's and parent's perception of family stress, and as a function of parent's psychological well-being.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was carried out on peripheral blood mononuclear cell mRNA samples collected from 273 individuals (129 parent:child pairs + 15 parent-or-child) who were also assessed on their perceptions of family stress (both parent's and child's perception). Each dyad is labeled by a case ID, with p suffix indicating parent's gene expression profile and c suffix indicating child's gene expression profile.  Variations in gene expression are analyzed as a function of both parent's perception of family stress and child's perception of family stress (using UCLA Life Stress Interview, as previously described: Hammen C (1991) Generation of stress in the course of unipolar depression. J Abnorm Psychol 100:555-561; Adrian C, Hammen C (1993) Stress Exposure and Stress Generation in Children of Depressed Mothers. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology 61:354-359; Rudolph KD, Hammen C (1999) Age and gender as determinants of stress exposure, generation, and reactions in youngsters: A transactional perspective. Child Development 70:660-677).  Higher values indicate greater levels of subjectively perceived family stress.  Additional data are available for 107 parents who completed all 6 subscales of the Psychological Well-Being (PWB) Scale (Ryff CD (1989) Happiness is everything, or is it?  Explorations on the meaning of psychological well-being. J. Pers Soc. Psychol 57: 1069-1081), resulting in scores for PWB_Total (average score across all 6 subscales) as well as scores for subscales measuring Purpose in Life (PWB_Purpose), Environmental Mastery (PWB_Environmental_Mastery), Self-Acceptance (PWB_Self_Accept), Autonomy (PWB_Autonomy), Personal Growth (PWB_Growth), Positive Relations with Others (PWB_Relationship).  Higher scores indicate greater psychological well being.  Also available for those individuals are measures of age (years), male gender (0/1), ethnic group (1=White, 2=Chinese, 3=Indian, 4=Other Asian, 5=Other Ethnicity), Body Mass Index (kg/m^2), heavy alcohol consumption history (0/1), smoking history (0/1), and abundance of 8 mRNA transcripts indicating the relative prevalence of major leukocyte subsets (CD3E, CD3D, CD19, CD4, CD8A, FCGR3A, NCAM1, CD14). key word: Risk prediction
