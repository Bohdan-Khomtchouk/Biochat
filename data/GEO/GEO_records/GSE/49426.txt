TITLE
Global analysis of NFATc1 targets in human vascular endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed the newly mapping of genome-wide NFATc1 binding events in VEGF-stimulated primary cultured endothelial cells, by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). Combined NFATc1 ChIP-seq profile and the epigenetic histone marks revealed that predominant NFATc1-occupied peaks were overlapped with promoter marking but not silencer marking. DNA microarrays with NFATc1 expression or knockdown indicated the predominant NFATc1 binding targets were correlated with induced patterns.

DESIGN
To determine NFATc1-regulated genes, a total of 5 samples were derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated with or without 50ng/mL VEGF (VEGF 60min and 0min, respectively), pretreated with cyclosporine A (VEGF 60min plus CsA) and infected with adenovirus expressing the control or constitutively active NFATc1 (Ad-control and Ad-NFATc1).
