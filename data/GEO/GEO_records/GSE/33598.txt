TITLE
Genomic exploration of monozygotic twins discordant (MZD) for schizophrenia uncovers de novo mutations (DNM) and reveals candidate genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined six pairs of monozygotic twins discordant (MZD) for schizophrenia and identified copy number variation (CNV) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences between affected and unaffected co-twins using the Affymetrix Genome Wide SNP 6.0.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacurer's protocol on DNA extracted from whole blood CNV analysis was done using Affymetrix Genotyping Console 4.0 and Partek Genotyping Suite

PLATFORM
GPL6801 [GenomeWideSNP_6] Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array
