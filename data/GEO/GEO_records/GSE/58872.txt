TITLE
mRNA expression data from BCR-ABL, MYC and CD22DE12 transgenic mouse models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Leukemic splenocytes from these commercial transgenic mice that developed fatal leukemia with massive splenomegaly were isolated at the time of the necropsy and subjected to gene expression profiling and phosphoprotein profiling in side by side comparison with CD22DE12-Tg BPL or CD22DE12_BCR-ABL double transgenic cells.

DESIGN
Mouse leukemia cells were isolated from markedly enlarged spleens of CD22DE12-Tg (N=2), BCR-ABL-Tg (N=2), EÂµ-MYC Tg mice (N=2) and Splenocytes from wildtype healthy C57BL/6 mice served as controls (N=4).
