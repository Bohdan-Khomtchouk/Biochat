TITLE
Expression data from epigenetic memory and preferential lineage-specific differentiation in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from human pancreatic islet beta cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines were generated from pancreatic BCD (beta-cell-derived cells).  One iPS cell clone was derived from pancreatic non-beta cells. We used microarrays to study the gene expression profiles of beta-iPSCs, and compared the expression of genes in their somatic parental cells and other ES and iPS cells.

DESIGN
All BiPSC lines were tested in pluripotency assays (including morphology, immunostainings and qRT-PCR) for known pluripotency markers, as well as differentiation capacity in vivo and  in vitro.
