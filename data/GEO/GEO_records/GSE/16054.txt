TITLE
Transient expression of misfolded surfactant protein C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mutations in the SFTPC gene associated with interstitial lung disease in human patients result in misfolding, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention, and degradation of the encoded surfactant protein C (SP-C) proprotein. To identify candidate genes involved in ER quality control of SP-C, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with mutant SP-C (SP-CÎ”exon4 or SP-CL188Q), SP-CWT, or vector cDNAs, and global changes in gene expression were assessed by microarray analyses. Microarray analysis demonstrated that the SPC exon 4 deletion and SPC L188Q mutations invoke very similar transcriptional profiles including the activation of major players mediating ER response and unfolding protein response (UPR) in transient transfection system. In combination with promoter scan (UPRE, ERSE, XBP1 sites) and protein domain analysis (Finding ER Lumen, ER Membrane retention signal, J-Domain and Leucine Zipper domain), we were able to not only verify the known ERAD components (XBP1, Bip, Erdj4 & 5), but also identify multiple ER components which may play critical roles in the detection and /or degradation of mutant SPC, which in turn will help us to gain better understanding of the entire mammalian ERAD machinery.

DESIGN
samples consisted of HEK293 cells  transiently transfected with wild-type SP-C (WT), the delta exon4 mutant of SP-C (Ex4) or L188Q mutant of SP-C (LQ). Groups were performed in triplicate.
