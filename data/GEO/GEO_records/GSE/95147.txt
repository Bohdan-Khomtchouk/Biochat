TITLE
Gene expression data from WT and TET2cKO CD8+ T cells activated in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The epigenetic modifier TET2 plays a role in cell fate decisions in hematopeotic stem cells and CD4+ Th1 and Th17 differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that loss of TET2 promotes CD8+ memory differentiation following acute viral infection with LCMV-Armstrong. To identify early gene expression changes following TCR activation in WT versus TET2cKO CD8+ T cells, we isolated naive CD8+ T cells and activated them for three days with anti-CD3/CD28+IL-2 and performed microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Naive (CD44lo CD62Lhi) CD8+ T cells were isolated and sorted from WT C57BL/6  and TET2fl/flCD4Cre+ mice. These cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 for 3 days in the presence of 100U/ml hIL-2. RNA from these in vitro activated CD8+ T cells were processed, amplified, labeled and hybridized to  Affymetrix GeneChip MoGene 2.0 ST microarrays.
