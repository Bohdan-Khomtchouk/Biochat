TITLE
Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox factor-1 (Ape1/Ref-1) activates Notch signaling through Jagged1 expression and promotes colon cancer progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the possible role of Ape1/Ref-1 in tumorigenicity of colon cancer and explored the oncogenic mechanism of Ape1/Ref-1 in colon cancer cells.

DESIGN
Control and Ref-1 overexpressing SW480cells, control and Ref-1-deficient SW480 cells. Duplicate
