TITLE
Analysis of therapeutic miRNA against KRAS mutant colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the profile of miRNAs expressed in HEK293 and MRC5 cells that overexpressed KRASG12V to those expressed in parental cells that harbored wild-type KRAS. The results indicated that a subset of miRNAs was significantly down-regulated in KRASG12V transfected two cells.

DESIGN
To address the functional relevance of miRNAs in KRAS mutant cancers, we transfected exogenous KRASG12V into HEK293 and MRC5 cells with wild type KRAS genes, and we comprehensively profiled the dysregulated miRNAs.
