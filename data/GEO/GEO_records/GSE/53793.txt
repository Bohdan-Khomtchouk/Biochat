TITLE
Deep sequencing of the murine olfactory receptor neuron transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The recent development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques encouraged us to assess the transcriptome of the murine OE. We analyzed RNA from OEs of female and male adult mice and from fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) obtained from transgenic OMP-GFP mice

DESIGN
The Illumina RNA-Seq protocol was utilized to generate up to 86 million reads per transcriptome.
