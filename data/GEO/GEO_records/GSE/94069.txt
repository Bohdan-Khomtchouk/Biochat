TITLE
Early temporal transcriptome responses of the bovine mid-cycle corpus luteum to prostaglandin F2 alpha indicates cytokine activation

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In ruminants, prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2α)-mediated luteolysis is essential for resumption of the estrous cycle and is a target for improving fertility.  To deduce the early PGF2α-provoked signaling elicited in the corpus luteum a time-course from 0.5–4 h was performed on cows at mid-cycle.  A microarray-determined transcriptome was established and analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).  Self-organizing map analysis grouped differentially expressed transcripts into ten mRNA expression patterns indicative of signaling cascades. Classic PGF2α signaling (cyclic adenosine monophosphate, mitogen-activated protein kinases) and cytokine signaling (nuclear factor κB, interleukin) were both predicted by IPA after PGF2α administration.  Comparison with two analogous datasets revealed a conserved group of 124 transcripts similarly changed in each dataset, which also predicted cytokine signaling.  Elevated levels of cytokine transcripts after PGF2α and IPA-predicted activation of cytokine pathways demonstrate the importance of inflammatory reactions early in PGF2α -mediated luteolysis.

DESIGN
Adult cows at midcycle were grouped (3 cows/group) into four PGF2α treatment times of: 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h, and a saline control.  Corpus luteum RNA was analyzed by Affymetrix microarray.
