TITLE
Expression of M-CSF from cryopreserved teeth-derived human periodontal ligament cells with different freezing protocols

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study investigated which genes regarding root resorption are upregulated by cryopreservation and whether cryopreservation affects the expression of Macrophage –colony stimulating factor. We manufactured the customized template which was made of genes selected regarding root resorption including osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL), RANKL’s cognate receptor (RANK), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) and analyzed gene expression.

DESIGN
cultured human periodontal ligament cells (control) VS cryopreserved and cultured periodontal ligament cells(cryopreserved group): 3 control replicates, 3 cryopreserved replicates
