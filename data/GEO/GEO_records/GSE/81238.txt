TITLE
Analysis of differential gene expression during Bacillus subtilis spore outgrowth in high-salinity environments using RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
Overall, salt stress seemed to slow down the complex molecular reorganization processes (‘ripening’) of outgrowing spores by exerting detrimental effects on vegetative functions such as amino acid metabolism.
