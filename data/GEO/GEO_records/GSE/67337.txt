TITLE
Functional Antagonism Between CELF and Mbnl Proteins in Cytoplasm and Nucleus [RNA Bind-N-Seq]

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The CUG-BP and ETR-3-like factor 1 (Celf1) RNA binding protein plays an important role in heart and muscle development, and is over-expressed in the disease myotonic dystrophy.  Celf1 has known roles in regulation of RNA splicing, RNA stability, and protein translation.  To identify transcriptome-wide targets of the Celf1 protein, we performed CLIP-seq against Celf1 using the 3B1 antibody, in myoblasts, heart tissue, and muscle tissue.

DESIGN
RNA Bind-N-Seq was performed using recombinant CELF1 protein in the presence of competing amounts of recombinant MBNL1 protein.
