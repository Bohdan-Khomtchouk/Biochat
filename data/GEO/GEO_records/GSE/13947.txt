TITLE
Oligonucleotide DNA microarray profiling identifies novel genes involved in lung adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to find novel gene(s) involved in the development of lung adenocarcinomas (AD) using an oligonucleotide based DNA microarray platform with a selected set of genes from Human Apoptosis Subset v2.0 and Human Cancer Subset v3.0 (Operon).

DESIGN
In order to identify possible novel genes involved in the development of lung ADs we analysed the expression profile of 12 lung adenocarcinomas. We used dual color approach. Tumour tissue was labeled with Cy5 and corresponding normal tissue was labeled with Cy3. Each array contained at least 4 replicate spots for each gene analysed. Gene expression was obtained by calculating median from replicate spots.
