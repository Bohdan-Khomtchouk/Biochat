TITLE
Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expression array

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
cDNA expression array of epithelial phenotype untreated MDCK cells; after 30 days of TGFb treatment, which induces a mesenchymal phenotype; TGF-b-treated cells that are treated with 5-AZA for 72 h; and 30 days after TGFb withdrawal Gene expression was analyzed in a genome-wide manner, to asses those changes occurring upon TGF-b-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), those that are stimulated by treatment with a demethylating agent, and which are restored after TGF-b withdrawal

DESIGN
Two replicates for untreated and TGFb treated, and one sample for 5-AZA and TGFb withdrawal
