TITLE
SIRT1 deficiency in microglia contributes to cognitive decline in aging and neurodegeneration via epigenetic regulation of IL-1beta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aging is the predominant risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. One key phenotype as brain ages is the aberrant innate immune response characterized by proinflammation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying aging-associated proinflammation are poorly defined. Whether chronic inflammation plays a causal role in cognitive decline in aging and neurodegeneration has not been established. Here we established a mechanistic link between chronic inflammation and aging microglia, and demonstrated a causal role of aging microglia in neurodegenerative cognitive deficits. Expression of microglial SIRT1 reduces with the aging of microglia. Genetic reduction of microglial SIRT1 elevates IL-1β selectively, and exacerbates cognitive deficits in aging and in transgenic mouse models of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Interestingly, the selective activation of IL-1β transcription by SIRT1 deficiency is likely mediated through hypomethylating the proximal promoter of IL-1β. Consistent with our findings in mice, selective hypomethylation of IL-1β at two CpG sites are found in normal aging humans and demented patients with tauopathy. Our findings reveal a novel epigenetic mechanism in aging microglia that contributes to cognitive deficits in neurodegenerative diseases.
