TITLE
Expression profile of PC12 cells stimulated by nerve growth factor measured by Agilent microarray

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the comprehensive gene expression changes by nerve growth factor (NGF) in PC12 cells using Agilent microarrays. The genes of 1920 NGF treated were up-regulated and 2670 genes were down-regulated significantly compared with the control group. The expression level of genes involved in cell structure and proteolysis were up-regulated. On the other hand, the genes of cell cycle and some metabolism were rather down-regulated. Therefore, it is suggested that it is necessary to stop the cell cycle and down-regulate metabolism to neurite outgrowth.

DESIGN
Gene regulation associated with the differentiation program in PC12 cells still needs to be elucidated. We analyzed the genes expression with Agilent microarrays after 6 hours of NGF treatment by the one-color method, and found 2099 genes were up-regulated and 2781 genes were down-regulated.
