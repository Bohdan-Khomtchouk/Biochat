TITLE
Sex-dependent and -independent X-chromosome histone modifications in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila X chromosomes are subject to dosage compensation in males and are known to have a specialized chromatin structure in the male soma.  We are interested in how specific chromatin structure change contributes to X chromosome hyperactivity and dosage compensation. We have conducted a global analysis of localize two dosage compensation complex dependent histone marks H4AcK16 and H3PS10 and one dosage compensation complex independent histone mark H3diMeK4 in the genome, especially on X chromosome by ChIP-chip approach in both male and female adult flies. We also probed general genomewide chromatin structure by deep DNA sequencing of sheared ChIP input DNA from male and female adult flies.

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed in 5-7 day aged adult male and female flies with three histone modification antibodies. ChIP enriched DNA and input DNA was labeled by Cy3 or Cy5 dye separately and hybridized simultaneously to the Drosophila FlyGEM arrays. At least two biological replicates were performed for each antibody and sex. DNA-seq (NIDDK-Drosophila-Illumina-DNASeq) were performed on ChIP-input sheared DNA to check the general chromatin structure of different chromosome.
