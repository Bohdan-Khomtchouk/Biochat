TITLE
The specific role of RhoC in tumor invasion and metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The molecules RhoC and RhoA are essential factors for invasion/metastasis of  tumor cells proliferation, respectively.  RhoC over-expression was especially linked to aggressive cancers, which requires loss of epithelial polarity and deregulation of cellular adhesion. This epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) includes a change in gene expression pattern through several transcription factors, like Snail, ZEB1 or Twist. Here we analyze the potential of RhoC to induce EMT, migration and invasion and to regulate specific genes involved in tumorigenesis. We established stable MCF-10A cell lines with RhoA/RhoC expression under the control of a doxycycline-regulated trans-activator and a transcriptional silencer allowing conditional expression of RhoA and RhoC, respectively. We additionally quantified the transcriptional response from two bacterial toxins: Escherichia coli Cytotoxic Necrotizing Factor 1 (CNF1) and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis Cytotoxic Necrotizing Factor (CNFY) to directly activate the endogenous pool of Rho GTPases and characterized changes in morphology, migration and invasion upon induction of RhoA/RhoC expression or activation by the toxins in MCF-10A grown in  two- and three-dimensions. The transcriptome response identified PTGS2 as  RhoC specific target genes involved in pro-migratory changes which was experimentally validated.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted in biological duplicates from (i) CNF1 and CNFY treated and untreated organoids at one and seven days after induction and from (ii) organoids transfected with an RhoA or RhoC shRNA coding pGIPZ Vector with or without addition of doxycycline at days one and seven after induction
