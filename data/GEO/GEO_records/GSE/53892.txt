TITLE
The Demethylase JMJD2C/KDM4C Localizes to H3K4me3 Positive Transcription Start Sites (Affymetrix microarray analysis)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have mapped transcriptional changes after depletion of the histone demethylases JMJD2C/GASC1/KDM4C and JMJD2A/KDM4A alone or in combination in the esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line, KYSE150. The KYSE150 cell line contains an amplification of the JMJD2C locus.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from KYSE150 cells transfected with shRNAs targeting JMJD2C and/or JMJD2A. The experiment was performed in triplicates and expression levels analyzed using Affymetrix microarrays.
