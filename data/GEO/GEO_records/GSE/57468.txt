TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling in bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMM) cells upon RANKL treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To screen for altered gene expression during osteoclastogenesis, RANKL-treated BMM cells were subjected to gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
BMM cells were treated with M-CSF and RANKL for 0, 1, 2 and 3 days. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by gene expression microarray using the MouseRef-8 v2.0 Expression BeadChip.
