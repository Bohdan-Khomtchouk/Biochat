TITLE
Genomic and phenotypic alterations of  the neuronal-like cells derived from the human embryonal carcinoma stem cells (NT2) caused by exposure to the organophosphorus compounds paraoxon and mipafox

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
hNT2 under neurodifferentiation were exposed during 4 days to 1 µM of the non-neuropathic organophosphorus compound paraoxon and 5 µM of the neuropathic organophosphorus compound and afterwards transcriptomics were analysed and compared regarding control non-exposed cells Exposure to paraoxon caused alteration of 137 genes while only a single gene was altered after exposure to mipafox

DESIGN
Comparing two experimental conditions: control versus paraoxon or mipafox exposed cells. Three biological replicates.
