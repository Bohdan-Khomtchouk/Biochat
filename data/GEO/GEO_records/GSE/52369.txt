TITLE
Tight Junction Protein 1 is a Modulator and Biomarker of Proteasome Inhibitor Sensitivity in Multiple Myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Proteasome inhibitors are important chemotherapeutics in the treatment of multiple myeloma, but they are currently used empirically as no markers of sensitivity have been validated.  We have identified expression of tight junction protein (TJP) 1 as being associated with sensitivity of plasma cells in vitro and in vivo to proteasome inhibitors.  TJP1 suppressed expression of genes in the major histocompatibility class II region, including two catalytically active immunoproteasome subunits, thereby decreasing proteasome activity, a critical determinant of proteasome inhibitor sensitivity.  This occurred through suppression by TJP1 of signaling through the epidermal growth factor receptor/Janus kinase 1/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway.  In the clinic, high TJP1 expression in myeloma patients was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of responding to bortezomib, and with a longer time-to-progression after treatment.  Taken together, these data support the use of TJP1 as a biomarker of sensitivity and resistance to proteasome inhibitors.

DESIGN
To further elucidate mechanisms of bortezomib resistance, we developed human-derived multiple myeloma cell lines with a 4-fold or greater resistance to bortezomib. Then total RNA for bortezomib resistant (BR) and wild type (WT) was extracted and used for comparison by gene expression profiling.
