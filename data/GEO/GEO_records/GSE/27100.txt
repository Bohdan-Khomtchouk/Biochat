TITLE
Integrated miRNA-mRNA-analysis of human monocyte derived macrophages upon Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The host response to mycobacterial infections was studied after infection of macrophages derived from primary human monocytes. mRNA and miRNA expression studies were performed to identify key regulators of immune defence and their targets.
