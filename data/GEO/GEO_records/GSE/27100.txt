TITLE
Integrated miRNA-mRNA-analysis of human monocyte derived macrophages upon Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The host response to mycobacterial infections was studied after infection of macrophages derived from primary human monocytes. mRNA and miRNA expression studies were performed to identify key regulators of immune defence and their targets.

DESIGN
Experimental samples were taken 6h, 24h and 48h after infection of monocyte derived macrophages with two mycobacterial strains (MAH10091 and MAH104)
