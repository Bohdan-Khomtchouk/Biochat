TITLE
Gene expression profiles in rat alveolar macrophages exposure to exfoliated graphene (EGr)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To further development of our gene expression approach to assess the effects of manufactured nanomaterials at the transcriptional level, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to distinguish characterization of physicochemical properties of exfoliated graphene (EGr).

DESIGN
Exfoliated graphene (EGr) induced gene expression in rat alveolar macrophages were measured at 24 hours exposure to doses of 0.01mg/mL. The experiments were performed using control for each experiment (n=4).

PLATFORM
GPL7294 Agilent-014879 Whole Rat Genome Microarray 4x44K G4131F (Probe Name version)
