TITLE
Phenotypically-anchored transcriptome profiling of developmental exposure to the antimicrobial agent, triclosan, reveals hepatotoxicity in embryonic zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We employed whole-genome microarray expression profiling in 48 hpf zebrafish to better understand the mechanism of action of the antimicrobial agent, triclosan (TCS)

DESIGN
TCS-induced transcriptional changes was measured in 48 hpf embryos exposed to 0 or 7.37 uM TCS from 6-48 hpf. Four biological replicates of 8 pooled whole embryos were used for each treatment

PLATFORM
GPL20686 Agilent-069507 ArrayXS_Danio_rerio_V1 (Probe Name version)
