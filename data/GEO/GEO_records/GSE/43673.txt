TITLE
Expression data from D. melanogaster pupal wings

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The goal of this gene expression profiling experiment was to identify the entire set of transcription factors expressed during late pupal wing development (~80h APF) when pigmentation genes are expressed

DESIGN
We used Affymetrix microarrays to profile the expression of the transcription factors in late pupal wings of Oregon R flies. The staging of the flies was made by eye, based on the extent of wing pigmentation. RNA was extracted from batches of 40 flies and three biological replicates were analyzed.
