TITLE
Total Gene expression analysis of Dppa4-trandformed 3T3s

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total gene expression analysis was performed on 3T3s transfomed by SV40, cMyc, or mDppa4 in relative to vector transduced control 3T3s. Intent was to analyze the role of mDppa4 in oncogenic transformation.

DESIGN
Oncogenic foci transduced with different oncogenes (SV40, c-Myc, or mDppa4) were picked and culture for RNA isolation. Vector transduced 3T3s were included as control. Total RNA was isolated for gene analysis.
