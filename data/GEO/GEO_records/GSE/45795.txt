TITLE
RNA messengers translated at the ER membrane

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In order to identify what RNA messengers are being translated at the ER membrane, membrane-associated polysomes were separated from free polysomes by subcellular fractionation of WT and delta-egd1/delta-egd2 yeast strains and associated RNA was isolated and then identified by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments
