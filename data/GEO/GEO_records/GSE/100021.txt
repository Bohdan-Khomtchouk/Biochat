TITLE
IGF-1 gene therapy in aging rats modulates hippocampal genes relevant to memory function

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In rats, learning and memory performance decline during normal aging, which makes this rodent species a suitable model to evaluate therapeutic strategies. In aging rats, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), is known to significantly improve spatial memory accuracy as compared to control counterparts. A constellation of gene expression changes underlie the hippocampal phenotype of aging but no studies on the effects of IGF-I on the hippocampal transcriptome of old rodents have been documented. Here, we assessed the effects of IGF-I gene therapy on spatial memory performance in old female rats and compared them with changes in the hippocampal transcriptome.

DESIGN
Hippocampal RNA-Seq profiles of 28 months old rats intracerebroventricularly injected with an adenovector expressing rat IGF-I was compared with placebo adenovector-injected counterparts (4 samples each group)
