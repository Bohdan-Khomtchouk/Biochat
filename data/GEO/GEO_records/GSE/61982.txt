TITLE
The overexpression of the pine transcription factor PpDof5 in Arabidopsis leads to increased lignin content and affects carbon and nitrogen metabolism.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpresing PpDof5, a transcription factor of Pinus pinaster. Plants were grown with nitrate or ammonium as unique source of nitrogen

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment: wt Arabidopsis vs. transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing PpDof5 grown with nitrate or ammonium. 2 Biological replicates and 2 technical replicates.
