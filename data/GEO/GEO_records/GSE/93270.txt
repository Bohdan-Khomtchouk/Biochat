TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of gene (mRNA) amd miRNA expression during mouse embryonic heart development [miRNA]

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Affymetrix whole genome gene (mRNA) and miRNA expression data  during the development period (from E10.5 to E19.5) and  expression data of adult (10 weeks old mice) as well as old  (14 months old mice) murine heart tissues For a more comprehensive understanding of the potential effects of miRNA for heart development, we carried out the first study of time-resolved parallel profiling of mRNA and miRNA levels in the developing murine heart and identify the dynamical activation or repression of numerous biological processes and signalling pathways
