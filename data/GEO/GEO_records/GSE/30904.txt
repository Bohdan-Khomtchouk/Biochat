TITLE
RIP-Chip analysis of Musashi (Msi1) in the Daoy human medulloblastoma cell line.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RIP-chip analysis to identify mRNA preferentially associated with Msi1 protein.

DESIGN
RIP-Chip experiments were performed on two biologically replicated samples transfected with the BAP-Msi1 construct and a control sample from cells transfected with the BAP-Control construct. A total of 8 microarrays were carried on using technical replicates of BAP-Msi1 vs. BAP-Control for each dye orientation.
