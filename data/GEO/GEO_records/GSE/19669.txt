TITLE
Cross-platform correlation analysis of global microRNA expression technologies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Two reference pools comprised of different miRNA content were hybridized to four different miRNA microarray platforms (Agilent, LC Sciences, Exiqon and a homemade chip (generated from an Inviteogen Ncode probeset)) This dataset includes the reference samples on the Agilent miRNA array. Keywords: miRNA

DESIGN
Two reference pools were created from commercially available reference RNA (FirstChoiceÂ® mouse Total RNA including the small fraction (Catalogue # AM7800-AM7828, Ambion, Streetsville, ON)). Reference #1 contained equal parts of mouse testicle, ovary and 10-12 day embryo. Reference #2 contained liver, heart and lung. These references were hybridized to four different miRNA microarray platforms (two in two colour, two in one-colour, with 4 replicates each). Data from each platform were normalized by cyclic lowess and analysed by correlation analyses both within and between platforms.
