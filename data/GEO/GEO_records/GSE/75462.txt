TITLE
Ribosome quality control is a central protection mechanism for yeast exposed to Deoxynivalenol and Trichothecin

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Trichothecenes, like deoxynivalenol (DON) are secondary metabolites of Fusarium species, and are major pollutants in cereal food and feed products. They inhibit eukaryotic protein synthesis, however with only partly resolved consequences for the cellular homeostasis. Here we report a systematic functional investigation of the effects of DON on exponential phase growing yeast cells using either short doses of DON or continuos treatment with DON.

DESIGN
Yeast cells were grown in exponential phase with 0, 12 or 24ppm DON treatment and with or without a 24h 24ppm DON pre-treatment and harvested at an OD600 of 1.0 or 1.5. Experiments were performed with 3 biological replicates except for sample T0.OD1.5 which only has 2 replicates for a total of 23 samples. The 0ppm DON treatment samples were used as controls.
