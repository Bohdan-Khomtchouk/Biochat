TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for experimental lingual carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identification of gene expression profiling during lingual tumorigenesis, tongue cancer was induced by oral delivery of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) at a dose of 50mg/L for 16weeks in C57BL/6 female mice. Nine samples of lingual mucosa from 0th (encoded as C in experiment), 12th ((encoded as M in experiment) and 28th ((encoded as E in experiment) week which were supposed as normality, early stage and cancer during lingual tumorigenesis were harvested for microarray. 2339, 2539 and 2482 genes were significantly varied between M vs. C, E vs. M and E vs. C respectively.

DESIGN
Chemical carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide induced gene expression in C57BL/6 female mice was measured at 0th (C), 12th (M) and 28th (E) week after oral delivery of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) at a dose of 50mg/L. Three independent experiments were performed at each time (0th ,12th ,28th week) using lingual mucosa.
