TITLE
Expression profile of splenocytes with glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) induced arthritis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore TNF-related genes in GPI-induced arthritis, we performed GeneChip analysis using arthritic splenocytes and control-immunized splenocytes. Among the arrayed TNFalpha-related genes, TIARP mRNA was highly expressed in arthritic splenocytes, with levels exceeding more than 20-times the control splenocytes

DESIGN
The spleens of three GPI-GST (MW=89 kD) (300 µg) -immunized DBA/1 mice were harvested on day 10. As a control, the spleens of three GST (MW=26 kd) (100 µg) -immunized DBA/1 mice were used. Total RNA was extracted from the splenocytes using Isogen (Nippon gene), then 15 ug of RNA was utilized for cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription followed by synthesis of biotinylated cRNA through in vitro transcription. After cRNA fragmentation, hybridization with mouse 430A2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) with probes for 43,000 mouse genes ESTs was performed according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Analysis was performed by gene expression software
