TITLE
CD13 and ROR2 permit isolation of highly enriched cardiac mesoderm from differentiating human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The resultant heat map demonstrates the maturation of CD13+/ROR2+ cells as they proceed through cardiac differentiation.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis was preformed on RNA samples from undifferentiated hESCs, 13R2+ and 13R2- populations from day 3, 13R2+/NKX2-5+ and 13R2+/NKX2-5- from day 7, and 13R2+/NKX2-5+/Î±-MHC+ and 13R2+/NKX2-5+/MHC- from day 14
