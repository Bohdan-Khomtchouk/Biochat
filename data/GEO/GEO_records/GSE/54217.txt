TITLE
Calcineurin signaling regulates neural induction through antagonizing the BMP pathway

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Calcineurin activity is required for neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC). We assessed gene expression changes at several time points of in vitro ESC to neural differentiation when calcineurin activity is inhibitied by its antagonist FK506 and Cyclosporin(CsA).

DESIGN
d4, d6, d8, and d12 EBs of FK506/CsA treatment group (d3-8) and its non-treated control group were harvested from three independent experiments of in vitro differentiation of 46C mouse ESCs. Total RNA of each sample was extracted, reverse transcribed, labeled and hybridized to Affymetric Mouse Gene ST 1.0 Arrays.

PLATFORM
