TITLE
TEL-AML1 (ETV6-RUNX1) in B-cells and leukemia (part 4)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified directly and indirectly regulated target genes utilizing an inducible TEL-AML1 system derived from the murine pro B-cell line BA/F3 and a monoclonal antibody directed against TEL-AML1. By integration of promoter binding identified with ChIP-on-chip, gene expression and protein output through microarray technology and stable labelling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), we identified directly and indirectly regulated targets of the TEL-AML1 fusion protein.

DESIGN
Bound promoter regions of immunoprecipitated TEL-AML1 associated genes were first compared to input material and enrichment was calculated. 3 independent replicates were performed.
