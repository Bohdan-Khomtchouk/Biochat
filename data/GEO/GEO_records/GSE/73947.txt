ZNF224 binding profiles in HEK293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ZNF224 is a Kruppel-associated box-containing zinc-finger protein which represses gene transcription by interacting with the KAP-1, WT1, PRMT5, and DEPDC1 co-repressors. In this study, we have found that ZNF224 functions as an oncogene in MCF7 cells. ZNF224 overexpression increases colony formation, cell growth, and cell survival against camptothecin (CPT) compared to control, and vice versa, upon siRNA knockdown of ZNF224. To examine the mechanism of ZNF224 as an oncogene, first we tried to identify DNA binding element (DBE) of ZNF224 through ChIP-sequencing, and found that ZNF224 could bind to elements containing 5'-CAGC-3' sequence, which was further confirmed by ELISA, SPR, qPCR, and luciferase activity assay. Based on these results, we found that ZNF224 binds to the MIR663A promoter. ZNF224 increased MIR663A transcription, which in turn binds to 3' UTR of p53 and p21 to decrease their expression. MIR663A antagonist abolished ZNF224-mediated suppression of p21 and p53, resulting in the enhanced apoptosis by CPT. The analyses using human breast ductal carcinoma tissues exhibited that the expression of ZNF224 and MIR663A was increased in cancer compared to its neighboring non-cancer region. Consequently, ZNF224 increases cell survival and decreases apoptosis by decreasing the expression of p53 and p21 via increasing the expression of MIR663A as a transcriptional activator. Taken together, we identified and characterized the DNA binding element of ZNF224 and its target genes, which provide novel insight into the role of ZNF224 in breast cancer.

DESIGN
The information of genome-wide ZNF224 binding sites in HEK293 cells transiently expressing the protein was generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx. Note: The data for the sample immunoprecipitated with normal mouse IgG antibody was not provided by the submitter.
