TITLE
Sip1 in cortical interneuron migration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from 6 samples of FACsorted telencephalons from E14.5 Sip1|Nkx2-1 knockout and WT|Nkx2-1 control mouse embryos to find differentially expressed genes in the absence of the transcription factor Sip1.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in 3 control and 3 Sip1|Nkx2-1 knockout samples
