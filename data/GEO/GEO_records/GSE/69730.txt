TITLE
TRAF6, a master activator of p53 transactivation, suppresses mitochondrial p53 and apoptosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TRAF6 -/- thymi display defects in IR-induced p53 target gene expression and attenuate further enhancement of apoptosis upon IR treatment. TRAF6-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of p53 at K24

DESIGN
2.5 week WT and TRAF6 null mice were IR (15Gy) treated for 10h, thymi were then isolated and RNA was extracted by standard Trizol methods.  H1299 cells were transfected with p53 wt and K24R mutant, RNA was extracted by standard Trizol methods.
