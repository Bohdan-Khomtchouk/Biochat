TITLE
Pseudomonas aeruginosa gene expression in artificial sputum medium using a broad capture array designated the PANarray

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
The PANarray design (GPL13324) contains the genes of eight P. aeruginosa genomes in non-redundant format, thus allowing identification of expression of non-PAO1 and other P. aeruginosa genes.

DESIGN
For the series GSE28152, isogenic isolates were sequentially collected from two cystic fibrosis (CF) patients several years apart. The isolates had not been eradicated in the meantime and represent persister strains. One was an Australian Epidemic Strain-1 isolate and the other a non-epidemic strain. Strains were cultured in an artificial sputum medium (ASMDM) closely resembling CF sputum.
