TITLE
Expression data from P7 mouse cerebral cortex and hippocampus -CTCF Nex-Cre mediated conditional knockout

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is key to chromatin conformational changes that promote cellular diversity, but nothing is known about its role in neurons. Here we produced mice with a conditional knockout (cKO) of CTCF in postmitotic projection neurons, mostly in the dorsal telencephalon. 390 transcripts were expressed at significantly different levels between CTCF-deficient and control cortex and hippocampus.

DESIGN
14 Total samples were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA, using the core probe sets defined by Affymetrix with the revision of the clustered Pcdhs. A list of genes showing a significant difference by Ctcf deletion was generated using a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 with a fold difference of < -1.2 or > 1.2 as a cutoff value.
