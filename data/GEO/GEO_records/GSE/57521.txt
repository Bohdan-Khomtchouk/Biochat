TITLE
Expression analysis of the effects of methyl-donor deficient diet on male mice (part 1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BALB/c and CBA/Ca male mice were maintained for 8 weeks on a synthetic diet lacking in choline and folic acid and sacrificed after the end of dietary restrictions. The design of this study is further described in Voutounou, M., C .D. Glen, and Y. E. 2012. The effects of methyl-donor deficiency on mutation induction and transgenerational instability in mice. Mutat. Res. 734(1):1-4 (PMID: 22569175) The pattern of gene expression in spleen of mice sacrificed immediatelly after the end of dietary restrictions is not significatly altered.

DESIGN
A six 12x135K chip study using total RNA extracted from kidney and liver of control and treated BALB/c male mice. The expression of 42,575 genes was measured with two-fold technical redundancy.
