SUMMARY
The efficacy and safety of tacrolimus or sirolimus monotherapy after combined induction therapy with campath-1H and infliximab monoclonal antibodies in 20 kidney graft recipients were evaluated in single centre prospective randomized trial.  Campath-1H and infliximab induction followed by tacrolimus monotherapy spare tolerance asssociated naive B-cell related molecular markers and results in 36 months excellent renal graft function and normal histology.

DESIGN
The experiments were performed with total RNA derived from whole blood samples of twenty different patients who had undergone a kidney transplantation. After an initial administration of Campath, Infliximab, Methylprednisolone, and Tacrolimus, the participants of the trial were split into two arms, one of which was treated with the immunosuppressive Calcineurin inhibitor Tacrolimus, and the other was treated with the mTOR-Inhibitor Sirolimus (Rapamycin). As severe side effects were observed for the kidney recipients in the Sirolimus arm, this part of the study had to be stopped. Samples were collected before transplantation and at consistent time points (W3, M2, M3, M6, M12) after transplantation. As microarray platform, the RISET 2.0 microarray (GPL8136) was used. classification of clinical samples
