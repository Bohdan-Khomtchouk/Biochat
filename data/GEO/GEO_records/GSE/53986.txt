TITLE
NRROS negatively regulates ROS in phagocytes during host defense and autoimmunity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the important antimicrobial mechanisms of phagocytic cells. Enhanced oxidative burst requires these cells to be primed with agents such as IFNg and LPS with a synergistic effect of these agents on the level of the burst. However, excessive ROS generation will lead to tissue damage and has been implicated in a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune disease. Therefore, this process needs to be tightly regulated. In order to understand the genes regulating this process, we will treat bone marrow derived macrophages with above mentioned priming agents and study the gene expression. We used microarrays to determine the changes in gene expression that occur in bone marrow derived macrophages after treatment with IFNg, LPS, or a combination of IFNg and LPS
