TITLE
Molecular Characterization of Laser Microdissected Circumventricular Organs and Third Ventricle Ependyma in the Adult Rat by Microarray Analysis.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used LCM and microarrays to analyze the transcriptomes of three CVOs, the SCO, the subfornical organ (SFO), and the PG, and the third ventricle ependyma in the adult rat in order to better characterize these organs at the molecular level.

DESIGN
Gene expression was performed on laser microdissection of rat Pineal Gland (n=2), Subcommisural Organ (pool of 2), Subfornical Organ (pool of 2) and Third Ventricle Ependyma (pool of 2). Pool of rat total normal brains was used as reference.
