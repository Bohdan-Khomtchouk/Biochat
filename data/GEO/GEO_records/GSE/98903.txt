TITLE
Gene expression profiling of ramie roots during hydroponic induction and adaption to aquatic environment

ORGANISM
Boehmeria nivea

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of root development related genes in terrestrial and hydroponic ramie. Ramie seedlings were cultivated in soil, and in hydroponic with the shoot-cutting propagation method. The root samples from hydrophonic ramie were collected from the early stage (5-day-old seedling) and the late stage  (30-day-old seedling) of acquatic roots induction. The roots of ramie seedling cultivated in soil were also collected for comparative analysis. Our study represents the detailed analysis of ramie root transcriptomes with biologic replicates.

DESIGN
Root samples of terrestrial ramie, and different development stage of hydrophonic ramie were firstly pooled for reference transcriptome sequencing by Illumina Hiseq 2000. These clean reads were then de novo assembled into unigenes and annotated with the 7 functional databases.  Gene expression level of each sample were  quantified using BGISEQ500 platform to help understand the distribution of aquatic root development related genes from macro level.
