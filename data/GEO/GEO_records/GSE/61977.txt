TITLE
Expression profiles of microRNA in bovine raw milk exosome and supernatant without exosome [mRNA array]

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We have reported that microRNAs are present in human, bovine, and rat milk whey. Milk whey miRNAs were resistant to acidic condition and to RNase. Thus, milk miRNAs were thought to be present packaged into membrane vesicles like exosome. However, body fluid miRNAs have been reported that there are in different forms. To clarify which miRNAs species are exist in exosome and which species are exist in another form, we used bovine raw milk and purified total RNA from exosome fraction and ultracentrifugated supernatant fraction, and analyzed by miRNA microarray.

DESIGN
Three bovine raw milk samples were prepared and mixed equally. These raw milks are usually used for R & D in our laboratory. For example, trial manufacturing.
