TITLE
Expression data of human CD4+CD45RA+CCR7+ Naïve T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T-cell replete cord blood transplantation results in a rapid thymus-independent T-cell reconstitution which  is strikingly CD4+ biased compared to the well-established observation of CD8+ T-cell biased expansion after T-cell replete bone marrow transplant. We used microarrays to detail the distinct gene expression profile underlying rapid CD4+ T cell expansion following T-cell replete cord blood transplantation and identified distinct up-regulated pathways during this process.

DESIGN
Twenty-four total samples were analyzed. Naive CD4+ T cells were selected from normal donor cord blood, normal donor peripheral blood and, from recipients of cord blood and bone marrow graft two months after stem cell transplantation. RNA was extracted from naive CD4+ T cells and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Biological replicates of samples from normal donor cord blood (n=3) and normal donor peripheral blood (n=3) were compared in 3 separate experiments. The third experiment compared cord blood and peripheral blood samples from the same donors, thus allowing a paired analysis. In the same experiment, we also performed biological replicates of reconstituting naïve CD4+ T cells at two months after cord blood transplantation (n=3) and bone marrow transplantation (n=3).
