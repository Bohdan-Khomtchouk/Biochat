TITLE
Next generation sequencing to elucidate the novel function of RORC (RORgamma) in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exploring the novel role of RORC (RORgamma) in breast cancer, utilizing NEXTseq with genetic gain and loss of function and pharmacological treatment.

DESIGN
For loss of function, control-siRNA or RORC-siRNA was transfected for 48h in three cell lines (MCF-7, T-47D and MDA-MB-231). For gain of function, CMV-empty or CMV-RORC was transfected for 48h in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, the selective RORC antagonist, SR2211 was utilized. MCF-7 cells were treated either DMSO or SR2211 (5uM) for 24h. Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy kit. NEXTseq was performed for transcriptome analysis.
