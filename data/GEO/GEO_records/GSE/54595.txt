TITLE
Differential in vivo tumorigenicity of distinct subpopulations from a luminal-like breast cancer model (SNP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cellular heterogeneity of one patient derived orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model PDX was investigated using flow cytometry, combined with assessment of in vivo tumorigenicity and SNP genotyping array for copy number analysis. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) was revealed as a highly specific cell surface marker of the human tumor cell population in both xenografts.  Based on expression patterns observed in primary tumor tissue, SSEA-4 and CD24 were chosen as markers to further subdivide the luminal tumor cells into four subpopulations. FACS sorting was used to isolate four cell subpopulations.  Results: In vivo tumorigenicity assay showed that SSEA-4+/CD24+ cells were non-tumorigenic, while the three other subpopulations were tumorigenic. Tumors resulting from the SSEA-4+/CD24- subpopulation of luminal cancer cells, did not express CD24, while tumors arising from the SSEA-4-/CD24-, and SSEA-4-/CD24+ populations both recapitulated the original tumor containing all four subpopulations. Copy number analysis comparing the four subpopulations between eachother, did reveal high similarity. Although there were some minor differencies between the subpopulations, no differences in genome aberrations could explain their difference in tumorigenicity.  Discussion: Our results imply that subpopulations from one primary tumor can give rise to dissimilar daughter tumors. These tumors may not necessarily respond to the same targeted treatment, and thereby represent a therapy escape mechanism. This study highlights that to remove the risk of breast cancer recurrence, inhibition of the molecules critical for driving the tumor progression in several tumor cell subpopulations might be essential

DESIGN
Four subpopulations were analysed using Infinium HumanOmniExpressExome BeadChip array. Replicates are not included, the HumanOmniExpressExome-8v1-2_A.egt  file was used as a reference.
