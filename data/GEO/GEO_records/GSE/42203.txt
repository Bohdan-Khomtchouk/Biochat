Global expression analysis of DLBCL and SMZL cell lines

SUMMARY
The multifunctional protein lipopolysaccharide-induced TNFalpha factor (LITAF) induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in monocytes and regulates protein degradation in neural cells. In B-cell lymphomas, LITAF is frequently inactivated by epigenetic mechanisms, but beyond these data little is known about its regulation and function. Immunohistochemical and gene expression profiling analyses of normal and malignant B-cells revealed that LITAF and BCL6 exhibited opposite expression patterns. Accordingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase experiments showed that LITAF is transcriptionally repressed by BCL6 in germinal center (GC) lymphocytes and in B-cell lymphoma cells. Gain- and-loss-of-function assays demonstrated that LITAF does not exert any of its previous roles. Conversely, LITAF co-localized with autophagosomes in B-cells whereby activated autophagic responses, which were abrogated upon LITAF silencing. Therefore, BCL6-mediated transcriptional repression of LITAF may contribute to an appropriate GC reaction by suppressing autophagy in GC lymphocytes, whereas constitutive repression of autophagic responses may promote B-cell lymphoma development.

DESIGN
39 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 3 splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) untreated cell lines were analyzed for global gene expression with the GeneChipÂ® Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix). SMZL cell lines were hybridized in duplicate, resulting in a total of 45 microarrays.
