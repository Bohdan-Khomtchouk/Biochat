TITLE
Role of DNA methylation in FOXA1 cell type-specific recruitment to chromatin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CTCF, H2AFZ and FOXA1 genomic recruitment sites were determined using ChIP-chip while MeDIP-chip was used to monitor DNA methylation levels. Amplified and labeled DNA was hybridized to Affymetrix tiling arrays covering human chromosomes 8, 11 and 12. Cells used in this study are: MCF7 breast cancer cells, LNCaP prostate cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells stably transfected with a FOXA1 expression vector (MDA231-FOXA1) or the empty control plasmid (MDA231-CTRL). H3K4me2 genomic distribution was determined using ChIP-chip. Amplified and labeled DNA was hybridized to Affymetrix tiling arrays covering human chromosomes 8, 11 and 12. Cells used in this study are MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells stably transfected with a FOXA1 expression vector (MDA231-FOXA1) or the empty control plasmid (MDA231-CTRL).
