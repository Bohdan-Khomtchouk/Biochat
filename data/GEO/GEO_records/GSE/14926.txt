TITLE
Analysis of the impact of the method of cell selection on the gene expression profile of human CD4 and CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Negative immunomagnetic selection has become the method of choice for isolating T cell subsets for functional studies due to concerns that directly binding antibody to the surface of a cell, as occurs with positive selection, results in cross-linking of surface antigens, altered gene transcription and subsequent cellular activation. However there is little data to support this. We therefore examined the impact of the method of immunomagnetic cell selection on the gene expression profile of healthy human CD4 and CD8 T cells in a total of 21 cases. Keywords: Methodology

DESIGN
This study was composed of 4 groups of samples: CD4 Negative Selection (n=5), CD4 Positive Selection (n=5), CD8 Negative Selection (n=5), CD8 Positive Selection (n=6). Two samples (PS6 CD8 and PS9 CD4) were removed from the analysis due to discrepant normalised unscaled standard errors
