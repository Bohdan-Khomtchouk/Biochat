TITLE
Expression data from odontogenic epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim to the study was to elucidate the character of odontogenic epithelial cells from epithelial cell rests of Malassez in comparison with gingival epithelial cells by carrying out a geome-wide expression analysis.

DESIGN
Total RNA from human odontogenic epithelial cell line, OdE and human immortalized gingival epithelial cell line, OBA-9 was hybridized on AffymetrixÂ® GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST arrays. The key findings were verified by quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR).
