TITLE
Transdifferentiation as a mechanism of treatment resistance in a mouse model of castration-resistant prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptome of prostate tissue from the anterior lobe or tumor from 9, 12, 13, 14, and 16 months old mouse Prostate tissue or tumor from 9 month old Nkx3.1CreERT2/+ mice, 14 month old Nkx3.1CreERT2/+;Ptenflox/flox mice (intact, treated with vehicle), 16 month old Nkx3.1CreERT2/+;Ptenflox/flox mice (castrated, treated with vehicle or abiraterone), 12 month old Nkx3.1CreERT2/+;Ptenflox/flox;P53flox/flox mice(intact, treated with vehicle), 13 month old Nkx3.1CreERT2/+;Ptenflox/flox;P53flox/flox mice (castrated, treated with vehicle or abiraterone) was harvested, and snap frozen for subsequent molecular analysis

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from prostate tissues or tumors. Prostate tissues or tumors were harvested and processed for RNA isolation and transcriptome analysis using the MagMAX RNA isolation kit (Ambion).

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
