NCI-H1299 lung cancer cell line transfected with miR-34a and ghR-34a

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells transfected with synthetic oligo mimics for microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-34a and ghR-34a. We developed a 30-nucleotide single-strand RNA (ssRNA), termed “guide hairpin RNA (ghR),” that has a physiological function similar to that of miRNA and siRNA. The ghR caused no innate cytokine response either in vitro or in vivo. In addition, its structure does not contain a passenger strand seed sequence, reducing the potential for off-target effects relative to existing short RNA reagents. Systemic injection of ghR-form miR-34a (ghR-34a) suppressed tumor growth in a mouse model of RAS-induced lung cancer. Furthermore, ghR-34a functioned in a Dicer- and Ago2-independent manner. This novel RNAi technology may provide a novel, safe, and effective nucleic acid drug platform that will increase the clinical usefulness of nucleic acid therapy.

DESIGN
MiR-34a–targeted mRNAs regulated by mRNA degradation rather than translational inhibition were identified using microarray data from miR-34 and ghR-34a transfectants.
