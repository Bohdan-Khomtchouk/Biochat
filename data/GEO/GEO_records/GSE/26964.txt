TITLE
Altered expression of microRNAs in bone metastasis compared with human prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The principal problem arising from prostate cancer (PCa) is its propensity to metastasize to bone. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in many tumor metastases.The importance of miRNAs in bone metastasis of PCa has not been elucidated to date. We investigated whether the expression of certain miRNAs was associated with bone metastasis of PCa.

DESIGN
We examined the miRNA expression profiles of 6 primary and 7 bone metastatic PCa samples by miRNA microarray analysis. Total RNA was taken from the specimens, low molecular weight RNA was seperate and labeled , and then hybridized to capitalbio V3.0 biochip  representing about 924 microRNA.

PLATFORM
GPL8469 Capitalbio mammal microRNA V3.0
