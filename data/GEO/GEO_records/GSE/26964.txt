TITLE
Altered expression of microRNAs in bone metastasis compared with human prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The principal problem arising from prostate cancer (PCa) is its propensity to metastasize to bone. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in many tumor metastases.The importance of miRNAs in bone metastasis of PCa has not been elucidated to date. We investigated whether the expression of certain miRNAs was associated with bone metastasis of PCa.
