TITLE
ROR1 Can Interact With TCL1 And Enhance Leukemogenesis in EÂµ-TCL1 Transgenic Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of RNA samples from leukemia cells of ROR1xTCL1 and TCL1 transgenic mice Animals engrafted with ROR1xTCL1 leukemia-cells developed more aggressive disease than mice engrafted with TCL1 leukemia cells.  Transcriptome analysis of RNA samples from leukemia ROR1xTCL1 transgenic mice revealed shared common gene expression signatures that were distinct from those of TCL1 leukemia-cells.

DESIGN
We performed microarray transcriptome analyses on isolated leukemia cells that developed in ROR1xTCL1 Tg mice (n=4) or TCL1 Tg mice (n=4) using the Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool. No techinical replicates were performed.
