TITLE
Changes in gene expression during the transition from inflammation to cancer following Helicobacter felis infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We are now trying to elucidate the mechanism of Helicobacter-induced gastritis and gastric cancer. To identify genes involved in these Helicobacter-associated diseases, we infected Helicobacter felis to INS-GAS (insulin-gastrin transgenic) mice (C57BL/6 background) which shows accelerated development of gastritis and gastric cancer.

DESIGN
Three infected mice and three uninfected control mice (6 in total) were sacrificed periodically (2, 4, 6, 8 months after the infection), and total RNA was isolated from each stomach. These samples are subjected to gene microarray analysis. Samples were obtained from mouse stomachs at 2, 4, 6, and 8/9 month post infection intervals. Control time points were taken at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. All samples, 22 in total, were hybridized to the GLYCOv2 array.
