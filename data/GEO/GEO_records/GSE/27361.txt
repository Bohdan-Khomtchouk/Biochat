TITLE
Changes in gene expression during the transition from inflammation to cancer following Helicobacter felis infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We are now trying to elucidate the mechanism of Helicobacter-induced gastritis and gastric cancer. To identify genes involved in these Helicobacter-associated diseases, we infected Helicobacter felis to INS-GAS (insulin-gastrin transgenic) mice (C57BL/6 background) which shows accelerated development of gastritis and gastric cancer.
