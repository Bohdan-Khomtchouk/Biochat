Profiling 20,077 genes in 25 vaccine recipients: U133 Plus 2.0, Custom CDF Version 9

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The immune responses generated by YF-17D by profiling 20,077 genes in 25 vaccine recipients were accessed at days 1, 3, 7, and 21 post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination in PBMCs.

Keywords: time course

DESIGN
This study is a combination of 2 separate YF-17D vaccination trials.  Trial 1 has 15 subjects, and Trial 2 has 10 subjects.   The two trials occurred 1 year apart and used different lots of the vaccine.  Enrolled volunteers were healthy, aged 18 to 45, and signed a written informed consent form. Potential volunteers were excluded from participating in the study if they were pregnant, or if they had been vaccinated previously with YF-17D. Blood samples were taken pre-vaccinaion to serve as a reference point for each individual, and post-vaccination samples were taken a days 1, 3, 7, and 21 after YF-17D vaccination.  All subjects received YF-17D.  Blood samples for microarray analysis were collected either in blue and black topped citrate buffered cell preparation tubes (CPT).  Following PMBC isolation from CPT, 2 x 106 cells were lysed in 1 ml of TRIzol and stored at -80?C (Cat# 15596-026; Invitrogen Life Technologies).  After all time points were collected for a subject, the samples were thawed, and the RNA isolation proceeded according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol.
