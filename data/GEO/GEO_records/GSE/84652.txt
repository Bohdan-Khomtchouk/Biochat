TITLE
Gene expression profiling in Dip G-treated HL-60 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the function of the small molecule Dip G, the gene expression profiles of HL-60 cells treated with Dip G were analyzed using the microarray.

DESIGN
HL-60 cells were treated for 24 h in the absence or presence of Dip G (15 mM). Three replicates were performed in every independent experiment.
