TITLE
Circulating miRNA expression after subcutaneous injection of Gram negative and positive bacteria in the mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the circulating miRNA expression after subcutaneous injection of Gram negative and positive bacteria in the mice

DESIGN
The recombinant specific Gram negative pathogens Escherichia coli (xen14) and Gram positive pathogens Staphyllococcus aureus (xen29) were purchased from the Caliper (Caliper, Princeton, NJ, USA). 1×108 Escherichia coli or Staphyllococcus aureus pathogen in 100 μl PBS was injected subcutaneously with Fr. 25 needle into the back of the mice to cause bacterial infection of the mice. An extra group of animals was inoculated with PBS to serve as a negative control. The mice had access to food and water ad libitum both before and after bacteria injection. The mice were killed at the indicated time points (4, 8, and 24 h) after the bacteria injection, and whole blood was drawn.
