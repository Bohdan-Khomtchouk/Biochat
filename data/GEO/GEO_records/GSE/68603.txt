TITLE
Metabolic and metagenomic outcomes from early-life pulsed antibiotic treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammalian species have co-evolved with intestinal microbial communities that can shape development and adapt to environmental changes, including antibiotic perturbation or nutrient flux.  In humans, especially children, microbiota disruption is common, yet the dynamic microbiome recovery from early-life antibiotics is still uncharacterized. Using a mouse model mimicking pediatric antibiotic use, we found that therapeutic-dose pulsed antibiotic treatment (PAT) with a beta-lactam or macrolide altered both host and microbiota development. Early-life PAT accelerated total mass and bone growth, and resulted in progressive changes in gut microbiome diversity, population structure, and metagenomic content, with microbiome effects dependent on the number of courses and class of antibiotic. While control microbiota rapidly adapted to a change in diet, PAT slowed the ecological progression, with delays lasting several months in response to the macrolide. This study identifies key markers of disturbance and recovery, which may help provide therapeutic targets for microbiota restoration following antibiotic treatment.

DESIGN
C57BL/6J mice received three antibiotic courses: at days 10-15, 28-31, and 37-40 of life, amoxicillin or tylosin.Livers were collected at age 22 weeks, RNA was extracted, and transcriptional differences were measured by microarray analysis.
