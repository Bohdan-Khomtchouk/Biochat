TITLE
HNF4G, AR, FOXA1, H3K4me1, H3K27acetyl binding sites upon knockdown and overexpression of HNF4G in 22Rv1 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells respectively

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HNF4G is a gastrointestinal tissue enriched master transcriptional regulator seen overexpressed in a subset of prostate cancer. Here we have mapped binding sites of HNF4G, AR, Foxa1, H3K4me1, H3K27acetyl upon knockdown and overexpression of HNF4G in in 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells respectively

DESIGN
ChIPSeq mapping of HNF4G, AR, Foxa1, H3K4me1, H3K27acetyl upon knockdown and overexpression of HNF4G in in 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells respectively

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
