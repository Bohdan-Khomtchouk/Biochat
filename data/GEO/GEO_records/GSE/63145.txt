TITLE
HITS–CLIP reveals Argonaute 1-associated MicroRNAs and Target Sites in Schistosoma japonicum

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
In this study, we isolated and identified the small RNAs associated with the S. japonicum Argonaute protein, SjAgo1, by HITS-CLIP combined with bioinformatic analysis. These data reveal a genome-wide miRNA-mRNA interaction map in S. japonicum in vivo, which will help us understand the complex gene regulation network in this pathogen and thereby facilitate to develop novel approaches against Schistosomiasis.
