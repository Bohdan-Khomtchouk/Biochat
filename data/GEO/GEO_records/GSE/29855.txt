TITLE
Expression analysis of Candida glabrata CBS138 delta-cnb1, delta-crz1, delta-slt2, and delta-ire1 mutants in response to tunicamycin exposure (Transcriptional response of Candida glabrata to tunicamycin exposure)

ORGANISM
[Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in response to tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein N-glycosylation, in Candida glabrata CBS138 delta-cnb1, delta-crz1, delta-slt2, and delta-ire1 mutants, compared to the wild-type strain. The mutations engineered into these strains render them hypersusceptible to tunicamycin. The mutants analyzed in this study are further described in Miyazaki, T. et al. (2010) Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 54(4):1639-1643 (PMID: 20100876) and Miyazaki, T. et al. (2010) FEMS Yeast Res 10(3):343-352, 2010 (PMID: 20214686).

DESIGN
A fifteen chip study using total RNA isolated from Candida glabrata wild-type control and four mutant strains, in which the entire ORFs of CNB1 (XP_448800), CRZ1 (XP_449644), SLT2 (XP_447735), or IRE1 (XP_446111) are deleted. Each chip measures the expression level of 5,217 genes from Candida glabrata CBS138 with six 60-mer-probe pairs per gene, with two-fold technical redundancy.
