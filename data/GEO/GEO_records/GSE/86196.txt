TITLE
Reprogramming Mouse Fibroblasts into Engraftable Myeloerythroid and Lymphoid Progenitors: Induction and Underlying Mechanisms (BeadChip)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we show that hematopoietic transcription factors Scl, Lmo2, Runx1 and Bmi1 can convert a developmentally-distant lineage (fibroblasts) into “induced hematopoietic progenitors” (iHPs). We analyzed transcriptomic data for cell undergoing the transdifferentiation process at several time-points of the process.

DESIGN
We performed microarray transcriptome analysis of wild-type fibroblasts (MEFs), intermediate populations undergoing SLRH reprogramming (4 dpi  and 14 dpi), reprogrammed 26 dpi iHPs (CD45+ or Kit+) and finally bone marrow (BM) (CD45+ or Kit+) cells as a positive control
