TITLE
Expression data from 3T3-MEFs derived from wild-type and SMRT RID mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors) is recruited by numerous transcription factors to mediate lineage and signal dependent transcriptional repression.  We generated a knock-in mutation in the receptor interaction domain (RID) of SMRT (SMRTmRID) that solely disrupts its interaction with nuclear hormone receptors.  SMRTmRID-derived 3T3-MEFs display a dramatically increased adipogenic capacity and accelerated differentiation rate.  We measured global gene expression in wild-type versus SMRTmRID-derived 3T3-MEFs in the undifferentiated state to examine which pathways were altered. Our results demonstrate that SMRT-RID dependent repression is a key determinant of the adipogenic set point. Keywords: SMRTmRID expression compared to wild-type

DESIGN
3T3 cells derived from wild-type and SMRT RID MEFs were cultured under pre-differentiated conditions prior to harvesting for RNA.
