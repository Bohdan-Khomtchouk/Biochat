TITLE
Whole-genome gene expression profiles of non-tumorous human lung tissues: UBC set

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled genome-wide gene expression in non-tumorous human lung tissues. The overall goal of this project is to improve our molecular understanding of various lung diseases including lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

DESIGN
The samples from the University of British Columbia (UBC) were derived from a long-standing tissue bank started by Drs. James C. Hogg and Peter D. Paré (Ding L, Quinlan KB, Elliott WM, Hamodat M, Paré PD, Hogg JC, Hayashi S. A Lung Tissue Bank for Gene Expression Studies in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. COPD: Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 2004;1:191-204 (PMID 17136987)). Lung specimens were obtained from patients undergoing lung surgery. Primarily this was for resection of benign or malignant lesions. Some were the diseased lungs from transplant recipients. Patients are approached prior to surgery and asked if they would like to donate a portion of the lung tissue that is to be removed for research. It is explained that this would be done after the appropriate diagnostic specimens are taken and that only portions of lung that would be otherwise discarded will be used for research. A small number of lung samples were obtained at the time of autopsy. Immediately after resection, the lobes or lungs were inflated using a 50% mixture of Cryomatrix and saline. The specimens were then frozen in liquid nitrogen fumes and stored at -80C for later RNA extraction. RNAs were extracted and then hybridized to a single custom-made whole-genome human Affymetrix array.
