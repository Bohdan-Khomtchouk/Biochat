TITLE
TIGIT+ Tregs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TIGIT+ Tregs suppress Th1 and Th17 responses while sparing Th2 responses. Analysis of global gene expression of TIGIT+ vs. TIGIT- Tregs from naive mice reveled that TIGIT+ Tregs display an activated phenotype and are enriched for Treg signature genes including the Treg effector molecule Fgl2 which enables them to selectively spare Th2 responses.

DESIGN
TIGIT+ and TIGIT- Tregs were sorted from na√Øve Foxp3-GFP KI mice (pooled spleen and lymph nodes) TIGIT: T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains
