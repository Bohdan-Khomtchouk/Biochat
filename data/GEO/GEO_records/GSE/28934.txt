TITLE
Changes in glycogene expression during maturation of dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the expression of glycosyltransferases in dendritic cells and the changes in expression associated with maturation.

DESIGN
Healthy normal donor RNA preparations from Resting macrophages (Macro), LPS-mature dendritic cells (LPSMDC), IL-15 immature dendritic cells (IL15DC), Dexamethasone immature dendritic cells (DxMDC) from 2 different donors.

PLATFORM
GPL11095 [GLYCOv3_Hs] Custom Affymetrix Glyco v3 GeneChip
