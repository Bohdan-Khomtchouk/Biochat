TITLE
microRNA expression profiles of tumor-positive and tumor-negative sentinel lymph node biopsies from cutaneous melanoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed microRNA profiles in archival FFPE sentinel node biopsy (SNB) from melanoma patients with different outcomes. Tumor-negative SNB (N), and tumor-positive SNB from patients with (PP) or without disease progression at 5 years follow-up (PN) were analyzed.

DESIGN
This is a pilot  study assessing  24 sentinel node biopsies from 24 melanoma patients. Each biological group contains 8 samples.
