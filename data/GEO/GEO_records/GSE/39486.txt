TITLE
MicroRNA-138: A Pro-survival OncomiR for Glioma Stem Cells is Associated with Tumor Recurrence [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the identification of microRNA-138 (miR-138), as a molecular signature of GSCs and demonstrate a vital role for miR-138 to promote growth and survival of bona fide tumor-initiating cells with self-renewal potential.

DESIGN
Total RNA from Glioma Stem Cells and Neural Stem Cells were subjected to microRNA microarray analysis, 3 replicates each.
