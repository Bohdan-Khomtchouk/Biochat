TITLE
Transcription profile of WT and LKB1 (encoded by the gene Stk11)-deficient Treg cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LKB1 deficiency in Treg cells impairs their survival, metabolism and suppressive function. To exclude the impact of excessive inflammation on LKB1-deficient Treg cells, we generated mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeras using Foxp3-Cre WT and Foxp3-Cre Stk11 fl/fl BM cells, together with CD45.1+ BM cells. We used microarray to compare the global transcription profile of dornor-derived LKB1-deficient Tregs with WT counterparts.

DESIGN
In total 10 samples; 5 sampels WT Treg cells and 5 samples of LKB1-deficient Treg cells
