TITLE
Expression data from liver tissue from Npc1 mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the disease progression in the mutant mice compared to their control littermates.

DESIGN
We collected liver tissue from 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-, and 11-week-old Npc1+/+ and Npc1-/- mice (N=4), and some additional controls.

PLATFORM
