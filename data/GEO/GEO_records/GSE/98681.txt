TITLE
mRNA/miRNA expression profiles of human primary adipocytes exposed to low doses of bisphenols A, F and S  [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bisphenols F (BPF) and S (BPS) are BPA structural analogs used in many marketed products as a replacement for BPA. Since sparse toxicological data are available yet for these bisphenol substitutes, our objective was to comprehensively characterize bisphenols gene targets in a human primary adipocyte model, using chronic exposure at two concentrations: a “low-dose” similar to the dose usually encountered in human biological fluids and a higher dose.

DESIGN
Bisphenols A, F and S have been added at 10 nM or 10 µM during the differentiation of human primary adipocytes from subcutaneous fat of three non-diabetic Caucasian female patients. Gene expression (mRNA/lncRNA) arrays and microRNA arrays, have been used to assess coding and non-coding RNA changes. All RNAs are measured in the same samples, with multiple replicates for each patient, four per pre-adipocyte and differentiated adipocyte and two per adipocyte differentiated with each BP.
