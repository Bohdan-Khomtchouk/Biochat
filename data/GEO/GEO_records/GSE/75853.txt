TITLE
H3K36 mutations promote sarcomagenesis through genome-wide remodeling of H3K36 and H3K27 methylation [RNA_Chondroblastoma_H3K36M_H3WT]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to understand the genome-wide alterations in chromatin landscapy induced by a histone mutation (H3.3 K36M) derived from chondroblastomas

DESIGN
Examination of H3K36M mutations to H3WT Chondroblastomas.
