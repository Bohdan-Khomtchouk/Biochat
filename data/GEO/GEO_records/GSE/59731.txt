TITLE
Comparison of pDCs isolated from recipients of STAT1+/+ vs. STAT1-/- bone marrow

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to determine if pDCs reconstituted from T cell depleted allogeneic STAT1-/- bone marrow express genes that contribute to Graft versus host disease (GVHD) resistance as compared to STAT1+/+ bone marrow

DESIGN
Lethally irradiated B6 x C3H.SW mice were transplanted with T cell depleted 129 or 129 STAT1-/- bone marrow. 14 days later, pDCs were isolated from spleens by magnetic cell selection, and pooled from 12 mice/group. cDNA was generated and hybridized to an Affymetrix genechip mouse genome 430 2.0 array. Samples were normalized by RMA algorithm to a log2 intensity value and analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis v8.5 software.
