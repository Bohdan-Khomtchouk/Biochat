TITLE
Expression profiles in PCARNEQ ncRNA depletion in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To globally address the function of a novel ncRNA PCARNEQ located in chromosome 8q24, microarray analysis was performed on RNA isolated from prostate cancer  cell line LNCaP cells treated with siRNA to PCARNEQ and the control siRNA to EGFP (siEGFP).

DESIGN
LNCaP cells were treated with siRNA to PCARNEQ or the control siRNA to EGFP and total RNA from each experiment was analyzed in triplicate by microarray.
