TITLE
Microarray analysis of Nurr1 and Foxa2 synergisitic effect for DA neuron induction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of dopaminergic neuronal gene expression changes by Nurr1 and/or Foxa2 overexpression. Result provides that Foxa2 potentiates Nurr1-induced DA neuronal phenotype gene expression.

DESIGN
To identify the syergism of Nurr1 and Foxa2 for developing DA neural precursors, neural precusor cells (NPCs) isolated from embryonic brain were treated control, Nurr1, Foxa2 and Nurr1-Foxa2 retrovirus. After treatment of retroviruses, NPCs were cultrued in N2 media withdrawn mitogen (bFGF, EGF) for differetiation of DA neuron. Total RNA was obtained from NPCs in differentiation day 2.
