TITLE
DYRK2 regulates cancer stem cell population.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to  identified new factor that regulates cancer stem cell population in shRNA  DYRK2 cells using stable DYRK2 knockdown cells and mammosphere.

DESIGN
We stably silenced DYRK2 in MCF-7 cells (shRNA-DYRK2 cells) using pSuper vector. For control, pSuper control cells were created. We obtained expression profiles from shRNA-DYRK2 cells and pSuper control cells. We also obtained RNA from  mammosphere which are stably expressing pSuper  vector or shRNA DYRK2.
