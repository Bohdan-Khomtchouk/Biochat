TITLE
Assessing transcriptomes of mouse cumulus cells, mural granulosa cells, and cumulus-oocyte complexes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptomes of mouse mural granulosa cells were sequenced to identify transcripts expressed in mural granulosa cells of ovaries.  Moreover, transcriptomes of cumulus cells were compared between those of young (2 month-old) and old mice (10 month-old) to assess the effects of ageing on cumulus cells.  In addition, transcriptomes of cumulus-oocyte complexes were compared between DBA/2 and (C57BL/6 x DBA/2)F1 mice to assess the strain differences.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of cumulus cells, mural granulosa cells, and cumulus-oocyte complexes

PLATFORM
