TITLE
Genome-wide detection of STAT3 binding sites in human Th17 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
STAT3 is a major transcription factor driving the polarization of Th17 cells in response to IL-6, TGF-β and IL1-β. STAT3 is phosphorylated and forms a homodimer and translocates into the nucleus. There STAT3 binds to specific DNA sequences, regulating the transcription of its target genes. Here we have analyzed on a genome wide level the STAT3 binding sites, after 0.5h and 4h of  IL-6, TGF-β and IL1-β induction, in naive human CD4+ T cells.

DESIGN
Altogether 2 samples from 1 biological replicate were analyzed.
