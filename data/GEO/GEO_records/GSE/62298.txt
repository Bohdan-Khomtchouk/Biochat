ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-scale DNA methylation profiling using the Infinium DNA methylation BeadChip platform and samples from acute myeloid leukemia patients screened for their mutation status of DNMT3a, a frequent aberration in AML.

DESIGN
DNA methylation analysis of blood samples from patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia using the Infinium DNA methylation BeadChip platform .
