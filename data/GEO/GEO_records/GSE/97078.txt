TITLE
AG-221 as an effective and on-target therapy in IDH2 mutant AML

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Herein we developed a multigenic AML model with inducible expression of IDH2R140Q and constitutive expression of mutant DNMT3AR882H and NRASG12D. Using genetic de-induction and the first-in-class IDH2 inhibitor AG-221, we demonstrate that despite the presence of multiple oncogenic lesions, AML cells expressing mutant IDH2 depend on continued production of 2-HG to maintain their leukemic potential. Moreover, by comparing pharmacological inhibition and genetic depletion of IDH2R140Q we validate AG-221 as a highly on target inhibitor and identify key downstream pathways including GATA1 that are critical for disease maintenance.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing of mutant IDH2 AML cells treated with vehicle, doxycycline (genetic depletion of IDH2R140Q) or AG-221 (IDH2 inhibitor)
