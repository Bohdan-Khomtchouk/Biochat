TITLE
Lachancea kluyveri (formerly Saccharomyces kluyveri); Growth on different nitrogen sources.

ORGANISM
Lachancea kluyveri

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of the yeast Lachancea kluyveri when grown on minimal media with different compounds added as the sole nitrogen source. Cells grown on uracil, uridine, dihydrouracil and ammonia were profiled using cells grown on proline as the reference.

DESIGN
Five conditions, of one was used as reference. Each grown in 4 parallell biological replicates, which were extracted, labeled and hybridized individually, except for the reference where the replicates were pooled. 1 technical replicate. Please note that raw data files for the following samples are not available; Skluy_uracil_rep2, Skluy_dihydrouracil_rep3, Skluy_uridine_rep4

PLATFORM
