TITLE
Ethanol induced hepatic gene expression changes during gestation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The specific role of nutritional status during gestation in exacerbating or mitigating fetal toxicity of ethanol (EtOH) remains unclear. We used an intragastric infusion model (Total enteral nutrition, TEN) to appropriately control for dietary EtOH consumption and caloric intake. Time impregnated female Sprague Dawley rats (250-300 g) were surgically cannulated with intragastric cannulae (on gestation day 4) and infused either control or EtOH-containing diets. Rats were fed 220 kcal/ kg3/4/d (NRC recommended caloric intake for gestation) or 160 kcal/ kg3/4/d (undernourished to 72% of control) diets containing either 12 g/kg/d EtOH or an isocaloric amount of carbohydrates from gestation days 6-15. Maternal hepatic gene expression profiles were assessed on GD15. The present data dissect specific effects of nutritional status during gestation and EtOH intake and the interaction thereof. The data reveal a highly significant interaction between undernutrition and EtOH consumption. Keywords: Nutrition-gene interactions

DESIGN
Four groups of time impregnated female Sprague Dawley rats were utilized. Group 1: Control, TEN-220, control group fed normal (non-EtOH containing) diets at 220 kcal/ kg3/4/d. Group 2: Ethanol-220, EtOH-220 (EtOH group fed EtOH containing diets) at 12 g EtOH/kg/d diets at 220 kcal/ kg3/4/d. Group 3: Control-160, TEN-160, (undernourished control group fed normal (non-EtOH containing) diets at 160 kcal/ kg3/4/d. Group 4: Ethanol-160, EtOH-160, (undernourished rats fed EtOH containing diets) at 12 g EtOH/kg/d diets at 160 kcal/ kg3/4/d
