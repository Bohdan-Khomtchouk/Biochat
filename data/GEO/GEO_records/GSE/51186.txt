Transcriptome study of THP-1 human monocytes following exposure for 4 h or 24 h to 50 uM S-Nitrosoglutathione, 50 and 200 ug/ml S-Nitrosoglutathione-loaded polymeric and empty Eudragit RL nanoparticles

SUMMARY
To further study the transcriptome of THP-1 human monocytes after exposure to S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), we investigate whole genome microarray expression to identify genes regulated by exposure or not to GSNO. To further study the transcriptome of THP-1 human monocytes after exposure for 4 h to 50 ug / mL of S-Nitrosoglutathione-loaded polymeric Eudragit RL nanoparticles (GSNO-loaded ENP), we investigate whole genome microarray expression to identify genes regulated by exposure or not to 50 ug / mL of GSNO-loaded ENP. To further study the transcriptome of THP-1 human monocytes after exposure for 4 h to 200 ug / mL of empty polymeric Eudragit RL nanoparticles (empty ENP), we investigate whole genome microarray expression to identify genes regulated by exposure or not to 200 ug / mL of empty ENP. To further study the transcriptome of THP-1 human monocytes after exposure for 24 h to 50 ug / mL of S-Nitrosoglutathione-loaded polymeric Eudragit RL nanoparticles (GSNO-loaded ENP), we investigate whole genome microarray expression to identify genes regulated by exposure or not to 50 ug / mL of GSNO-loaded ENP.

DESIGN
Changes in gene expression in THP-1 cells incubated without (control) or with 50 uM GSNO for 4 h, were measured. Five biological replicates were performed as controls: F_01; F_07; F_13; S_01; S_02. Four biological replicates were performed in GSNO exposed cells: S_13; S_14; S_15; S_16. Changes in gene expression in THP-1 cells incubated without (control) or with 50 ug / mL of GSNO-loaded ENPs (300 nm) for 4 h were measured. Five biological replicates were performed as controls: F_01; F_07; F_13; S_01; S_02. Three biological replicates were performed in 50 ug / mL of GSNO-loaded ENP exposed cells: S_06; S_07; S_08.  Changes in gene expression in THP-1 cells incubated without (control) or with 200 ug / mL of empty ENPs (300 nm) for 4 h were measured. Five biological replicates were performed as controls: F_01; F_07; F_13; S_01; S_02. Three biological replicates were performed in 200 ug / mL of empty ENP exposed cells: S_17; S_19; S_20. Changes in gene expression in THP-1 cells incubated without (control) or with 50 ug / mL of GSNO-loaded ENPs (300 nm) for 24 h were measured. Five biological replicates were performed as controls: F_04; F_10; F_16; S_03; S_04. Four biological replicates were performed in 50 ug / mL of GSNO-loaded ENP exposed cells: S_09; S_10; S_11; S_12. Changes in gene expression in THP-1 cells incubated without (control) or with 50 ug / mL of empty ENPs (300 nm) for 24 h were measured. Five biological replicates were performed as controls: F_04; F_10; F_16; S_03; S_04. Three biological replicates were performed in 50 ug / mL of empty ENP exposed cells: F_05; F_11; F_17. Changes in gene expression in THP-1 cells incubated without (control) or with 50 ug / mL of empty ENPs (300 nm) for 4 h were measured.
