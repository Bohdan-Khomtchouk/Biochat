TITLE
High content analysis of estrogen receptor activity: a mechanism-driven approach to compound testing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the genome-wide response of the ER:PRL-HeLa cell line to treatment with estrogen receptor ligands estradiol, 4H-tamoxifen and bisphenol-A.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from ER:PRL-HeLa cells treated for 4 hours with estradiol, 4H-tamoxifen or bisphenol -A is compared to vehicle treated controls
