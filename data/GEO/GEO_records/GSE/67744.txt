TITLE
Chronic haloperidol effects on open chromatin accessibility in mouse [ATAC-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We evaluate the effects of chronic administration of antipsychotic haloperidol versus placebo in male, 8-week old, C57BL/6J mice.

DESIGN
We used ATAC-seq to study chromatin landscape changes after haloperidol treatment in striatum samples of 14 mice (7 haloperidol-treated mice, 7 placebo-treated mice).

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
