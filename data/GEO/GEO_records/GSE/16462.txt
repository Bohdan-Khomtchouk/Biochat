TITLE
Expression data from Chd1-deficient mouse ES cells (E14 cell lines) and genome-wide binding of Chd1 in parental ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to study the effect of Chd1 loss of function in mouse ES cells. We used ChIP-chip to analyze genome-wide binding of Chd1 in normal ES cells.

DESIGN
Mouse Embryonic Stem (ES) cells were infected with a lentiviral vector (pSicoR-mCherry) for expression of a shRNA against Chd1 and GFP (as a control). mCherry-sorted ES cells were plated and individual clones were selected and grown under normal ES cell conditions. 6 ES cell clonal lines were isolated and analyzed along with the parental E14 cell line. The final analysis consisted in 3 control cell lines (E14, E1 and G8) and 4 Chd1-deficient cells (3 different clones using a shRNA sequence #1- C1i5, C1i6 and C1i9; 1 clone using a different shRNA (#4) sequence targeting Chd1- C4i2). RNA samples were isolated from these Chd1-deficient ES cells and control ES cells, and hybridized on Affymetrix chip. For ChIP-chip, parental E14 ES cell line was used.
