TITLE
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (WT) versus Mut1 and Comp1

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of H37Rv (WT), Mut1 and Comp1 bacteria under aerobic (Aer/0 day, i.e 0 D) and hypoxic conditions (Hyp/5 days standing culture, i.e  5 D). Mut1: H37Rv carrying devR gene disruption by in frame insertion of kanamycin resistance cassette and expressing DevRN-Kan fusion protein. Comp1: Mut1 complemented with low copy number plasmid carrying devR gene expressed from its native constitutive upstream promoter. (Reference: Majumdar et al., 2010, PLoS One 5:e9448). Goal is to compare transcriptional patterns of WT, Mut1 and Comp1 strains under aerobic (0 D) and hypoxic (5 D) conditions in vitro.
