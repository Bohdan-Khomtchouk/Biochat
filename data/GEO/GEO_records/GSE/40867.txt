TITLE
Global mapping of estrogen receptor and histone modifications in breast tumor samples uncovers distinct patterns for aromatase inhibitor resistance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq on primary breast cancer tumor samples for Era, H3K4me3, H3K27me3. Patients had a poor or good outcome after aromatase inhibitor treatment. Differential binding patterns between good and poor outcome patients were identified for each marker, predicting response to treatment

DESIGN
comparing ER, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 patterns between two breast cancer patient populations

PLATFORM
