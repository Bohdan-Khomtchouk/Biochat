TITLE
Gene expression analysis of bovine day 16 embryos obtained from SCNT and IVP pregnancies

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In vitro production systems, as well as cloning technology, may lead to persistent aberrations of gene expression patterns during embryonic and fetal development. In order to get a global overview of gene expression alteration induced by in vitro environment and somatic cell nuclear transfer, we performed microarray analysis of day 16 conceptuses obtained from SCNT, IVP and AI pregnancies.

DESIGN
Day 7 blastocysts generated from AI, IVP and SCNT were transferred to synchronized cows. Comparable length of day 16 embryos were recovered and used for transcriptome analysis using GeneChip bovine genome array

PLATFORM
GPL2112 [Bovine] Affymetrix Bovine Genome Array
