Strong Time Dependence of the 76-Gene Prognostic Signature

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Recently a 76-gene prognostic signature able to predict distant metastases in lymph node-negative (N-) breast cancer patients was reported. The aims of this study conducted by TRANSBIG were to independently validate these results and to compare the outcome with clinical risk assessment. Materials and Methods: Gene expression profiling of frozen samples from 198 N- systemically untreated patients was performed at the Bordet Institute, blinded to clinical data and independent of Veridex. Genomic risk was defined by Veridex, blinded to clinical data. Survival analyses, done by an independent statistician, were performed with the genomic risk and adjusted for the clinical risk, defined by Adjuvant!Online. Results: The actual 5- and 10-year time to distant metastasis (TDM) were 98% (88%-100%) and 94% (83%-98%) respectively for the good profile group and 76% (68%- 82%) and 73% (65%-79%) for the poor profile group. The actual 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) were 98% (88%-100%) and 87% (73%-94%) respectively for the good profile group and 84% (77%-89%) and 72% (63%-78%) for the poor profile group. We observed a strong time-dependency of this signature, leading to an adjusted HR of 13.58 (1.85-99.63) and 8.20 (1.10-60.90) at 5 years, and 5.11 (1.57-16.67) and 2.55 (1.07-6.10) at 10 years for TDM and OS respectively. Conclusion: This independent validation confirmed the performance of the 76-gene signature and adds to the growing evidence that gene expression signatures are of clinical relevance, especially for identifying patients at high risk of early distant metastases.
