TITLE
Inhalation exposure of hexanal in rats (miRNA)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To further development of insight into the mechanism of toxicity, it is important to employ whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify and characterize miRNAs profiles as a discovery platform relevant for toxicologic mechanisms of hexanal. miRNAs have prominent role in cell cycle control, apoptosis, cancer development and proliferation-related processes. However, few reports have described the effect of hexanal on miRNA expression profiles using animal model. In this respect, we studied the expression profiles of miRNAs in hexanal-exposed in rats by miRNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
To evaluate the miRNA expression in lung tissue of rats after exposure of hexanal, Fischer-344 rats were inhaled to three concentrations (600, 1000, 1500 mg/m3) for 5 weeks. miRNA expression analysis was conducted using Rat miRNA 8 x 15K microarray v19.0 (Agilent Technologies, USA).

PLATFORM
GPL18115 Agilent-046066 Unrestricted Rat miRNA V19.0 (miRNA ID version)
