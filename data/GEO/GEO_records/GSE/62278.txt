TITLE
Expression data from G0 versus G4/G5 CMP/GMP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Telomere dysfunctional CMP/GMP have deregulated pathways that are associated with DNA damage signaling We compared differentially expressed genes in the G4/G5 CMP relative to the G0 control to identify pathways that may affect CMP differentiation.

DESIGN
Bone marrow CMP and GMP cells were sorted from two paired pools of G0 TERTER/+ or G4/G5 TERTER/ER mice (5,000-20,000 cells per sample) using the Influx Cell Sorter. Every paired pool includes CMP or GMP sorted from 4 age and gender matched G0 or G4/G5 mice. RNA from the respective sorted cells was extracted using Trizol (Ambion) and profiled on 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Gene expression profiling was performed at the Sequencing and Non-coding RNA Program at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Briefly, the GeneChip® 3 IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix) was used to generate biotin-labeled cRNA, which were purified and fragmented, before target hybridization on the GeneChip® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Affymetrix raw data (CEL files) were normalized using Affymetrix Microarray Suite (MAS) version 5.0 using a TGT=100. Paired pools used in the study were: CMP pool 1: G0-1 and G4/5-1 CMP pool 2: G0-2 and G4/G5-2 GMP pool 1: G0-1 and G4/G5-1 GMP pool 2: G0-2 and G4/G5-2
