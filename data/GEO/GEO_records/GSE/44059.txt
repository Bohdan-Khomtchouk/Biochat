TITLE
Gene expression of adipocyte and stromal-vascular fractions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to select mRNA transcripts strongly enriched in murine white adipocytes versus brown adipocytes or stromal-vascular fraction, gene expression data of the adipocyte and stromal-vascular fractions of the interscapular brown, inguinal subcutaneous as well as visceral epididymal adipose tissue depots of young adult male C57BL/6 mice housed at constant 23Â°C ambient temperature were obtained.

DESIGN
18 samples: 3 different adipose tissues separated into stromal-vascular fraction and adipocytes, analyzed in biological triplicates.
