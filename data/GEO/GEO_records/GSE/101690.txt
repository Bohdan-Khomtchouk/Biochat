TITLE
Sequencing of tumor associated (B16f10-OVA) mir-155 Wt or deficient CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumor associated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were sorted from B16f10 OVA expressing tumors in miR-155 flox, miR-155 flox CD4Cre+, and miR-155 flox CD4Cre+ mice treated with immune checkpoint blocking (ICB) antibodies by flow sorting on CD45+CD3+CD4+ cells and CD45+ CD3+CD8+ cells. RNA was collected from these cells to perform RNA sequencing of total RNA.

DESIGN
Each sample represents cells from 2  to 3 individual tumors grown on individual mice that were pooled together before sorting via flow cytometry

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
