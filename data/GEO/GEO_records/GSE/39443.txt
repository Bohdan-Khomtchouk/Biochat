TITLE
Genome wide analysis of germinal center MYC positive B-cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the gene expression profile between MYC positive and MYC negative germinal center B-cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from MYC positive and MYC negative GC B-cells, isolated by FACS from 10 day sheep red blood cell immunized mice MycEGFP (a Myc reporter allele, in which a MYC-EGFP fusion protein (MYCEGFP) is expressed from the endogenous Myc locus, Huan, CY et al Eur J Immunol 2008)
