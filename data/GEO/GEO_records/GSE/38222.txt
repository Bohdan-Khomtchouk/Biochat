TITLE
Stau2 RIP-Chip in Mouse E13-14 Cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The double-stranded RNA binding protein Staufen2 (Stau2) is asymmetrically localized and segregated during asymmetric cell divisions in the developing mouse cortex and promotes intermediate progenitor cell fate. We carry out RNA immunoprecipitation with a Stau2 specific antibody, followed by microarray analysis to identify Stau2 assoicated RNAs that may be shuttled asymmetrically into one daughter cell thus affecting cell fate.

DESIGN
Cortex was dissected from E13-14 timed-pregnant Swiss Webster Mice (Taconic) and RNA immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis was carried out to identy Stau2 associated RNA cargos.
