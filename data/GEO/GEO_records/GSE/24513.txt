TITLE
Expression data from P4 and P10 mouse optic nerves

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Optic nerves are an accessible part of the CNS, providing a source of glia without the presence of neuronal cell bodies.  Therefore, an analysis was carried out of gene expression in optic nerves at P4, before myelination begins and at P10, when myelination is very actively proceeding.  The goal was to obtain a profile of the changing gene expression that accompanies this transition from unmyelinated CNS nerve to myelinated nerve.

DESIGN
Two microarray experiments were combined here.  In the first, RNA was prepared from the optic nerves of 75 P4 C57BL/6J mice and 70 P10 C57BL/6J mice. In the second experiment, RNA was prepared from the optic nerves of 55 P4 C57BL/6J mice and two groups of 50 P10 C57Bl/6J mice. In total, there are 2 P4 RNA samples and 3 P10 RNA samples being hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip 430A for Mouse Expression.
