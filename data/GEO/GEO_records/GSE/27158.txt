TITLE
Cytokine receptor modulation by interleukin-2 broadly regulates T helper cell lineage differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T helper (Th) cells control host defense to pathogens. IL 12R expression is required for Th1, IL-4Rα for Th2, and IL-6Rα/gp130 for Th17 differentiation to allow responsiveness to IL-12, IL-4, and IL-6, respectively. IL-2 via STAT5 controls Th2 differentiation by regulating the Th2 cytokine gene cluster and Il4ra expression. Here we show that IL-2 regulates Th1 differentiation, inducing STAT5-dependent IL-12Rβ2 and T-bet expression, with impaired human Th1 differentiation when IL-2 was blocked. Th1 differentiation was also impaired in mouse Il2-/- T cells but restored by IL-12Rβ2 expression. Consistent with IL-2’s inhibition of Th17 differentiation, IL-2 decreased Il6ra and Il6st/gp130 expression, and Il6st augmented Th17 differentiation even when IL-2 was present. Thus, IL-2 influences T-cell differentiation by modulating cytokine receptor expression to help specify/maintain differentiated states.

DESIGN
Genome-wide mapping of STAT1,STAT4,STAT5A,STAT5B binding to their target genes in Th1 or human CD4+ cells was conducted
