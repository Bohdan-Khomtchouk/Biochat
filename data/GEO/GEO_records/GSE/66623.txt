TITLE
Iodine-131 Biomarker Identification in the Rat Thyroid Gland

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Introduction  Iodine-131 (131I) is frequently used in nuclear medicine. Unbound or released 131I accumulate in the thyroid gland and may be detrimental to normal thyroid function. The aim of the present study was to identify biomarkers for 131I exposure in rat thyroid tissue and to assess the effect on thyroid function.    Methods   Thirty six male Sprague Dawley rats were i.v. injected with 150 µl saline solution containing 9.0, 88, 170, 260, 340, 760, 1300, or 4700 kBq (group A-H) 131I, or mock-treated with 150 µl saline solution only, and killed at 24 h after injection. Total RNA was extracted from individual thyroid tissue samples thyroids and mRNA levels were determined with the Agilent microarray platform.     Results   Estimated absorbed doses in treatment groups A-H was 0.0058, 0.057, 0.11, 0.17, 0.22, 0.5 Gy, 0.8 Gy, and 3 Gy. Totally, 429 transcripts were identified with a fold change fold change ≥ 1.5 and adjusted p-value ≤ 0.01. A trend with downregulation of thyroid hormone biosynthesis associated genes (e.g. thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, the sodium-iodine symporter) was identified, but only statistically significant after 0.0058 and 0.22 Gy. Three transcripts coding for isoform 1 of the DBP protein showed a pattern with monotonous decrease in downregulation with absorbed dose between 0.0058-0.22 Gy. Changes in Dbp expression were not statistically significant between 0.5-3 Gy. However, a trend with downregulation at 0.5 and 0.8 Gy and upregulation and 3 Gy was identified. Previously, 131I (0.85-17 Gy) and 211At (0.023-32 Gy) exposure resulted in upregulation of Dbp in mice thyroid tissue 24 h after administrations. Additionally, a monotonous decrease in Dbp downregulation has been identified of in mouse kidney tissue at 8 and 12 months after 177Lu-octreotate administrations.     Conclusion  Conclusively, the Dbp gene is a promising candidate biomarker gene for exposure to 131I and possibly other internal radiation emitters. Further studies should be performed to establish how Dbp expression vary with dose-rate, absorbed dose, time after administration, different radiation qualities, and the function of Dbp.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from fresh-frozen individual thyroid tissue samples (Sprague Dawley rats). Each sample was run once. Four rats received the same treatment. Control samples (from non-irradiated rats) are included.
