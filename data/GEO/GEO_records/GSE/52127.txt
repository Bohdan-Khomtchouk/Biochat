TITLE
Brain tumor initiating cell response to microglia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Determination of the mechanism by which microglia regulate growth of brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) and differentiation. Results identify the factors involved in the regulation and provide mechanistic basis. We subjected brain tumor initiating cells to microarray to determine the genes involved in BTICs growth and differentiation when exposed to microglia conditioned medium (MCM) for 6h.

DESIGN
BTICs were grown in MCM or control medium for 6h, and media was removed and then the cells were subjected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymatrix microarrays. Three (3) control and four (4) MCM samples were generated. The overall objective was to collect the RNA from the MCM exposed differentiated BTICs.
