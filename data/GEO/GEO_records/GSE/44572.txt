TITLE
Comparative transcriptomics reveals gain of proliferative capacity in addition to tumor-promoting mechanisms by tumor-associated macrophages in murine chronic lymphatic leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are a major component of the tumor microenvironment linked to reduced survival in most tumor entities. Using comparative transcriptomics between macrophages derived from spleen and bone marrow at pre-leukemic and leukemic state, we revealed profound re-programming of macrophages during leukemogenesis neither associated with M1-like nor M2-like macrophage programs. Instead, major transcriptional changes were linked to gain of proliferative capacity and loss of phagocytic mechanisms which we experimentally validated in vivo in mice and in vitro in humans. Using Mif-/- mice as a model for reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival of leukemic mice, we demonstrate that transcriptional programs in TAM are further shaped by such environmental factors enhancing tumorigenic effects. Comparative transcriptomics of macrophages within the same tissue at pre-malignant and malignant state lead to the identification of important macrophage-mediated suppressive mechanisms that can form a basis for the development of novel cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.

DESIGN
F4/80 macrophages were isolated by FACS-sorting from bone marrow or spleen either prior leukemia or during leukemia in Eµ-TCL1 transgenic mice. In some experiments F4/80+ macrophages were isolated from Mif-/- mice.  After the sort, cells were immediately lysed in Trizol (Invitrogen) before storage at -80°C for RNA isolation.
