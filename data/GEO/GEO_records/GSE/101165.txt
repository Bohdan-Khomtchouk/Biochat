TITLE
Expression data of wildtype and miR-146a-deficient 2D2 transgenic T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays to compare the gene expression profiles of wildtype and miR-146a-deficient 2D2 transgenic T cells.

DESIGN
Naïve CD4 T cells sorted from wildtype and miR-146a-deficient 2D2 Tg mice (denoted as 2D2 and 2D2KO T cells, respectively) were cultured in a 24-well plate at 1x10^6 cells per well for 3 days, in the presence of plate-bound anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml). On day 3, cells were collected and total RNAs were isolated for whole-genome gene expression profile analysis using the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays, following a standard Affymetrix microarray protocol (UCLA Clinical Microarray Core).
