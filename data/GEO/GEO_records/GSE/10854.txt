TITLE
The anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor cell signaling networks of the kringle 1 domain of hepatocyte growth factor (HGFK1)

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previously, we have demonstrated that the recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying the kringle domain 1 of hepatocyte growth factor (rAAV-HGFK1) gene is a potential anti-angiogenic approach for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and exerts direct inhibition effects on tumor cells. Here, using genome-wide expression profiling technology, coupled with RT-PCR validation, we investigated the differentially expressed genes and proposed the mechanisms involved in HGFK1 anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor cell signaling networks. Keywords: HGFK1, anti-angiogenic signaling network, anti-tumor cell signaling network
