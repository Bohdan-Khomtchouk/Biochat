TITLE
The anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor cell signaling networks of the kringle 1 domain of hepatocyte growth factor (HGFK1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Previously, we have demonstrated that the recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying the kringle domain 1 of hepatocyte growth factor (rAAV-HGFK1) gene is a potential anti-angiogenic approach for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and exerts direct inhibition effects on tumor cells. Here, using genome-wide expression profiling technology, coupled with RT-PCR validation, we investigated the differentially expressed genes and proposed the mechanisms involved in HGFK1 anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor cell signaling networks. Keywords: HGFK1, anti-angiogenic signaling network, anti-tumor cell signaling network

DESIGN
Microarray probe sets which were at least 2-fold changed upon rAAV-HGFK1 treatment when compared to rAAV-EGFP (baseline control) treatment on the cells are considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The differentially expressed genes were analyzed using two software tools, namely PathwayArchitect (version 1.0.0) (www.strategene.com) and Ingenity Pathways Analysis (version 5.0) ( http://www.ingenuity.com/index.html ). They are designed to assist microarray data analysis and provide visualization of biological pathways, gene regulation networks and protein-protein interactions to users. The signaling networks proposed above were manually determined and created based on the relevant findings in literature provided by the software tools.
