TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of dFOXO binding sites in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To understand how reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling extends Drosophila lifespan through its downstream transcription factor dFOXO. We conducted ChIP analysis with a dFOXO antibody followed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing from chico heterozygous mutants, which are long-lived and normal sized, and from adult flies with ablated insulin producing cells (IPCs), which are also long-lived. dFOXO bound at promoters of 273 genes common among these genotypes, thus potentially enriching for shared factors in control of aging.

DESIGN
Two replicates were sequenced from chico heterozygous mutants and IPC ablated flies.
