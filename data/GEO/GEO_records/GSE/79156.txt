TITLE
Blockade of the neogenin-RGMb-BMP signaling hub inhibits allergen-induced airway hyperreactivtiy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bronchial asthma is associated with type 2 immune responses induced by components of adaptive as well as innate immunity.  Although innate cytokines such as IL-25 have been shown to play key roles in development of airway hyperreactivity (AHR), little is known of innate molecules that regulate IL-25-mediated airway inflammation. We found that blockade of repulsive guidance molecule b (RGMb) in an experimental murine model of asthma blocked the development of AHR, a cardinal feature of asthma, and that RGMb is expressed on F4/80+CD11b+CD11cneg macrophages (RGMb+ macrophages), which accumulated in the lungs of OVA-sensitized and challenged mice, but not in na√Øve mice. Moreover, we found that a large fraction of the RGMb+ macrophages expressed the IL-25 receptor IL-17RB and produced IL-13.   IL-25 was critical for the development of AHR in our model, since mice deficient in IL-17RB did not develop AHR.  Finally, treatment with anti-RGMb mAb during the challenge phase of the protocol after allergen sensitization effectively prevented the development of AHR and airway inflammation, suggesting for the first time that RGMb+ cells, including RGMb+ macrophages, play critical roles in allergen-induced asthma. We used microarrays to compare the gene expression patterns in WT mice sensitized and challenged with OVA that were treated with either RGMb mAb or an isotype control.

DESIGN
First replicate: 3 control samples (mice sensitized and challenged with saline), 3 RGMb mAb samples, 3 isotype samples; 2nd replicate: 3 control samples, 3 RGMb mAb samples, 2 isotype samples.  Lung tissues were harvested at the same treatment time point in all groups.
