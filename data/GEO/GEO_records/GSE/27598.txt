TITLE
Effects of estrogen and progesterone on glycosyltransferase expression in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This laboratory studies the structural basis of carbohydrate function in terms of adhesion and other biological processes. The Fisher lab is testing the hypothesis that the mucin-coated oral and uterine cavities present similar carbohydrate receptors that specify the bacterial ecology of both regions and the repertoire of these oligosaccharide species is hormonally regulated. This theory also suggests that certain individuals express carbohydrate receptors that make them susceptible to both periodontal disease and preterm labor.

DESIGN
Experimental procedure: 40 mature female mice were ovariectomize . The mice were allowed to rest for two weeks to eliminate any remaining endogenous estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4). Then the mice were separated into four groups (10 each) that received the treatment indicated. Group 1: ovariectomized mice with no supplement, only sesame oil vehicle. Group 2: ovariectomized mice with only P4 supplement (2 mg/day/mouse). Group 3: ovariectomized mice with E2 supplement (100 ng/day/mouse). Group 4: ovariectomized mice with both P4 (2 mg/day/mouse) and E2 (100 ng/day/mouse) supplement. The treatment lasted for 4 days; the steroids were dissolved in sesame oil and injected subcutaneously. After treatment, salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual gland), submandibular lymph nodes and uterine horns with cervix were collected. Total RNA was extracted from these samples using Trizol.
