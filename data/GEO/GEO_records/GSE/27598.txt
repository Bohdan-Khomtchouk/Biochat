Effects of estrogen and progesterone on glycosyltransferase expression in mice

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This laboratory studies the structural basis of carbohydrate function in terms of adhesion and other biological processes. The Fisher lab is testing the hypothesis that the mucin-coated oral and uterine cavities present similar carbohydrate receptors that specify the bacterial ecology of both regions and the repertoire of these oligosaccharide species is hormonally regulated. This theory also suggests that certain individuals express carbohydrate receptors that make them susceptible to both periodontal disease and preterm labor.
