TITLE
Microarray gene expression analysis of mouse fetal liver erythroblasts after plek2 knockdown

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment is to determine the expression levels of the genes that are influenced by the downregulation of plek2.

DESIGN
TER119 negative mouse fetal liver erythroblasts were purified and infected with control and plek2 shRNA retroviruses and cultured in Epo free medium for 24 hours followed by Epo medium for 24 hours. Microarray gene expression profile analysis was performed using an Illumina platform with a biological triplicate of the same experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
