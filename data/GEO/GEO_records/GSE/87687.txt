TITLE
Gene expression profiling upon TPO treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
JAK2 activation by TPO study and its downstream targets STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 on Mouse HPC7 stem cells on four time points. The aim is to verify wether a JAK/STAT signalling signature is similar to the age-related functional decline in the haematopoietic system.

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from TPO-treated HPC7 cells at four time points. Samples were collected at 0h (Serum starved â€“ no TPO), 30 minutes, 1 hour and 4 hours. Three replicates were generated per time point.
