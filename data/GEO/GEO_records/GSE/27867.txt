TITLE
Expression data from C. elegans (wild type vs. tag-24)

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To provide insights into the mechanism underlying the enhanced immunity of tag-24/octr-1  animals, we used genome microarrays to find clusters of genes commonly misregulated in tag-24 relative to wild-type animals grown on live P. aeruginosa.

DESIGN
Gravid adult wild-type and tag-24/octr-1 animals were lysed using a solution of sodium hydroxide and bleach (ratio of 5:2), washed and the eggs were synchronized for 22 hours in S basal liquid medium at room temperature. Synchronized L1 larval animals were placed onto NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 and grown at 20°C until the animals had reached the L4 larval stage. Animals were collected and washed with M9 buffer before transferring to NGM plates containing P. aeruginosa PA14 for 4 hours at 25°C. After 4 hours, animals were collected and washed with M9 buffer, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Residual genomic DNA was removed by DNase treatment (Ambion Austin, TX).
