TITLE
Radiation-induced genes commonly expressed in lung and skin among three strains of mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling  was used to identify genes that display radiation-induced transcriptional change over mouse strain and tissue differences. Keywords: mouse strain comparison, irradiation,  time course, lung, skin

DESIGN
Inbred A/J, C57BL/6J and C3H/HeMs female mice were irradiated by gamma-rays as local irradiation in single doses to the thorax or hind leg. The animals were sacrificed at 1, 12 and 72 hours after irradiation. Non-irradiated mice served as the controls. The lungs and skin were dissected and used for expression analysis. Each sample including non-irradiated control was hybridized with global control that derived from mixture of commercially available total RNA from ten organs.
