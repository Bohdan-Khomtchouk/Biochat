TITLE
Synergistic Action of LIF and Glucocorticoids on pituitary corticotrophs cell line (AtT-20)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
While the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) activates a general stress response by increasing glucocorticoid (Gc) synthesis, biological stress resulting from infections triggers the inflammatory response through production of cytokines. The pituitary gland integrates some of these signals by responding to the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and LIF and to a negative Gc feedback loop. The present work used whole-genome approaches to define the LIF/STAT3 regulatory network and to delineate cross-talk between this pathway and Gc action. Genome-wide ChIP-chip identified 3 449 STAT3 binding sites, whereas 2 396 genes regulated by LIF and/or Gc were found by expression profiling. Surprisingly, LIF on its own changed expression of only 85 genes but the joint action of LIF and Gc potentiated the expression of more than a thousand genes. Accordingly, activation of both LIF and Gc pathways also potentiated STAT3 and GR recruitment to many STAT3 targets. Our analyses revealed an unexpected gene cluster that requires both stimuli for delayed activation: 83% of the genes in this cluster are involved in different cell defense mechanisms. Thus, stressors that trigger both general stress and inflammatory responses lead to activation of a stereotypic innate cellular defense response.

DESIGN
1) Pituitary corticotrophs cell line (AtT-20) response to glucocorticoids and LIF: AtT-20 cells mRNA extracted after treatment with PBS as control, LIF for 18h, Dex+LIF for 3h and Dex+LIF for 18h. Each treatment were made in duplicate. [GSM471246-GSM471253] 2) Pituitary corticotrophs cell line (AtT-20) response to LIF after 3h treatment: AtT-20 cells mRNA extracted after treatment with PBS as control or LIF for 3h. Each treatment were made in duplicate. [GSM471254-GSM471257] 3) Pituitary corticotrophs cell line (AtT-20) response to Dex after 3h treatment: AtT-20 cells mRNA extracted after treatment with PBS as control or Dex for 3h. Each treatment were made in duplicate.

Each treatment were made in duplicate. [GSM471262-GSM471269]
