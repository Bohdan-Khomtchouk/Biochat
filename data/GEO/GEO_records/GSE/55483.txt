TITLE
Biological effects of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha lockade in uterine cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) expression is frequently observed in many kinds of cancer and is a candidate for therapeutic targeting. Here, we evaluated the biological significance of PDGFRα and PDGFRα blockade (using a fully humanized monoclonal antibody, 3G3) in uterine cancer. PDGFRα was expressed in uterine cancer cells, and its blockade with 3G3 resulted in inhibition of PDGFRα phosphorylation and of downstream signaling molecules, AKT and MAPK. Cell viability and invasive potential of uterine cancer cells were also inhibited by treatment of 3G3. Moreover, greater therapeutic effects were observed for 3G3 in combination with chemotherapy than for either drug alone in orthotopic mouse models of uterine cancer. These findings identify PDGFRα as an attractive therapeutic target for uterine cancer.

DESIGN
Two groups of samples are included: 1.Hec-1A 2.Rl-95-2. Gene expression profiles of Hec-1A cells were compared to that of  RL95-2 cells.
