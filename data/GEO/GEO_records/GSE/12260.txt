TITLE
Expression data from isolated perfused rat hearts exposed to doxorubicin

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail transcriptional changes in the rat heart in response to doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic drug known to induce cardiac disfunction/heart failure Keywords: treatment vs control

DESIGN
Langendorff perfusion of isolated hearts with/without doxorubicin
