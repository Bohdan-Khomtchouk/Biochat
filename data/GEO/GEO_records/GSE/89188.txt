TITLE
Expression profile of Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) induced miRNAs during TGF-beta mediated chondrogenesis of marrow derived human mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A miRNA microarray was used to identify candidate miRNAs regulated by PTHrP treatment in chondrogenic hMSC differentiation. miRNA-expression patterns after PTHrP treatment for 1 week (CM-T-Pt-L1) or 3 weeks (CM-T-Pt-3) in chondrogenic culture were compared with reference levels obtained from cell pellets treated with TGF-β only (CM-T). Under identical chondrogenesis conditions (except for PTHrP treatment), miRNA-expression patterns were relatively unchanged when compared with the TGF-β-only control, which simplified the selection of candidate miRNAs. Microarray analysis revealed that only 4 miRNAs in CM-T-Pt-L1 cells and 7 miRNAs in CM-T-Pt-3 cells were differentially expressed following PTHrP treatment. Hsa-miR-590-5p and hsa-miR-892b were commonly down-regulated or up-regulated in both PTHrP-treated groups. Interestingly, hsa-miR-892b expression was not detected in the TGF-β-only control, while hsa-miR-877*, hsa-miR-1288, and hsa-miR-1305 were up-regulated. Therefore, PTHrP treatment induced hsa-miR-892b expression during TGF-β-mediated hMSC chondrogenesis. hsa-miR-892b expression in CM-T-Pt-L1 cells was 2.43-fold higher than that in CM-T-Pt-3 cells.

DESIGN
PTHrP induced miRNA expression in human MSC was measured at 21 days of chondrogenic induction after exposure for last 1 week or all 3 weeks to dose of 100 ng/ml PTHrP.  Four independent experiments were performed depending on PTHrP-exposure times (0, 1, and 3 weeks) using two different donors for each experiment.
