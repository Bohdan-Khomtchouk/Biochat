TITLE
Methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) sequencing of 15 primary stage 4S neuroblastoma tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The DNA methylome of 15 primary stage 4S neuroblastoma tumors is profiled by enrichment with a methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) and massively parallel sequencing

DESIGN
DNA of 15 primary stage 4S tumors is sheared (fragments of Â± 200 bp), followed by MBD-based (MethylCap kit of Diagenode) enrichement, library preparation and multiplexing. Both input DNA and captured DNA were sequenced paired-end on Illumina Hiseq2000
