TITLE
MLL rearrangements in pediatric ALL and AML: MLL specific and lineage specific signatures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis identified a MLL translocation-specific signature of differentially expressed genes discriminating ALL and AML with and without MLL rearrangements. Gene expression signatures of acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemia samples with and without MLL rearrangements were analyzed using paired supervised analyses.

DESIGN
ALL and AML patients with and without MLL rearrangements have been studied using paired class comparison (SAM) and class prediction (PAM) analyses.
