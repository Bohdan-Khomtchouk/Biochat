TITLE
Gene expression profile of Cnot3(+/+) & Cnot3 (∆/∆) pro-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the role Cnot3 in early B cells development, RNASeq analysis of pro-B cells (B220+ and CD43+) was performed in tamoxifen treated Cnot3(fl/fl) RERTCre and Cnot3+/+;RERTCre mice.

DESIGN
Two individual replicates of Cnot3(fl/fl) RERTCre and Cnot3(+/+) RERTCre mice were tamoxifen treated periodically. Ten days after the initial treatment, B220+CD43+ pro-B cells were sorted from the bone marrow and RNASeq analysis was performed.
