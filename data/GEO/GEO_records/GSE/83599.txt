TITLE
Comprehensive transcriptome analysis of the cochleae of 7-month-old Fabp7 (+/+) and Fabp7 (-/-) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To discover the molecules and signal pathways that are associated with the anti-aging effects of Fabp7 deficiency, transcriptome analyses were conducted using DNA microarray. The ABR thresholds of Fabp7 (+/+) and Fabp7 (-/-) mice were not significantly different at 7 months of age, but it was speculated that important gene expression changes might arise at approximately this stage. Therefore, 7-month-old Fabp7 (+/+) and Fabp7 (-/-) mice were used for transcriptome analyses.

DESIGN
Three samples (total 12 cochleae from 6 mice) per group were collected, and gene expression was measured.

PLATFORM
