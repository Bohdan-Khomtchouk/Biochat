TITLE
Screening Hub Genes Related to the Recovery Phase of Irradiation Injury by Microarray Analysis Combined with Integrated Gene Network

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used to identify the differentially expressed genes. Bioinformatics analyses integrated with databases and text-mined gene network were conducted to understand irradiation-related hub genes, pathways and biological processes. Our hypothesis in these paper are: 1) the expression profiles of irradiation damaged bone marrow tissue are not identical in injury phase and recovery phase; and 2) some hub genes potentially vital to BM recovery can be screened out by means of microarray analysis and bioinformatics analysis. The results provide basic information to explain the radiation-related biological processes and hub genes.

DESIGN
The five mRNA samples in total bone marrow cells were profiled by using gene chip at 3, 7, 11 and 21 days after irradiation and 0 day (sham-irradiation) as control. Each time point contains one sample.
