TITLE
Genome-wide methylation profiles of saliva

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate age-correlated DNA methylation changes in saliva, genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed for saliva from 54 males aged 18 to 73 years. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to acquire DNA methylation profiles across about 450,000 CpGs in bisulfite converted DNA.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 54 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
