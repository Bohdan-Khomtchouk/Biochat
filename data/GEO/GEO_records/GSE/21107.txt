TITLE
NF1 inactivation in adult acute myelogenous leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: This study was conducted to identify novel genes with importance to the biology of adult acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Conclusions: NF1 null states are present in 7/95=7% of adult AML and delineate a disease subset that could be preferentially targeted by Ras or mTOR-directed therapeutics.

DESIGN
Experimental design: We analyzed DNA from highly purified AML blasts and paired buccal cells from 95 patients for recurrent genomic microdeletions using ultra-high density Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array-based genomic profiling. 006, 096 and 136 normal Samples have been excluded from study.
