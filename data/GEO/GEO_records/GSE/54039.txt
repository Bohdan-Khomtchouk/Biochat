TITLE
LncRNA/mRNA expression profiling for THP-1 macrophages and THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By identifying differentially expressed LncRNAs/mRNAs in THP-1 macrophages and THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells, we select some differentially expressed LncRNAs and explore their roles in atherosclerosis process. We already find that some LncRNA can effect cholesterol metabolism and level of inflammation factor, which may influence atherosclerosis process.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, 6 human samples were used to acquire expression profiles, which provide futher insight into the pathologies of atherosclerosis
