TITLE
miRNA expression profile in PC12 cells under NGF treatment and deprivation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling of PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells during NGF-induced differentiation and apoptosis of differentiated cells after 24h of NGF deprivation. miRNA expression in differentiating and deprivated cells was compared  to untreated and terminally differentiated PC12 cells respectivelly.
