TITLE
miRNA expression profile in PC12 cells under NGF treatment and deprivation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling of PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells during NGF-induced differentiation and apoptosis of differentiated cells after 24h of NGF deprivation. miRNA expression in differentiating and deprivated cells was compared  to untreated and terminally differentiated PC12 cells respectivelly.

DESIGN
Five-condition experiment, NGF-treated cells (1h, 3h, 6h, 24h, 240h) vs. untreated. One-condition experiment, NGF-deprivated vs. differentiated cells.
