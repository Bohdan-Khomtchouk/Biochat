TITLE
Expression Profiling of Pancreatic Xenografts and Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of 70 Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) samples was performed on Agilent 44K expression arrays for cancer gene discovery. Additionally, matched aCGH on Agilent 244K arrays was performed. These two datasets were integrated in order to identify driver mutations leading to pancreatic cancer. Promising candidates were interrogated further using functional studies.

DESIGN
68 tumor samples (48 xenografts, 20 cell lines). 2 color arrays hybridized against a common reference pool of RNA from 11 cancer cell lines

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
