TITLE
Comparative gene expression profiles of T-dependent and T-independent germinal centre B cells in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Selection of B cells subjected to hypermutation in germinal centres (GC) during T-dependent (TD) antibody responses yields memory cells and long-lived plasma cells that produce high affinity antibodies biased to foreign antigens rather than self-antigens. GC also form in T-independent (TI) responses to polysaccharide antigens but failed selection results in GC involution and memory cells are not generated. To date there are no markers that allow phenotypic distinction of T-dependent and T-independent germinal centre B cells. We have now compared the global gene expression of GC B cells purified from mice immunized with either TD or TI antigens and identified eighty genes that are differentially expressed in TD GC. Keywords: T-dependent and T-independent germinal center B cells
