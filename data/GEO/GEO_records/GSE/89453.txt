TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of fresh-cut lettuce samples (Lactuca sativa L., var Babybel, Batavia bionda), treated with two different sanitizer procedures.

ORGANISM
Lactuca sativa

SUMMARY
Comparative profiling of fresh-cut lettuce samples treated with an alternative washing solution  (PAA) with respect to standard treated samples STD (SH-treated).We generated a comprehensive repertory of transcripts useful to study the global change induced by two sanitizer  in different time points of storage (T1, T3, and T6).

DESIGN
To investigate transcriptional changes of fresh-cut lettuce leaves  treated with two different sanitizer solution, 12K DNA microarray chips were produced with CustomArrayTM DNA Synthesizer by selecting 12000 Lactuca sativa unigenes from The Gene Index (TGI) Project database. Transcriptional datasets of fresh-cut lettuce leaves during storage were produced and then used to reveal changes in response to the sterilizing agents under investigation. T1 day 1  (first day of storage) T3 day 3  (after 3 storage days ) T6 day 6  (after 6 storage days)
