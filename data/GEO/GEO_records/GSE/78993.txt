TITLE
Demonstration of novel piRNA production in chromosome-fusion containing Oxytricha

ORGANISM
Sterkiella histriomuscorum ; Oxytricha trifallax

SUMMARY
Oxytricha cells containing a chromosome fusion were backcrossed to wild-type, and the production of novel piRNAs spanning the fusion boundary was demonstrated by PIWI-protein (Otiwi-1) immunoprecipitation - seq

DESIGN
RNA-IP of piRNAs from backcrossing Oxytricha cells, WT control was obtained from GSM860690.

PLATFORM
GPL15927 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Oxytricha trifallax)
