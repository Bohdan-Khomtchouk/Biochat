TITLE
Expression profiling of long noncoding RNAs in mouse liver tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNA profile in the liver after ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI).

DESIGN
In the study presented here, we mixed the three mouse livers after IRI and identified the genome-wide expression level of lncRNAs.
