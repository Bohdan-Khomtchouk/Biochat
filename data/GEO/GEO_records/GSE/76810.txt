TITLE
Determination of genes expressed in response to drought in root and shoot of Leucaena leucocephala

ORGANISM
Leucaena leucocephala

SUMMARY
Leucaena leucocephala seedlings were treated with PEG6000 and the shoot and root tissues were collected after 48 hours following the treatment.  The gene expressions were compared between treated and untreated in root and shoot separately. The differentially expressed genes may be related to drought resistance.

DESIGN
RNA from shoot and root from treated and untreated L. leucocephala seedlings were extracted.  Two biological replicates were made for each sample (each replicate represents about 10 individual seedlings).
