TITLE
The metabolic regulator mTORC1 controls terminal myeloid differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Monocytes are derived from hematopoietic stem cells through a series of intermediate progenitor stages, but the factors that regulate this process are incompletely defined. Using a Ccr2/Cx3cr1 dual-reporter system to model murine monocyte ontogeny, we conducted a small molecule screen that identified an essential role of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in the development of monocytes and other myeloid cells.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression in 1) Granulocyte-Monocyte Progenitors from Raptor KO mice, Tsc2 KO mice and controls; and 2) DR-ER-Hoxb8 cells differentiated in the presence of DMSO, rapamycin or SL0101-01

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
