TITLE
Yarrowia lipolytica biolipid production during D-stat setup. [Part 1]

ORGANISM
Yarrowia lipolytica

SUMMARY
First part of the time-course transcriptomic profilling of the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, obtained during a controlled decellerostat (D-stat) setup. A nitrogen limitation was applied during the course of the D-stat to initiate and control de novo biolipid synthesis.

DESIGN
Yarrowia lipolytica Agilent microarray, one-color staining.  Each time sample was spotted in triplicate. A reference condition was spotted in quadruplicate, based on a RNA pool from three samples obtained during the biomass production phase.

PLATFORM
GPL15177 Agilent-031148 Yarrowia lipolytica V2 [Probe Name version]
