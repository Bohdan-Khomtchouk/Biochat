TITLE
Mycobacterium smegmatis: I-SceI homing endonuclease generated genomic DNA damage in Darr strains expressing ArrWT, ArrH18A, ArrD83A, or an empty vector vs WT M. smegmatis Mc2155 (mgm182, site(+))

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Mycobacterium smegmatis comparing strains undergoing I-SceI generated DNA damage at a single genomic locus Gene designations are the updated annotation

DESIGN
Four comparisons were made, all with log phase cultures and no ATc added. Darr Site(+) with an empty vector compared to wild-type M. smegmatis Site(+), Darr Site(+) with a vector expressing WT Arr compared to wild-type M. smegmatis Site(+), Darr Site(+) with a vector expressing ArrH18A compared to wild-type M. smegmatis Site(+), Darr Site(+) with a vector expressing Arr D83A compared to wild-type M. smegmatis Site(+). 3 biological replicates of each strain for each experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL13909 JCVI PFGRC Mycobacterium smegmatis 22K v3 array designed primarily based on strain MC2 155 [ORF-centered version]
