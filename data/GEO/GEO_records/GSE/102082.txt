TITLE
Evaluating the relative potency and mechanism of action of azoles in the rat Whole Embryo Culture

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We evaluated the effect of azoles on embryonic development in the rat whole embryo culture (WEC). Using the total morphological scoring system (TMS), we calculated the effective dose for 10% decrease in TMS. We collected transcriptomics data for rat WEC exposed to azoles at their ID10 for 4 hours. Results revealed shared expressions responses in genes involved in the retinoic acid (RA) and sterol biosynthesis pathways, which are respectively representatives of developmental toxicity and desired fungicidal action of the azoles. Azoles with more pronounced effects on the regulation of RA-associated genes were generally characterized as more potent embryotoxicants.
