TITLE
Select correlative genes involved in pathogenesis of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia by high-throughput sequencing analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report abonormally expressed genes of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia by RNA-seq analysis. BMP3 was found down-regulated in idiopathic intestital pneumonia patients, and it closely correlated with pathogenesis of disease. The role of BMP3 in advancement of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia was verified by a series of experiments.

DESIGN
Examination of differentially expressed genes in idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. Verification the function of selected gene in pathogenesis of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia in vivo and invitro.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
