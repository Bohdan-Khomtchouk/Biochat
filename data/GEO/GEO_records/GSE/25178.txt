TITLE
Differential expression between floor plate and ventral lateral region in E10.5 mouse embryo midbrain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The data revealed differential expression between floor plate and ventral lateral region in E10.5 mouse embryo midbrain. Several differentially expressed genes in these regions have been reported in the literature, demonstrating reliability of tissue dissection.

DESIGN
Midbrain floor plate and non-overlapping adjacent ventral lateral region of mouse E10.5 embryo midbrain was dissected. Each sample was a pool from 6 embryos. Three replicates for each region were used for the experiment.
