TITLE
Genomic diversity of a pneumococcal clonal complex, 199

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae

SUMMARY
Comparative genomic hybridisation of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from a single clonal complex, in order to determine genomic diversity. Isolates were selected from a range of tissue types and serotypes in order to cover the full diversity of the clone, and also in order to try and identify tissue-specific genes

DESIGN
Biological replicates: 19 clonal complex 199 S. pneumoniae isolates. One clonal complex 180 isolate used as an outgroup. Independently grown and isolated. One isolate per array

PLATFORM
GPL10885 JCVI PFGRC Streptococcus pneumoniae 21K v6 array designed primarily based on strain TIGR4 [full array version] GPL10886 JCVI PFGRC Streptococcus pneumoniae 21K v7 array designed primarily based on strain TIGR4 [full array version]
