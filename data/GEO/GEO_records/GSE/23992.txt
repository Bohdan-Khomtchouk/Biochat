TITLE
Genomic diversity of a pneumococcal clonal complex, 199

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae

SUMMARY
Comparative genomic hybridisation of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from a single clonal complex, in order to determine genomic diversity. Isolates were selected from a range of tissue types and serotypes in order to cover the full diversity of the clone, and also in order to try and identify tissue-specific genes

DESIGN
Biological replicates: 19 clonal complex 199 S. pneumoniae isolates. One clonal complex 180 isolate used as an outgroup. Independently grown and isolated. One isolate per array
