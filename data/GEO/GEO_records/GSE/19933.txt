TITLE
Overexpression of miR-129-5p in thyroid carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TCP1 papillary thyroid carcinoma cells were plated at 100,000 cells/well in a 6-well plate and transfected with 10nM of a synthetic pre-miR-129-5p or a negative pre-miRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent. RNA samples were harvested at 24 and 48 hours post-transfection.

DESIGN
Three independent experiments performed in dye-swap: miR-129-5p versus miR-Neg.
