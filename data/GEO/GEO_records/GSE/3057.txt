TITLE
Temporal pattern of gene expression in the late third instar larvae and prepupae of Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This study identifies genes that alter their expression in synchrony with the late third instar and prepupal pulses of 20E. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from w1118 whole animals staged at -18, -4, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours relative to pupariation, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix Drosophila Genome Arrays.
