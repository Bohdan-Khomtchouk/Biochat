TITLE
Transcription Factors Sp8 and Sp9 Coordinately Regulate Olfactory Bulb Interneuron Development [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We conducted RNA-Seq and in situ hybridization to identify transcriptional profile changes in the Sp8/Sp9-DCKO olfactory bulb. Simultaneously, we did ChIP-Seq with homemade Sp9 antibody to identify Sp9 binding motifs and which changed genes might be the direct targets of transcription factor Sp9. We found that Sp9 directly binded to key genes which are required for olfactory bulb development. Transcription factors Sp8 and Sp9 belong to the same transcription factor family, so we think Sp8 and Sp9 have very similar binding sites of transcriptional regulation.

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitation reactions were performed in duplicates using one input genomic DNA as control sample.

PLATFORM
