TITLE
De novo homozygous deletion of segmental KAL1 and entire STS cause Kallmann syndrome and X-linked ichthyosis in a Chinese family

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kallmann syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous condition and a treatable form of male infertility. Defects in KAL1 gene have been implicated in Kallmann syndrome, which can be associated with X-linked ichthyosis in contiguous gene syndromes. In order to uncover the genetic cause of two brothers with Kallmann syndrome and X-linked ichthyosis, a custom semiconductor targeted resequencing panel to detect seventeen Kallmann syndrome causal genes and STS gene was designed. Next-generation sequencing was performed using this panel in the two affected brothers and their normal parents. To validate the result, we applied CytoScanâ„¢ HD array, quantitative real-time PCR and direct PCR electrophoresis analysis with the participants. The patients received clinical assessment, human chorionic gonadotropin treatment and follow-up for 39 months. The results showed that the two affected siblings have the same de novo deletion at Xp22.3 including exons 9-14 of KAL1 gene and entire STS gene but showed different phenotypes in some respects. The secondary sex characteristics of the patients were greatly improved after treatment. We firstly reported that a de novo homozygous deletion contribute to KS with bilateral cryptorchidism and unilateral renal agenesis or normal kidney development and developed a cost-effective and reliable semiconductor targeted resequencing panel for genetic diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome in routinely obtained samples.

DESIGN
One of the two brothers with Kallmann syndrome and X-linked ichthyosis was analyzed for validation the results of the deletion detected by next-generation sequencing.
