TITLE
Impact of temperature, food, and laboratory conditions on C. elegans transcriptomic analyses

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Regarding transcriptomics, the “big data” has arrived to stay. Still, researchers investigating with model organisms are often concern about the use of this public information. Using Caenorhabditis elegans we performed similar RNA-sequencing experiments, at two different temperatures, in two independent laboratories. We demonstrate that the laboratory fingerprint, due to biological and/or methodological factors, cause spurious expression changes. Interestingly, we found a transcriptional response to temperature, whereas major developmental signaling pathways such as Wnt, NOTCH, TGF or EGF/Ras/MAPK remain unaffected by temperature or lab conditions. These results support the use of transcriptomic databases to investigate central developmental processes.
