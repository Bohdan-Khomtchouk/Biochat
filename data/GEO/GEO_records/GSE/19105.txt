TITLE
Chromosomal aberrations in Tak1-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Characterization of chromosomal aberrations in liver tumors of Tak1-/- mice of different ages The aim of the project is to dissect signaling mechanisms which could be of importance during the process of liver carcinogenesis. Keywords: Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis (aCGH).

DESIGN
Comparison of chromosomal aberrations in Tak1-/- in comparison to wt mice
