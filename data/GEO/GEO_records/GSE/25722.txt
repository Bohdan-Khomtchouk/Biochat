TITLE
Chip-chip from wt and ino80 mutant cells with Htz1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Global regulation of H2A.Z localization by the INO80 chromatin remodeling enzyme is essential for genome integrity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of Htz1 in wild-type and ino80 mutant yeast demonstrated that Ino80 plays a role in replacing Htz1 with H2A.

DESIGN
Comparison of Htz1 localization in wt vs ino80 mutant yeast Prior to immunoprecipitation, cells arrested with alpha-factor or nocodazole: - The alpha-factor mating pheromone arrests yeast of the a mating type in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. - Nocodazole disrupts the polymerization of microtubules, blocking the cells from entering mitosis and arresting them in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle.
