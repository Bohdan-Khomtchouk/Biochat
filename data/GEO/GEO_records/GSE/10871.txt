SUMMARY
Expression profiles generated during dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying direct reprogramming of somatic cells to a pluripotent state (induced pluripotent stem cells, iPS). Keywords: Cell type comparison/Timecourse

DESIGN
2 technical replicates of B lymphocytes, partially reprogrammed (MCV8, MCV6, BIV1), MEF-iPS(Oct4) and B-iPS(Nanog) cell lines.
