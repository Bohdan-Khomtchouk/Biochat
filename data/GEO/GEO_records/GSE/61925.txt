TITLE
Pathogenic mechanisms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa wound infection in response to murine fascia

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Wound infections are traditionally thought to occur when microbial burden exceeds the innate clearance capacity of host immune system. Here we introduce the idea that the wound environment itself plays a significant contributory role to wound infection. We developed a clinically relevant murine model of soft tissue infection to explore the role of activation of microbial virulence in response to tissue factors as a mechanism by which pathogenic bacteria cause wound infections. Mice underwent abdominal skin incision and light muscle injury with a crushing forceps versus skin incision alone followed by topical inoculation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa whole genome transcriptional profiling demonstrated that fascia induced the activation of multiple genes responsible for the synthesis of the iron scavenging protein pyochelin.

DESIGN
Ex-vivo murine fascia homogenates were prepared and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MPAO1 was incubated with an inoculum of the fascia homogenate solution. Pseudomonas aeruginosa MPAO1 incubated under the same condtions without the homogenate was used as the control group. Three biological replicates in each group was used.
