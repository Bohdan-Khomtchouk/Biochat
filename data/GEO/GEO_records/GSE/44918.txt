TITLE
High resolution nulceotide level methylation map of female mouse primary keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We determined the high resolution methylation maps of female mouse primary keratinocytes and compared these maps at nucleotide level with the female mouse primary dermal fibroblasts. Single nucleotide level methylation maps led us to identify several additional features of CG methylation. We have detected that differentially methylated regions are epigenetically marked in other cells including embryonic stem cells and neuronal progeniator cells. Different new charecteristics and functions were also discovered with these methylation maps.
