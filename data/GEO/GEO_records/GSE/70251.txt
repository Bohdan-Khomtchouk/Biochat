TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of Zea maize TSSs

ORGANISM
Zea mays subsp. mays

SUMMARY
Genome-wide mapping of the TSS in root and shoot from two maize lines B73 and Mo17 Genome-wide locations and dynamics of maize core promoters obtained from the experimental establishment of the TSSs coordinates. The work derived from this data it is the first genome-wide atlas of core promoters and its dynamic generated for an important crop species.

DESIGN
Four samples each one with biological replicates. Comparisons were done between B73 and Mo17 for each of the tissues and between tissues for each line
