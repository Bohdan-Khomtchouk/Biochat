TITLE
Flavivirus antagonism of type I interferon signaling reveals prolidase as a regulator of IFNAR1  trafficking and expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Type I interferon (IFN-I) signals through two receptor subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, to regulate sterile and infectious immunity. IFNAR1 expression is tightly regulated to prevent autoimmunity although the mechanisms governing this are incompletely understood. We investigated the strategies used by two flaviviruses, tick-borne encephalitis virus and West Nile virus, to antagonize IFN-I signaling. Infection with these viruses resulted in depletion of IFNAR1 associated with the function of the viral IFN-I antagonist, NS5. NS5 function was dependent on its ability to associate with prolidase (PEPD), a cellular dipeptidase. PEPD was required for IFNAR1 maturation and accumulation, as well as gene induction following IFNAR1 stimulation. The relevance of PEPD to human biology was confirmed in fibroblasts derived from patients with genetic prolidase deficiency that expressed low IFNAR1 and exhibited reduced responses to IFNAR1. Thus, by understanding flavivirus IFN-I antagonism, PEPD is revealed as a central regulator of IFN-I responses in humans.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from replicates of 4 cultured dermal fibroblast lines derived from patients with genetic prolidase deficiency (PEPD), as well as from 4 cultured dermal fibroblast lines derived from normal healthy donors.  These were run on Agilent microarrays to compare differences in gene expression observed in PEPD fibroblasts compared with normal fibroblasts.
