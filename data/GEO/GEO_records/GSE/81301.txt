Proteogenomic Reveals Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Lymphoid Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we find the transcriptional network regulated by ALK oncogenic activitiy in two Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma cell lines.

DESIGN
The role of ALK in regulating the transcriptome of ALK positive ALCL cell lines was studied.
