TITLE
Gene expression from embryoid bodies derived from HBG3 HB9 ES cells exposed to serum from mice carrying an ALS causing mutation, or non-carrier littermates.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have established proof of principle for the Indicator Cell Assay PlatformÈ (iCAPÈ), a broadly applicable tool for blood-based diagnostics that uses specifically-selected, standardized cells as biosensors, relying on their innate ability to integrate and respond to diverse signals present in patientsê blood. To develop an assay, indicator cells are exposed in vitro to serum from case or control subjects and their global differential response patterns are used to train reliable, cost-effective disease classifiers based on a small number of features. In a feasibility study, the iCAP detected pre-symptomatic disease in a murine model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with 94% accuracy (p-Value=3.81E-6) and correctly identified samples from a murine Huntingtonês disease model as non-carriers of ALS. In a preliminary human disease assay, the iCAP detected early stage Alzheimerês disease with 72% cross-validated accuracy (p-Value=3.10E-3). For both assays, iCAP features were enriched for disease-related genes, supporting the assayês relevance for disease research.

DESIGN
Embryoid bodies derived from HBG3 HB9 ES cells. 29 arrays are from sod1 hemizygous exposure, and 30 from non-carrier exposure.
