TITLE
Gene expression analysis of T-ALL cell lines treated with gamma-secretase inhibitor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH1 are common in T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias making this receptor a promising target for drugs such as gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI), which block a proteolytic cleavage required for NOTCH1 activation. However, the enthusiasm for these therapies has been tempered by tumor resistance and the paucity of information on the oncogenic programs regulated by oncogenic NOTCH1. Analysis of gene expression in GSI-responsive and GSI-resistant cell lines treated with Compound E identifies differential resopnses to GSI. Keywords: Drug response

DESIGN
Samples for microarray analysis were prepared and hybridized in Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 arrays according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions and as previously described. RNA was extracted from duplicate cultures of GSI-sensitive (ALL-SIL, CUTLL1, DND41, HPB-ALL, KOPTK1) and GSI-resistant (CCRF-CEM, MOLT3, P12 ICHIKAWA, PF382 and RPMI8402) T-ALL cell lines treated for 24 h with vehicle (DMSO) or 500 nM CompE.  Interarray intensity differences were normalized with Dchip.
