TITLE
Microarray analysis of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin Exposed Amputated Adult Zebrafish Heart Ventricles

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment is to understand which transcripts are differentially expressed following exposure to TCDD. We used microarrays to understand global changes in gene signal intensity

DESIGN
Adult zebrafish (danio rerio) were injected (i.p) to vehicle control or TCDD (70 ng/g) one day prior to heart ventricle amputation.  A subset of fish were exposed but the hearts were not amputated.  Amputated hearts were collected at 6 hours post amputation and 7 days post amputation and processed for microarray analysis
