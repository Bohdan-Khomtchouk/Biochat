TITLE
TGF-beta1-Induced Gene Expression Changes in Primary Murine Hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We here compared gene expression profiles of primary murine hepatocytes (mPC) upon stimulation with 1 ng/ml TGF-beta1 for 20 min, 2 hours and 4 hours with untreated cells. Experiments were done in three independent replicates. The goal of this study was to determine genes regulated by TGF-beta1.

DESIGN
12 samples were hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array
