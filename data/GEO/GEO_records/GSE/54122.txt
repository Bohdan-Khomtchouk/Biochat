TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-435 had higher metastatic potential and other aggressive characteristics than MCF-7 cells.  Next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to clear this concern through comparison the transcriptomic expression profiles of these two cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435S cells, and the polyA+ mRNA was sequenced using Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx. The reads were mapped to RefSeq RNA reference sequences.
