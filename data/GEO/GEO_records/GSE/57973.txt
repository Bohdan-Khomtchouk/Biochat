TITLE
Age-dependent gene expression changes in human islets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptomic profiling of islet cell subtypes obtained from young and old human donors. We report the transcriptomic profiling of Endo-ßH1C cells expressing SIX3, SIX2 or GFP.

DESIGN
Profiling FACS-purified human pancreatic islet cells by RNA-Seq. We analyzed the gene expression changes in Endo-ßH1C cells expressing SIX3, SIX2 or GFP using RNA-Seq.
