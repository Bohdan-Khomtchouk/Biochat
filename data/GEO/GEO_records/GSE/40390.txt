TITLE
Genome-wide HSF1 binding sites in control and heat shocked spermatocytes and hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In somatic cells elevated temperature induces activation of the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) what leads to heat shock proteins synthesis and cytoprotection. However, in the male germ cells (spermatocytes) upon HSF1 activation, caspase-3 dependent apoptosis is induced and spermatogenic cells are actively eliminated. To find out molecular targets of HSF1 in all promoter regions, and to elucidate a mechanism of such diverse HSF1 activity we carried out genome-wide HSF1 binding analysis in control and heat-shocked cells, either spermatogenic or somatic. As model somatic cells we used hepatocytes that respond to hyperthermia in a classical way by induction of heat shock genes transcription. As spermatogenic cells we used a fraction of cells enriched with spermatocytes, which are the most sensitive to damage in elevated temperatures. Using isolated spermatocytes we avoided the influence of the somatic testicular component on the our final results.

DESIGN
On Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Mouse Promoter 1.0R Arrays we analyzed DNA immunoprecipitated (using anty-HSF1 antibody) from spermatocytes or hepatocytes, either untreated (control) or immediately after heat shock performed in vitro for 5-20 minutes. ChIP on chip analyses were done in triplicate.
