TITLE
Expression regulation by RYBP in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) are important chromatin regulators of ES cell function. RYBP binds Polycomb H2A monoubiquitin ligases Ring1A and Ring1B, and has been suggested to participate in localizing Polycomb complexes to their targets. Moreover, constitutive inactivation of RYBP precludes ES cell formation. Here we have used ES cells conditionally deficient in RYBP to investigate RYBP function. Chromosome immunoprecipitation on a chip (ChIP-chip) of RYBP and microarray experiments were performed using wild type and knocked-out ES cells. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of WT, conditionally deficient in RYBP with or without Yaf2 RNAi, and ChIP-chip of RYBP on promoters of WT, Dnmt1-KO or Eed-KO ES cells.
