TITLE
Expression data from bone marrow cultures treated with adiponectin - evidence for lipopolysaccharide contamination

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The adipocyte-derived hormone adiponectin potently inhibits osteoclast formation in vitro. Gene expression profiling of murine bone marrow cells treated with adiponectin was used to identify candidate genes that mediate the effect of adiponectin to inhibit osteoclastogenesis in these cultures. However, we found that contamination by lipopolysaccharide confounds the study of adiponectin activity.

DESIGN
Bone marrow cells were cultured for up to five days and RNA was extratced from cells treated with adiponectin and from untreated controls at different time points.
