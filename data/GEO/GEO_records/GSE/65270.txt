TITLE
Associations between host gene expression, the mucosal microbiome, and clinical outcome in the pelvic pouch of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pouchitis is a common complication for ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) surgery. Similarly to IBD, both innate host factors such as genetics, and environmental stimuli including the tissue-associated microbiome have been implicated in the pathogenesis. In this study, we make use of the IPAA model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to carry out a study associating mucosal host gene expression with the microbiome and corresponding clinical outcomes.

DESIGN
In order to determine how host gene expression might influence, or be influenced by the tissue associated microbiome, we analyzed 205 IPAA patients with biopsies collected from the pouch and afferent limb for host transcriptomics and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Metadata included antibiotic use, inflammation score, and clinical classification. To achieve power for a genome-wide microbiome-transcriptome association study, we used principal component analysis to reduce OTUs and host transcripts to eigengenes and eigenclades explaining 50% of observed variance. These were subsequently tested for significant covariation with one another and/or outcome using multivariate linear modeling.
