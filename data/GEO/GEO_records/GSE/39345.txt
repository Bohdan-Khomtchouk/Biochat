TITLE
Microarray gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer treated with first line combination chemotherapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have extended our investigation to advanced-stage NSCLC by analyzing gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with newly-diagnosed NSCLC and histopathology of either AC or SCC. Furthermore, to establish a direct link between gene expression and chemotherapy treatment, PBMC from  patients who have received 4 courses of combination chemotherapy with CDDP and GEM were obtained, and the effects of chemotherapy on global gene expression were evaluated using microarray analyses.

DESIGN
We analyzed microarray gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 30 patients with newly-diagnosed advanced stage NSCLC, and 20 age, sex, and co-morbidity-matched healthy controls (HC). All the cancer patients received a maximum of six courses of chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine of a 28-day cycle as first line treatment.Furthermore, to establish a direct link between gene expression and chemotherapy treatment, PBMC from patients who have received 4 courses of combination chemotherapy with CDDP and GEM were obtained, and the effects of chemotherapy on global gene expression were evaluated using microarray analyses.
