TITLE
Genome-wide Scan for Methylation Profiles in Keloids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal skin and keloid samples. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.1 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485577 CpGs in keloid and normal samples. Samples included 6 normal skin, 6 Keloid.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 12 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.1

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
