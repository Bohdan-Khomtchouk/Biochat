TITLE
Inner stem tissue of V2 seedlings and husks (maize B73)

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Genome-wide prediction of transcriptional enhancers in maize B73 using DNase-seq and H3K9ac ChIP-seq.  RNA-seq data was used to associate potential target genes to enhancer candidates.

DESIGN
Examination of DNase I hypersensitivity in 2 tissue types (GSE94291) Examination of H3K9ac in 2 tissue types (GSE94251) Examination of gene expression in 2 tissue types (GSE94252)

PLATFORM
GPL17628 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Zea mays)
