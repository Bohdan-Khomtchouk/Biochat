TITLE
Cardiac transcriptome of Tcf21-depleted Xenopus embryos

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
The aim of the approach was to use RNAseq analysis to identify genes expressed in  Xenopus epicardium that were affected by embryonic depletion of the epicardial transcription factor Tcf21 compared to control-MO injected siblings. Both upregulated and downregulated genes were validated by RT-PCR and whole embryo in situ hybridization to validate gene expression and assess spatio-temporal distribution of genes of interest within the heart and epicardium. Approximately 70-100 stage 44-46 Xenopus laevis hearts were dissected to isolate total mRNA from which poly-adenylated RNA was extracted using the Illumina standard protocol. This experiment represents one replicate from pooled hearts.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of stage 44-45 Xenopus laevis sibling hearts from control or Tcf21-depleted embryos, were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAII.
