TITLE
12h pathway stimulation / inhibition experiment in mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment records the transcriptional responses of mES cells (line OG2) to FGF/ERK stimulation in the presence of LIF, to LIF/STAT3 inhibition in the presence of an FGF/ERK inhibitor, and to combined FGF/ERK stimulation / LIF/STAT3 inhibition.

DESIGN
ES cells were grown feeder-free on gelatin in KSR medium containing an FGF/ERK inhibitor and LIF and were then treated for 12h as indicated for the individual samples.

PLATFORM
