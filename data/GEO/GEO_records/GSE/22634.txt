TITLE
Zebrafish toxicogenomics and phenotypic analyses reveal molecular insights into bisphenol-A (BPA) early-life exposure toxicity.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In this study, developing zebrafish were exposed to 500-4500 µg/L BPA for 7 days from 3 hours post-fertilization for a microarray experiment to obtain molecular insights into BPA early-life exposure toxicity.

DESIGN
We analyzed a total of 18 arrays; five biological replicate arrays for zebrafish treated with 500  µg/L BPA, four biological replicate arrays for zebrafish treated with 1500 µg/L BPA, four biological replicate arrays for zebrafish treated with 4500 µg/L BPA against 5 biological replicate arrays for control fish. A common reference sample was used for both treated and control samples.
