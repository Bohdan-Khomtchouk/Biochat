TITLE
Esox lucius transcriptome

ORGANISM
Esox lucius

SUMMARY
Expression data from 13 tissues in Esox lucius using RNA-seq

DESIGN
All tissues for RNA-seq were extracted from a single, juvenile, male pike caught November 1, 2011 in the Portage Diversion/Assiniboine River Floodway near Portage la Prairie, MB, Canada (N50.00747 W98.38181). The animal was euthanized and then frozen on dry ice until sampling, and subsequently at -80Â°C. Tissues were extracted by mixer-mill (Retsch) homogenization in Trizol (Invitrogen), followed by column clean-up using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN).
