TITLE
Circulating miRNAs Bear a Signature of Acute Hepatitis C Viremia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNAs were purified from frozen plasma from injection drug users in the Baltimore Before and After the Start of Hepatitis (BBAASH) Study before, during and after acute hepatitis C infection. Acute HCV outcome of 'Clear' indicates spontaneous resolution of infection. 'Time 3' in these individuals indicates the last known viremic specimen from these individuals before resolution and 'Time 4' indicates a plasma sample greater than one month after resolution of infection. Acute HCV outcome of 'Persist' indicates progression to chronic infection and 'Time 3' and 'Time 4' samples from these individuals are plasma samples time-matched to those of the clearers with the same name.

DESIGN
qPCR miRNA expression profiling. 22 individuals HCV negative at enrollment were profiled for miRNA abundance in plasma, before, during, and after HCV infection.
