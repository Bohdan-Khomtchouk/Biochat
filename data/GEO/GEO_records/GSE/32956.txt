TITLE
Global transcriptome analysis of mammary tissue during fetal bud formation and growth in two pig breeds

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The mammary gland development in swine begins at embryogenesis. The number and identity of relevant genes are unknown. Simultaneously, 24,123 probe-sets were screened, of which some 12,000 had present calls and were analysed for differential expression between different breeds (german landrace and pietrain) at different stages of development ( 63 and 91 dpc)

DESIGN
RNAs of teat from german landrace and pietrain at 63 and 91 dpc were hybridized to Affymetrix Porcine Genome Arrays.
