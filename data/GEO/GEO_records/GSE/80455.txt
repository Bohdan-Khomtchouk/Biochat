TITLE
Transcriptional Profiling of Human Endocervical Tissues Reveals Distinct Gene Expression in the Follicular and Luteal Phases of the Menstrual Cycle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify genes differentially expressed in the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle in the human endocervix and to identify significantly represented biological pathways and processes.  This was done in order to better understand mechanisms associated with hormonal regulation of endocervix function which has implications in susceptibility to infections.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human endocervix tissues obtained from hysterectomy specimens that were separated into either follicular or luteal phases by endometrial dating.
