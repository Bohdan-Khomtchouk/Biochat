TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in Staphylococcus aureus strain SH1000 wildtype vs mepR

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
MepR is a substrate-responsive repressor of mepR and mepA, which encode itself and a MATE family multidrug efflux pump.  Microarray analyses of Staphylococcus aureus SH1000 and its mepR-disrupted derivative revealed changes in expression of many genes in addition to mepR and mepA, notably several involved in virulence Keywords: Staphylococcus aureus, MATE efflux pump, MepR

DESIGN
Staphylococcus aureus strains SH1000 wildtype and mepR were grown in duplicate to exponential and post-exponential phase (corresponding to an A550 nm of 0/4 and 2.0 respectively).  RNA was harvested, converted to cDNA, labelled with Biotin and used to probe custom-designed Affymetrix antisense S.aureus GeneChips.  Eight samples in total were prepared and analyzed.
