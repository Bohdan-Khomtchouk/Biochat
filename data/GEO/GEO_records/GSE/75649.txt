TITLE
The ancestral gene repertoire of animal stem cells

ORGANISM
Ephydatia fluviatilis

SUMMARY
This work reveals the deeply conserved gene repertoire of animal stem cells, from sponges to mammals.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles totipotent stem cells (archeocytes), choanocytes, other differentiated cell types in a freshwater sponge and were mapped on the reference transcriptome generated in the same study
