SUMMARY
Cytoplasmic DNA triggers the activation of the innate immune system. While downstream signaling components have been characterized, the DNA sensing components remain largely elusive. We performed a systematic proteomics screen for proteins that associate with DNA, traversed to a screen for IFN-β-induced transcripts. We identified DSIRE (DNA sensor for the IL-1β response, previously called AIM2) as a candidate cytoplasmic sensor. DSIRE showed a marked selectivity for double-stranded DNA. DSIRE can recruit the inflammasome adaptor ASC and gets redistributed to ASC speckles upon coexpression of ASC. RNAi-mediated reduction of DSIRE expression led to an impairment in IL-1β maturation. Reconstitution of unresponsive cells with DSIRE, ASC, caspase 1 and IL-1β showed that DSIRE is sufficient for inflammasome activation. Overall, our data strongly suggest that DSIRE is a cytoplasmic DNA sensor for the inflammasome.
