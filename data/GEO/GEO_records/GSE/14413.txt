TITLE
Gene expression profiling of interferon-beta stimulated cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cytoplasmic DNA triggers the activation of the innate immune system. While downstream signaling components have been characterized, the DNA sensing components remain largely elusive. We performed a systematic proteomics screen for proteins that associate with DNA, traversed to a screen for IFN-β-induced transcripts. We identified DSIRE (DNA sensor for the IL-1β response, previously called AIM2) as a candidate cytoplasmic sensor. DSIRE showed a marked selectivity for double-stranded DNA. DSIRE can recruit the inflammasome adaptor ASC and gets redistributed to ASC speckles upon coexpression of ASC. RNAi-mediated reduction of DSIRE expression led to an impairment in IL-1β maturation. Reconstitution of unresponsive cells with DSIRE, ASC, caspase 1 and IL-1β showed that DSIRE is sufficient for inflammasome activation. Overall, our data strongly suggest that DSIRE is a cytoplasmic DNA sensor for the inflammasome.

DESIGN
In a genomic screen, we used NIH3T3, L929 and RAW264.7 cells to identify genes that were transcriptionally regulated by IFN-β. We stimulated the cells with IFN-β for 4h, isolated the RNA and analyzed global changes in gene expression by microarray analysis. Overall, 225 genes were upregulated at least 3fold, among which numerous well-known interferon-induced genes were found
