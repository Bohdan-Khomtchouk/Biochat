TITLE
Expression of PRAME in retinoblastoma primary tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of partially degraded and fragmented RNA samples from retinoblastoma primary tumors. Global gene expression profiling has shown great promise in high-throughput biomarker discovery for early disease detection in Retinoblastoma tumors.  In this analysis we have used 3 retinoblastoma primary tumors in triplicates which was normalised against human healthy Retina. Here, we have used nanogram scale of retinoblastoma RNA, processed in  HUMAN GENE 1.0 ST ARRAYS.

DESIGN
We have analysed the gene expression in 2 normal healthy adult retina collected from cadaveric eyes and 3 retinoblastoma primary tumors

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
