TITLE
Effect of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in combination with high-cholesterol diet on cholesterol homeostasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to see any effect of rosuvastatina or atorvastatin on cholesterol homeostasis after 24 hours in C57BL/6 hyperlipidemic mice (induced by diet). Experiments were perfomed using a custom Steroltalk v2 microarray. Effect of both statins on drug metabolism was also evaluated. All experiments were done within the European sixth Framework program “Steroltalk” (www.steroltalk.net).

DESIGN
Animals were given one peroral application of vehicle (tap water), 20 mg/kg rosuvastatin or 40 mg/kg atorvastatin after one week of 1% cholesterol diet. After 24h they were sacrificed and total RNA was isolated from the livers. Each sample was hybridized with a reference sample to Steroltalk v2 microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL7190 Steroltalk v2 mouse
