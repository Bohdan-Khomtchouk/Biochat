TITLE
Expression profiling of small intestine neuroendocrine tumors identifies subclasses  with clinical relevance, therapeutic target and biomarkers for prognosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to define the gene expression profiles of small intestine neuroendocrine tumors  (SI-NETs) in order to identify clinically relevant subgroups of tumors, prognostic markers  and novel targets for treatment.

DESIGN
Genome-wide expression profiling was conducted on tumor biopsies from a cohort of 33  patients with metastatic SI-NETs and on 10 normal small intestine (SI)  mucosa (controls).
