TITLE
Whole genome epigenetic sequencing on DNA from infarcted non-infarcted left ventricle of WT and NEIL3-deficient mice subjected to myocardial infarction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myocardial  infarction  (MI)  triggers  a  reparative  response  involving  fibroblast  proliferation   and  differentiation  driving  extracellular  matrix  modulation  necessary  to  form  a  stabilizing   scar.  Recently,  it  was  shown  that  a  genetic  variant  of  the  base  excision  repair  enzyme   endonuclease VIII-like 3  (NEIL3)  was associated  with increased risk of MI in humans. Here,   we  report  elevated  myocardial  NEIL3  expression  in  heart  failure  patients  and  marked   myocardial  upregulation  of  Neil3  following  MI  in  mice,  especially  in  a  fibroblast-enriched   cell fraction.  Neil3-/-mice showed increased  mortality after MI compared to WT, caused by   myocardial rupture.  Epigenomic  analysis  suggested  dysregulated  myofibroblast proliferation   and  differentiation  in  Neil3-/-hearts  and  several  differentially  expressed  genes  were   downstream targets of  differentially  methylated/hydroxymethylated transcriptional regulators.  Furthermore, proliferation of Vimentin+ and ÔÅ°SMA+ (myo)fibroblasts was increased in Neil3  -/-hearts  following  MI.  We  propose  that  NEIL3-dependent  modulation  of  epigenetic  DNA   methylation regulates cardiac fibroblast proliferation and thereby controls extracellular matrix  modulation after MI.
