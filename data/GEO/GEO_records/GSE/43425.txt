TITLE
Long noncoding RNAs expression data from Atm+/+ and Atm-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts  after DNA damage at various time point

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Atm+/+ and Atm-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts were treated with or without DNA damaging agent neocarzinostatin (NCS), and cells were harvested after 4 hours and 8 hours for the microarray analyses of whole-genome long noncoding RNAs.

DESIGN
To examine how long noncoding RNAs are regulated in the DNA damage response, we assessed the genome-wide long noncoding RNA expression in Atm+/+ and Atm-/- littermate mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) treated with or without DNA damage
