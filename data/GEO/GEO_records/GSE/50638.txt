TITLE
expression data from Zbtb17 cKO mouse heart after pressure overload

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
whole gene expression analysis for ZBTB17 cKO mice after transverse aortic constriction (TAC) We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying hypertrophy and heart failure process upon pressure overload

DESIGN
16 male mice, 4 mice per group, were selected at 8-10 weeks old for 4 weeks of TAC and SHAM and collected samples for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We included corresponding controls.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
