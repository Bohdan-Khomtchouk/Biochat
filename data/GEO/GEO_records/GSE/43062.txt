TITLE
Genome wide mapping of histone 3 lysine 79 dimethylation in MLL-AF6 murine leukemias

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the genome wide distribution of H3K79 dimethylation in mouse MLL-AF6 positive leukemias to assess whether this epigenetic mark drives MLL-target gene expression.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K79 dimethylation in  bone marrow cells from sacrificed terminally ill MLL-AF6 positive leukemic mice. The retroviral MSCV-IRES-neo-MLL-AF6 construct was transduced into mouse bone marrow lineage negative Kit +, Sca + (LSK) cells and these cells were injected after G418 selection into irradiated syngenic mice to establish MLL-AF6 positive leukemias.
