TITLE
LncRNA expression profile in minor salivary gland of Sjögren’s syndrome (SjS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The present study was aimed to identify aberrantly expressed lncRNAs involved in the progression of SjS and explore their potential functions. Labial salivary gland of 4 SjS patients and 4 healthy controls was collected. LncRNA expression profile in labial salivary gland was analyzed by LncRNA microarray.

DESIGN
LncRNA expression profile in labial salivary gland of 4 SjS patients and 4 healthy controls was analysised. Patients with SjS were fulfilled the American-European consensus group criteria for SjS. No immunosuppressive treatment was conducted in these patients before the sample conllection. All healthy donors were confirmed to be free of acute infection or systemic diseases.
