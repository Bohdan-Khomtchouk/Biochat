TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of HoxBlinc lncRNA downstream targets in mouse ESC-derived embryonic bodies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We find a new non-coding transcript associated with active HoxB locus, which we named HoxBlinc lncRNA.  We report that HoxBlinc RNA  specifies Flk1+ mesoderm and then promotes the development of HS/PCs and cardiomyocytes. To understand the molecular pathways reguated by HoxBlinc, we generate two doxycycline inducible  KD ES R1E cell lines,  then differentiate these cell lines to day 6 via embryonic bodies stage. RNA-seq analysis were performed for day 6 EBs with or without doxycycline treatment starting at Flk1+ mesodermal stage.

DESIGN
RNA from day 6 EBs targeting with 2 invidiual shRNAs with or without doxycycline treatment were combined together for RNA-seq analysis.
