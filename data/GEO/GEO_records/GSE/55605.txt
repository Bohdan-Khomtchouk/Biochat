TITLE
Role of Polycomb group proteins in the DNA damage response – a reassessment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have investigated whether components of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) are recruited to double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by inducible expression of the AsiSI restriction enzyme in normal human fibroblasts.  Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (ChIP-seq), which detects PRC1 proteins at common sites throughout the genome, we did not find evidence for recruitment of PRC1 components to AsiSI-induced DSBs.  In contrast, the S2056 phosphorylated form of DNA-PKcs and other DNA repair proteins were detected at a subset of AsiSI sites that are predominantly at the 5’ ends of transcriptionally active genes. Our data question the idea that PcG protein recruitment provides a link between DSB repairs and transcriptional repression.

DESIGN
Single chromatin preparations from treated and untreated cells (+/- OHT), immunoprecipitated with two antibodies (pDNA-PKcs and MEL18) were sequenced as technical replicates, along with the corresponding input DNAs
