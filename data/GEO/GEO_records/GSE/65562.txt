TITLE
Similarities and Distinctions in Actions of Surface-Directed and Classic Androgen Receptor Antagonists

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was undertaken to compare efficacy of MJC13 and the classic AR antagonist flutamide. Both compounds modulate endogenous AR target gene expression in Prostate cancer cells in a similar fashion despite different mechanisms of action.

DESIGN
LNCaP cells were seeded within 6-well dishes at density of 1 × 100,000 within RPMI 1640 media supplemented with L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), day 2 the media replaced with RPMI 1640 media supplemented with L-glutamine and 10% charcoal-stripped FBS, day 3 the cells were treated with DMSO (control), 10nM DHT, 1μM Flutamide, 1μM Flutamide + 10nM DHT, 30μM MJC13, or 30μM MJC13 + 10nM DHT for 24 hours, after which total RNA was isolated.
