TITLE
Genome-wide translational analysis of the effect of acute endurance exercise on mouse gastrocnemius

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the translational regulation of skeletal muscle during acute endurance exercise. Methods: We used mRNA-Seq and ribosome profiling to examine transcriptional and translational regulation, respectively. Result: There were clear distinctions between the profiles of transcription and translation even at a basal condition. TOP-motif genes were translationally suppressed immediately after the exercise. Other genes, such as Slc25a25 was significantly translationally up-regulated presumably in a mTOR-independent manner. Conclusion: There were diverse regulation between transcription and translation. Although many focused on overall protein synthesis to understand the effect of exercise, translational regulation of individual genes are required.

DESIGN
Transcriptional and translational profiles of mouse gastrocnemius with or without acute endurance exercise were generated using Ion PGM sequencer.
