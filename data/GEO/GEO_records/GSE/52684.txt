TITLE
Large scale transcriptomic characterization of mice blood inflammation during Acute Lung Injury (PBMC)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ARN sample of PBMC from mouse were obtened at 6 times points: 1h, 1h30, 3h, 4h, 18H, 24h, after injection of oleic acid or physiological serum PBMC total RNAs from mouse injected with acid oleic or physiological serum were profiled after hybridization with Agilent SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray to identify genes with differential expression

DESIGN
Blood from 30 C57BL6 mice are divided into 6 groups . Each group included tree or two mices given physiological serum (Phi) and 3 mices given oleic acid (OA). Each group was identified according to the incubation time: 1h, 1h30, 3h, 4h, 18h and 24h.

PLATFORM
GPL13912 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
