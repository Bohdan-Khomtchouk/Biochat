TITLE
Impact of ERG and PTEN loss on RNA expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The current study defines the how ERG, PTEN, and AR inteact to regulate the transciptome in established prostate cancers.  Prostate cancer organoids were derived from established prostate cancer in GEM models harboring ERG over-expression and/or loss of PTEN and cultured in vitro using prostate epithelial organoid culture conditions. The established organoids were then isolated as individual clones in triplicate and CRISPR strategies were employeed to knock out ERG and AR.  RNA was isolated under physiologic steady state growth conditions and 24 hour treatment with the AR inhbitor MDV3100 in a subset of ERG-PTEN CRISPR ERG organoids.

DESIGN
18 samples over 6 genotype/conditions with 3 individual clones per genotype/condition

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
