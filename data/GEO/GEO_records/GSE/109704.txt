TITLE
Gene expression profiling of immune response genes and epigenetic modification factors in melioidosis patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study population consisted of 30 melioidosis cases, 10 healthy controls and 10 sepsis cases caused by other pathogens. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCâ€™s) of study subjects. Gene expression profiles of 25 gene targets including 19 immune response genes and 6 epigenetic factors were analyzed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling of melioidosis patients compared to other sepsis cases and healthy controls
