TITLE
Expression data from mouse lung squamous cell carcinoma isolated from KrasG12D;Lkb1 mice treated with Vehicle or with catalytic mTOR inhibitor MLN128 for 8 weeks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lung tumors were induced in Kras LSL-G12D; Lkb1 fl/fl mice by intranasal inhalation of Adenoviral Cre. Four weeks after tumor induction, mice were randomly assigned into two groups and treated daily with either Vehicle or 1mg/kg MLN128 for 8 weeks. At the end of the study, mice were euthanized and tumors were dissected out from lung and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tumors were stored in -80C freezer. Lung squamous cell carcinomas adapted to chronic treatement with MLN128 We used microarrays to examine changes in the gene expression in pathways that allowed MLN128 treated squamous cell carcinomas to continue to proliferate in the presence of MLN128

DESIGN
Lung tumors were induced in Kras LSL G12D; Lkb1 fl/fl mice by intranasal administration of Adenoviral Cre. Four weeks after tumor induction, mice were randominzed into two groups and treatment started with either Vehicle or 1mg/kg MLN128. Mice were treated daily for 8 weeks. N = 3 squamous cell carcinomas (biological replicates) from Vehicle group; N = 3 squamous cell carcinomas (biological replicates) from MLN128 group.
