TITLE
Expression data from colons of mice fed psyllium fiber

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Feeding dietary fiber is known to provide us many beneficial effects. We used microarrays to detail the changes of gene expression in colons of mice fed the psyllium fiber for 5 days.

DESIGN
Mice were devided into 2 groups, control and psyllium fiber. The psyllium fiber group fed the diet containing 10% psyllium for 5 days, whereas the control groups fed the diet without psyllium fiber. Total RNA were extracted from mouse colons and applied to the microarrays.
