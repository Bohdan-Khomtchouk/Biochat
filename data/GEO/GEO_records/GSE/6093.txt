TITLE
Expression data from rat mammary tumors with varying invasive phenotyes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify genes implicated in breast cancer progression Keywords: tumor progression

DESIGN
By serially transplanting initial carcinogen induced rat mammary tumors (PR for primary tumor) through five generations of syngeneic hosts, we generated a series of tumors (T1 through T5) with varying invasive and metastatic phenoytpes
