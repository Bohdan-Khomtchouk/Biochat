SUMMARY
Background: Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) represents a therapeutic challenge for current medications. Methods: In order to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in CRPC progression and to identify new therapeutic targets, we analyzed a unique sample set of 11 castration-resistant prostate cancers and 7 advanced tumors by array-CGH and gene expression microarrays. The genome-wide DNA and RNA data were integrated to identify genes whose overexpression was driven by their amplification. To assess the functional role of these genes, their expression was analyzed in a transcriptional dataset of 329 clinical prostate cancers and the corresponding gene products were silenced using RNA interference in prostate cancer cells. Results: Six recurrent genetic targets were identified in the CRPCs; ATP1B1, AR, FAM110B, LAS1L, MYC and YIPF6. In addition to AR and MYC, FAM110B emerged as a potential key gene involved in CRPC progression in a subset of the tumors. FAM110B was able to regulate AR signaling in prostate cancer cells and FAM110B itself was regulated by androgens. FAM110B siRNA inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and this effect was substantially enhanced in androgen deficient conditions. Ectopic FAM110B expression in non-cancerous epithelial prostate cells induced aneuploidy and impaired antigen presentation. Conclusions: The DNA / RNA gene outlier detection combined with siRNA cell proliferation assay identified FAM110B as a potential growth promoting key gene for CRPC. FAM110B appears to have a key role in the androgen signaling and progression of CRPC impacting multiple cancer hallmarks and therefore highlighting a potential therapeutic target.
