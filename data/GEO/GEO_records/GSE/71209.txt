TITLE
Genes Targeted by the Hedgehog-Signaling Pathway can be Regulated by Estrogen Related Receptor Î²

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report Hedgehog signaling responsive genes with or without Esrrb in NI3T3 cells. Using Hh-responsive cells, we used RNA-Seq to find Hh responsive genes. In addition, we tested Esrrb's modification on Hh target genes' response.

DESIGN
Control vector transfected cells with vehicle treatment, Esrrb expression vector transfected cell with vehicle treatment, control vector transfected cells with Hh conditioned medium treatment, Esrrb expression vector transfected cell with Hh conditioned medium treatment,
