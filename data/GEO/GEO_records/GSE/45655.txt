TITLE
Lytic infection of Lactococcus lactis by bacteriophages Tuc2009 and c2 trigger alternative transcriptional host responses

ORGANISM
Lactococcus virus c2

SUMMARY
This study analysed the temporal transcriptional response of L. lactis UC509.9 undergoing infection with either Tuc2009 or c2, representing phages of two different species (P335 and c2, respectively) of the family Siphoviridae. For the first time, to our knowledge, both DNA microarrays of the host and high resolution tiling arrays of each phage were used provide corresponding data sets of the entire transcriptome at various points post-infection.
