TITLE
The rpoS transcriptome of Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 grown in rich medium

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas protegens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of an rpoS mutant of Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 in comparison to the wild-type Pf-5 strain grown in nutrient broth supplemented with 1% glycerol to OD600=2.0-2.4 (early stationary phase).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, the rpoS mutant compared to wild-type Pf-5 grown in nutrient broth supplemented with 1% glycerol to early stationary phase.  There are three biological replicates and two flip-dye replicates for a total of six slides analyzed.  Each slide contains three replicate spots per gene.

PLATFORM
