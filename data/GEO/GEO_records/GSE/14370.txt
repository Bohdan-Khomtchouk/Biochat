TITLE
Characterization of expression changes in armi,rhino,aub,ago3 mutants by tiling array

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We characterized changes of transposon and mRNA expressions in armi, rhino ,aub, ago3 mutants with respect to wild type using Affy tiling array. In most of these mutants, mRNA expressions were mostly unchanged but increased expressions was observed for many transposons indicating the role of these proteins in silencing transposons in Drosophila ovaries Keywords: Tiling array transcriptome profiling

DESIGN
3 replicates of each mutants and wild type, total RNA samples hybridized to tiling array.

PLATFORM
