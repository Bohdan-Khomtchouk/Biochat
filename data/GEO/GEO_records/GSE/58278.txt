TITLE
Genome wide analysis of the host antiviral response to dengue virus infection in primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the host response to dengue virus at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that dengue virus triggers and regulate different pathaway with different kinetics controlling the antiviral, the inflammatory and the apoptotic response in primary human DC. Results provide important information of the response to DC to dengue virus showing that antioxidant genes are early stimulated after denv infection reflecting an early production of reactive oxygen species. Interestingely, we demonstrated that ROS production and antiviral and apoptotic responses intersect since chemical inhibition of ROS impairs antiviral and apoptotic responses in these cells.
