TITLE
Gene expression change of M1 and BY-P41K-RPB7 in YPAD (OD600 reached 1) and after 12h Very High Gravity (VHG) fermentation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To further study the transcription profile of mutant M1 and its control (BY-P41K-RPB7), we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify differentially expressed genes in YPAD medium under OD600 reached 1 and after 12 VHG fermentation.

DESIGN
Total cellular RNAs were extracted from both the mutant and the control using RNeasy® Mini Kit and RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen,Hilden, Germany) under the following two conditions: i) when cells reached early exponential phase (OD600 ~1.0) in YPAD; ii) after 12h VHG fermentation. RNA quality and integrity was verified by gel electrophoresis, as well as by measuring 260/230 ratios with a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA). Two biological replicates of each sample were sent to Genomax Technologies (Singapore) for DNA microarray assay using Yeast (V2) Gene Expression Microarray, 8×15K Microarrays (Agilent technologies, USA). The obtained data was analyzed by Agilent Genespring GX software and the p-values were calculated by unpaired Student t-test.
