TITLE
Expression analysis of Desulfovibrio africanus strain Walvis Bay

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio africanus str. Walvis Bay

SUMMARY
Investigation of partial genome gene expression level changes in a Desulfovibrio africanus during exponential and stationary phase growth in the presence and absence of 5 ug/L Hg2+ (as HgNO3). Desulfovibrio africanus is a known mercury methylating bacteria

DESIGN
A 3 chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate cultures of Desulfovibrio africanus with 5 ug/L Hg during exponential phase growth, three seperate cultures of Desulfovibrio africanus with 5 ug/L Hg during stationary phase growth, three cultures of Desulfovibrio africanus without Hg during exponential phase growth, and Desulfovibrio africanus without Hg during stationary phase growth.  Each chip measures the expression level of 4,585 genes and intergenic regions from Desulfovibrio africanus strain Walvis Bay on a custom Nimblegen format with 75-mer probes with tiled in 4-plex format.

PLATFORM
GPL14660 NimbleGen Desulfovibrio africanus array [080225_D_afric_SB_expr_X4]
