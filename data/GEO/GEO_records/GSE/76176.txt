TITLE
Role of MYC target lncRNA DANCR in cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling by array Effects of DANCR siRNA on gene expression

DESIGN
PC3 cells were seeded in 6-well plates in antibiotic-free media overnight, and then transfected with DANCR siRNA. Arrays were performed to determine the repertoire of genes that change following knock-down of DANCR.
