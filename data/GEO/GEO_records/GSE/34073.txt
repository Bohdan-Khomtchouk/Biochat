TITLE
Uniform optimal framework for integrative next-gen sequence analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we have collapsed multiple analysis problems into two coherent categories, signal detection and signal estimation and adapted linear-optimal solutions from signal processing theory. Our algorithms for detection (DFilter) and estimation (EFilter) extend naturally to integration of multiple datasets. In benchmarking tests, DFilter outperformed assay-specific algorithms at identifying promoters from histone ChIP-seq, binding sites from transcription factor (TF) ChIP-seq and open chromatin regions from DNase- and FAIRE-seq data. EFilter similarly outperformed an existing method for predicting mRNA levels from histone ChIP-seq data (Spearman correlation: 0.81 - 0.89). We performed H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 ChIP-seq on e11.5 mouse forebrain and used DFilter and EFilter to predict promoters and developmental gene expression, uncovering plausible gene targets for SNPs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.

DESIGN
