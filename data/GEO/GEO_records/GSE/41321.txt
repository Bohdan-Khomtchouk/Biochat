TITLE
Differential microRNA expression profiles in Retinoblastoma serum

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Retinoblastoma (RB) is a malignant intraocular neoplasm occurs mostly in children. The malignancy caused due to altered miRNA expression in cancer tumors and circulating body fluids has been reported in several cancers. The aberrantly expressed microRNAs are useful for diagnosis and prognosticating the tumors. Circulating miRNAs have been identified as potential markers in neoplastic and non -neoplastic diseases. The aim of the study involves identifying microRNA signatures of serum of Retinoblastoma and possible use of differential miRNA as unique biomarker for RB.
