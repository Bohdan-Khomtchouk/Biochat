TITLE
Role of epigenetic modifiers on the bovine fibroblast innate immune response

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The innate immune signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the recognition and early response to pathogens associated with disease. Genetic analysis has been unable to completely account for individual variability in the strength of the innate immune response. The aim of this study was to determine the role of the epigenetic markers (DNA methylation or histone acetylation) in controlling bovine gene expression in relation to the response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To determine the impact epigenetics may have in controlling innate immunity, dermal fibroblasts from fifteen dairy heifers having previously displayed a differential response to LPS were exposed to 5-aza-2â€™-deoxyctidine (AZA) and trichostatin A (TSA); de-methylating and hyper-acetylating agents, respectively. The AZA-TSA

DESIGN
Fibroblast cultures (n=3) were examined under either control conditions or for gene expression following epigenetic modification with the de-methylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and hyper-acetylation agent trichostatin-A. Finally, expression was investigated for responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
