TITLE
Gene expression analysis of cervical cancer progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix-U133-plus2.0-based gene expression analysis of laser-captured epithelium from 128 cervical tissue specimens from women enrolled in SUCCEED Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most frequent cancer in women and the third leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Our analysis of normal, precancerous, and cancerous cervical tissue shows that progress of the disease is a cascade of increased DNA replication/repair and cell proliferation followed by substantial metabolic shifts. The data show a sharp decrease in estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±) in tumor cells, and ranking tissue specimens by estrogen-responsive gene expression correlates remarkably closely with histological pathology.

DESIGN
24 normal, 14 CIN1 lesions, 22 CIN2 lesions, 40 CIN3 lesions, and 28 cancers specimens were cryosecrtioned and used for laser-capture, RNA extraction, two rounds of T7-mediated amplification, and cRNA biotinylation. Bio-cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix U133-Plus2.0 arrays, scanned signals were processed through GC-RMA
