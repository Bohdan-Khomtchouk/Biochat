TITLE
Radiation and Dual Checkpoint Blockade Activates Non-Redundant Mechanisms in Cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Response to immune checkpoint inhibitors may be improved through combinations with each other and other therapies, raising questions about non-redundancy and resistance. We report results from parallel studies of melanoma patients and mice treated with anti-CTLA4 and radiation (RT). Although combined treatment improved responses, resistance was common. Computational analyses of immune and transcriptomic profiles (provided here) revealed that resistance in mice was due to upregulation of tumor PD-L1 that drives T cell exhaustion. Accordingly, optimal response requires RT, anti-CTLA4, and anti-PD-L1. Anti-CTLA4 inhibits Tregs, RT diversifies and shapes the TCR repertoire, and anti-PD-L1 reinvigorates exhausted T cells. Together, all three therapies promote the expansion of clonotypes with distinct TCR traits. Similar to mice, patients with melanoma showing high PD-L1 did not respond to RT + anti-CTLA4, demonstrated persistent T cell exhaustion, and rapidly progressed. Thus, the combination of RT, anti-CTLA4, and anti-PD-L1 promotes response through distinct mechanisms.

DESIGN
Mice with bilateral flank B16-F10 tumors were treated with radiation to one tumor combinated with CTLA4 blockade. From unirradiated tumors that were resistant or relapsed after therapy, cell lines were isolated. After confirming the resistance phenotype by reimplantation, tumors from these resistant cells and control sensitive cells were profiled by microarray.
