TITLE
Epigenetic regulation of sex determination by the histone demethylase Jmjd1a

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Developmental gene expression is defined through cross-talk between the function of  transcription factors and epigenetic status including histone modification. Although  several known transcription factors play crucial roles in mammalian sex determination,  how chromatin regulation contributes to this process is unknown. We observed  male-to-female sex reversal in mice lacking the H3K9 demethylase Jmjd1a, and found  that Jmjd1a directly regulates expression of the mammalian Y chromosome  sex-determining gene Sry, by regulating H3K9me2 marks. These studies reveal a pivotal  role for epigenetic regulation in mammalian sex determination, and provide new  impetus for identifying additional causes of disorders of sex determination by  environmental factors.

DESIGN
Gene expression patterns were measured in gonadal somatic cells of Jmjd1a mutant and control embryos at E11.5.  Three biological replicates were performed in each group.
