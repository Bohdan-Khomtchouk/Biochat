TITLE
Investigation of griffithsin's interactions with human cells confirms its outstanding safety and efficacy profile as a microbicide candidate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Treatment of cells by  different concentrations of Griffithsin resulted in minor alterations in gene expression

DESIGN
Cells were treated with Griffithsin or controls (Cyanovirin-N, lectin deficient Griffithsin termed mGRFT and PBS) and incubated overnight (16 h). Gene expression was compared to that of the PBS treated cells to derive fold changes. Each treatment was done in triplicates. Benjammini and Hochberg  correction was used and we considered a fold change of at least 2.0 compared to the PBS treated samples to represent a meaningfully altered gene expression.
