TITLE
Arc/Arg3.1 functionally defines migrating 1 dendritic cells and regulates actin dynamics

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the expression profiles of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) derived from Arc/Arg3.1 knockout and wildtype animals.

DESIGN
We generated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from Arc/Arg3.1 knockout and wildtype animals. BMDC were either stimulated with LPS or left untreated and analysed by microarray.
