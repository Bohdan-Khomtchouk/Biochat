TITLE
Cross-Species Comparisons of Transcriptomic Alterations in Human and Rat Primary Hepatocytes Exposed to 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin: rat samples

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
A toxicogenomics approach was used to qualitatively and quantitatively compare the gene expression changes in human and rat primary hepatocytes exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Hepatocytes from five individual rats and five individual humans were exposed for 24 hours to 11 concentrations of TCDD ranging from 0.00001 nM to 100 nM and a vehicle control.  Gene expression changes were analyzed using whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
60 microarrays representing primary hepatocytes from 5 rats, each exposed to 11 doses of TCDD and vehicle controls. Arrays were completed with a one-color design.
