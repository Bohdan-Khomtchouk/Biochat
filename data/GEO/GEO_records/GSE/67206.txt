TITLE
GATA3/G9A/MTA3 sequencing in non-treated  MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription factor GATA3 is essential for the specification and maintenance of the luminal cell differentiation in the mammary gland, and its expression is progressively lost during luminal breast cancer progression. However, how loss-of-function of GATA3 contributes to the development of breast cancer is still poorly understood. Here, we report that GATA3 nucleates a transcription repression program composed of G9A and MTA3-, but not MTA1- or MTA2-, constituted NuRD complex. Genome-wide analysis of the GATA3/G9A/NuRD(MTA3) targets identified a cohort of genes that are critically involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell invasion.

DESIGN
Examination of GATA3/G9A/NuRD(MTA3) target genes in MCF-7 cell line.
