TITLE
Effect of ruxolitinib treatment on gene expression in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HCC1143, HCC70, HCC38, and SUM159PT cells were treated for 4 or 24 hrs with 1uM ruxolitinib.  Control cells were treated for 24 hrs with DMSO (0.1%). The purpose was to determine changes in gene expresison patterns following inhibition of JAK1/2 in the cells.

DESIGN
Three independent experiments were conducted for three biological replicates at each time point, for each cell line
