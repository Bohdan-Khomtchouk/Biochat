TITLE
The Indispensible and Global Role of NAD Metabolism for the Lifestyle and Virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa TBCF10839

SUMMARY
A knockout of nrtR gene (PA4916) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa leads to the global changes in metabolic profile of the pathogen to its complete avirulence.

DESIGN
Bacterial cells of TBCF10839 and TBCF10839nrtR::Tn5 were grown in LB broth to late exponential phase at 37 oC

PLATFORM
GPL84 [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
