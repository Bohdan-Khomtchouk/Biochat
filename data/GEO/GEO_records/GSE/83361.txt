TITLE
The coi1-2 mutant has a differential transcriptional program in response to Al stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To investigate how JA regulates Al-induced inhibition of root growth, a transcriptional analysis through RNAseq was performed by comparing the coi1-2 mutant and WT plants in the presence or absence of Al. In the absence of Al, 149 and 147 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, at least 2-fold in the roots of the coi1-2 mutant and WT plants. In the presence of Al, 1747 and 5838 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in the roots of WT plants, while 1449 and 3773 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively in the coi1-2 mutant. While the comparison of the Al-exposed coi1-2 mutant and WT plants reveals that totally 1187 genes were up-regulated and only 197 genes were down-regulated at least 2-fold.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from control (non-treated roots) and Al-exposed roots. Six day old plants were treated with and without Al treatment for 24 h, then total RNA was isolated using the RNeasyÂ® Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN), and then Illumina sequencing was performed.
