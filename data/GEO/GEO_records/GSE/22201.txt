TITLE
Absolute expression level of Saccharomyces mikatae genes

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces mikatae

SUMMARY
Total RNA versus genomic DNA hybridization on custom arrays designed for all Saccharomyces mikatae genes

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected in mid-log phase from Saccharomyces mikatae cells grown in rich medium (abbreviated CM, in house recipe).   RNA was then converted to cDNA, Cy3-labeled and hybridized competitively against Cy5 labeled genomic DNA from Saccharomyces mikatae.
