TITLE
Mitochondrial DNA mutations induce supression of nuclear encoded mitochondrial Genes in skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify and analyze mtDNA mutation-responsive genes, a comparison of gastrocnemius muscle tissues from WT (control) and D257A mice was conducted. We examined changes in gene expression in the muscle associated with mtDNA mutations.

DESIGN
1) Types of experiments: a) Effect of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations b) Effect of aging c) WT (13 month-old Polg+/+ mice) vs. D257A (13 month-old PolgD257A/D257A) mice 2) Experimental factors: a) Type of gene: PolgD257A/D257A b) Time (age) 3) Number of hybridizations in the study: ~10 4) A common reference RNA was not used. 5) Quality control measures were not used. No replicates were done. Dye swap was not used.
