TITLE
An expression atlas of rice mRNAs and small RNAs

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Identification of all expressed transcripts in a sequenced complex genome is technically challenging, but essential for systems biology and genome analysis.  We used the transcriptional profiling technology called ‘massively parallel signature sequencing’ (MPSS) to develop a comprehensive expression atlas of rice (Oryza sativa cv Nipponbare). A total of 46,971,553 mRNA transcripts from 22 libraries, and 2,953,855 small RNAs from three libraries were sequenced. The data demonstrated widespread transcription throughout the genome, including expression for up to 25,500 annotated genes and antisense expression for nearly 9,000 annotated genes. An additional set of ~15,000 mRNA signatures mapped to unannotated genomic regions. The majority of the small RNA data represented lower abundance small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that match repetitive sequences, intergenic regions, and genes. Among these, numerous clusters of highly-regulated small RNAs were readily observed. We developed a genome browser ( ) for public access to the transcriptional profiling data for this important crop plant. Keywords: MPSS, mRNA, small RNA, transcriptome, rice
