TITLE
Comparison between E. coli K-12 BW25113 wt and E. coli K-12 BW25113 yjgK deleted mutant on 8 h biofilm cell development

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The role of six toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems on biofilm development was investigated (MazEF, RelBEF, ChpB, YefM-YoeB, DinJ-YafQ, and TomB-Hha). Although these TA systems were reported previously to not impact bacterial fitness, we found that biofilm formation is decreased by toxins and increased by anti-toxins, in part, through YjgK. Hence, one role of TA systems is to regulate biofilm formation.
