TITLE
Expression data from human unbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC) irradiated with X-ray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the molecular mechanism underlying inflammatory reaction in vascular system post exposure to ionizing radiation, we carried out microarray analysis in HUVEC exposed with X-ray

DESIGN
HUVEC were irradiated with X-ray (2.5 Gy) and then cultured for 6, 12, and 24 hr. Total RNA were extracted from the tissue by QIAGEN Rneasy mini kit.
