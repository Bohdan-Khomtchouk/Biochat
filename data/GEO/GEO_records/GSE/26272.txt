TITLE
Expression data from control and ZNF145-overexpressing human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ZNF145 is shown to be upregulated during three linage differentiation of MSCs especially in chondrogenesis. To understand the molecular basis of ZNF145 underlying MSCs,  targets of ZNF145 in MSCs are determined by microarray We used microarrays to detail the change in gene expression profile upon overexpression of ZNF145 compared with control in undifferentiated MSCs

DESIGN
Control MSCs and ZNF145-overexpressing MSCs are processed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To that end, we overexpressed ZNF145 in two patient-derived human MSCs.
