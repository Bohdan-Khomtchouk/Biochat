TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of 16 DAP seeds of Illinois protein lines.

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Illinois protein lines (IPL) comprise lines known as Illinois high protein (IHP), Illinois low protein (ILP), Illinois reverse-low protein (IRLP) and Illinois reverse-high protein (IRHP) lines. These lines represent over a century old experiment containing lines that represent various levels of nitrogen metabolism potential as a function of their grain protein concentration. Microarray experiment was conducted using 16 DAP seeds from the above mentioned four IPLs. Keywords: Genotype response

DESIGN
Technical replicates, dye swaps, technical replicates of dye swaps, no biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL5439 Maize oligo array version 1.9 array A GPL5440 Maize oligo array version 1.9 array B
