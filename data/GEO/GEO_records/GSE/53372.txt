TITLE
Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing of HEK293 cells (HEK293-HPT-blue) and HEK293 cells stably over-expressing the BAHD1 gene (HEK293-HPT-BAHD1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the genomic occupancy of the BAHD1 protein in HEK293 cells over-expressing the BAHD1 gene (HEK293-HPT-BAHD1)

DESIGN
We used Native ChIP-seq to identify DNA regions bound to BAHD1 (native ChIP involves use of native chromatin before precipitation of immune complexes, without formaldehyde crosslinking of proteins with nucleic acids)

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
