TITLE
Gastric Cancer Gene Expression Profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This series studied the patterns of gene expression among different types of gastric tumors. Gastric tumors and adjacent non-tumor normal tissues were obtained from 50 gastric cancer patients of diverse stages (IA, IB, II, IIIA, IIIB, and IV), tumor types (intestinal, diffuse, or mixed), and degree of tumor differentiation (moderately or poorly differentiated). Keywords: Cancer patient samples
