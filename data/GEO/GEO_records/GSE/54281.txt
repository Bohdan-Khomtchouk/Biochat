TITLE
Gene expression profiles in the bacterial pustule-resistant soybean cultivars

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles in the bacterial pustule-resistant soybean cultivars

DESIGN
To investigate the differential action between resistance and susceptible cultivars, we examined genome wide expression levels at five time points after X. axonopodis pv. Glycines (Xag) inoculation using microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL18194 Agilent-021600 Custom Soybean Microarray (44K)
