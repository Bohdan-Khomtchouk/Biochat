TITLE
Downstream Targets of HOXB4 in the primitive hematopoietic progenitor EML Cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Enforced expression of the homeobox transcription factor HOXB4 has been shown to enhance hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and expansion ex vivo and in vivo.  In order to investigate the largely unknown downstream targets of HOXB4 in hematopoietic progenitor cells, HOXB4 was constitutively overexpressed in the primitive hematopoietic progenitor cell line, EML.  Gene expression differences were compared between KLS (c-Kit+, Lin-, Sca-1+)-EML cells that overexpressed HOXB4 (KLS-EML-HOXB4) to control KLS-EML cells that were transduced with vector alone.  ChIP-chip was used to identify promoter regions bound by HOXB4.

DESIGN
We overexpressed HOXB4 in EML cells.  We isolated 3 separate single cell clones as assessed by Southern Blot Analysis (3 clones for EML-HOXB4 and 3 clones for control EML-GFP cells).   RNA was isolated from the KLS (c-Kit+, Lin-, Sca-1+) fraction of each single cell clone population and processed for hybridization to array chips using established lab protocols.  Chip-Chip analysis of the three HOXB4 overexpressing clones was performed to identify HOXB4 bound promoters.
