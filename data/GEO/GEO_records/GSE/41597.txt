TITLE
Sox2 ablation in the DP alters its gene expression signature

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using Tbx18Cre to target embryonic DP precursors, we ablate Sox2 early and efficiently, resulting in diminished hair shaft outgrowth. Transcriptional profiling of Sox2 null DPs reveals increased Bmp6 and decreased Bmp inhibitor Sostdc1, a direct Sox2 transcriptional target.

DESIGN
FACS sort to isolate Sox2GFP/Integrin-alpha 9 double-positive DP cells from Sox2 HET and cKO P5 skin for transcriptional profiling
