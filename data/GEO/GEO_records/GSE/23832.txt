TITLE
Expression profiles of PBMC from multiple sclerosis patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array was applied to compare the expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) between  healthy controls and  multiple sclerosis patients(MS pt). It suggested that certain genes involved in apoptosis pathway have been changed regulated in PBMC from MS pt.

DESIGN
Applying Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array and the mixed effects model for gene set analysis, we compared gene expression profiles between 8 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 4 healthy controls (HC).
