TITLE
Transcriptoma analysis of B splenocytes of 3'RR-deficient mice and wt mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The IgH 3' regulatory region (3'RR) controls class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation in mice. Similar numbers of B cells are found in spleen of 3'RR-deficient mice and wt mice. We compare their transcriptoma in order to find differences in their maturation status.

DESIGN
B splenocytes from four wt mice and four 3'RR-deficient mice are investigated. Splenic B cells are purified with anti-B220-coupled beads.
