TITLE
Expression data from D.melanogaster guts with a constitutively active Imd in the presence or absence of a microbiome

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Innate immune responses contributed to the containment of intestinal microbes. We used microarrays to examine transcriptional profiles of imflamed guts raised in convential or germ-free conditions. We found that gut inflammation and the gut microbiome regulate the expression of several hundred host genes.

DESIGN
Genotype control flies and flies with a constitutively active Imd were raised on regular food or food supplemented with antibiotics to obtain conventionally reared (CR) or germ-free (GF) flies. Guts were dissected for RNA extraction and RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChipÂ®Drosophila Genome 2.0 arrays to study the effects of gut inflammation in a microbiome dependant or independant manner on the transcriptional profile in host's gut.
