TITLE
Changes in global gene expression of Vibrio parahaemolyticus viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state

ORGANISM
Vibrio parahaemolyticus RIMD 2210633

SUMMARY
The phenomenon of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) referred as a dormant state of non-sporulating bacteria enhancing the survival in adverse environments. To our knowledge, only few studies have been performed on whole genomic expression of V. parahaemolyticus in VBNC state compared with cells in exponential and early stationary phases. Since many VBNC state studies found DNA, RNA and protein degradation, we hypothesise that gene regulation of VBNC cells is highly reduced, down-regulation of gene expression is dominant and only metabolic functions crucial for survival are kept on a sustained basis. In the VBNC state we found 509 significantly induced genes and 309 significantly repressed by more than twofold compared with unstressed phases among 4820 investigated genes (adjusted P-value < 0.05). Furthermore, up-regulation was dominant in most of the non-metabolism functional categories, while five metabolism-related functional categories revealed down-regulation in the VBNC state. To our knowledge, this is the first study of comprehensive transcriptomic analyses of three phases of V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633. Although the mechanism of VBNC state is not yet clear, massive regulation of gene expression occurs in the VBNC state compared with expression in unstressed phases and thus, VBNC cells are active cells.

DESIGN
VBNC state gene expression was detected in total bacterial RNA of V. parahaemolyticus. Three phases (exponential phase, early stationary phase, and VBNC state) were used in 8 biological replicates. Gene expression  in exponential phase and early stationary phase was used for normalization, respectively.
