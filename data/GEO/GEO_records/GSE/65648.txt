TITLE
CodeLink™ Mouse Whole Genome Bioarray data from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of miR-125a (+/+) wild-type mice and miR-125a (+/-) heterozygous mice with myeloproliferative disorder

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miR-125a knockout mice develop myeloproliferave disorder (MPD). To investigate the molecular mechanisms of MPD induced by the loss of miR-125a, gene expression profiling on hematopoietic stem cells of miR-125a (+/+) and (+/-) MPD mice was performed using CodeLink Whole Genome DNA array analysis.

DESIGN
Codelink Mouse Whole Genome Bioarrays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction on total RNA extracted from hematopoietic stem cells of miR-125a (+/+) wild-type mice and miR-125a (+/-) heterozygous mice with MPD. One replicate per array.
