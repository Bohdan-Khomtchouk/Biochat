SUMMARY
To compare and contrast genetic signatures from livers of young and aged Snell dwarf mice with their wild type controls. Keywords: Aging

DESIGN
25 micrograms of liver RNA was isolated from each of 6 aged (3 dwarf, 3 wild type) and 8 young (4 dwarf, 4 wild type) mice for use in hybridization of Affymetrix gene chips according to Affymetrix protocols.
