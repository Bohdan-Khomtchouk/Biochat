TITLE
Expression data from healthy murine bronchial epithelial cells and syngeneic murine lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) from DBA2 mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The process of lung squamous carcinoma tumorigenesis and metastasis is poorly characterized. Additionally, few models of this process exist in an immune-competent context. In order to address this problem, we utilized the KLN-205 lung squamous carcinoma cell lines that is derived from carcinogen exposure in DBA2 mice. We used healthy bronchial epithelial cells from adult DBA2 mice as a healthy control. Following an in vivo selection strategy to enrich for metastatic subclones (LN2-2, LN4-2, LN4K1), we used Affymetrix murine microarrays to study differentially expressed genes as the cells go from heathy, to tumorigenic but poorly metastatic to tumorigenic and highly metastatic (LN4K1).

DESIGN
Murine bronchial epithelial cells, KLN-205 and its metastatic subclones were grown to 60-80% confluence for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Then, differentially expressed genes were assessed as cells progressed from healthy, to tumorigenic to both tumorigenic and strongly metastatic (LN4K1).
