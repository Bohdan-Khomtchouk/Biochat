TITLE
Expression data from CSC and Non-CSC of three HCC cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the major subtype of liver cancer, characterized with a high rate of recurrence and heterogeneity. Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) may account for a hierarchical organization of heterogeneous cancer cells. However, how liver CSCs sustain their self-renewal remains largely unknown. We used microarrays to discover the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression underlying cell stem cell (CSC) and non cell stem cell (non-CSC) and identified distinct lncRNAs during this process.

DESIGN
We sorted CD13+CD133+ and CD13-CD133- cells from Hep3B, Huh7, and PLC/PRF/5 HCC cell lines as liver CSCs and non-CSCs, then hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to identify distinct lncRNAs in liver CSCs.
