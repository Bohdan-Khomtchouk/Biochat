TITLE
The Vasa homolog RDE-12 engages target mRNA and a secondary-Argonaute WAGO-1 to promote RNAi in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Argonaute proteins (AGOs) are key nuclease effectors of RNA interference (RNAi) [1]. Although purified AGOs can mediate a single round of target-RNA cleavage in vitro, accessory factors are required for siRNA loading and to achieve multiple-target turnover [2, 3]. To identify AGO co-factors we immunoprecipitated the C. elegans AGO WAGO-1, which engages amplified small RNAs during RNAi [4]. These studies identified a robust association between WAGO-1 and a conserved Vasa ATPase-related protein RDE-12. rde-12 mutants are deficient in RNAi including viral suppression, and fail to produce amplified secondary siRNAs and certain endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs). RDE-12 co-localizes with WAGO-1 in germline P-granules and to peri-nuclear cytoplasmic foci in somatic cells. These findings and our genetic studies suggest that (i) RDE-12 is first recruited to target mRNAs by upstream AGOs (RDE-1 and ERGO-1) where it promotes small-RNA amplification and/or WAGO-1 loading, and that (ii) downstream of these events, RDE-12 forms an RNase-resistant (target mRNA-independent) complex with WAGO-1 that may scan for additional target mRNAs.
