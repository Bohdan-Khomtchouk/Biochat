TITLE
Gene expression analysis of TRIM5 KD in the THP1 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We had evidence that TRIM5 regulates signal transduction, specifically NFkB and MAPK pathways. To test the role of endogenous TRIM5 we used the myelomonocytic leukemia cell line THP1. These cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector that delivers a miRNA engineered to knockdown TRIM5. The vector also encoded a puromycin-resistance cassette and transduced cells were selected in poold with puromycin. As a control, cells were transduced with a vector targeting luciferase instead of TRIM5.

DESIGN
After selection in puromycin, the TRIM5 KD and Luciferase KD cells were differentiated into macrophages by treatment with PMA. 3 days later, RNA was harvested for analysis.
