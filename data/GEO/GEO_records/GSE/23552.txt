TITLE
Exon Array Analysis of Asthmatic Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Asthmatic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (aCRSwNP) is a common disruptive eosinophilic disease.  Therefore, we sought to identify gene expression changes in nasosinus inflamed mucosa and adjacent polyp tissue from subjects with aCRSwNP.
