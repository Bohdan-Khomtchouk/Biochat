TITLE
Gene expression from ErbB2KI tumors with a heterozygous or a homoszygous loss of beta-catenin (ctnnb1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Beta-catenin controls both cell adhesion and transcription to facilitate ErbB2-driven mammary tumorigenesis In this study, we used conditional knockout and gene expression approaches to understand global molecular and transciptional changes due to ablation of both functions of beta-catenin.

DESIGN
Beta-catenin (ctnnb1) was specifically deleted in the mammary epithelium of ErbB2KI mice. Total RNA was collected from end-burden tumors (flash frozen) and subjected to microarray gene expression.
