TITLE
Genetic deletion or pharmacologic blockade of the amino acid transporter Slc6a14 in mice suppresses breast cancer induced by Polyoma middle T oncogene

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumor cells have an increased need for amino acids. Mammalian cells cannot synthesize essential amino acids; they must obtain these amino acids via specific transporters. Glutamine, though a non-essential amino acid, is critical for tumor cells (glutamine addiction). Entry of amino acids into tumor cells is enhanced by upregulation of specific transporters. If the transporters that are specifically induced in tumor cells are identified, blockade of the induced transporters would constitute a logical strategy for cancer treatment. The transporter SLC6A14 is unique and transports all essential amino acids as well as glutamine and is expressed only at low levels in normal tissues, but induced in colon cancer and in ER+ breast cancer. We have now established the potential of this transporter as a drug target for breast cancer treatment using genetic and pharmacologic approaches. We then examined the progression of breast cancer in Polyoma middle T antigen (Py-MT) Tg mouse on Slc6a14+/+ and Slc6a14-/- background using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
We have used three Affy-chips for each tumor sample (Group 1: WT/PyMT; Group 2: Slc6a14-KO/PyMT). Three biological replicates were used for each group.
