TITLE
Expression data from mouse peritoneal macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Biologic functions involved in innate immune response of macrophages rely on the precise regulation of kinds of immune molecular. In the virus infection procession, the macrophages are activated following a tightly controlled genetic programme where specific sets of genes are up-regulated or down-regulated. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying VSV infection and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Mouse peritoneal macrophages were selected with/without  VSV infection for 8 hours for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain expression profiles. We selected macrophages according to VSV infection at two time-points: uninfected macrophage(control) and VSV infected for 8 hour macrophages(VSV).
