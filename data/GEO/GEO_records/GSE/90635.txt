SUMMARY
T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling by MHC class-I and -II induces thymocytes to acquire cytotoxic and helper fates via induction of Runx3 or and ThPOK transcription factors, respectively. The mechanisms by The mechanisms by which TCR signaling is translated into transcriptional programs for each cell fate remain elusive. It remains elusivewhich how TCR signaling is translated into transcriptional programs for each cell fate remain elusive. We show that a genome organizer, SATB1, activates genes for lineage-specifying factors, including ThPOK, Runx3, CD4, CD8 and Treg factor Foxp3, and Treg factor Foxp3, and CD4, and /CD8, in post-selection thymocytes. Indeed, SATBatb1-deficient thymocytes are partially redirected into inappropriate T lineages after both MHC class-I and -II mediated selection, and fail to generate Treg subset. Despite its essential role in initiating regulatory regions activity in TCR signaled thymocytes. SATBatb1 is becomes dispensable for maintaining ThPOK in CD4+ T cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that SATBatb1 shapes the primary T-cell pool by initially directing lineage-specific transcriptional programs in the thymus.
