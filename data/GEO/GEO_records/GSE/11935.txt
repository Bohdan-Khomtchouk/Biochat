TITLE
Leukemia inhibitory factor regulates timing of oligodendrocyte development and myelination in postnatal optic nerve

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oligodendrocyte precursor cells from postnatal day 10 optic nerve remained in a developmentally immature state in LIF-/- mice.  Partial recovery of myelin genes is seen in LIF-/- mice by postnatal day 14 in the optic nerve.  Very little difference in myelin genes in the optic nerve is seen by postnatal day 35 (adult).

DESIGN
Optic nerves from male mice postnatal day 10, day 14 and day 35 (adult)
