SUMMARY
Fumarate hydratase (FH) is the enzyme in the Krebs cycle, which transforms fumarate to malate. Loss of fumarate hyrdragase leads to hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC). The biallelic inactivation has been highly accumulated in FH-deficient cells and is considered a major pro-oncogenic factor for HLRCC tumorigenesis. We used microarrays to understand the global readaptation of cell metabolism of gene expression underlying the truncated Krebs cycle by loss of function of fumarate hydratase.

DESIGN
The fumarate hydratase wild type and knock out cells were generated for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
