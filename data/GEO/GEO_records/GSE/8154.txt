TITLE
Gene analysis of the developing brain of embryos from STZ induced diabetic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Maternal diabetes causes congenital malformations in various organs in fetuses. This study was aimed to investigate the differential gene expression profiling in developing brains of embryos from diabetic mice. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Totally six samples were used. Three brains of the embryos from control normal mice was hybridized on three chips separately. And three malformed brains of the embryos from experimental diabetic mice was hybridized on three chips separately.
