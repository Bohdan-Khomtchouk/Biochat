TITLE
Down-regulation of a gene encoding CCR affects... cell wall function in embryogenic cultures of Norway spruce

ORGANISM
Picea abies

SUMMARY
An attractive objective in the breeding of forest trees is to reduce the content of lignin or alter the lignin composition. However, for long-lived forest trees, such as conifers, it is time consuming and expensive to wait until mature wood is formed for estimating how different ligninfication genes affect cell wall differentiation. The aim of this work was to examine the possibility of detecting changes in global gene expression and of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis already in embryogenic cultures carrying the native Norway spruce cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR) gene in antisense orientation. Several genes, including genes regulating phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and peroxidase, regulating different pathways associated with lignin biosynthesis were affected but the transcript abundances of genes regulating lignin biosynthesis were not affected. Functional assignment defined by Gene Ontology terms, which provide functional classification for genes and gene products representing their corresponding biological process, cellular component and molecular function showed that transformation with asCCR affects a broad spectrum of functional categories, especially processes taking place in the cell wall. Furthermore, many changes in genes related to chromatin, DNA and chromosome take place. Keywords: transgenic Norway spruce, embryogenic culture

DESIGN
Comparing three asCCR lines, A78:3, A78:4, A78:5; twotransformed control lines, G88:5, G88:9; and the untransformed line 95:11:22. The embryogenic lines were compared in a fully balanced loop design for each biological replicate encompassing in total 24 microarray slides.
