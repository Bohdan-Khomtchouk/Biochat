TITLE
Promoter methylation data: OHT/ICI-sensitive vs. -resistant cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF7 breast cancer cell lines: drug-resistant (OHT and ICI) cell lines vs. drug-sensitive (wild type) cell lines. Assessment of association between gene expression and methylation.

DESIGN
Two comparisons: OHT-resistant vs. wild type, and ICI-resistant vs. wild type. OHT: 4-hydroxytamoxifen ICI: fulvestrant ((ICI 182780) This submission represents the methylation component of the study.
