TITLE
Motility and stem cell properties induced by the epithelial-mesenchymal transition require destabilization of lipid rafts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition provides cells with the characteristics needed to metastasize.  We hypothesized that it does so through changes in the organization of the plasma membrane. We found that the EMT leads to destabilization of the membrane concomitant with transcriptional reprogramming.  However, treatment with DHA stabilizes the membrane and reverts the transcriptional program toward an epithelial state.

DESIGN
HMLE cells are treated with a combinations of Snail expression, TGF-b ligand, or DHA.
