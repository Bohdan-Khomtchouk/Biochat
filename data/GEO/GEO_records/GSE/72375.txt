TITLE
Response of fresh or frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 1 healthy donor to influenza virus derived peptide stimulation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD4 T cell responses are characterized based on a limited number of molecular markers selected from exisiting knowledge. The goal of the experiment was to assess antigenic-peptide specific T-cell responses in vitro without bias using microarrays.

DESIGN
PBMCs were isolated from 1 healthy donor. The fresh cells or cells thawed from cryopresevation (frozen) were stimulated with peptides derived from influenza virus for 24 hours. Unstimulated cells were cultured without the peptides for 24 hours. Experiments were done in triplicate.
