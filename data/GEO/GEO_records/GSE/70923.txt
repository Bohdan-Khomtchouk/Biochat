Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data from xenograft in BALB/c 6-wk-old nude mice with PC3 prostate cancer cells stably expressing PML or a vector control after treatment of the mice with palbociclib (100mg/kg/day diluted in sodium lactate 50mM pH4 given by gavage) during 5 consecutive days PML plays a role in the senescence tumor suppressor response of normal cells to oncogenic stress. PML also mediates therapy-induced senescence in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells after treatment with retinoic acid. However, many tumor cell lines fail to engage a complete senescence response to PML activation. Interestingly, in vivo and in vitro combination of PML overexpression with CDK inhibition induce senescence in PC3 prostate cancer cells. We used microarray to characterize the gene expression profile of PC3 stably expressing PML or a control vector after subcutaneous injection in BALB/c 6-wk-old nude mice and treatment of the mice with palbociclib (100mg/kg/day) during 5 consecutive days..

DESIGN
PC3 cells were infected with a retroviral vector that express PML or an empty vector before subcutaneous injection of 10^6 cells in both flanks of BALB/c 6-wk-old nude mice. Then, mice were treated for 5 consecutive days with  palbociclib (100mg/kg/day diluted in sodium lactate 50mM pH4 given by gavage)
