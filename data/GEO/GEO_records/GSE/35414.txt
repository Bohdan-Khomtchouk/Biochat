ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Evaluation of specific coordinated pattern of transcriptional events consistent with anti-myeloma activity of FK866 (chemical Nampt inhibitor)

DESIGN
3 samples were analyzed using as control the untreated cells. Treated cells were cultured in presence of FK866 at concentration of 10nM for 6 and 24 hours.
