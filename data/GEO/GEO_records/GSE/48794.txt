TITLE
Identification of factors associated with high fat diet induced insulin resistance

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Whole genome expression profilling were undertaken in high fat diet (HFD)-fed obese rats to identify the genetic factors associated with metabolic dysfunction, insulin resistance and obesity.

DESIGN
Sprague dawley male rats were maintained on HFD for 12 weeks ad libitum regimen. Liver being  the principal organ for glucose homeostasis is targeted for microarray profilling. We could identify genes/factors associated with obesity induced metabolic dysfunction. Custom Rat Whole Genome 8x60k Gene Expression Microarray (AMADID:030192 ) designed  by Genotypic Technology Private Limited.
