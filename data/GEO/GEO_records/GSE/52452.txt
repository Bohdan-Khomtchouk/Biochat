TITLE
Gene expression data from MGHU3 bladder cancer cells (FGFR3-Y375C) treated with TAK1 siRNA and/or PD173074

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The NFκB transcription factor is constitutively active in a number of hematologic and solid tumors, and many signaling pathways implicated in cancer are likely connected to NFκB activation.  A critical mediator of NFκB activity is TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1).  Here, we identify TAK1 as a novel interacting protein and direct target of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) tyrosine kinase activity. We further demonstrate that activating mutations in FGFR3 associated with both multiple myeloma and bladder cancer can modulate expression of genes which regulate NFκB signaling, and promote both NFκB transcriptional activity and cell adhesion in a manner dependent on TAK1 expression in both cancer cell types.  Our findings suggest TAK1 as a potential therapeutic target for FGFR3-associated cancers, and other malignancies in which TAK1 contributes to constitutive NFκB activation.

DESIGN
A total of 12 samples of MGHU3 (Y375C) mutant FGFR3 bladder cancer cells (a kind gift from Dr. Margaret Knowles (University of Leeds, Leeds, UK)) were used for array-based gene expression analysis.  3 replicates of each condition: Control siRNA, Control siRNA + PD173074, TAK1 siRNA, and TAK1 siRNA + PD173074.
