TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of engineered and improved Saccharomyces cerevisiae for xylose utilization

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The aim of present study is to understand the impact of xylose utilization on the  Saccharomyces cerevisiae physiology after initial genetic engineering and in a strain with an improved xylose utilization phenotype.

DESIGN
A twenty four array study using total RNA recovered from xylose-utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains M6880 and M7237 grown in chemostat culture.
