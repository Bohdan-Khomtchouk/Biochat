SUMMARY
The manuscript by D. Licastro and colleagues “Promiscuity of enhancer, coding and non-coding transcription functions in ultraconserved sequence elements” presents an overview of experimental and computational approaches employed by the authors to perform a multi-facet characterization of ultraconserved elements (UCEs). The authors present an interesting analysis where they investigate the transcription of UCEs in mouse development at different stages by conductin an microarray experiment. Some of these results are further verified by RT-PCR.
