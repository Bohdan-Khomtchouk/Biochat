TITLE
Testis expression in Mus musculus domesticus x Mus musculus musculus hybrid zone mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus musculus x M. m. domesticus

SUMMARY
We collected whole genome testis expression data from hybrid zone mice. We integrated GWAS mapping of testis expression traits and low testis weight to gain insight into the genetic basis of hybrid male sterility.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in whole testis from males aged 62-86 days. Samples include 190 first generation lab-bred male offspring of wild-caught mice from the Mus musculus musculus - M. m. domesticus hybrid zone.
