TITLE
Analyses of blue light (BL) and CRY-regualted genes and genes dependent on auxin receptors by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Total RNA was extracted from samples including dark-grown WT and tir1 afb123, blue light-grown WT and cry1 cry2 seedlings in continuous conditions for 4.5 days and subjected to high throughput sequencing. Light and auxin co-regulate a variety of developmental processes. This study reveals the molecular basis for light and auxin crosstalk by analyzing gene expression profile under control of both signals.

DESIGN
mRNA from dark-grown WT, BL-grown WT, BL-grown BL photoreceptors, and dark-grown auxin receptors was sequenced to analyze the genes regulated by CRY-mediated BL signaling and TIR1/AFBs-mediated auxin signaling.

PLATFORM
GPL17639 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
