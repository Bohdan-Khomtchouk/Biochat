TITLE
Expression data from  E2f7/E2f8/E2f3a null placentas and embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the underlying cause and mechanisms of embryonic lethality observed in combined loss of E2f7 and E2f8, we compared global gene expression profiles of wild type, germline deleted and sox2-Cre/Cyp19-Cre deleted embryos and placentas.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from E10.5 embryos and placentas. Gene deletion in samples confirmed by PCR genotyping of DNA isolated from each sample.
