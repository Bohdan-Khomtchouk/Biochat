TITLE
Gene expression of mouse embryonic gonad [Nanos3]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify germ cell- and somatic cell-specific gene expression profiles, we performed expression microarray analysis of the mouse gonads of the Nanos3+/-, Nanos3-/- female and male embryos from E12.5 to E15.5.

DESIGN
Biological duplicates were examined at each stage, genotype, and sex for each experiment.
