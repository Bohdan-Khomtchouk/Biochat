Prediction of isolated central nervous system relapses in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia

SUMMARY
Background   In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), central nervous system (CNS) involvement is rare at diagnosis (1-4%), but more frequent at relapse (~30%). Minimal residual disease diagnostics predict  most bone marrow (BM) relapses, but likely cannot predict isolated CNS relapses. Consequently, CNS relapses may become relatively more important. Because of the significant late sequelae of CNS treatment, early identification of patients at risk of CNS relapse is crucial.     Methods  Gene expression profiles of ALL cells from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and ALL cells from BM were compared and differences were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR. For a selected set of overexpressed genes, protein expression levels of ALL cells in CSF at relapse and of ALL cells in diagnostic BM samples were evaluated by 8-color flow cytometry.     Results  CSF-derived ALL cells showed a clearly different gene expression profile than BM-derived ALL cells, with differentially-expressed genes (including SCD and OPN) involved in survival and apoptosis pathways and linked to the JAK-STAT pathway. Flowcytometric analysis showed that a subpopulation of ALL cells ( > 1%) with a “CNS signature” (SCD positivity and increased OPN expression) was already present in BM at diagnosis in ALL patients who later developed a CNS relapse, but was < 1% or absent in virtually all other patients.     Conclusions  The presence of a subpopulation of ALL cells with a “CNS signature” at diagnosis may predict isolated CNS relapse. Such information can be used to design new diagnostic and treatment strategies that aim at prevention of CNS relapse with reduced toxicity.

DESIGN
We compared gene expression profiles of ALL cells obtained from cerebrospinal fluid (n=8) with profiles of ALL cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis (n=22) or at relapse (n=20)
