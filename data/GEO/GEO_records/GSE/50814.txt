TITLE
Human exosomal placenta-specific miRNAs modulate expression of target genes in maternal immune cells during pregnancy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated placenta-specific miRNA miR-517a (miR-517a-3p) functions in Jurkat cells. For this purpose, we identified candidate target mRNAs of the placenta-specific miRNAs using DNA microarray analysis. Transfection of Jurkat cells with miR-517a significantly downregulated 123 genes. Among the 123 genes identified, we searched for potential direct targets of miR-517a using the online software MicroCosm Targets. Seven genes, ALDH1B1, ANP32E, DHFR, FAT2, IGSF5, PRKG1, and RSPO3, had at least one potential miR-517a binding site in their 3’-UTRs. Furthermore, we revealed that PRKG1, one of the seven genes, was a miR-517a target using an in vitro experimental validation system.

DESIGN
We compared gene expression pattern of miR-517a–overexpressing Jurkat cells with that of negative control.
