TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles of FCRL5+/CD21-/lo/CD27- and FCRL5-/CD21-/lo/CD27- peripheral B cells from healthy donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare gene expression profile of FCRL5+ and FCRL5- tissue-like memory B cells (CD21-/lo/CD27-/CD19+), we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify differentially regulated genes in these two B cell subgroups. B cells freshly isolated from leukapheresis of healthy donors were used in the experiment.

DESIGN
PBMC from leukapheresis of healthy donors were obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation, and B cells were then isolated from PBMC by negative magnetic bead-based selection. Cells were then stained, and sorted by flow cytometry to get the FCRL5- and FCRL5+ tissue-like memory B cells. RNA purified from these two groups of cells from three healthy donors was used in microarray analysis.
