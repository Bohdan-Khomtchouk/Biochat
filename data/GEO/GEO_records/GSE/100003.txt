TITLE
Integrating Extracellular Flux Measurements and Genome-Scale Modeling Reveals Novel Differences between Brown and White Adipocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study predicted flux differences between brown and white adipocytes by integrating the results of extracellular flux analyzers, such as the Seahorse Analyzer, with metabolic modeling. The microarrays of the individuals' preadipocytes were used to support the predictions. These are the same individuals who were assayed by microarray in GSE68544.

DESIGN
Paired microarrays of preadipocytes from white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) from three individuals.
