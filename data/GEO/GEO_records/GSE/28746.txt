TITLE
Epigenome analysis of male identical twin pairs discordant for sexual orientation, age 21 to 55.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of saliva samples from male identical twins discordant for sexual orientation, age 21 to 55. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in bisulfite converted DNA. Samples included 34 pairs of identical twins and one set of identical triplets, and 13 hybridisations were technical replicates of a selection of those samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA isolated from saliva of identical twin pairs were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
