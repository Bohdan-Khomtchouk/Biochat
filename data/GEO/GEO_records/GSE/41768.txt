TITLE
PTP1B deficiency effect on mammary gland development and differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) deficient mammary glands from nulliparous mice at estrous and pregnancy day 3, 7, 10 and 15. We used a genetically ablated PTP1B mouse model to gain a deeper knowledge of the role PTP1B plays in mammary gland development and to define the mechanism regulated by this phosphatase. Results provide insight into the role of PTP1B in mammary gland development and differentiation.

DESIGN
Mouse mammary glands were isolated from PTP1B -/- and PTP1B +/+ nulliparous mice at estrous and pregnancy day 3, 7, 10 and 15 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
