TITLE
Dynamic changes in chromatin states during specification and differentiation of adult intestinal stem cells [mbd]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We assessed whether changes in DNA methylation were associated with the regulation of ISC signature genes. Methylated regions of DNA from whole genome were isolated using Methyl Binding Domain pull-down followed by sequencing (MBD-seq). The size of DNA fragments was between 120 to 170 bp, which provides a resolution at nucleosome level.

DESIGN
Intestinal epithelial cells from two embryonic stages (E12.5 and E14.5), adult Lgr5+ ISCs and enterocytes were used. For each stage biological duplicates were analyzed.
