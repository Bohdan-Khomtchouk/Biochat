TITLE
Gene expression profiling of RPMI-grown and macrophage-internalized Candida glabrata wild-type, Cgrsc3-a∆ and Cgrtt109∆ cells.

ORGANISM
[Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
To delineate the interaction of Candida glabrata with host immune cells, we performed genome-wide transcriptional  profiling analysis on  THP-1 macrophage-internalized  wild-type and chromatin remodeling defective mutant (Cgrsc3-a∆ and Cgrtt109∆) yeasts. Genes implicated in ergosterol biosynthesis, and high-affinity iron uptake and homeostasis were found to be down-regulated in C. glabrata wild-type and mutant cells upon macrophage internalization. Additionally, global gene expression profiles of RPMI-grown and macrophage-ingested Cgrsc3-a∆ and Cgrtt109∆ cells revealed down-regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration under normal growth conditions and induction of genes required for generation of precursors of metabolites and energy upon macrophage internalization. To examine the behavior of Candida glabrata wild-type and chromatin remodeling defective mutants upon internalization by differentiated human monocytic THP-1 cells, we compared the transcript profiles of 10 hour RPMI-grown with those of 10 hour THP-1 macrophage internalized C. glabrata cells. Additionally, early transcriptional response of C. glabrata wild-type cells to macrophage internal milieu was examined post 2 hour THP-1 macrophage infection.
