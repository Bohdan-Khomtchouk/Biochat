TITLE
Human liver Huh cell transcriptome (miRNA) response to a Wild-type ΔVP30 Ebola virus, Δmucin, and ssGP mutants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for microRNA analysis in human liver Huh cells using the following viruses obtained by reverse genetics: Zaire Ebola virus wild-type (WT) in the ΔVP30 background (wild), ΔsGP virus (eliminates expression of soluble glycoprotein [GP]) (ssGP), and Δmucin virus (encodes a GP lacking the mucin domain) (mucin).

DESIGN
Human liver Huh cells were infected with a Wild-type ΔVP30 Ebola virus, Δmucin, and ssGP mutants. The Huh7.0 VP30 cells were on split 5 for this experiment. Infected samples were collected in quintuplet; time-matched mocks were collected in quintuplet in parallel with infected samples. Two time courses were performed to generate samples for this experiment (the second set was started within 24 h of the first set). The time courses were 8 and 18 hours, and 24 and 48 hours.
