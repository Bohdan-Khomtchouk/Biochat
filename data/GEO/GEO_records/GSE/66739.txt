SUMMARY
Currently there is growing concern with respect to scenarios where people are likely to be presented with radiation exposure along with many kinds of other injuries such as trauma and infection. The potential for such scenarios was brought to reality with the events and aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. As such medical complications arising from such exposures would be poorly dealt with as no evidence-based guidelines exist for their rehabilitation or recovery. Our research intends to differentially characterize combined radiation and burn injuries and identify novel pathways and biomarkers. Such findings will lead to better medical practices in the diagnosis, care and rehabilitation of affected individuals. The study includes four groups of mice: 1) Control sham mice group (n=4), 2) Skin burn injury mice group (n=6), 3) Radiation injury mice group (n=6), 4) Combined radiation and burn injury mice group (n=6).
