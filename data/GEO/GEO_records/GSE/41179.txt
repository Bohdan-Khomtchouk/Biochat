TITLE
Expression data from the neural crest cells isolated from mouse cardiac outflow tract at E10.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neural crest defects lead to congenital heart disease involving outflow tract (OFT) malformation. Integrin-linked-Kinase (ILK) plays important roles in multiple cellular processes and embryogenesis. ILK is expressed in neural crest cells (NCC), but its role in NCC and OFT morphogenesis remains unknown. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the morphogenesis of the cardiac neural crest and outflow tract.

DESIGN
The outflow tract of control and ILK mutant mouse embryos at E10.5 were dissected and dissociated. Neural crest cells were FACS sorted and used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
