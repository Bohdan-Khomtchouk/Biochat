TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana six days after infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study focuses on responses of the host plant to infection and transformation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Genome wide changes in gene expression were integrated with the alterations in metabolite levels six days after inoculation of agrobacteria. Plants were infected with the virulent strain C58, harboring a T-DNA, or with strain GV3101, containing a disarmed Ti-plasmid. This allows discrimination between signals which derive from the bacterial pathogen and the T-DNA encoded genes.

DESIGN
The bases of Arabidopsis thaliana (WS-2) inflorescence stalks were wounded and immediately infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens or mock-infected for six days. Stalks of intact plants were inoculated with the oncogenic strain C58 (C58 6dpi 1 to 3) or the non-virulent strain GV3101 (GV3101 6dpi 1 to 3) to provide conditions close to nature. The gene expression data of three independent experiments of infected material were compared with three non-infected samples (reference 6dpi 1 to 3). Differential gene expression was determined by applying the LIMMA package (Linear Models for Microarray Data; Smyth, G.K. (2004) Applic. Genet. Mol. Biol. 3, Article 3; http://www.bepress.com/sagmb/vol3/iss1/art3/ ).
