SUMMARY
affy_genomic_poplar - affy_genomic_poplar - The project aims to identify genes of interest for water deficit acclimation in poplar. We look for genes and gene expression networks related to drought stress in two hybrid cultivars, differing in their drought tolerance in field. Affymetrix poplar genome array was designed on several Populus species. In order to deal with comparative approaches, we checked the convenience of the array by hybridizing genomic DNA of the two hybrid cultivars (Populus deltoides × Populus nigra, namely ‘cv Carpaccio’ and ‘cv Soligo’). This point is important as transcript sequence might have diverged in the two genomes (Fossati et al, 2005), which could lead to absence of hybridization without physiological meaning. -Two poplar cultivars, Soligo (S) and Carpacio (C) were grown in controlled conditions. Mature leaves were collected and genomic DNA was extracted from leaves in CTAB buffer. gDNA was fragmented with DNAse1. DNA fragments were labelled with Biotin N6-ddATP and hybridized on Affymetrix poplar genome array. Two technical replicates per genotype were performed.
