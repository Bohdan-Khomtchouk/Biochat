TITLE
Li-treatment-induced NDI (Li-NDI) in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
5 rats were offered food containing 40mM Li/Kg dry weight for 4 weeks, and 5 control rats obtained standard food. The RNA from the inner medulla of the Li-treated rats was labeled red (channel 1), and from the control rats labeled green (channel 2). The samples from  Li-treated rats 1+2 and control rats 1+2 were hybridized to array Li-NDI 1. The samples from  Li-treated rats 3+4 and control rats 3+4 were hybridized to array Li-NDI 2. The samples from  Li-treated rat 5 and control rat 5 were hybridized to array Li-NDI 3. Keywords: parallel sample
