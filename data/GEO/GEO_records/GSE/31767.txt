TITLE
FOXM1 Orchestrates a Global Methylation Signature that Mimics the Cancer Epigenome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant upregulation of a single oncogene FOXM1 in primary normal human oral epithelial cells orchestrated a cancer-like methylome landscape This study have identified a unique FOXM1-induced epigenetic signature which may have potentials as biomarkers for early oral cancer screening, diagnostic and/or therapeutic interventions

DESIGN
Comparisons of primary human normal oral keratinocytes transduced with either EGFP (control) or FOXM1B and a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line SCC15
