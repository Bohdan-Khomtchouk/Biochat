TITLE
Gene Array Analysis of Methylthioadenosine Supplementation in Dextran Sulfate Sodium Induced Colitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Study hypothesized that oral supplementation of methylthioadenosine (MTA) would reduce the inflammatory response in mice exposed to an agent that induces colitis (DSS) and that this reduction in inflammatory response would lead to reduced clinical disease burden.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from isolated colons of mice in the following treatment groups: untreated controls, DSS only, DSS+MTA
