TITLE
Expression data from intestinal-type and diffuse-type gastric cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the specific genes for intestinal-type and diffuse-type gastric cancers.

DESIGN
We selected 18 intestinal-type gastric cancers and 12 diffuse-type gastric cancers showing typical characteristics on the form of cell growth (clustered or scattered) and the degree of differentiation (well/moderate or poor), and performed microarray analysis for obtaining genome-wide mRNA expression profiles.
