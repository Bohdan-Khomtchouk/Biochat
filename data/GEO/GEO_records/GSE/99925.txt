TITLE
Comparing gene expression profiles of HCmel3 mouse melanomas treated (early-during-treatment, EDT d12-d20 after ACT onset) with gp100-specific adoptive pmel-1 T cell transfer (ACT) versus non-treated control HCmel3 melanomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This data was also integrated with gene expression profiles from late relapse tumors (GSE40213) to compare changes from early-during-treatment to late relapse versus non-treated. These re-analyzed samples are available in this series. In EDT samples we observed typical changes consistent with an effective anti-tumor T cell response including CD8 T cell infiltration, interferon pathway activation and downregulation of proliferation associated gene sets.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from excised and liquid nitrogen frozen tumors and global gene expression was performed using the Illumina Mouse WG6 v2.0 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
