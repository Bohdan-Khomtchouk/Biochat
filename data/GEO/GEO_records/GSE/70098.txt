TITLE
The histone H3 lysine 4 presenter WDR5 induces N-Myc target gene transcription and promotes neuroblastoma [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
WDR5 is an important co-factor for N-Myc-regulated transcriptional activation and tumorigenesis Using ChIP-Seq, We profiled key epigenetic marks H3K4 trimethylation in BE(2)-C neuroblastoma cells transfected with control siRNA or WDR5 siRNA-1 at N-Myc target gene promoters The results showed knockdown WDR5 significantly reduced H3K4me3 at 93.2% of N-Myc binding promoters, but only at 53.5% of N-Myc non-binding promoters.

DESIGN
Identification of Histone H3K4 trimethylation and N-Myc binding sites in BE(2)-C cells transfected with control siRNA or WDR5 siRNA-1.
