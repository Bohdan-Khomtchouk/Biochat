TITLE
Gene expression data from Peyer's patch mononuclear phagocyte system

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Peyer’s patches (PP) are primary inductive sites of mucosal immunity. Defining PP mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) is thus crucial to understand the initiation of mucosal immune response. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the phenotype, distribution, ontogeny, lifespan, function and transcriptional profile of PP MPS. We show that monocytes give rise to macrophages and to lysozyme-expressing DC (LysoDC) which are both involved in particulate antigen uptake, display strong innate antiviral and antibacterial gene signatures and, upon TLR7 stimulation, secrete IL-6 and TNF but no IL-10. However, unlike macrophages, LysoDC display a rapid renewal rate, strongly express genes of the MHCII presentation pathway and prime naïve helper T cells for IFNg production. Our results show that in PP,  at steady state, monocytes generate both LysoDC and macrophages which display distinct features from their adjacent villus counterparts.

DESIGN
3 replicates of 3 different mononuclear phagocyte subsets have been extracted from Peyer's Patches of WT C57Bl/6 mice: CD11b+ DC, lysoDC and lysoMac. The total RNA of PP-sorted cells from the 3 independent experiments was extracted with a Qiagen  micro RNAeasy PLUS kit. Quantity, quality and absence of genomic DNA contamination were assessed with a Bioanalyser (Agilent). Microarray experiments were performed by the Plateforme Biopuces of Strasbourg (France) using the GeneChip® Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array.
