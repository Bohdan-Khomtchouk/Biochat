TITLE
Microarray Analysis of microRNA Expression during Notophthalmus viridescens (red-spotted newt) heart regeneration

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The adult vertebrate red spotted newt is a champion of regeneration, demonstrating an amazing ability to regenerate damaged organs and tissues back to an uninjured state without the formation of scar or reduction in function. By developing a novel cardiac resection strategy, our group recently demonstrated that newt hearts could morphologically and functionally regenerate, without scarring, within a period of 2-3 months following injury. MicroRNAs (miRs) have been widely publicized as essential post-transcriptional gene regulators in a variety of biological processes, including regeneration. We have conducted a microarray screen for vertebrate miRs, with several candidate miRs showing significant differential expression at important time-points following injury to the newt heart. The newt microRNA expression between uninjured hearts and regenerating hearts, 7 and 21 days post-injury (dpi), was compared by microarray analysis.
