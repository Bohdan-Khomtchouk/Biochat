TITLE
Human lupus netting neutrophils induce endothelial damage, infiltrate tissues and expose immunostimulatory molecules

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our group has proposed that low-density granulocytes (LDGs) play an important role in lupus pathogenesis, as they can damage endothelial cells and synthesize increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. LDGs have a heightened capacity to synthesize neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).  NETs from LDGs display increased levels of bactericidal and immunostimulatory proteins, such as the cathelicidin LL37 and externalize double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Lupus netting LDGs have increased capacity to kill endothelial cells and expose IL-17.  Through NETosis, lupus neutrophils stimulate plasmacytoid DCs to synthesize IFN-Î±. Our results further expand the potential pathogenic role of aberrant lupus neutrophils through a NET-mediated effect. We used microarrays to analyze the gene expression of neutrophils in healthy and lupus patients, and of low-density granulocytes in lupus patients.

DESIGN
Human neutrophils and LDGs were isolated from PBMCs. RNA from healthy neutrophils, lupus neutrophils and lupus LDGs was extracted and processed for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
