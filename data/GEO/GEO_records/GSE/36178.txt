TITLE
Expression diversity in Phytophthora ramorum

ORGANISM
Phytophthora ramorum

SUMMARY
Expression diversity of P. ramorum isolates belonging to the NA1 clonal lineage growing on solid CV8 was examined.  It was found that although all the analyzed isolates belonged to a single clonal lineage, expression patterns were distinctive between isolates originating from coast live oak and California bay laurel.

DESIGN
Global expression patterns of 13 isolates originating from coastal live oak and California bay laurel was investigated.  No biological replicates were generated.  The sequenced strain Pr102 was included.  Gene models Phytophthora ramorum v1.0 were used to construct NimbleGen 72K x4 custom arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL15286 Phytophthora ramorum 4x72K v1.0
