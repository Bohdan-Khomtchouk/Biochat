TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profilings between parental A549, OSK-A549-Colony and OSK-A549-SN

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study, we successfully generated lung cancer stem cell (CSC)-like cells by introducing a small set of transcription factors into a lung cancer cell line (OSK-A549-Colony). In addition to properties that are conventionally referred to as CSC properties, the lung induced CSCs exhibited the ability to form lung cancer-like tissues in vitro with vascular cells and mesenchymal stem cells, which showed structures and immunohistological patterns that were similar to human lung cancer tissues.

DESIGN
We extracted total RNA from 3 lung cancer cell lines (parental A549), 3 induced lung cancer stem like cells (OSK-A549-Colony) and 3 differentiated non lung cancer stem like cells (OSK-A549-SN)  and hybridized them to Agilent gene expression microarrays.
