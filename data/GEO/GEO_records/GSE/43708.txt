TITLE
Expression data from Influenza A infected mouse primary tracheal epithelial cell cultures (MTEC), from wild-type, IFNAR1-/-, IL28Ra-/- and  IFNAR1-/- IL28Ra-/- double ko

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in response to Influenza A  (PR8) infection

DESIGN
Fully differentiated MTEC cells were infected with PR8 (moi: 0.3) or mock infected and RNA was collected at 24 hours post infection

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
