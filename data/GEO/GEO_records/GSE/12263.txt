TITLE
Benzoate induced transcriptomic response in Bacillus subtilis

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Bacillus subtilis strain AG174 was grown in the presence and absence of  benzoate (30 mM). Benzoate was used in order to equalize the external and internal pH. The cultures were grown at external pH 7.0, and the addition of benzoate did not change the external pH. Microarray analysis was performed on cDNA synthesized from bacterial RNA. Real-time PCR of highly up-regulated genes confirmed the results of the microarray. These data were compared to previous B.subtilis microarray results, where genes regulated by external pH were identified.
