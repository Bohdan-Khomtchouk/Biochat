TITLE
Predicting Outcome in Follicular Lymphoma by Using Interactive Gene Pairs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Follicular lymphoma is a common lymphoma of adults. Although its course is often indolent, a substantial proportion of patients have a poor prognosis, often due to rapid progression or transformation to a more aggressive lymphoma. Currently available clinical prognostic scores, such as the follicular lymphoma international prognostic index, are not able to optimally predict transformation or poor outcome. Experimental Design: Gene expression profiling was done on primary lymphoma biopsy samples.  Results: Using a statistically conservative approach, predictive interaction analysis, we have identified pairs of interacting genes that predict poor outcome, measured as death within 5 years of diagnosis. The best gene pair performs > 1,000-fold better than any single gene or the follicular lymphoma international prognostic index in our data set. Many gene pairs achieve outcome prediction accuracies exceeding 85% in extensive cross-validation and noise sensitivity computational analyses.Many genes repeatedly appear in top-ranking pairs, suggesting that they reproducibly provide predictive capability. Conclusions:The evidence reported here may provide the basis for an expression-based, multigene test for predicting poor follicular lymphoma outcomes. Keywords: Comparative genomics
