TITLE
mRNA differential expression analysis in a human ex vivo model of chronic wounds

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation in a normal or pathological situation, NHDF (Normal human dermal fibroblast) obtained from two different healthy donors (donors A and B) were either left untreated (T-E-) either treated with TGF-beta alone (T+E-), or with exudate from chronic wounds (T-E+) or both (T+E+). For each different treatment we performed mRNA deep sequencing 3 times : twice with cells from donor A and once with cells from donor B.We focused our study on gene expression profile as a representation of cell fate. We performed mRNA deep sequencing analysis of the 4 different conditions. For each condition, mRNA deep sequencing was performed 3 times : twice with cells from donor A and once with cells from donor B.Comparing the mRNA abundance between the different treatments, we identified 3 lists of genes characterizing the different gene expression states: 171 genes in List I representing the genes differentially expressed during normal fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, 409 genes in List II representing the genes differentially expressed upon exudate-only treatment and 1006 genes in List III representing the genes differentially expressed upon the combination of exudate and TGF-beta treatments.

DESIGN
4 different treatments are compared : (T-E-) NHFD left untreated, (T+E-) NHDF treated with TGFbeta  for 4 days, (T-E+) NHDF treated with exudate for 4 days and (T+E+) NHDF treated with both TGFbeta and exudate. NHDF : Normal Human Dermal Fibroblast
