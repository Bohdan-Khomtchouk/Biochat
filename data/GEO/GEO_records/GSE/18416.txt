TITLE
Drosophila Divergence 20091001

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila sechellia ; Drosophila simulans ; Drosophila yakuba

SUMMARY
D. yakuba, D. simulans, and D. sechellia gDNA competitively hybridized against D. melanogaster to evaluate aCGH as a means to identify diverged orthologs.

DESIGN
2 D. sechellia vs D. melanogaster hybs - with dye swap, 2 D. simulans vs D. melanogaster hybs with dye swap, and 8 D. yakuba vs D. melanogaster hybs with balanced dye swaps. D. yakuba vs. D. melanogaster were then analyzed in all 2,4,6,8 possible combinations that incorporated dye-swap to asses sources of variation.
