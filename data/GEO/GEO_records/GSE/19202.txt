TITLE
Genome-wide recognition of PML/RARa binding sites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PML/RARa is of crucial importance in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) both pathologically and therapeutically. Using a genome-wide approach, we identified in vivo PML/RARa binding sites in ZnSO4 treated PR9 cells. A total of 2,979 high quality binding sites were identified, representing 1,981 unique RefSeq genes. The supplementary bed file contains all 2,979 high quality PML-RARa binding sites reported in the paper.

DESIGN
RARa ChIP in ZnSO4 induced PR9 cells vs. Input in ZnSO4 induced PR9 cells.
