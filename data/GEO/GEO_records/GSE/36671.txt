TITLE
Expression data from an ex vivo ischaemia reperfusion model of renal deceased by cardiac death (DCD) donation in rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In DCD organ donation one of the significant problems for the organ is the inflammatory response due to ischaemia reperfusion injury caused by warm ischaemia prior to retrieval followed by warm reoxygenation upon transplantation. We developed a model where a DCD kidney was retrieved and preserved using hypothermic machine perfusion with cold University of Wisconsin  solution with/without the addition of heparinoids low molecular weight heparin and pentosan polysulfate (PPS) followed by warm oxygenated perfusion with modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer to simulate early ischaemia reperfusion injury (IRI). The donor rats consisted of a control group cold perfusion group compared to warm perfusion and groups treated with either low molecular weight heparin or PPS to assess their activity in ameliorating IRI. We used equimolar pooled RNA samples from each group to perform an exploratory microarray experiment

DESIGN
Donor kidneys were harvested and preserved by hypothermic machine perfusion with University of Wisconsin (UW) Solution for 3 hours followed by warm oxygenated perfusion with modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer for 30 minutes to simulate transplantation and whole blood ischaemia reperfusion injury. The model was then used to test the anti-inflammatory properties of the glycosaminoglycan heparin and PPS when used as supplements into perfusate solutions.  Half of the donor kidney was used to extract RNA using the Tri reagent and stored in RNA Later. The qualitative best three RNAs from each group were quantified by fluorimetry and mixed in an equimolar manner and used for microarray analysis.
