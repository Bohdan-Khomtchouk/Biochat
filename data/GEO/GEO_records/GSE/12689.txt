SUMMARY
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most advanced form of a large subset of brain tumors collectively known as glioma, is the most aggressive and invasive type of brain tumor.  Patients usually experience a median survival range of 9 to 12 months.  GBMs are extremely difficult to manage because of the tumor cellsâ€™ tendency to migrate and pervade into adjacent tissues.  Surgical resection of GBMs generally only slows disease progression because any remaining tumor cells proceed to migrate through brain tissues and reform a new tumor mass.  It is hypothesized that the invasive phenotype of these tumor cells may be attributable to unique gene expression.  Stationary core and invasive rim tumor cells were collected separately by laser capture microdissection (LCM) from 19 biopsy samples.  Identification of differentially expressed genes in the tumor core and invasive rim can give valuable insight to the genes and pathways potentially involved with the invasive phenotype.  This information can then be used to generate possible biomarkers, diagnostic markers, or drug targets.
