Human bone marrow precursor cells

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to characterize in vivo miRNA expression in normal myeloid development of the neutrophil granulocyte (granulopoiesis) to gain insight into miRNA control of these processes. Cell populations highly enriched in precursors from successive stages of granulopoiesis and mature neutrophils were isolated from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples, respectively, from 4 healthy human donors. Total RNA was extracted from each cell population and subjected to miRNA gene expression profiling using miRCURYTM LNA microRNA Arrays
