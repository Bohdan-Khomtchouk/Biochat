TITLE
Bisulfite sequencing data of one human DNA sample

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bisulfite conversion and whole genome-single base next generation sequencing of DNA from a single iPSC clone (CMC28). This method provides exceptional depth of the sequenced methylome.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from a single iPSC clone (CMC28), and get its high-throughput sequence data with Illumina.
