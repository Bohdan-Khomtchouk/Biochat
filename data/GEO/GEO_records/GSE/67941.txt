TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of human global and transcription-coupled excision repair of UV damage at single-nucleotide resolution

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed a method for genome-wide mapping of DNA excision repair named XR-seq (eXcision Repair-seq). Human nucleotide excision repair generates two incisions surrounding the site of damage, creating a ~30-mer. In XR-seq, this fragment is isolated and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. We used XR-seq to produce stranded, nucleotide-resolution maps of repair of two UV-induced DNA damages in human cells, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and (6-4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts ((6-4)PPs). In wild-type cells, CPD repair was highly associated with transcription, specifically with the template strand. Experiments in cells defective in either transcription-coupled excision repair or general excision repair isolated the contribution of each pathway to the overall repair pattern, and showed that transcription-coupled repair of both photoproducts occurs exclusively on the template strand. XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bi-directional eRNA production at enhancers. XR-seq data also uncovered the repair characteristics and novel sequence preferences of CPDs and (6-4)PPs. XR-seq and the resulting repair maps will facilitate studies of the effects of genomic location, chromatin context, transcription, and replication on DNA repair in human cells.

DESIGN
We have performed XR-seq for two types of UV-induced damages (CPD and (6-4)PP) in three different cell lines: NHF1, XP-C (XP4PA-SV-EB, GM15983)), and CS-B (CS1ANps3g2, GM16095). Two biological replicates were performed for each experiment, in which independent cell populations were UV treated and subjected to XR-seq.
