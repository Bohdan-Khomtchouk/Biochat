TITLE
Transcriptional Analysis of lsm1a lsm1b Arabidopsis mutant.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Characterization of the lsm1a lsm1b transcriptional profile. LSM1 protein is involved in RNA decay through decapping facilitation. The performed array help us to understand the transcription level alterations produced by the absence of LSM1.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, Col-0 vs. lsm1a lsm1b plants. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates.
