TITLE
Transcriptomic response of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae EC1118® during wine alcoholic fermentation under unusual nutrient starvations.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In order to asses yeast EC1118® strain expression changes during wine alcoholic fermentation triggered by various nutrient starvations, this experiment describes the gene expression under  micronutrient starvations that lead to yeast cell death (oleic acid starvation, ergosterol starvation, pantothenic acid starvation and nicotinic starvation) or allow the maintenance of yeast viability (nitrogen starvation).

DESIGN
For each fermentation condition (low nitrogen, low nitrogen/low ergosterol, high nitrogen/low oleic acid, high nitrogen/low ergosterol, high nitrogen/low pantothenic acid, high nitrogen/low nicotinic acid), three independent fermentations were carried out in parallel . Sampling was performed at 4 time-points of the fermentation (20 106 cells/mL, 12 g of CO2 produced, 40 g of CO2 produced and 75 g of CO2 produced) for each biological repetition of each fermentation condition, giving a total of 72 samples. The condition low nitrogen serves as reference as this condition is known to lead to set up of the environmental stress response.
