TITLE
Whole Transcriptome analysis of the coral acropora millepora reveals complex responses to ocean acidification during the initiation of calcification

ORGANISM
Acropora millepora

SUMMARY
We used the Illumina RNAseq approach to study the effects of acute exposure to elevated CO2 on gene expression in primary polyps of Acropora millepora

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptome in Acropora millepora primary polyps at 380, 750 and 1000 ppm CO2 after 3 days exposure
