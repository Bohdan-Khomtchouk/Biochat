TITLE
A transcript profile of Medicago truncatula 2HA and Jemmalong during somatic embryogenesis

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
The Medicago truncatula line 2HA has a 500-fold greater capacity to regenerate plants in culture by somatic embryogenesis than wild-type Jemalong. We have compared transcriptomes of tissue cultures from leaf explants of these two lines. We have used the Affymetrix Medicago Genome Array GeneChip to compare leaf explants of Medicago truncatula Jemalong and the superembryogenic line 2HA after two weeks of tissue culture on 10 µM 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 4 µM 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) (P4 10:4) Keywords: Genotype comparison
