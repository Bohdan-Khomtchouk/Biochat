TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of inhibitor-treated schistosome female

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of  S. mansoni adult females treated with Herbimycin A (4.5 µM ) or TGF beta receptor type I kinase inhibitor (TRIKI, 300 nM) or a combined treatment with both inhibitors (Herbimycin A 4.5µM and TRIKI 300nM)   vs. Non-treated S.mansoni adult females (DMSO during 48h)

DESIGN
Two conditions (treated vs. Non-treated) with three biological samples of treated worms (Herbimycin, TRIKI or Herb+TRIKI) and in parallel other three biological samples of non-treated worms (DMSO) for each treatment condition. For each sample (three treated and three non-treated for each inhibitor combination) were performed two technical replicas.
