TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of iron and phosphorus interaction in rice seedlings

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The antagonistic interaction between iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P) has been noted in the area of plant nutrition. To understand the physiology and molecular mechanisms of this interaction, we studied the growth performance, nutrient concentration, and gene expression profiles of root and shoot segments derived from 10-d-old rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings under four different nutrient conditions: (1) full strength of Fe and P (+Fe+P); (2) full strength of P and no Fe (-Fe+P); (3) full strength of Fe and no P (+Fe-P); and (4) without both Fe and P (-Fe-P). We used Affymetrix genechip to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying different Fe and P supply conditions identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes.

DESIGN
The GeneChip analysis experiment was designed as a two-factor experiment  with four treatments: (1) +P+Fe; (2) –Fe+P; (3) +Fe–P; (4) –Fe–P. The  experiment included two biological replicates. Each sample represented root  and shoot material from five to 10 plants.
