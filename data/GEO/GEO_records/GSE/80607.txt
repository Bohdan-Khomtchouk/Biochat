TITLE
Transcriptome of Vibrio fischeri ES114 in rich medium, seawater, and after venting from the Hawaiian bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes

ORGANISM
Vibrio fischeri ES114

SUMMARY
We report the full transcriptome (RNA-Seq) of Vibrio fischeri ES114 in rich medium, seawater, and after venting from the Hawaiian bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes. We also report the effects of ribodepletion on low-biomass samples, down to input amount of 1ng total RNA.

DESIGN
We performed RNAseq experiments on V. fischeri cells in culture, cells that were incubated in artificial seawater, and cells collected during expulsion from the squid host in order to look for transcriptional signals that were directly associated with host colonization.
