TITLE
The genetics of wound healing in tympanic membranes in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify the genes differentially expressed between timepoints in the week following tympanic membrane perforation in rats. Tissue from 240 individual rats was used in this study following random allocation into timepoint groups to be sacrificed over 7 days. An Agilent one color microarray technique was performed and the results were analyzed using Genespring GX9 software. A total of 3262 genes were identified as significant (p < 0.05) and differentially expressed above a two-fold threshold between the timepoints. This study provides a complete genetic review of rat tympanic membrane wound healing over 7 days. The results can be used as a model for other wound healing in other mammals and in different parts of the body. The information on differential gene expression can be used in research towards developing chronic tympanic membrane perforations and also in research to treat acute and chronic tympanic membrane perforations. The microarray was performed on animals in a disease free environment and the genetic information can be compared to future research in disease states of the TM including Otitis media, cholesteatoma, chronic perforation and tympanosclerosis.

DESIGN
Rats were randomly selected as either controls or in the perforation group. Perforations were created unilaterally (left ear) in the upper outer quadrant of the pars tensa of ratsâ€™ tympanic membranes using sterile 23 gauge needles . Rats were then randomly allocated into timepoint groups to be sacrificed at either 12, 24, 36, day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.  At the point of microarray, there were 18 rats per timepoint group and 18 controls.
