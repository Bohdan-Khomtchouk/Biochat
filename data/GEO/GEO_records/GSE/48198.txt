TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Arthrobacter in the phyllosphere

ORGANISM
Pseudarthrobacter chlorophenolicus A6

SUMMARY
Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus A6 is a 4-chlorophenol degrading soil bacterium with high phyllosphere colonization capacity. Till now the genetic basis for the phyllosphere competency of Arthrobacter or other pollutant-degrading bacteria is uncertain. We investigated global gene expression profile of A. chlorophenolicus grown in the phyllosphere of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) compared to growth on agar surfaces.

DESIGN
We designed transcriptome arrays and investigated which genes had different transcript levels in the phyllosphere of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) as compared to agar surfaces. Since water availability is considered an important factor in phyllosphere survival and activity, we included both high and low relative humidity treatments for the phyllosphere-grown cells. In addition, we determined the expression profile under pollutant exposure by the inclusion of two agar surface treatments, i.e. with and without 4-chlorophenol.
