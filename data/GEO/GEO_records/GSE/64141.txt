TITLE
Stable 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) Acquisition Marks Gene Activation During Chondrogenic Differentiation [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulation of chondrogenic differentiation by DNA demethylation is little understood. The ten-eleven-translocation (TET) proteins oxidize methylated cytosines (5mC) to 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC eventually leading to DNA demethylation. However, 5hmC is stable and can potentially act as an epigenetic mark as well. In this study, we report that global changes in 5hmC mark chondrogenic differentiation.

DESIGN
Progenitor and differentiated chondrocyte gene expression patterns were examined to assess the changing expression profiles over the course of chondrogenesis.
