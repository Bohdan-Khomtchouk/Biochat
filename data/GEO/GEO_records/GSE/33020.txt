TITLE
CD20 positive cells are undetectable in the majority of multiple myeloma cell lines and are not associated with a cancer stem cell phenotype

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although new therapies have doubled the survival of multiple myeloma (MM) patients, this remains an incurable disease. It has been postulated that the so-called MM Cancer Stem Cells (MM-CSC) would be responsible for tumor initiation and relapse but their unequivocal identification remains unclear. Here, we investigated in a panel of MM cell lines the presence of CD20+ cells harboring a MM-CSC phenotype. Among the multiple cell lines investigated, only a small population of CD20dim+ cells (0.3%) in the RPMI-8226 cell line was found. CD20dim+ RPMI-8226 cells expressed the plasma cell markers CD38 and CD138 and were CD19-CD27-. Additionally, CD20dim+ RPMI-8226 cells did not exhibit stem-cell markers as shown by gene expression profiling and the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) assay. Moreover, we demonstrated that CD20dim+ RPMI-8226 cells are not essential for CB17-SCID mice engraftment and show lower self-renewal potential than the CD20- RPMI-8226 cells. These results do not support CD20+ expression for the identification of MM-CSC.

DESIGN
For detailed description of Material and Methods, see supplementary Methods. The human MM cell lines RPMI-8226, U266, MM1S, MM1R, NCI-H929, RPMI-LR5, U266-LR7 and U266-Dox4 were studied. Cells were cultured as previously described [Ocio, 2009, 3781]. MM cell lines were immunophenotyped using a 7-color immunofluorescence technique [Paiva, 2011, 697], with the following combination of monoclonal antibodies (Pacific Blue (PB)/ anemonia majano cyan (AmCyan)/ fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/ peridinin chlorophyll protein-cyanin 5.5 (PerCP-Cy5.5)/ PE-cyanin 7 (PE-Cy7)/ allophycocyanin (APC)/ alexafluor 700 (AF700)): CD19/CD45/CD20/CD138/CD27/CD56/CD38. Data were stored for a minimum of 3x105 events. CD20dim+ and CD20- RPMI-8226 cells were sorted after incubation with CD20-APC/7AAD and acquisition on a FACSAria cytometer (Becton Dickison Biosciences). Sorting was performed only for viable cells (7AAD-) and debris were excluded by scatter properties. The CD20- and CD20dim+ RPMI-8266 sorted cells had a final purity of 98% and 88%, respectively. CD20dim+ and CD20- RPMI-8226 cells were extensively characterized. Morphological characterization was done with May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining. Characterization of VDJH and IGKappa rearrangements was performed as described elsewhere [BIOMED-2, BMH4-CT98-3936]. The expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) was assessed using the Aldefluor Kit (StemCell Technologies) following manufacturer’s instructions with further staining with a CD20-APC antibody. For gene expression profile studies, RNA was isolated, labeled and hybridized to Human Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix) according to Affymetrix protocols [Gutiérrez, 2005, 402]. The arrays were analyzed using the DNA-Chip Analyzer software (DChip). Fold change ≥2 was considered significant.
