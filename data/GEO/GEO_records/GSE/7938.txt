TITLE
Effect of nicotianamine over-accumulation in standard condition and in response to nickel treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs04-05_nickel - nickel_leaf - Nicotianamine is a known metal chelator (of Mn, Fe, Zn, Ni, Cu) suspected to be involved in metal delivery and/or circulation in planta. This project aim at understanding the effect of the modulation of the nicotianamine content on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana in control hydroponic condition and in response to nickel treatment both at the root and at the leaf level. - After germination, plants were grown hydroponically for 6 weeks in classical nutrient solution (Marques et al, New Phytol, 2004, vol 164, pp 289-95) and then treated for 48 hours with 50 uM NiSO4 or with no nickel added for control. Keywords: gene knock in (transgenic),organ comparison

DESIGN
1 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
