TITLE
Effects of metoprolol and nebivolol on gene expresion in human coronary smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human coronary smooth muscle cells were treated with two different ß-blocker (metoprolol and nebivolol). RNA from three replicates of each, treated and the untreated control group, were isolated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Human Genechip U133A arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes with different expression patterns between the treated and untreated control cells. Keywords: atherosclerosis, smooth muscle cell, ß-receptor antagonist, inflammation, microarray, nebivolol

DESIGN
3 replicates of control cells (untreated), 3 replicates of metoprolol treated cells and 3 replicates of nebivolol treated cells  were analyzed
