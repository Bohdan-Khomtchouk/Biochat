TITLE
miRNA Expession Changes with Cofilin-2 Deficiency

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA Expression in Quadriceps Muscle from Cofilin-2 Null Mice Compared to WT Littermates on Day 7

DESIGN
Quadriceps muscle resected on day 7 from cofilin-2 deficient mice and wildtype littermates were collected and mIRNA was isolated.  Expression changes were analyzed by microarray.
