TITLE
Molecular correlates of sleep deprivation in the brain of three inbred mouse strains in an around-the-clock experiment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These studies adress differential changes in gene expression between sleep deprived and control mice. We profiled gene expression at four time points across the 24H Light/Dark cycle to take into account circadian influences and used three different inbred strains to understand the influence of genetic background. Keywords: brain, circadian, genetic background, sleep deprivation
