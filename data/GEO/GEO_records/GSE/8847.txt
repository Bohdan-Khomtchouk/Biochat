TITLE
The Effect of Lifestyle on Gene Expression in Moroccan Amazighs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human transitions from nomadic to agrarian to urban lifestyles are likely to impact physiology and disease susceptibility.  In order to estimate the magnitude of the impact of lifestyle on genome function, we profiled gene expression in total leukocytes of Moroccan Amazigh from three distinct localities.  Despite great expression heterogeneity in humans, as much as one third of the PBMC transcriptome was found to differ between the localities. Keywords: Population genomic comparison
