TITLE
Genome-wide cDNA screening of IFIT1 promoter activation factors in human hepato cellarlar carcinoma cell line Huh-7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify novel ghost factors regulating the expression of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs), we conducted genome-wide cDNA screening in Huh-7 IFIT-1 Luc cells

DESIGN
Huh-7 cells stably expressing IFIT1 luciferase reporter were plated into the wells with pre-spotted cDNA clones from MGS collection ( http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/ ) (reverse transfection).  The inducibility of luciferase activity upon the introduction of each cDNA clone was then measure to determine the regulator of IFIT1 expression.  Two biological replicates were tested and the averages were taken for measurement.
