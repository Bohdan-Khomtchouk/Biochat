TITLE
Effect of erythropoietin (EPO) and leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) on gene expression profiling in differentiating rat CG4-EPOR oligodendrocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the gene expression profile in differentiating rat CG4-EPOR oligodendrocytes treated with EPO, LIF or their combination for 1h or 20h

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured undifferentiated CG4-EPOR cells and in differentiating cells at 1h and 20h in 5 conditions: control, EPO 10ng/ml, LIF 0.2ng/ml, LIF 10ng/ml, EPO 10ng/ml+LIF 10ng/ml); 3 or 4 replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL15084 Agilent-028279 SurePrint G3 Rat GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
