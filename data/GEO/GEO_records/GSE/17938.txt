TITLE
Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells Upregulate Expression of Complement Factors after Co-culture with Activated T Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we examined the effect of T cell-derived cytokines on retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells with respect to expression of complement components. We used an in vitro co-culture system in which CD3/CD28-activated human T cells were separated from the human RPE cell line (ARPE-19) by a membrane. Differential gene expression in the RPE cells of complement factor genes was identified using gene arrays, and selected gene transcripts were validated by q-RT-PCR. Protein expression was determined by ELISA and immunoblotting. Co-culture with activated T cells increased RPE mRNA and/or protein expression of complement components C3, factors B, H, H-like 1, CD46, CD55, CD59, and clusterin, in a dose-dependent manner. Soluble factors derived from activated T cells are capable of increasing expression of complement components in RPE cells. This is important for the further understanding of inflammatory ocular diseases such as uveitis and age-related macular degeneration.

DESIGN
10 samples investigating variations of co-cultures of RPE cells and T-cells. Variable parameters include the cell type, the co-culturing of the counter-part cell type and the orientation of the system (apical vs basolateral).
