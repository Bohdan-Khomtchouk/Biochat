TITLE
Human dendritic cells treated with Echinacea purpurea phytocompounds

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study investigated the specific and differential gene expression in human immature DCs (iDCs) in response to treatment with a butanol fraction containing defined bioactive phytocompounds extracted from stems and leaves of Echinacea purpurea

DESIGN
Human immature DCs (iDCs) differentiated from primary monocytes in vitro were incubated with [BF/S+L/Ep] or cichoric acid for 4 or 24 h to characterize early- or late-responsive genes. A total of nine Affymetrix HU-133A chips were hybridized to determine the transcriptome profiles in human iDCs.
