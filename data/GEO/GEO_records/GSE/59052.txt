TITLE
Transcriptome analysis associated with MDV infection in leghorn SPF chicken

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Using global transcriptome analysis and specific pathogen free chicken CEF, we try to identify genes, pathways involving in the response to MDV infection.

DESIGN
Primary chicken CEF cells were isolated from 10-day-old specific-pathogen free (SPF) white leghorn chicken embryos. Primary chicken CEF cell collected from one embryo was seeded onto two individual flasks with the density of 5×106/flask. Cells in one of flask were infected by MDV and the other were mock infected, in total, four chicken embryos was used in the current study. The cells were collected at 56 hours post inoculation. Total RNA was isolated using Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) from MDV infected chicken CEF cell. A custom chicken 4×44K Agilent microarray was used to identify the gene expression profile in the response to MDV infection.
