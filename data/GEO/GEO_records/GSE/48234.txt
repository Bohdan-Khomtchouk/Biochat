TITLE
A global profiling of uncapped mRNAs under cold stress reveals specific decay patterns and endonucleolytic cleavages in Brachypodium

ORGANISM
Brachypodium distachyon

SUMMARY
PARE (parallel analysis of RNA ends) was performed to study the change of uncapped mRNAs before and after cold treatment  in Brachypodium. Different change patterns were identified. We have provided a complete view of uncapped transcriptome under cold stress condition, which will deepen our understanding of gene expression regulation in cold stress response as well as cold stress response mechanism for monocot plants.

DESIGN
The uncapped mRNA profiles of 12-day-old Brachypodium seedlings with and without cold treatment  (4 Â°C for 24 h)  were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx

PLATFORM
GPL17338 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Brachypodium distachyon)
