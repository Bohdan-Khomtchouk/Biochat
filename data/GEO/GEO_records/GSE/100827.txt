TITLE
Analysis of transcriptome profiling in liver tissues of wild-type and SREBP1c knockout mice using RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) plays important roles in lipid metabolism and cell proliferation. To identify novel target genes of SREBP1c, particularly, in cell cycle regulation, we analyzed transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) in liver tissue of wild-type and SREBP1c knockout mice. Liver transcriptome profiles of 12-week-old wild-type (C57BL/6) and SREBP1c KO mice were generated by mRNA-seq, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq4000 by MACROGEN, Inc (Korea).
