TITLE
Global gene occupancy by nuclear WASp during T cell development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate a role of nuclear WASp in T cell development we performed WASp chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in thymocytes and spleen CD4+ T cells. To pre-process raw ChIP-Seq data, the total number of reads were normalized and aligned against the mouse genome. WASp was enriched at transcription start sites of a large number of protein-coding genes. Many of the WASp-enriched genes were associated with RNA Polymerase II-enriched genes and active epigenetic marks of transcription; H3K4m3, H3K9a, H3K27a, and with the epigenetic mark for active enhancers H3K4m1. To study the distribution of overactive WASpI296T in the thymocyte genome and to identify regions enriched in WASpI296T binding, we performed second round of ChIP-Seq analysis using the WASp F-8 antibody. To detect differences in gene enrichment between thymocytes expressing wildtype WASp or WASpI296T, we applied stringent conditions and subtracted common genes between the two samples. Using this approach, we identify 70 WASpI296T-enriched genes. Functional clustering of these genes revealed that WASpI296T was associated with RNA Polymerase II genes in 11 functional groups of genes.thymocytes and spleen CD4+ T cells. WASp was enriched at transcription start sites of a large number of protein-coding genes.
