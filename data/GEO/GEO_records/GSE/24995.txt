TITLE
Dendritic cell response to hypoxia and poly I:C

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation whether hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1alpha quantitatively or qualitatively modifies the gene expression pattern induced by poly I:C, a TLR ligand that does not induce normoxic HIF-1alpha stabilization on its own (non-HIF-1alpha-stabilizing TLR ligand). Keywords: Comparison of single and combined treatment

DESIGN
Bone marrow derived Dendritic Cells from mice were stimulated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 16h with media or poly I:C. Total cellular RNA was harvested, labeled and hybridised to Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 1.0 GeneChips. Cel files were normalized with RMA.
