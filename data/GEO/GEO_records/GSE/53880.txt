TITLE
Rad51 binding in meiosis after undergoing S phase with different replication programs.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
ChIP-on-chip analysis of Rad51 binding in cells induced to undergo synchronous meiosis after growth in continuous nitrogen-rich conditions or after nitrogen depletion.

DESIGN
Comparison of pat1-114 cells grown in -N and +N conditions as well as pat1-114 cells with altered Cdc45 levels in -N conditions. pat1-114 rec12Î” mutants in -N and +N conditions were also evaluated to confirm that Rad51 binding is dependent on the Rec12 transesterase.
