TITLE
Pdx1 overexpression sensitizes to IL-1b-induced apoptosis

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Cytokines have been shown to play a key role in the destruction of beta cells. In the rat insulinoma cell line (INS-1ab) overexpressing pancreatic duodenum homeobox 1 (Pdx1) increases sensitivity to Interleukin 1b (IL-1b). To elucidate mechanisms of action underlying Pdx1 driven potentiation of beta-cell sensitivity to IL-1β, we performed a microarray analysis of INS-1ab cells with and without Pdx1 overexpression exposed to IL-1β between 2h and 24h.

DESIGN
INS-1ab cells were cultured with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline (+/- DOX). After 24 h, 40 ng/ml IL-1b was either added or not (+/- IL-1b). Cells were harvested either 2h, 4h, 6h, 12h or 24h after addition of IL-1b. Four biological replicates for each of the eight groups.
