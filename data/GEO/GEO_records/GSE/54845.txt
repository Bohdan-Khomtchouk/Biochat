TITLE
MacroH2A1 ChIP-seq from IMR90 human primary lung fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The histone variant macroH2A1 and the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase PARP-1 both regulate gene transcription by modulating chromatin structure and function. Of the two macroH2A1 splice variants, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, the former is often suppressed in cancer and has the unique ability to interact with poly(ADP-ribose). Using ChIP-seq in primary lung fibroblasts, we demonstrate that macroH2A1 is incorporated into either of two spatially and functionally distinct types of chromatin; the first is marked by H3 K27 trimethylation, while the second contains a set of nine histone acetylations. MacroH2A1-regulated genes are involved in cancer progression are specifically found in macroH2A1-containing acetylated chromatin. Through the recruitment of PARP-1, macroH2A1.1 promotes the acetylation of H2B K12 and K120 which plays a key role in the regulation of macroH2A1 target genes in primary cells. The macroH2A1/PARP-1 pathway regulating H2B K12 and K120 acetylation is disrupted in cancer cells, in part, explaining macroH2A1â€™s role in cancer suppression.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of the macroH2A1 ChIP and two corresponding input samples were sequenced
