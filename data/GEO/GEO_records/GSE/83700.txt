TITLE
Effect of High-Fat Diet on Mouse Liver Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global liver gene expression in mouse treated with either chow diet or high-fat diet was compared. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying effects of high-fat diet on gene expression in mouse liver.

DESIGN
Male C57/BJ mice aged 6 weeks were randomly assigned to a high-fat diet or control chow diet. All mice were sacrificed under anesthesia 20 weeks after treatment and livers were harvested. 3-4 total RNA samples per group were analyzed and gene expression was compared between groups.
