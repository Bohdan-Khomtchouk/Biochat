TITLE
RNA-seq of FSHD and control immortalised myoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FSHD and control immortalised myoblasts show repression of Pax7 target genes

DESIGN
FSHD Myoblasts 54-2, 54-12, 54-A5, 16A and 12A and matched controls 54-6, 54-A10, 16U and 12U were plated at 312,000 cells per 12 well plate in proliferation media and cultured for 48 hours or until 100% confluent. RNA-sequencing was performed on high quality (RIN > 8.0) DNA free RNA.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
