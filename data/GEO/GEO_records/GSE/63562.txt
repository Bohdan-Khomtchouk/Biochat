TITLE
YBX1-dependent hypoxia-induced modulation of gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify YBX1-dependent targets that are modulated under hypoxic conditions, we used control and YBX1 knockdown cells grown under normoxia and hypoxia to profile gene expression levels.

DESIGN
Control and YBX1-knockdown cells were grown and profiled under hypoxia and normoxia to identify YBX1-dependent hypoxia-induced target transcripts.
