TITLE
Evolution of monoclonal zebrafish Myc-induced T-ALL, assessed by copy number variant analysis

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Clonal evolution and intratumoral heterogeneity drive cancer progression through unknown molecular mechanisms. To address this issue, functional differences between single T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) clones were assessed using a zebrafish transgenic model. Functional variation was observed within individual clones, with a minority of clones enhancing growth rate and leukemia propagating potential with time. We analyzed CNVs between monoclonal primary transplants and secondary transplants of clones that evovled increased leukemia propagating potential, and well as non-evovled clones with inherently high and low leukemia propagating potential. The goal of this study was to identify CNVs commonly assoicated with increased leukemia propagating cell frequency.

DESIGN
Myc-induced T-ALL were generated in syngenic CG1. Single T-ALL cells were transplanted into recipitent CG1, resulting in monoclonal T-ALL.  In some instances, the monoclonal T-ALL were serially passaged. Leukemia propagating frequency was calculated for each T-ALL clone, at each passage. In this analysis, 9 primary T-ALL and 35 monoclonal T-ALL were individually run against a CG1 control.
