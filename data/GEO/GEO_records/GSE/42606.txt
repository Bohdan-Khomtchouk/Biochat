TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of human PBMCs stimulated with Candida albicans and non-fungal inflammatory stimuli

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Candida albicans is the most common human fungal pathogen causing mucosal and systemic infections, but human anti-fungal immunity remains poorly defined. Expression profiling of Candida-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) provides new insights into Candida-specific host defense mechanisms in humans.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from PBMCs from healthy human volunteers. PBMCs were stimulated with heat-killed Candida albicans (10^6/ml), non-fungal inflammatory stimuli or RPMI control for 4 or 24 hours. A large number of biological replicates ( > 20) were included per stimulation condition and duration.
