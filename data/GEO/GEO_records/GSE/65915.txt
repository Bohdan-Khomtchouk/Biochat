TITLE
Expression analysis of gene expression changes in Homo sapiens SGC-7901 cells after knock down of MTA2 or overexpression of SNHG5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression analysis of gene expression changes in Homo sapiens SGC-7901 cells after knock down of MTA2 (Metastasis-associated protein) or overexpression SNHG5 (snoRNA host gene 5) Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Homo sapiens gastric carcinoma cells SGC-7901 after knock down MTA2 expression and upregulation of SNHG5

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA extracted from  SGC-7901 cells transfected with siRNA negative control and SGC-7901 cells knock down of MTA2 with siRNA. Each chip measures the expression level of 45033 genes collected from the authoritative data source including NCBI
