TITLE
Neisseria gonorrhoeae with knock-out of NgoAXP (ngo0545::km) and NgoAV (ngo406::cm) Restriction-modification system versus wild type

ORGANISM
Neisseria gonorrhoeae

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of N. gonorrhoeae comparing wild type cells to cells with inactivated by kanamycin cassette (km) gene involved in restriction modification NgoAXP or with chloramphenicol cassette (cm) gene involved in restriction-modification NgoAV. The Goal was to study the role of M.NgoAXP and NgoAV methyltransferases in overall expression profile.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wild type cells vs. mutant cells . Biological replicates: 4 control replicates, 4 mutant replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL19073 Agilent-034141 Neisseria gonorrhoeae Genotypic_EA500_N_gonorrhoeae_8x15k_GE 023571
