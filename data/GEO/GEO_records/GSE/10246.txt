GNF Mouse GeneAtlas V3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
High-throughput gene expression profiling has become an important tool for investigating transcriptional activity in a variety of biological samples. To date, the vast majority of these experiments have focused on specific biological processes and perturbations. Here, we profiled gene expression from  a diverse array of normal tissues, organs, and cell lines in mice.  Keywords: multiple tissues
