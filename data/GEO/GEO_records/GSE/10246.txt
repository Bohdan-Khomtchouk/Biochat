TITLE
GNF Mouse GeneAtlas V3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
High-throughput gene expression profiling has become an important tool for investigating transcriptional activity in a variety of biological samples. To date, the vast majority of these experiments have focused on specific biological processes and perturbations. Here, we profiled gene expression from  a diverse array of normal tissues, organs, and cell lines in mice.  Keywords: multiple tissues

DESIGN
Multiple tissues were taken from na√Øve male C57BL6 mice for hybridization to MOE430_2 arrays

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
