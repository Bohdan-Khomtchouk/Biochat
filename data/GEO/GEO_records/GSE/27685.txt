TITLE
Expression data of embryonic stem (ES) cells from both control and Prmt6 overexpressed population

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ES cells are able to self-renew and remain pluripotent. These characteristics are maintained by both genetic and epigenetic regulators. Protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) 4 and 5 are shown to be important in early embryonic development and in ES cells. PRMT6-mediated di-methylation of histone H3 at arginine 2 (H3R2me2) can antagonize the tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4, which marks active genes. However, it is unclear whether PRMT6 and PRMT6-mediated H3R2me2 play crucial roles in early embryonic development and ES cell identity. In this study, we investigate their functions using mouse ES cells as the model. We used microarray (Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0ST) to examine the global change of gene expression in mouse ES cells when Prmt6 was overexpressed and identified distinct classes of genes that are up-regulated and down-regulated during this process.

DESIGN
Mouse ES cells were transfected with either pCAGIP.puro empty vector (control) or Prmt6 overexpressing plasmid (P+6 OE). After 3 days of selection by puromycin, cells from both populations were subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
