TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of rabbit parthenogenetic blastocysts developed under in vivo conditions

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
Parthenogenetic embryos are one attractive alternative as a source of embryonic stem cells, although many aspects related to the biology of parthenogenetic embryos and parthenogenetically derived cell lines still need to be elucidated.  The present work was conducted to investigate the gene expression profile of rabbit parthenote embryos cultured under in vivo conditions using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Transcriptional microarray study that compares gene expression of 6 day parthenote rabbit embryos to their in vivo counterparts. Biological replicates used: 4 replicates for control embryos, 4 replicates for parthenote embryos
