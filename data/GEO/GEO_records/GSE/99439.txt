TITLE
Cellular and molecular characterization of gametogenic progression in ex vivo culture of prepuberal mouse testis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was performed by commercial agreement with Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). We have evaluated the miRNA profiles of mouse testis during the spermatogenic progression after ex vivo culture. We have observed that as long as spermatogenesis progress, miRNA expression decreases. However, we have identified some miRNAs that did not follow this expression profile, like miR-34c-5p and miR-449a-5p, with a higher expression in samples where the spermatogenic process was more advanced, which suggest important roles at the last stages of spermatogenesis.

DESIGN
For the analysis, we have isolated RNA from testis in 7 different situations: 6.5 days post-partum (dpp) testis, 10.5 dpp testis, 6.5 dpp testis cultured for 12 days with medium supplemented with KSR, 6.5 dpp testis cultured for 12 days with medium supplemented with AlbuMAX I, 10.5 dpp testis cultured for 12 days with medium supplemented with KSR, 10.5 dpp testis cultured for 12 days with medium supplemented with AlbuMAX I and adult testis.
