TITLE
Study of Cj1103 function in Campylobacter jejuni

ORGANISM
Campylobacter

SUMMARY
In order to study the function of the Campylobacter jejuni Cj1103 gene, a series of experiments were carried out. Three strains were constructed: a Cj1103 knockout strain, a strain where the Cj1103 knockout was complemented in trans, and a strain with a second copy over-expressing Cj1103 from an metK promoter. The transcriptomes of these were all compared to the wild-type strain. The arrays are all from RNA isolated in mid-exponential growth from independent biological replicates.
