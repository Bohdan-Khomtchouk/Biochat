TITLE
Gene expression changes in primary Sertoli cells treated with MEK1/2 inhibitor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the gene expression regualted by MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling in Sertoli cells, we cultured primary Seroli cells and treated  bFGF and PD0325901, which are activator and inhibitor of the signaling, respectively.

DESIGN
Isolated primary Sertoli cells were incubated with 20ng bFGF, 10uM PD0325901 or vehicle for 24 hours and then gene expression changes were measured with microarray analysis

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
