TITLE
Effects of SAA treatment on global gene expression in THP-1 derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effect of SAA1 treatment on global gene expression in THP-1 macrophages was studied. The study determined the gene expression upon wild-type SAA1 treatment, variant SAA1 treatment (p.Gly72Asp) and in untreated THP-1 macrophages. SAA1 treatment of macrophages induces the expression of genes involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, phagocytosis and tissue remodeling which are important in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.

DESIGN
THP-1 macrophages were treated with SAA1 for either 8 hours or 24 hours. RNA were then extracted and the gene expression pattern was compared between (i) wild-type SAA1 vs untreated (ii) variant SAA1 vs wild-type SAA1 at both 8 hr and 24 hr.
