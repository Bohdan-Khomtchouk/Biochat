TITLE
Tumor-independent host gene expression changes induced by PD-1 pathway inhibitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis was used to identify tumor-independent changes after treatment with mouse neutralizing PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies.

DESIGN
8 week olg Balb/c mice were treated for 7 days with anti-PD-1 clone RMI1-14 (250ug/mouse every 3 days) or anti-PD-L1 clone 10F.9G2 (250ug/mouse every 3 days). Lung tissue was collected and total RNA was isolated for whole genome expression analysis.
