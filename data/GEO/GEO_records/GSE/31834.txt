TITLE
Expression data from shoot bases of rice seedling after gravistimulation

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Upper and lower parts (flanks) of rice (Oryza sativa sp. japonica) shoot bases at 0.5 h and 6 h after gravistimulation was used for expression analysis in control and gravistimulated samples.Targets from biological replicates of both control and gravistimulated samples were generated and expression profiles were determined Affymetrix Rice Genome arrays.
