TITLE
Pcs1 and Mde4 are inner centromere proteins required to prevent merotelic kinetochore orientation

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Chromosome segregation depends on proper attachment of sister kinetochores to microtubules. Merotelic kinetochore orientation is an error which occurs when a single kinetochore is attached to microtubules emanating form opposite poles. Mechanisms preventing or correcting the merotelic attachment must operate to avoid chromosome missegregation. Pcs1 has been implicated in preventing merotelic attachment in mitosis and meiosis II. We describe here the identification of Mde4 protein which forms a complex with the Pcs1. Both Mde4 and Pcs1 localize to the central core of the centromere. Similarly to the pcs1 mutant, in the absence of mde4 lagging chromosomes are frequently observed during mitosis and meiosis II . We provide the first evidence that the lagging chromosomes in pcs1 and mde4 mutants are due to merotelic kinetochore orientation. Keywords: ChIP-chip analysis

DESIGN
ChIP-chip analysis: In all cases, hybridization data for ChIP fraction was compared with that of SUP (supernatant) fraction. Pombe whole chromosome array was used.
