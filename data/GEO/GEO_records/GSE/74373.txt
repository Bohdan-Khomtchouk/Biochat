TITLE
The differential expression of mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs between ectopic and eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adenomyosis, defined as ectopic endometrial tissue within the myometrium,  can often be misdiagnosed as multiple uterine leiomyomata or endometrial  thickening. We therefore performed a combined mRNA and long noncoding  (lnc)RNA microarray and bioinformatic analysis of eutopic and ectopic  endometrium in women with adenomyosis to better understand its  pathogenesis and help in the development of a semi-invasive diagnostic test.  A total of 586 mRNAs were increased and 305 mRNAs decreased in ectopic  endometrium of adenomyosis compared with eutopic endometrium, while 388  lncRNA transcripts were up-regulated and 188 down-regulated in ectopic  compared with paired eutopic endometrial tissue. Bioinformatic analysis  suggested a series of metabolic and molecular abnormalities in adenomyosis,  which have many similarities with endometriosis. Furthermore, our study  constitutes the first known report of lncRNA expression patterns in human  adenomyosis ectopic and eutopic endometrial tissue.
