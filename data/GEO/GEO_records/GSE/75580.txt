TITLE
Effect of loss of Jmjd1c on Hoxa9/Meis1 leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profile of Hoxa9/Meis1 leukemia cells 6 days after loss of Jmjd1c. Loss of Jmjd1c induces differentiation and Hoxa9/Meis1 leukemia cells. These results provide insight into the role of Jmjd1c in AML with elelvated expression of Hoxa9.

DESIGN
We used primary Jmjd1c f/f Hoxa9/Meis1 neo leukemia cells from three leukemic mice and delivered Cre-Tomato by retroviral infection. We sorted Tomato positive cells 6 days after Cre infection and subjected the samples to RNA-seq.

PLATFORM
