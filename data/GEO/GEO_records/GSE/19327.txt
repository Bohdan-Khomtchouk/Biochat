TITLE
Expression data from mouse cumulus cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are currently used on cumulus-oocyte complexes to mimic the luteinizing hormone surge in vitro and induce oocyte maturation and cumulus expansion. We have previously shown that addition of exogenous recombinant growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) during oocyte in vitro maturation led to an improvement of oocyte quality, as shown by an increased blastocyst percentage and fetal survival. Our objective was to characterize the effect of FSH/EGF and GDF9 treatments on mouse cumulus cells expression profile by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were recovered from 21 to 26 day old female 129/SV mice, 44 hours post equine chorionic gonadotropin treatment (eCG (5 IU)). For the microarray experiment whole COCs were treated with 293H control medium (0.125% v/v), with 20 ng/ml GDF9 or with a combination of 50 mIU/ml FSH and 10 ng/ml EGF. After 8 hours of in vitro maturation, COCs were denuded by gentle pipetting, the oocytes were removed and the cumulus cells centrifuged and extracted RNA analysed by microarray.
