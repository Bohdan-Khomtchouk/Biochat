TITLE
High-throughput RT-PCR analysis of Colon Adenocarcinoma Stem Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human early stage colon adenocarcinoma stem cell line was FACS-sorted for CCR9- and CCR9+ cell groups and differential expression was identified via Wafergen SmartChip

DESIGN
RT-PCR gene expression profiling. CCR9- and CCR+ cells were FACS-sorted. 24 hours afterwards, cells were treated with 100ng/ml human CCL25 for 30 min. RNA was extracted from both populations using PureLink RNA Mini kit (Invitrogen) and analyzed using the SmartChip Real-Time PCR System

PLATFORM
GPL14610 Wafergen Biosystems SmartChip Human Oncology Panel v2
