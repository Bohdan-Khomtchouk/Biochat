TITLE
CTCL and ATL cell lines, mir-150 transfected versus controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the function of miR-150 in T-cell lymphomagenesis. We transfected GFP-control or GFP-miR-150 into several T-cell lymphoma lines and sought which genes were regulated by miR-150.

DESIGN
To examine the function of miR-150 in T-cell lymphomagenesis, we first transfected GFP-control (Mock) or GFP-miR-150 into several T-cell lymphoma lines (ATN-1, HUT78, My-La, and HH). To detect genes commonly downregulated among these cells, we used the CodeLinkTM Human Whole Genome Bioarray platform with the criterion that the miR-150/GFP-control ratio must be < 0.75 in all 3 CTCL lines.
