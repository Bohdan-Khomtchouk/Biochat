TITLE
Plagl1/Zac1 regulates extracellular matrix genes and the imprinted gene network

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to determine the targets of the imprinted transcription factor Zac1, we compared wild type and Zac1-mutant MEFs and measured the differentially expressed genes by RNA-seq. Genes deregulated in the absence of Zac1 include genes belonging to the Imprinted Gene Network and genes coding for the extra-cellular matrix.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of MEFs wildtype and Zac1-mutant were cultivated at different time point corresponding to proliferative and quiescent states. Genes differentially expressed between WT and Zac1-mutant MEFs were determined using RNA-seq.
