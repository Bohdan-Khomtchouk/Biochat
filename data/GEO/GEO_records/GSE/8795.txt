TITLE
mRNA expression in TTHA1939 deletion mutant of Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain grown on minimum medium

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We compared the expression profile of TTHA1939 deletion mutant strain of Thermus thermophils HB8 with that of wild-type.  The mutant strain grown in minimum essential medium (CS medium) exhibited growth arrest and cellular aggregation during the logarithm growth phase.  In this phase, 99 genes were suppressed and 63 genes were activated for the mutant strain.  The suppressed genes included genes of ribosomal proteins, TCA cycle, amino acid biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, cobalamin biosynthesis, transporters, and cell division including dnaB and ftsZ.  The activated genes included genes of nitrogen metabolism, stress proteins, and proteases.  We suggested that these transcriptional alterations in the mutant cell were induced by the ppGpp accumulation which was prevented by ppGpp degradation activity of TTHA1939 in WT cell. Keywords: gene deletion, minimum essential medium, logarithm growth phase
