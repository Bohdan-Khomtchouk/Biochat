SUMMARY
Full title: Prepubertal Human Spermatogonia and Mouse Gonocytes Share Conserved Gene Expression of Germline Stem Cell Regulatory Molecules Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis Reveals Novel Genes Expressed in Prepubertal Human Spermatogonia and Mouse Gonocytes

DESIGN
Four hundred cells were selected for each group of germ cells or testis somatic cells from three independent testis cell preparations from both human (age 2, 8 and 10 yr) and mouse (age all 3 days) Selected germ and somatic cells were placed in 25 Âµl Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) immediately after isolation Oligonucleotide microarray was utilized to identify genes enriched in human and mouse selected germ cell populations and testis somatic cells.
