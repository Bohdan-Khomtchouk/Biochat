TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional changes in the Clostridium perfringens-afflicted chicken intestine in an avian necrotic enteritis (NE) disease model

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
This study utilized comparative global gene expression microarray analysis to evaluate the effects of NE on intestinal immunity of chicken.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, NE-afflicted chickens vs. Non-infected control chickens. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 NE-afflicted replicates with dye-switching.

PLATFORM
GPL8764 Agilent-015068 Chicken Gene Expression Microarray 4x44k (Feature Number version)
