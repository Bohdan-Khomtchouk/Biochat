TITLE
methylC-seq data over Arabidopsis thaliana germination

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
methylC-seq profiling of 4 time points during germination in Arabidopsis, from mature seed, through  stratification, germination and to post-germination.

DESIGN
gDNA was extracted from Arabidopsis seeds at 4 time points during germination in triplicate. The time points were: following 15 days of ripening (0 h), after 48h of stratification (48hS), 6 hours into the light (6 h SL), 24 hours into the light (24 h SL) and 48 hours into the light (48 h SL).
