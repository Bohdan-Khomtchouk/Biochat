TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the effect of DAPT in GHMT-induced cardiac reprogramming

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment is to anlyze the transcriptomic changes associated with Notch inhibition, by DAPT treatment, during cardiac reprogramming mediated by GHMT (Gata4, Hand2, Mef2c anf Tbx5).

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed on MEFs infected with GHMT (Gata4, Hand2, Mef2c anf Tbx5) and  treated for 15 days with DMSO (vehicle) or DAPT.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
