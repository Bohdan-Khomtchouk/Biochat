TITLE
ELAVL1 modulates transcriptome-wide miRNA binding in murine macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Post-transcriptional gene regulation by miRNAs and RNA binding proteins (RBP) is important in development, physiology and disease. To examine the interplay between miRNAs and the RBP ELAVL1 (a.k.a. HuR), we mapped miRNA binding sites on a transcriptome-wide scale in WT and Elavl1 knockout murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. Proximity of ELAVL1 binding sites attenuated miRNA binding to transcripts and promoted gene expression. Transcripts that regulate angiogenesis and macrophage/ endothelial cross talk were preferentially targeted by miRNAs, suggesting that ELAVL1 promotes angiogenesis, at least in part, by antagonism of miRNA function.  We found that ELAVL1 antagonized binding of miR-27 to the 3â€™UTR of Zfp36 mRNA and alleviated miR-27-mediated suppression of the RBP ZFP36 (a.k.a. Tristetraprolin). Thus the miR-27-regulated mechanism synchronizes the expression of ELAVL1 and ZFP36.  This study provides a resource for systems-level interrogation of post-transcriptional gene regulation in macrophages, a key cell type in inflammation, angiogenesis and tissue homeostasis.

DESIGN
Bone marrow derived macrpohges mRNA profiles of 7-day cultured wild type (WT) and Elavl1l-/- mouse bone marrow cells were generated by deep sequencing, with 4 biologic duplication, using Illumina GAII.
