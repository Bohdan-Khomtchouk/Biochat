TITLE
DNase Hypersensitivity Peaks from Rat Schwann Cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We utilized DNase-Seq to identify open chromatin regions within Schwann cells. This data was used in conjunction with sequence conservation and transcription factor binding site prediction to identify putative cis-regulatory elements critical for Schwann cells. We used three independent biological replicates, and for our studies used sample 'barcode4' as a representative sample for all three. DNase HSS peaks were identified using F-Seq and HOMER, and overlapped to prioritize candidate regions. These regions were then verified using luciferase assays.

DESIGN
Performed DNase HSS on three independent biological replicates of S16 rat Schwann cells
