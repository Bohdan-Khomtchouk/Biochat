TITLE
Expression data from HCT116 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Advanced colon cancer is characterized by drug resistance and a poor prognosis. In these patients tumor-propagating cells appear to be largely resistant against various targeted drugs including ErbB-inhibitors. The cell surface antigen prominin-1 (CD133) has recently been identified as a potential marker of colon cancer stem cells. The purpose of this study was to define mRNA expression patterns in CD133+ and CD133- HCT116 cells.

DESIGN
To define mRNA expression patterns in CD133+ and CD133- HCT116 cells, gene array analysis were performed using genome-wide human U133 2.0 plus GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 3 repetitions of CD133+ HCT116 cells and 3 repetitions of CD133- HCT116 cells were performed. Robust Multichip Average (RMA) signal extraction and normalization were performed.
