TITLE
T cell Basal Signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Signal transduction pathways guided by cellular receptors commonly exhibit low-level constitutive signaling in a continuous, ligand-independent manner. The dynamic equilibrium of positive and negative regulators establishes such a tonic signal. Ligandindependent signaling by the precursors of mature antigen receptors regulates development of B- and T-lymphocytes. Here we describe a basal signal controlling gene expression profiles in the Jurkat T cell line and mouse thymocytes. Using DNA microarrays and Northern blots to analyze unstimulated cells, we demonstrate that expression of a cluster of genes, including RAG-1 and RAG2, is repressed by constitutive signals requiring the adapter molecules LAT and SLP-76. This TCR-like pathway results from constitutive low-level activity of Erk and Abl kinases. Inhibition of Abl by the drug STI-571 or events upstream of Erk increases RAG-1 expression. Our data suggest that physiologic gene expression programs depend upon tonic activity of signaling pathways independent of receptor ligation.
