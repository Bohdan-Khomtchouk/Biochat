TITLE
Gene expression profile of E1A infected C2C12 myotubes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Proliferating C2C12 myoblasts were induced to differentiate into myotubes and then infected with adenovirus expressing E1A (Ad-E1A), which induces cell cycle re-entry and dedifferentiation. We analyzed the transcriptional profile of E1A infected C2C12-myotubes through the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array, searching for genes that were significantly regulated between two independent biological replicates at two different time points (24h and 36h after infection with Ad-E1A). In addition, we took advantage of the E1A mutant known as YH47/dl928 (hereafter referred as YH47), which bears two mutations in the pocket-binding region of E1A (Y48H, C124G) able to disrupt the interaction with Rb and its cognate proteins and to impair cell-cycle re-entry phenotype. YH47 mutant was used to identify the Rb independent transcriptional reprogramming of C2C12.
