TITLE
bigun transcriptomics-Functional characterization of BIGUN proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au14-03_bigun - bigun transcriptomics - What are the gene networks associated with BIGUN function during Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis infection? - 5 weeks after germination of 12 seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0,bigun 1 mutant and bigun 2 mutant genotypes(growth condition n°1),6 plants are infected by spraying a solution of Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis spores,and 6 plants are left untreated,and all plants were cultivated under growth condition n°2.For each condition,leaves were sampled and pooled one week after infection.The experiment was repeated three times.

DESIGN
12 dye-swap - gene knock out,normal vs disease comparison

PLATFORM
GPL18904 Agilent-047069 CATMAv7 [Probe Name Version]
