TITLE
Botulinum neurotoxin A induced expression profiles in Raw264.7 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) is one of the most potent protein toxins, which makes it a possible biological weapon and therapeutic. Using microarray analysis we performed global transcriptional profiling of RAW264.7 cells, a murine alveolar macrophage cell line.

DESIGN
Time dependent expression profiles after treatment of 1nM or 5nM Botulinum neurotoxin A

PLATFORM
GPL8833 Lund Strategic Center Mouse Illumina Expression Chip V6.1.1
