TITLE
Gene expression analysis in mouse podocytes expressing shRNA directed against the long noncoding RNA Tug1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated two mouse podocyte cell lines stably transduced with either a shControl lentiviral construct or a shRNA lentiviral construct designed to target Tug1 RNA to investigate the consequences on the gene expression profile of Tug1 knockdown in differentiated mouse podocytes

DESIGN
RNA from 2 biological repliactes of shControl podocytes, 2 biological replicates of independent shTug1 clones (shTug1 Clone 2 and shTug1 Clone 3)  were harvested after 10 days of podocyte differentiation and submitted for microarray analysis on the Agilent Mouse 4x44K gene expression arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
