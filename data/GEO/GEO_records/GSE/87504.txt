TITLE
Expression analysis of wt and maternal Trim28 mutant E3.5 embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed RNAseq on 4 individual E3.5 control and maternal Trim28 blastocysts respectively in order to detect transcriptional differences amog the 2 cohorts which are to be linked to epigentic reprogramming defcts at early stages.

DESIGN
mRNA isloated from E3.5 embryos was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the SMART-Seq® Ultra® Low Input RNA Kit (Clontech), followed by sequencing library preparation using the Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) according to manufacturers instructions.
