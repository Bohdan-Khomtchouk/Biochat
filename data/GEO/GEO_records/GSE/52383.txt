TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of pig chromosomes regions associated with water holding capacity [PiF1].

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To further characterize genomic regions previously identified which are linked with meat quality traits like drip loss, PH, conductivity and etc., we employed a customary regional tiling array experiment for two pig populations. Total RNA were taken from muscle sample of M. longissimus dorsi of pigs selected from two phenotypic groups graded according to high (HI) and low (LO) drip loss. Hybridization were made in batches, 2 to 3 biological replicates for each sample. DuPi and PiF1 are code names for the two experimental populations.
