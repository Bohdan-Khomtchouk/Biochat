TITLE
Lung Adenocarcinoma derived from Normal Bronchial Epithelial Cells Co-cultured with HPV-Positive Peripheral Blood lymphocyte from Lung Cancer Patient

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray and bioinformatics analysis indicated that Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway activation may play a crucial role in HPV-infected lung adenocarcinomas derived from NHBE cells.

DESIGN
Microarray and bioinformatic analysis were used to understand what is the most important pathway involved in HPV-induced lung tumorigenesis.
