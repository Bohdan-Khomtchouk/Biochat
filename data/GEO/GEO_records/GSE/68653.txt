TITLE
Gene expression profiling in IBD rat treat with MSC transplantation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Inflammatory bowel disease rats after MSC transplantation, compared to IBD control rats, and to explore the mechanism of MSC transplantation.

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA recovered from two separate IBD rats after MSC transplantation and two separate IBD control rats. Each chip measures the expression level of 26,419 genes from normal rat and IBD rat treated with MSC transplantation.
