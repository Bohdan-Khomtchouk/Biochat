TITLE
ChIP-chip to determine the regulation of the K. lactis hsgs (ChIP of MATa1, MATalpha2, and RME1)

ORGANISM
Kluyveromyces lactis

SUMMARY
ChIP-chip to determine the regulation of the K. lactis hsgs (ChIP of MATa1, MATalpha2, and RME1).  The MATa1 and MATalpha2 ChIPs were performed in an a/alpha cell using N-terminally HA-tagged proteins and the RME1 ChIPs were perfomed in an a cell using C-terminally myc-tagged protein. For the RME1 ChIPs, the cells grown with out phosphate.  For the MATa1 andMATalpha2 ChIPs the cells were grown in YEPD.

DESIGN
Epitope tagged strains were compared to untagged control strains.  Two biological replicates were preformed for the RME1 ChIP.  For the MATa1 and MATalpha2 ChIP, peaks were considered indicative of binding if both MATa1 and MATalpha2 showed enrichment above the untagged control.
