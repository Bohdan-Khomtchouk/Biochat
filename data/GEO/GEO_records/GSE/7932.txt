TITLE
atnin7-1 in two different nitrogen conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Does the ko of NIN7 leads to a differential expression in comparison to the wildtype and is this dependent on the nitrogen regime? Can we repeat the results from the first experiment, and is there a difference between the two alleles?  - Plants were harvested during the first 3 hours of light after 42 growth on 0.2mM and 6mM nitrate in hydroponic condition (short day, 170 uE). 42 DAYS of growth Keywords: gene knock out

DESIGN
8 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
