TITLE
Tissue selective effects of topoisomerase II inhibitors in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
One major class of anti-cancer drugs targets topoisomerase II to induce DNA double-strand breaks and cell death of fast growing cells. In vitro experiments showed that doxorubicin can induce histone eviction as well as DNA damage, while etoposide can only induce DNA damage. Here, we compare the transcription responses of different tissues to doxorubicin or etoposide treatment in vivo.

DESIGN
Total RNA from respective tissues in FVB mice 1 day or 6 days post indicated drug treatment were extracted and compared to un-treated mice. Two mice were used for each treatment.
