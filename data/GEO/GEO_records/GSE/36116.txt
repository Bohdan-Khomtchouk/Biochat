TITLE
Exon Level Expression Profiling in D54 with or without TIP-1 expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
D54 stable cell lines that transfected with control shRNA and TIP-1 shRNA were cultured overnight. Isolated the total RNA of these cell lines to do microarray. Try to get more information about the difference in the mRNA level in these cell lines.

DESIGN
We analyzed gene expression from 5 subjects: 2 control D54 (two independent clones) and  3 shRNA TIP-1  D54 cells (3 differenct shRNA to scilence TIP-1 expression) using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool. No techinical replicates were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
