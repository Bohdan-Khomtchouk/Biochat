TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in Ig-lambda/kappa positive bone marrow wild type/TAK1-/- B cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The activation signaling of transcription factor nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) plays central role for immune system.  One of key kinase mediating this pathway is TAK1 in adaptive and innate immunity.  However, role of TAK1 in bone marrow B cell is still unclear. To know effects of TAK1-deletion, the gene expression of Ig-lambda/kappa positive cells were analyzed in comparison of wild type with TAK1-deficient bone marrow B cells.

DESIGN
Bone marrow B cells were purified by depleting CD3+/Ter119+/CD11b+/DX5+/Gr1+ cells.Purified B Cells were stained with anti-Iglambda or kappa and sorted on a FACSAria (BD Biosciences ).  Two replicated samples were analyzed.
