TITLE
Expression analysis of Yersinia intermedia strain ATCC 29909 at 28 C in minimal medium with glucose under aerobic and anaerobic conditions

ORGANISM
Yersinia intermedia ATCC 29909

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Yersinia intermedia strain ATCC 29909 in response to oxygen. The experiments and results have not been published yet (manuscript has been submitted to journal office and is under revision)

DESIGN
A 6 chip (whole-genome-tiled array) study using total RNA recovered from the following: 6 separate cultures of Yersinia intermedia strain ATCC 29909 grown in minimal medium with glucose (3 grown in the presence of oxygen and 3 grown without oxygen). Each whole-genome-tiled arrays contained ~320,000 probes representing 3953 genes that included 3887 protein coding genes (and 18 likely pseudogenes), 12 non-coding RNAs and 36 tRNAs. Data from probes corresponding to intergenic regions (and some pseudogenes, rRNA genes and unannotated genes) of the genome were not considered in the present analysis.
