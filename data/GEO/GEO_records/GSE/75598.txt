TITLE
RNA-Sequencing of C57BL-6 thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Thymocytes were extracted from a pool of three 8-12 week old C57BL-6 female mice. Cells were separated from stroma by gently crushing the thymi in between 2 microslides. RNA from thymocytes was extracted using the Trizol reagent and protocol, and analysed using the Illumina HiSeq 2000.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic analysis of a single replicate of thymocytes from a pool of three 8-12 week old C57BL-6 female mice, using the Illumina HiSeq 2000
