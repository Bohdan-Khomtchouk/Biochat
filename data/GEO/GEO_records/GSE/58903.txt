TITLE
DAOY human medulloblastoma cells stably expressing a tamoxifen inducible MXD3: Ethanol vs. Tamoxifen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of DAOY stable cell lines expressing a tamoxifen inducible MXD3. Data was normalized to a null version of MXD3 (unable to bind DNA). Goal of the study was to identify candidate genes regulated by MXD3.

DESIGN
Four condition experiment: two tamoxifen inducible cell lines (ER-MXD3 and ER-MXD3.E66D), each with their own ethanol vs. tamoxifen. Submitted in the matrix sheet is each test condition normalized to reference. Each condition had a dye swap biological repeat, with the normalized opposing dye reference pool of RNA from all samples.
