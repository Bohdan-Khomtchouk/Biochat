TITLE
Analysis of small RNAs in murine neutrophils by Solexa/Illumina genome analyzer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine the effects of microRNAs including miR-223 on murine neutrophil function, small RNAs cloning and sequencing from neutrophils were performed.

DESIGN
Neutrophils were isolated from a wild-type mouse and total RNAs were prepared.  Small RNAs were cloned and sequenced by Solexa/Illumina genome analyzer.
