TITLE
Expression profile of diffuse large B cell lymphoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the biological function of GSTT1 deletion in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we identified genes that are expressed differently in lymph node tissues from DLBCL patients collected at diagnosis with GSTT1 deletion (4 cases) compared to those without GSTT1 deletion (4 cases).

DESIGN
Lymph node tissue of DLBCL patients were collected at diagnosis for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. 4 cases of DLBCL samples with GSTT1 deletion and 4 cases of DLBCL samples wihtout GSTT1 deletion were used.
