TITLE
Gene profile analysis of sorted Sca1+/cKit- BMCs obtain from mice bearing instigator, non-instigator  and Matrigel

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sca1+/cKitâ€“ hematopoietic BMCs of hosts bearing instigating tumors  (BPLER) promote the growth of responding (HMLER-HR) tumors that form with a myofibroblast-rich, desmoplastic stroma. BMCs from mice bearing Non-instigating tumors lack this ability

DESIGN
Sca1+/cKit- BMCs were isolated from mice bearing Matrigel control or size-matched instigating or non-instigating tumors by FACS directly into Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).
