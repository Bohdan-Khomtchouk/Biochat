TITLE
Expression data of K562 cells with KLF3 deficiency and shRNA vector control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KLF3, a member of the Kr√ºppel-like factor (KLF) family, is expressed in a wide range of cell types. It is involved in hematopoiesis of several blood cell lineages including erythrocyte and B lymphocyte. However, the research of regulatory roles on hematopoiesis of KLF3 in K562 cells has been still largely limited. To comprehensively assess the regulatory roles of KLF3 on hematopoiesis in K562 cells, a microarray analysis was performed in KLF3-deficient K562 cells. The differentially expressed genes were applied to IPA analysis to observe the perturbed hematopoiesis-associated functions, networks, and molecular pathways. This study will extensively assess the regulatory roles of KLF3 on hematopoiesis in K562 cells. We used microarrays to study the genome-wide expression profiles of KLF3-deficient K562 cells.

DESIGN
The stable K562 cell lines with KLF3-deficiecy and shRNA control were established in laboratory. Total RNA was extracted from each cell culture dish and used for microarray assay using illumine Total Prep RNA Amplification Kit. Two mRNA-chip libraries of K562 Ctrl and KLF3 KD cells were generated in parallel and the expression profiles of each sample was determined in duplicates.
