TITLE
Gfi1 proteins regulate the emergence of HSCs and blood precursors in the  AGM through recruitment of LSD1 [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of sorted hemogenic endothelial cells with and without Lsd1 inhibition with 300nM of compound B. Transcriptome analysis to detect the global changes in gene expression upon LSD1 inhibition.

DESIGN
Bry-GFP ES line derived FLK1+ mesodermal were differentiated to Cdh5/CD41 positive HE cells with/out the compound B. CD41 compartment of both populations were FACS sorted and processed for Affymetrix.

PLATFORM
GPL6193 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
