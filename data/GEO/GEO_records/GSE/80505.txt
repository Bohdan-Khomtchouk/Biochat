TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of differential gene expression after Foxd3 knockdown in colorectal CDCP1+CSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of Foxd3-regulation of self-renewal and quiescence in CDCP1+CSCs at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that the Foxd3 global developmental regulator serves a critical role to support the self-renewal of CDCP1+CSCs as one of few known factors involved in maintaining their quiescence. Results provide important information of the response of colorectal CDCP1+CSCs to depletion of Foxd3, such as genes involved in regulation of cell cycle, cell proliferation, and stem-like properties.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated CDCP1+CSCs subjected to 24 hours in vitro Foxd3 shRNA treatment compared to untreated control cells.
