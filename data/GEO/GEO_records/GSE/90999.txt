TITLE
Global gene expression profiling and senescence biomarker analysis of hESC exposed to H2O2 induced non-cytotoxic oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) potentially offer new routes to study, on the basis of the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) concept, how the maternal environment during pregnancy influences the offspring health and can predispose to chronic disease in later life. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), antioxidant defences, and cellular redox status state play an important role in the regulation of gene expression and are involved in diabetes and metabolic syndromes as in aging. We designed an in vitro cell model of oxidative stress by exposing hESCs to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 72h. To resemble the period of preimplantation embryonic development, we have analysed the global gene expression profiles of hESCs (HUES3) exposed to non-cytotoxic H2O2 concentrations (see main text), using Illumina HT-12 v4 expression beadarray.

DESIGN
Human ESCs in four conditions, each in triplicate, 12 datasets in total; Four conditions: control, 4µM, 8µM and 16µM

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
