TITLE
Rabbit Model of Fetal Tracheal Occlusion for Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of embronic day 30.5 (E30.5) fetal rabbit left lung after creation of diapragmatic hernia (DH) at E25 and tracheal occlusion (TO) at E27.

DESIGN
The fetuses of timed pregnant New Zealand rabbits were subjected to creation of a left diaphragmatic hernia at E25 with or without tracheal occlusion at E27. At E30.5, the fetuses were sacrificed with collection of the lateral aspect of the left upper lobe for NextGen mRNA sequencing.
