TITLE
A genetic circuitry linking Id-proteins (Id2 and Id3) and the AKT-FOXO-mTORC1 axis to suppress innate-variant TFH cell development, maintain T cell quiescence and prevent lymphomagenesis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It is now well established that the E- and Id-protein axis regulates multiple steps in lymphocyte development. However, it remains unknown as to how E- and Id-proteins mechanistically enforce and maintain the naïve T cell fate. Here we show that Id2 and Id3 suppressed the development and expansion of innate-variant TFH cells. Innate-variant TFH cells required MHC Class I-like signalling and were associated with germinal center B cell development. We found that Id2 and Id3 induced Foxo1 and Foxp1 expression to antagonize the activation of TFH transcription signature.  We show that Id2 and Id3 acted upstream of the Hif1a/Foxo/AKT/mTORC1 pathway as well as the c-myc/p19Arf module to control cellular expansion and activation. We found that mice depleted for Id2 and Id3 expression developed colitis and αβ T cell lymphomas. Lymphomas depleted for Id2 and Id3 expression displayed elevated levels of c-myc whereas p19Arf abundance declined. Transcription signatures of Id2- and Id3-depleted lymphomas revealed similarities with genetic deficiencies associated with Burkitt lymphoma. We propose that in response to antigen receptor and/or cytokine signaling the E-Id protein axis modulates the activities of the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-Hifa and c-myc/p19Arf pathways to control cellular expansion and homeostatic proliferation.

DESIGN
RNA-seq data of 5 of wild type CD4SP cells, 3 of wild type Tfh cells, 3 of Id3-/- CD4SP cells, 3 of Id2-/-Id3-/-(dKO) CD4SP cells, and 6 of Id2-/-Id3-/- lymphoma cells.
