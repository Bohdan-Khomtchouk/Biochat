TITLE
Expression profiling of primary leukemia initiating cell-enriched population induced by AML1-ETO9a

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Combined gene expression and DNA occupancy profiling identifies JAK/STAT signaling as a valid therapeutic target of t(8;21) AML t(8;21) is commonly associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The resulting AML1-ETO fusion proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of AML. To identify novel molecular and therapeutic targets, we performed combined gene expression and promoter occupancy profiling using a primary leukemia initiating cell-enriched population induced by AML1-ETO9a (AE9a). CD45, a negative regulator of cytokine/growth factor receptor and JAK/STAT signaling, is greatly downregulated; furthermore JAK1 and JAK2 are upregulated in these leukemia cells. Consequently, JAK/STAT signaling is enhanced in the AE9a leukemia cells. Importantly, AE9a leukemia cells are highly susceptible to perturbation of JAK/STAT signaling, and a JAK2-selective inhibitor, TG101209, effectively targets these leukemia cells in vivo, suggesting the potential efficacy of JAK2 inhibitors in treating t(8;21) AML.

DESIGN
Wild-type or AE9a leukemic samples in triplicate.
