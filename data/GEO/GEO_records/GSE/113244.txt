TITLE
Anti-oncogenic triterpenoids from Ganoderma lucidum activate circNF1-419 to regulate lipid metabolism and promote apoptosis in glioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to confirm that L3 (G. lucidum triterpenoids fraction) could influence circRNA expression in glioma, U87 and L3-treated U87 cells were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing system. There were 131 circRNAs identified as down-regulated and 131 circRNAs identified as up-regulated after the U87 cells were co-incubated with L3.

DESIGN
Examination of circRNA sequending in 2 cell types (U87 and L3 treated U87 samples).

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
