TITLE
Splicing activation by Rbfox requires self-aggregation through its tyrosine-rich domain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine how the higher order assembly of Rbfox proteins affect Rbfox-dependent splicing regulation, we expressed Rbfox wildtype and its mutant protein in Flp-In™ T-REx™ 293 Rbfox2-/- cells and extracted RNA from these cells to perform RASL-seq which profiles thousands of alternative splicing event.

DESIGN
Flp-In™ T-REx™ 293 Cell Line (in triplicate) were transfected by Rbfox1 wildtype and its mutants, followed by Dox induction. Total RNAs were extracted and been analyzed by RASL-seq.
