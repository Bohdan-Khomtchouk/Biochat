TITLE
Expression data of human lung adenocarcinoma cell line H441 treated with TTF-1/NKX2-1 siRNA and TGF-beta

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We determined and analyzed the effect of TTF-1/NKX2-1 on Smad3/Smad4 binding sites by ChIP-sequencing. We used expression microarrays to evaluate the effect of TTF-1/NKX2-1 siRNA on TGF-beta-induced gene expressions.

DESIGN
H441 cells were transfected with siRNAs and treated with TGF-beta for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. This submission represents transcriptome component of study.
