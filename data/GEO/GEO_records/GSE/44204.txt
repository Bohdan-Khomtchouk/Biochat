TITLE
Study of microRNA associated with metforminâ€™s anti-tumor effect [Huh7 cells]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The miRNAs expression was markedly altered with the treatment of metformin in vitro and in vivo and various miRNAs induced by metformin also may contribute to tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.

DESIGN
Using a custom microarray platform, we analyzed the expression levels of 985 human miRNA probes in the cell lines in vitro and tumorous tissues in vivo that were treated with and without metformin.

PLATFORM
GPL14903 3D-Gene Human miRNA V16_1.0.0
