TITLE
Parp-1 wildtype and deficient mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide methylation analysis was performed by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-CpG island (CGI) microarray analysis to identify the CpG methylation levels of Parp-1 wildtype, Parp-1 deficient or Parp inhibitor treated mouse embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
Two samples were analyzed by MeDIP-CGI microarray. One is a whole genomic DNA and another is the MeDIP DNA. The whole DNA samples were used as reference.
