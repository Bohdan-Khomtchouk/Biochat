TITLE
Whole genome tomato transcriptional response to Tetranychus urticae herbivory [Heinz1706]

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, is one of the most significant mite pests in agriculture that can feed on more than 1,100 plant hosts, including model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato, Solanum lycopersicum. Here, we described tomato transcriptional responses to spider mite feeding and compared them to Arabidopsis in order to determine conserved and divergent responses to this pest. 2,133 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected at 1, 3, 6, 12 or 24 hours post spider mite infestation (hpi) relative to non-infested control plants. Based on Biological Process Gene Ontology annotations, improved in the course of our analysis, DEGs were grouped in 60 significantly enriched gene sets that highlighted perception of the spider mite attack (1 hpi), metabolic reprogramming (3-6 hpi), and establishment and maintenance of the defense responses (6-24 hpi). We used microarray to assess global gene expression in Solanum lycopersicum cv. Heinz 1706 upon Tetranychus urticae attack.

DESIGN
1 month old tomato plants were subjected to Tetranychus urticae attack through application of 100 adult mites on a terminal leaflet of leaf 3 for various periods of time (timecourse scenario) or hundreds of mites for 1 hour (feeding site scenario).
