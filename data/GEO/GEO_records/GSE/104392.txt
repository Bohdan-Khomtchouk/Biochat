TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in control, Hic1 KO and p53 KO mouse embrynoic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines I

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesised that genetic inactivation of the transcriptional repressor Hic1, would lead to changes in gene expression that may lead to transformation. We assessed changes in gene expression in pre-immortal MEF cell lines in which Hic1 was inactivated compared to controls.

DESIGN
Total RNA from pre-immortal ESRCre;Hic1lox/lox and control MEF lines at P2 cultured with (or without out) 500nM tamoxifen for 24 hours was collected following a further 48 hour incubation period. A minimum number of 3 cell lines for all genotypes was collected.
