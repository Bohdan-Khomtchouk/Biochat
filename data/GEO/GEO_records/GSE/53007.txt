TITLE
Murine study of sepsis-induced cardiac gene expression changes in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We systematically assessed the transcriptomic changes of heart biopsies of mice that had undergone polymicrobial sepsis. Data indicate strong cardiac in vivo responses during murine sepsis affecting a large amount of pathways and categories including cytokines, mitochondria, immune system and cardiomyocytes.

DESIGN
RNA from murine heart muscle tissue (n=4 for sepsis, n=4 for controls) was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis for comparison of transcriptomic responses.
