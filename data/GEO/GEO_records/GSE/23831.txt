TITLE
Array CGH analysis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) profiling of Oral Sqaumaous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) was performed to delineate candidate non-random chromosomal loci associated with clinico-pathological parameters. The array CGH hybridizations were performed for 60 OSCC samples with pooled gender matched controls. All tissue samples were collected after obtaining written informed consent.
