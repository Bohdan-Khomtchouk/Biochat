TITLE
Microarray analysis of stalk-eyed fly lines selected for divergent eyespan

ORGANISM
Teleopsis dalmanni

SUMMARY
Eye-stalks of some flies exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism, but little is known about the genetic mechanisms producing variation in these ornamental traits. Therefore, we constructed an EST database of genes expressed in the developing eye-antennal imaginal disc of the highly dimorphic species, Teleopsis dalmanni, and used this set of genes to construct high density oligoarrays and compare patterns of gene expression between lines of flies selected for divergent eyespan. Microarray experiments using eye-antennal disc tissue identified over 350 genes with significant differential expression between male flies from lines selected for high and low relative eyespan but did not reveal any primary biological process or pathway that is driving the expression differences.
