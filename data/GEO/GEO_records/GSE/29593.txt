TITLE
The effect of Crem absence on gene expression in mouse testis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CREM (cAMP responsive element modulator) together with CREB and ATF-1 belong to the CREB family of transcriptional factors, that respond to cyclic AMP signaling and bind to cAMP responsive element (CRE) sites in promoters of selected genes. CREM can produce isoforms that have either activating or repressing functions, depending on the transcription of specific exons. In testis, it is involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from wild-type and Crem knock-out mouse testis.

DESIGN
2 condition experiment: 2 strains (WT, Crem-/-). 5 biological replications per condition.
