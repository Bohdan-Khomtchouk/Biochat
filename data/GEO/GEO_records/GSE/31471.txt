TITLE
Host cell gene expression in Influenza A/Duck/Malaysia/01 (H9N2) infected A549 cells at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 hours post infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used the microarray data to analyze host cells response on A549 cells infected with A/Duck/Malaysia/01 (H9N2)

DESIGN
The A/Duck/Malaysia/01 (H9N2) infected A549 cells were harvested at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 hpi and RNA extraction was performed using standard protocol as described by Affymetrix. The aim of this experiment is to analyze host response to Influenza A/Duck/Malaysia/01 (H9N2) infection.
