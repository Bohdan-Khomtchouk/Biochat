TITLE
Gene expression of growing antler in Cervus elaphus

ORGANISM
Cervus elaphus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study is to characterize the gene expression of the growing antlers during their process of regeneration and fast growth Keywords: tissue type and state comparison

DESIGN
Gene profiles of RNA samples from antler tip, base (pedicle) and frontal bone. Samples were harvested during spring, at the period of maximum antler growth (60 days after casting the previous antlers). And additional sample (DEER4) was harvested at the end of the growing season (90 days after the casting).
