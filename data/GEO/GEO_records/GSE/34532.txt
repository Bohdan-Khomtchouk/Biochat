TITLE
microRNA expression in young and elder mouse tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated expression profiles of miRNAs in various tissues of young and elder mice by means of DNA microarray. The results suggested that there was a difference in the expression of miRNAs between young and elder mice.

DESIGN
Small RNA samples prepareed from various tissues of young and elder mice were examined by means of GenopalÂ®-MICM DNA chips.
