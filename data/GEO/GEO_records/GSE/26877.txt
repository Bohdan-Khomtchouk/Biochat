TITLE
Transcriptome of mouse erythroid cells (part1) poly(A)+

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report genome-wide maps of transcription in mouse erythroid cells. We used an approach to survey poly(A)+ (mRNA) (GSE26877) and non-polyadenylated RNA poly(A)- (GSE27920) separately. This provides an alternative framework for comprehensive transcriptome profiling in mammalian cells.

DESIGN
Two Samples. mRNA-seq from wild type murine Ter119+ cells and mRNA-seq from Î”MCS-P6MCS-R3-/- Ter119+ cells

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
