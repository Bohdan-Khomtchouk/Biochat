TITLE
Expression data from chimeric antigen receptor transduced (CAR) human CD4+ T cells during expansion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this data set we include expression data from human CD4+ T cells isolated on day 0, 6, 11 and 24 follow anti-CD3/anti-CD28 magnetic bead stimulation and chimeric antigen receptor transduction.

DESIGN
30 samples were submitted. Samples represented three biological replicates of normal donors transduced with various CARs. CARs used were a cMet 28z specific CAR comprised of the IgG4 hinge, CD28 transmembrane and CD28 and CD3zeta intracellular domains. A CD19 CD28 CAR was specific to CD19, and was comprised of a CD8a hinge, CD28 transmembrane and CD28 and CD3zeta intracellular domain. A third CAR, the CD19 BBz, was used that was specific to CD19 was comprised of a CD8a hinge, CD8a transmembrane and 4-1BB and CD3zeta intracellular domains. Expression data was analyzied on day 0, 6, 11 and 24.
