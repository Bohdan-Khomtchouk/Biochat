TITLE
Gene expression analysis in skeletal muscle and heart of 11 days-old TK2 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TK2 deficiency causes severe mtDNA depeltion in several tissues, including skeletal muscle and heart. TK2 knockout mice grow slower and their skeletal muscles appeared significantly underdeveloped, whereas heart was close to normal size. We used microarrays in order to compare the transcriptomes in skeletal muscle and heart tissue of 11 days-old TK2 knockout pups with the sames tissues of wild-type pups at the same age.

DESIGN
We collected skeletal muscle from the hind limb and hearts of three 11 days-old TK2 knockout and three wild-type pups and extracted total RNA. These RNA samples were used for hybridization in Affymetrix arrays.
