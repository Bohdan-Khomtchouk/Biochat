TITLE
Transcriptional responses of Escherichia coli rpoS- BW25113 vs. wild-type BW25113 under 15% ethanol shock in log phase

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
RpoS, an alternative sigma factor, is critical for stress response in Escherichia coli.RpoS also acts as a global regulator for stress control of gene expression, and actually dose so in log stage and stationary stage. To further understand the effect of environmental stresses on in ethanologenic strains, DNA microarrys was used to analyze the expression profiles of E. coli and its rpoS mutant strain.

DESIGN
BW25113（rpoS-）and BW25113 were selected at log stages and stationary stage of early development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To that end, we hand-selected BW25113 and BW25113（rpoS-） according at different treatments: BW25113（rpoS-）at log stage (BW25113(rpoS-) log), BW25113 at log stage (BW25113 log),BW25113（rpoS-）atstationary stage ( BW25113(rpoS-) stationary), BW25113 at stationary stage ( BW25113 stationary)
