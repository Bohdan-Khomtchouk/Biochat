TITLE
The effect of Sparstolonin B (SsnB) on gene expression in HCAECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sparstolonin B is a novel bioactive compound isolated from Sparganium stoloniferum, an herb historically used in Traditional Chinese Medicine as an anti-tumor agent.  SsnB has previously demonstrated anti-angiogenic properties.  In functional assays, SsnB inhibited endothelial cell tube formation (Matrigel method) and cell migration (Transwell method) in a dose-dependent manner. We used microarrays to examine how SsnB affected the gene expression of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs), focusing in particular on pathways related to angiogenesis.

DESIGN
Three plates of HCAECs were exposed to 100 micromolar SsnB and three plates of HCAECs were exposed to Vehicle Control (1:1000 dilution of DMSO).  After 24 hours, RNA was extracted for microarrays and gene expression was analyzed.
