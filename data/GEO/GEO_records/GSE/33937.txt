TITLE
Gene expression analysis of early haematopoietic progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The common myelo-erythroid progenitor (CMP) was subdivided based on expression of CD27. To understand the relationship between the various CD27 fractions of the CMP and downstream progenitors (granulocyte-monocyte progenitor, GMP, and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor, MEP), genome-wide transcriptional analysis was used.

DESIGN
FACS purified CMP CD27+, CMP CD27-, GMP and MEP progenitors from C57BL/6 adult 4-6 weeks old mice were hybridised to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430_2 GeneChip

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
