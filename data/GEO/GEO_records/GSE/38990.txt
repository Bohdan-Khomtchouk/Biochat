TITLE
The polyA+ transcriptomes of mouse embryonic stem cells and their derived neural precursors from strand-specific RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have examined the nuclear (nuc) and cytoplasmic (cyt) polyA+ transcriptomes of undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (un) and cells differentiated to neural precursors (d5) using strand-specific RNA-Seq. The 46C mouse embryonic stem cell line was used for this study.

DESIGN
Two cell types were examined: undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (un) and cells differentiated to neural precursors (d5). For each cell type, cells were fractionated to nuclear and cytoplasmic components. RNAs were extracted from each component and were fragmented enzymatically for library construction. For each cell type and component, strand-specific RNA-Seq libraries were generated using at least two different fragmentation protocols.
