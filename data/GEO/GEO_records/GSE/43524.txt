TITLE
Microarray analysis of wildtype, Klf8gt/gt, Klf3-/- and Klf3-/- Klf8gt/gt TER119+ E13.5 fetal liver cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this experiment was to investigate the regulation of gene expression by KLF3 and KLF8 in fetal erythroid cells by analyzing single and double mutant mouse models. Affymetrix microarrays were performed on RNA from TER119+ fetal liver cells from E13.5 wildtype, Klf8gt/gt, Klf3-/- and Klf3-/- Klf8gt/gt mice.

DESIGN
Four wildtype replicates, four Klf8gt/gt replicates, three Klf3-/- replicates and four Klf3-/- Klf8gt/gt replicates of E13.5 TER119+ fetal liver cell samples, litter-matched where possible.
