TITLE
piRNA expression in rat ovary

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To study the expression profile of piRNAs in rat ovary Methods: Ovary from eight-weeks old, adult wistar rats were harvested after sacrificing the animal. The total RNA is isolated using trizol reagent. Subsequently, small RNA library was contructed using illumina kit as per manufacturer's instructions. Results: The reads were annotated to the rat genome (rn5) and piRNA database and their expression is studied Conclusions: Large number of piRNAs are expressed in rat ovary

DESIGN
Small RNA profile of rat ovary was generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 1000

PLATFORM
GPL18469 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Rattus norvegicus)
