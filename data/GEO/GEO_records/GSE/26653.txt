TITLE
HoxB4 in hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ectopic expression of homeodomain transcription factor HoxB4 in mouse ES cells enhances in vitro development of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).

DESIGN
Mouse ES cells were differentiated for 6 days in EBs, then c-Kit+CD41+ hematopoietic precursor cells were isolated, plated onto OP9 cells, and transduced with the GFP control or 3Ã—FLAG-tagged HoxB4 retrovirus.  At day 12 of the co-culture with OP9 cells, c-Kit+ progenitor cells overexpressing HoxB4 were collected by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and subjected to a ChIP-chip and microarray analysis. The purity of the recovered c-Kit+ cells was more than 95% as judged by flow cytometry.
