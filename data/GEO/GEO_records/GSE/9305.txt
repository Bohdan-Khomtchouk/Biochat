TITLE
Gene expression profiles of primary tumors with radiotherapy and lung metastases in mouse squamous cell carcinoma model.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine whether the local carbon ion radiotherapy affects the characteristics of the metastatic tumors, the expression profiles of the primary tumors and the lung metastases were studied in a mouse squamous cell carcinoma model by applying local radiotherapy with no irradiation (negative control), gamma-ray irradiation (reference beam), and carbon-ion irradiation. Keywords: mouse, squamous cell carcinoma, primary tumor, lung metastases, radiotherapy, carbon ion, gamma ray
