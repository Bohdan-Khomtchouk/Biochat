TITLE
Gene expression profiles of primary tumors with radiotherapy and lung metastases in mouse squamous cell carcinoma model.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine whether the local carbon ion radiotherapy affects the characteristics of the metastatic tumors, the expression profiles of the primary tumors and the lung metastases were studied in a mouse squamous cell carcinoma model by applying local radiotherapy with no irradiation (negative control), gamma-ray irradiation (reference beam), and carbon-ion irradiation. Keywords: mouse, squamous cell carcinoma, primary tumor, lung metastases, radiotherapy, carbon ion, gamma ray

DESIGN
A highly metastatic mouse squamous cell carcinoma NR-S1 was implanted into the hind leg of synergetic C3H/HeNrs mice and irradiated with 5 Gy of carbon ion beam. 8 Gy of gamma ray was used as a reference beam. At 2 weeks after the irradiation, the lung tissue was sampled. In order to collect samples of primary tumors, the tumors were implanted in other mice and irradiated in the same manner, and the primary tumors were collected at 1 week after the irradiation. The tumor cells of the primary and metastatic tumors were collected by laser microdissection, and oligonucleotide microarray analysis of the irradiated primary tumors and the metastatic tumors were all performed in comparison to the non-irradiated primary tumor by two-color methods.
