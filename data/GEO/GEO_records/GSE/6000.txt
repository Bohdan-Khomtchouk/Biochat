TITLE
miRNA expression during UCB-CD34 cells erythropoiesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the miRNA expression in ex vivo human erythroid cultures from umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived CD34 cells.  Hypothetically, the decline of certain miRNAs may promote erythropoiesis by unblocking expression of key functional proteins while the up-regulation of other miRNAs may block commitment to non-erythroid lineages. Therefore, discovering the patterns and sequence of miRNA expression during hematopoietic differentiation will provide insights about the functional roles of these tiny noncoding genes. Keywords: miRNA expression profiling
