Nuclear Receptor Corepressors are Required for the Histone Deacetylase Activity of HDAC3 In Vivo (Microarray)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the hepatic gene expression changes in NCOR and SMRT DADm-mutated mice.

DESIGN
10-12 wk male mouse liver for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to find differential gene changes between wt and NS-DADm mice.
