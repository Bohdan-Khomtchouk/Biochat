TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Dermatomyositis Skin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to use global gene expression analysis to determine major functional pathways and genes dysregulated in the skin of active rashes of dermatomyositis patients.  These data will be used to help assign a diagnosis to skin biopsies from patients with rashes that are not clearly dermatomyositis.  In addition, we will correlate gene expression changes with specific histopathologic changes in skin biopsies that are taken adjacent to those analyzed for gene expression analysis.  Finally, these data will be used to search for genes and pathways that are associated with clinical outcomes and autoantibody status in this cohort of patients.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of healthy donor and dermatomyositis patient skin biopsy specimens.
