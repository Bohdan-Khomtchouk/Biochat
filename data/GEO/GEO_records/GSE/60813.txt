TITLE
Expression microarray analysis of HaCaT epidermal keratinocyte treated with AdcaRAS/dnRAS, p53 siRNA, and/or TGF-beta

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that activation of Ras and TGF-β pathways strengthens the binding of p63 to its genomic sites and modulates the expression of p63 target genes. Our findings support a model of mutual inhibition between ΔNp63α, DUSP6 and mutant p53 downstream of oncogenic Ras and TGF-β.

DESIGN
We used expression microarrays to evaluate the effect of caRAS/dnRAS, p53 siRNA, and/or TGF-beta in HaCaT epidermal keratinocyte.
