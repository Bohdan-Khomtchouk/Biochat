TITLE
Expression data from mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LASS2 is expressed mostly in human liver. We explored roles of LASS2 in pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis. Hepatocyte-specific LASS2 knockout (LASS2-/-) mice were generated using Cre-LoxP system. LASS2-/- and wild-type (WT) mice were fed with chow or high-fat diet (HFD). We performed global gene expression analysis for the mice livers in accordance with standard Affymetrix protocols to explore signaling pathways involved by LASS2 deficiency.

DESIGN
The livers were obtained from four groups of mice for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The four groups of mice were as follows, WT chow: Wild-type mice fed by standard chow diet, LASS2-/- chow: LASS2-/- mice fed by standard chow diet, WT HFD: Wild-type mice fed by high-fat diet, LASS2-/- HFD: LASS2-/- mice fed by high-fat diet.
