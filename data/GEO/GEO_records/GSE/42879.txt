TITLE
Overexpression of GATA1 confers resistance to chemotherapy in acute megakaryocytic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression study of shRNA knockdown of GATA1 in the megakaryoblastic cell line Meg01.

DESIGN
Cell culture samples from two Meg01 clones (GATA1 4-14 and GATA1 5-13) were compared against a negative control infection sample (GATA1-neg). Two dye-swap microarrays were completed for each clone.
