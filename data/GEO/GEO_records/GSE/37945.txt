TITLE
Effect of HIC1 and miR-212/132 expression on MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the target of miR-212, miR-132 and HIC1, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling on the human breast cancer MCF7 cells.

DESIGN
To generate miR-212/132 or HIC1 inducible MCF7 cells, doxycycline-dependent miR-212/132 or HIC1 gene expression system was used. Either Tet-ON miR-212/132 MCF7 or Tet-ON HIC1 MCF7 were treated with 1Î¼g/ml of Doxycycline for 36 hours with EMEM containing 0.01 mg/ml bovine insulin and 10% FCS. Two independent experiments were performed.
