TITLE
Influence of type I Interferons on function of splenic conventional dendritic cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Type I Interferons encompasses a large family of closely related cytokines comprising of at least 13 IFN-α isotypes and single IFN-β. Both IFN-α and IFN-β exert their activity through a common receptor IFNAR. Type I Interferons have broad regulatory effects and various subtypes of dendritic cells are influenced by this cytokines. In our study we asked question whether the low, constitutive levels of type I Interferons produced under steady state conditions are important for proper function of splenic conventional dendritic cells.
