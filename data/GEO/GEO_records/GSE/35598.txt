TITLE
Osmolality as a major regulator of the transcriptome and metabolome in kidney collecting duct cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that altered extracellular osmolality per se could affect the transcriptome of the kidney inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells, and hence it might change renal tubular function. The data sets of transcriptomics were incorporated into the " omic " data sets of metabolomics. Primary cultured IMCD cells of rat kidney were grown in hyperosmolar culture medium (640 mOsm/KgH2O) for 4 d, and then the cells were cultured in the medium with either reduced (300 mOsm/KgH2O) or the same osmolality for 1 or 2 d more.

DESIGN
Osmolality stress response. Total RNA from IMCD cells exposed to 300 or 640 mOsm/KgH2O for 24 h (n=3 in each group, 24 h-300 and 24 h-640) or for 48 h (n=3 in each group, 48 h-300 and 48 h-640) after a 4-day-culture in culture media (640 mOsm/KgH2O) were subjected to transcriptome analysis (Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Rat Gene 1.0 ST array containing 29,215 gene-level probe sets) to profile the gene expression at the mRNA level.
