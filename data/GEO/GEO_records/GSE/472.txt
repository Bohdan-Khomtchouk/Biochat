Congestive heart failure in dog

SUMMARY
Canine tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy caused by several weeks of rapid ventricular pacing is a well-established animal model of congestive heart failure.  However, little is known about the underlying changes in gene expression that occur in the canine myocardium after the induction of heart failure.  This project aims to compare expression profiles in left ventricular free wall samples from control dogs and dogs with pacing-induced heart failure on the custom MuscleChip. Keywords: other
