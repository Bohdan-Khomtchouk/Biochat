TITLE
Transcriptomic characterization of the diabetic retinal response to chronic insulin treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify alterations associated with diabetes-induced functional dysregulation of the retina and the effects of chronic insulin therapy.  Transcriptional profiling through microarray analysis was analyzed to find mRNA targets of interest in diabetic samples, as well as in the insulin treated group.   Verification of targets shown to be unrecovered in the insulin group was validated.

DESIGN
Diabetes was induced in Sprague-Dawley male rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) by intraperitoneal injection of 65 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ)(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 10mM sodium citrate pH 4.5 vehicle. Control rats were injected with an equal dose of vehicle only.  Rats had free access to food and water, and were maintained on a 12 hour light/dark cycle. Blood glucose level and body weight were measured 6 days post-STZ or vehicle injection, and biweekly throughout the experiment. Only rats with blood glucose levels > 250 mg/dL at the time of the original test and throughout the experiment were included in the diabetic groups.  The insulin treatment group received one 26mg subcutaneous pellet (LinShin Canada, Scarborough, Canada) delivered via trocar 6 weeks post-STZ injection. An additional 26 mg implant was introduced when body weight exceeded 300 g or when midday non-fasting blood glucose exceeded 250 mg/dL.  At the time of retina harvest, rats were given a lethal dose of pentobarbital, 100 mg/kg, (Ovation Pharmaceuticals Inc., Deerfield, IL) by intraperitoneal injection and sacrificed by decapitation. Retinas were rapidly excised snap- frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent experimentation.
