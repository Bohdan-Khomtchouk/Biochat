TITLE
Anti-proliferative tumor suppressor-like activity of mir-9 overexpression and identification of novel mir-9 targets by trancription profiling in breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of genome-wide effects (transcriptome profiling) and direct targets of mir-9 in MCF-7 cells transfected with mir-9 in two dosages (1X and 2X)

DESIGN
Following transfections of mir-9 or control miRNA mimics, total RNA was isolated and microarray profiling was performed.
