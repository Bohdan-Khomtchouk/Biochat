TITLE
Identification of dysregulated genes in 3D culture of BRIP1 knockdown cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify down-stream target genes of BRIP1 during acinar morphogenesis of human mammary epithelial cells, we carried out microarray analysis of BRIP1 knockdown cells.

DESIGN
Changes in gene expression in 3D culture of non-target and BRIP1 shRNA-transduced cells were analyzed. Samples were harvested from three different clones of non-target and BRIP1 shRNA-transduced cells at three time points, 4, 8, and 12 days, after cell seeding in Matrigel.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
