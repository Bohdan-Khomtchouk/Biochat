TITLE
The DNA Double-Strand Break Response Is Abnormal in Myeloblasts From Patients With Therapy-Related Acute Myeloid Leukemia [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to examine if the upregulation of DNA repair genes on chromosome 8 was associated with the abnormal DSB phenotype observed in trisomy 8 (defined by array CGH or cytogenetics), we compared the mRNA levels of DNA repair genes on chromosome 8 in trisomy 8 t-AML patients versus normal t-AML gammaH2AX responders using gene expression array data.

DESIGN
Bone marrow cells taken directly from patients after written informed consent were cryopreserved, RNA extracted, and microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix U133plus2 chips.
