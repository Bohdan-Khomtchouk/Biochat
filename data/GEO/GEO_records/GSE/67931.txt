TITLE
Disruption of Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2 scaffold suppresses colon cancer proliferation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A key function of Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2) is spatial organization of signaling proteins to facilitate signal transduction. The role of NHERF2 in cancer progress is not well understood. This study determines how loss of NHERF2 alter colon cancer progress.

DESIGN
We show that loss of NHERF2 decreases colon cancer cell proliferation. To compare the effects of NHERF2 and LPA2 at the molecular level, HCT116 colon cancer xenograft with knockdown of NHERF2 or LPA2 was analyzed by RNAseq. Please note that standard cufflinks/cuffdiff output files are provided in the compressed tar files as processed data and Cufflinks/Cuffdiff output file content/formats are described at: (also included in the 'readme.txt' file)
