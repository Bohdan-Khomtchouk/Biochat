TITLE
Gene expression profiling of CD45+/Sca1+ cells isolated from the bone marrow and the muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The BM-derived CD45+/Sca1+ cells are haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells that have the ability to circulate and migrate and engraft to the muscle tissue, and therefore they are of particular interest. Notably, these cells retain their haematopoietic potential, as revealed both by in vitro and in vivo assays; but they also acquire myogenic potential, as shown by their ability to participate in muscle regeneration. Whether, this latter remarkable ability is the result of the reprogramming of the BM-CD45+/Sca1+ cells and the activation of a myogenic molecular program within these cells, remains controversial. This study aims to clarify this aspect of the process, investigating the role of the muscle microenviroment and key myogenic transcription factors. Keywords: CD45+/Sca1+ cells, BM, muscle

DESIGN
CD45+/Sca1+ cells isolated from the BM or the muscle were processed fresh and their RNA was extracted. Moreover, CD45+/Sca1+ cells isolated from the muscle of BM transplanted or untransplanted mice after injury with Cardiotoxin were processed fresh and their RNA was extracted.
