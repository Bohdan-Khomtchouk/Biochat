TITLE
Progesterone Regulation of Extracellular Vesicles in the Uterine Luminal Fluid of Sheep (miRNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Progesterone (P4) acts via the endometrium to modify the uterine environment and promotes conceptus growth for elongation and pregnancy establishment. Ewes were ovariectomized and treated with P4 for 14 days or P4 for 14 days and RU486, a progesterone receptor antagonist, from days 8 to 14. Small RNA sequencing of endometrium and EVs from the uterine lumen detected expression of 768 miRNAs and P4 regulation of 9 endometrial and 7 extracellular vesicle miRNAs.

DESIGN
Endometrium from P4-treated (n=5) or P4+RU486-treated ewes (n=5); Extracellular vesicles from the uterine lumen of P4-treated (n=4) or P4+RU486-treated ewes.

PLATFORM
GPL22509 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Ovis aries)
