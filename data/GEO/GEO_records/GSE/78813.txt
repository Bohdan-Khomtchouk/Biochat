TITLE
Identifying Bit1-regulated genes in the EC9706 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further verify the underlying functions of Bit1 in ESCC, therefore, in the present study, we examined Bit1 expression in a panel of ESCC cell lines, and investigated the effects of Bit1 knockdown on tumor growth, migration and invasion as well as cell apoptosis in ESCC, and further preliminarily elucidated the possible molecular mechanisms. All data presented herein suggest Bit1 may be a promising molecular target for the therapy of ESCC, and thus intervention of Bit1 may lead to better therapeutic outcomes for the patients with ESCC.

DESIGN
EC9706 cells were harvested 72 h after transfection with pSilencer3.1-H1 -neo-Bit1-shRNA or pSilencer3.1-H1-neo-negative-shRNA. Approximate 1 × 106 cells from each sample were subjected to gene microarray assay. Total RNA was extracted  was extracted for analysis.
