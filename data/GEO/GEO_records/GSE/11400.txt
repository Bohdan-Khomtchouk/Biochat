TITLE
Gene Expression Data in R26Pax3 palates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying palate development by persistent expression in R26Pax3 mice and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: palate development

DESIGN
Palatal shelves were dissected at E14.5 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Wild type and R26Pax3/Pax3 littermates were used.

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
