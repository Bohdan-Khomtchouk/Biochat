TITLE
Global MicroRNA Expression Profiling Identifies MiR-210 Associated with Tumor Proliferation, Invasion and Poor Clinical Outcome in Breast Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to improve our understanding of breast cancer (BC) biology and its prognostication, global miRNA expression profiling was performed using microarray technology on systemically untreated BC patients with long-term follow up.

DESIGN
In this study, global miRNA expression profiling using microarray technology was conducted on 56 systemically untreated BC patients with long-term follow up. The arrays used for miRNAs expression profiling comprise a total of 640 probes targeting 328 human miRNAs (hsa-miRs), as well as mouse and rat miRNAs, from the miRBase Sequence Database version 8.0.
