TITLE
Expression data from Mouse Lymphoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have made use of the Eμ-myc transgenic mouse, a model for the study of B-cell lymphoma development that is initiated through a defined genetic alteration, to explore the contributions of additional somatic alterations that contribute to the heterogeneity of the resulting tumors.  As one example of such heterogeneity, we have focused on the observation that lymphomas develop in Eμ-myc mice with a variable time of onset.  Twenty-five early-onset, 25 late-onset lymphomas and 10 normal samples were each assayed on an Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array. Keywords: Myc induced lymphomas with various time-of-onset

DESIGN
To focus on events that might distinguish early and late onset tumors, we performed genome-wide expression analyses of early- and late-onset lymphomas from Eµ-myc transgenic mice using expression microarray techniques.  Total RNA was prepared from 25 early-onset (32-76 days, 62.6+/-11.0 days, median 65 days), 25 late-onset tumors (253-649 days, 391.5+/-101.8 days, median 398 days) and 10 normal tissues (lymph nodes or spleen, 38-438 days, 181.0+/-175.2 days, median 62.5 days) and subjected to Affymetrix GeneChip analyses.
