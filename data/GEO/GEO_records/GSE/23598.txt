TITLE
Global gene expression profiles of MT knockout and wild-type mice in the condition of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The present study was designed using MT knockout mice in concert with genomic approaches to explore the possible molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the protective effects of MT against DOX cardiotoxicity. MT-Ⅰ/Ⅱ null (MT-/-) mice and corresponding wild-type mice (MT+/+) were administrated with a single dose of DOX (15 mg/kg, i.p.) or an equal volume of saline. Animals were sacrificed on the 4th day after DOX administration and samples were collected for further analyses. Global gene expression profiles of cardiac mRNA from two genotype mice revealed that 381 characteristically MT-responsive genes were identified between MT+/+ mice and MT-/- mice in response to DOX, including fos, ucp3, car3, atf3, map3k6, etc.. Functional analysis implied MAPK signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, etc. might be involved to mediate the protection of DOX cardiomyopathy by MT. Results from the present study not only validated the previously reported possible mechanisms of MT protection against DOX toxicity, but also provided new clues into the molecular mechanisms involved in this process.

DESIGN
Male MT+/+ & MT-/- mice (6-8 weeks old) were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups and administrated with a single dose of DOX (15 mg/kg, i.p.) or an equal volume of normal saline solution (NS) respectively. Animals were sacrificed on the 4th day after DOX injection, and samples were collected for further microarray analyses.
