TITLE
Expression data of RANKL-deficient CCR6+ ILC3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to determine transcriptional differences between CCR6+ ILC3s isolated from RorccreTnfsf11fl/fl and Tnfsf11fl/fl small intestine lamina propria.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from CCR6+ ILC3s isolated from adult mouse RorcCreTnfsf11fl/fl or Tnfsf11fl/fl small intestine lamina propria.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
