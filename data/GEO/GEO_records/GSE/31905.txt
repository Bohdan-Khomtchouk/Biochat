TITLE
Gene expression profiling of colorectal carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the prognostic gene expression markers in early primary colorectal carcinomas, we analyzed genome-wide gene expression profiles using Agilent 4x44K oligonucleotide microarrays. By SVM we selected a gene signature which discriminated patients which later developed metastasis from patients with a good prognosis. Most of the genes that were found to be informative for patients’ distant recurrence were related to the patient’s immune response. Furthermore, our microarray data confirmed the specificity and sensitivity of the angiogenesis-related genes signature.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of 67 specimens of 55 colorectal carcinomas, 7 normal and 5 adenomas  was studied.
