TITLE
Arabidopsis buds: dyt1 vs Col; tdf1 vs Col; ams vs Col; ms188 vs Col

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis buds comparing dyt1, tdf1, ams, ms188 mutants with wild type (Col ecotype), respectively. Goal was to determine the differential expression genes between the buds of mutant and wild type.

DESIGN
Biological replicates: 3 replicates of mutant buds, 3 replicates of wildtype buds.

PLATFORM
