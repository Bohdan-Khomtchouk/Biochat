TITLE
HCT 116 cells expressing Fucci (fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator); G1 phase vs. S/G2/M phase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fucci-expressing HCT116 were inoculated into subcutaneous tissue or cecum of NOD/SCID mice. Four weeks after inoculation, Fucci green (mAG; S/G2/M) and red (mKO2;G1) expressing cells were isolated from implanted tumors by FACSAria sorting (BD, Biosciences). Comparative analyses among green and red cells cultured in vivo were performed to elucidate the molecular basis of cell cycle-dependent motility control mechanism.

DESIGN
The labeled cRNAs were hybridized on 4X44K Agilent Whole Human Genome dual colour Microarrays (G4112F) in two dye swap experiments, resulting in four individual microarrays.
