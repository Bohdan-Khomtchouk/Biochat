TITLE
ALDH1A3-mediated gene expression in MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-MB-468 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the effect ALDH1A3 expression on global gene expression in MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-MB-468 cells

DESIGN
In MDA-MB-231 cells, ALDH1A3 was overexperssed (have low endogenous levels of ALDH1A3) and compared to MSCV empty vector control. In MDA-MB-468 cells that have high endogenous levels of ALDH1A3, ALDH1A3 expresion was reduced with ALDH1A3 shRNA1 and compared to scramble shRNA control.
