TITLE
Analysis for expression of genes in human leukemic cell line Jurkat treated with Me6TREN or Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA from cells treated with or without small molecule Me6TREN for 24 hour was analyzed for differential gene expression. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that specific genes were up- or down-regulated via certain signaling pathways. Results provide important information to study the response of cellular functions triggered by Me6TREN.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human Jurkat cells subjected to 24 hours in vitro Me6TREN and PBS-treated control cells was amplified and hybridized to Illumina HT12 human whole-genome arrays.
