TITLE
Gene expression profiling of MRC-5 cells treated with 100 ug/mL regular-length pristine SWCNTs for 72 h

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A total of 30 genes were up-regulated and 19 genes were down-regulated > 1.5-fold following 100 ug/mL regular-length pristine SWCNTs treatment

DESIGN
Microarray experiments were performed in duplicate as follows: MRC-5 cells were treated with 100 ug/mL regular-length pristine SWCNTs or control vehicle for 72 h. Total RNA from cells was extracted using Qiagen RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturersâ€™ protocol. RNA purity was examined by spectrophotometric determination at 260/280 nm. The microarray hybridizations were carried out using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
