TITLE
Genome-Wide Transcriptional Effects of the Anti-Cancer Agent Camptothecin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The anti-cancer drug camptothecin inhibits replication and transcription by trapping DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) covalently to DNA in a “cleavable complex”. To examine the effects of camptothecin on RNA synthesis genome-wide we used Bru-Seq and show that camptothecin treatment affected transcription initiation, elongation, termination, splicing and enhancer activity. Following removal of camptothecin, transcription spread as a wave from the 5’-end of genes with no recovery of transcription apparent from RNA polymerases stalled in the body of genes. As a result, camptothecin preferentially inhibited the expression of large genes such as proto-oncogenes, and anti-apoptotic genes while smaller ribosomal protein genes, pro-apoptotic genes and p53 target genes showed relative higher expression. In addition, a set of mitotic regulator genes and histone genes were inhibited in a size-independent manner. Cockayne syndrome group B fibroblasts showed a very similar RNA synthesis recovery profile to normal fibroblasts suggesting that transcription-coupled repair is not involved in the repair of transcription-blocking TOP1 lesions. These findings of the effects of camptothecin on transcription have important implications for its anti-cancer activities and may aid in the design of improved combinatorial treatments involving Top1 poisons.

DESIGN
Analysis of the effect of Camptothecin (CPT) on transcription. Normal fibroblasts and Cockayne syndrome group B fibroblasts were exposed to CPT for 60 minutes, after which a washout was performed. Nascent RNA was labeled using bromouridine for 15 minutes starting at time points: 1) 15 minutes before the washout; 2) Immediately after the washout; 3) 15 minutes after the washout. Test samples are compared to control cells that were not exposed to CPT.
