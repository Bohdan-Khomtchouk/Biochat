TITLE
Expression data from vehicle or PD-0332991 treated human T-ALL lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cyclin D3 is critical hematopoiesis and loss of cyclin D3 leads to resistance to transformation of bone marrow progenitors by Notch1-IC. We used a small molecule targeting cyclin D3:CDK4/6 activity to study whether its inhibition is an effective therapeutic strategy. We analyzed T-ALL lines in vitro with PD-0332991 or vehicle control to determine genes affected by the drug.

DESIGN
CEM, Jurkat, DND41, and CUTL-1 cell lines were treated with 1 uM PD-0332991 or DMSO for 15 hours prior to RNA extraction and hybridization to Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Affymetrix arrays.
