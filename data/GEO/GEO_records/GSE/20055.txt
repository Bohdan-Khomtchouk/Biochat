TITLE
HLA-B35 upregulates ET-1 and downregulates eNOS via ER stresss response in endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The presence of the HLA-B35 allele has emerged as an important risk factor for the development of isolated pulmonary hypertension (iPHT) in patients with Scleroderma (SSc), however the mechanisms underlying this association have not been fully elucidated. The goal of our study was to determine the molecular mechanisms that mediate the biological effects of HLA-B35 in endothelial cells (ECs). Our data demonstrate that HLA-B35 expression at the physiological levels using via adenoviral vector resulted in a significantly increased endothelin-1 (ET-1) and a significantly decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, HLA-B35 greatly upregulated expression of cytoplasmic chaperones, including heat shock proteins (HSPs) HSP70 (HSPA1A and HSPA1B) and HSP40 (DNAJB1 and DNAJB9), suggesting that HLA-B35 induced the ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) in ECs. Examination of selected mediators of the UPR response, including BiP (GRP78), CHOP (GADD153), ERO1 (endoplasmic reticulum oxidase) and PDI (protein disulfide isomerase) has revealed a consistent increase of BiP expression levels. Accordingly, Thapsigargin (TG), a known ER stress inducer, stimulated ET-1 mRNA and protein levels in ECs. This study suggests that HLA-B35 could contribute to endothelial cell dysfunction via ER stress mediated induction of ET-1 in patients with PHT.

DESIGN
Three samples: endothelial cells transduced with Adenovirus GFP; cells without gene insert, cell with HLA-B35, and cells with HLA-B8.
