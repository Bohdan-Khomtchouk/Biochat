TITLE
ChIP-chip from Drosophila egg chambers using ORC2 antibody

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) followed by hybridization to genome-wide tiling microarrays demonstrated that ORC localizes to the six Drosophila amplicons in follicle cells (DAFC) as well as other non-amplified loci

DESIGN
Comparison of ORC2 ChIP sample compared to input DNA for two different Drosophila strains and two developmental stage samples
