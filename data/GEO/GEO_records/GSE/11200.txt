TITLE
Expression data from malting barley seeds

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Malting is seed germination under strictly controlled environmental conditions. Malting quality is a complex phenotype that combines a large number of interrelated components, each of which shows complex inheritance. Currently, only a few genes involved in determining malting quality have been characterized. This study combined transcript profiling with phenotypic correlations to identify candidate genes for malting quality. We used the Barley1 GeneChipÂ® array to identify differentially expressed genes in four malting stages relative to dry seed in the barley variety Morex, and to identify differentially expressed genes among four barley varieties. Keywords: time course and genotype differences
