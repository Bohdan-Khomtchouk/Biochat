TITLE
Microarray profiling for differential gene expression in PSMG-hCG stimulated pre-ovulatory ovarian follicles of Chinese Erhualian and Large White sows

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The Chinese Erhualian is one of the most prolific pig breeds in the world, which farrows at least five more piglets per litter than Western pig breeds partly due to a greater ovulation rate. Differences in the transcriptome of Chinese Erhualian and Large White ovaries directly result in variation of ovulation rate. To understand the molecular basis related to ovulation rate in Chinese indigenous and Western breeds, samples were collected and used to hybridized. This study reveals many potential avenues of investigation for seeking new insights into ovarian physiology and the genetic control of reproduction.

DESIGN
Expression profiling experiments were conducted to identify differentially expressed genes in ovarian follicles at the preovulatory stage of a PMSG-hCG stimulated estrous cycle from 3 Chinese Erhualian and 3 Large White cycling sows by using the Affymetrix Porcine Genechipâ„¢.
