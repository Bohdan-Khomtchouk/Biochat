TITLE
IAH Salmonella infected chicken caecal contents

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
RNA from in vitro grown Salmonella typhimurium is compared with RNA extracted from Salmonella typhimurium from infected chick caecums using a common DNA reference. Keywords: Disease state analysis, infected versus uninfected, common reference

DESIGN
Five replicates from infected chick caecal contents compared to a common reference. Three replicates from in vitro grown Salmonella compared to a common reference. The common reference was genomic DNA and always occupies the Cy3 channel (channel 2).
