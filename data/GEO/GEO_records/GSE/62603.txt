TITLE
Epidermal overexpression of ∆NLef1 leads to deregulation of epidermal stem cell fate.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In adult K14ΔNLef1 mouse, the overexpression of ∆NLef1, a B-catenin dominat negative, in basal keratinocytes leads to the conversion of hair follicles into multilayered epithelial cysts and ectopic sebaceous gland. To uncover in vivo changes in gene expression associated to ∆NLef1 activity, we compared the expression profiles of unfractionated  keratinocytes  in wild type and K14ΔNLef1 transgenic mice. Cells were collected from 9.5 week old mice, when the hair follicle are in the resting (telogen) phase of the hair growth cycle. At this stage the ∆NLef1 phenotype is not yet evident enabling us to detect early molecular events.

DESIGN
We compared the expression profiles of unfractionated keratinocytes in wild type and K14ΔNLef1 transgenic 9.5 week old mice. Three biological replicates for each cell population were analyzed.
