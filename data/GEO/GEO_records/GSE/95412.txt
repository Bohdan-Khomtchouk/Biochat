TITLE
Identification of diverse target RNAs that are functionally regulated by human Pumilio proteins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq to measure transcript levels in human cells with the PUM1 and PUM2 proteins knocked down; by analyzing the differences in transcript abundances between those conditions, we were able to identify 927 targets showing significant changes in the presence of the PUM knockdown.

DESIGN
Comparative expression profiling via RNA seq between cells undergoing shRNA-mediated PUM knockdown and cells treated with a non-target control
