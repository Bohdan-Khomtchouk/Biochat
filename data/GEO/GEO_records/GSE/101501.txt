TITLE
MicroRNA microarray of Haemonchus contortus lifecycle stages and gut tissue

ORGANISM
Haemonchus contortus

SUMMARY
Examined expression of microRNAs in different life-cycle stages and gut tissue of the pathogenic nematode Haemonchus contortus and identified differentially expressed miRNAs. Custom array contained probes to 609 Haemonchus contortus miRNA sequence (all mature and start miRNAs identified by Winter et al., 2012, BMC Genomics13:4;  DOI: 10.1186/1471-2164-13-4)  and all C. elegans sequences in miRBase release 16

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were used for all stages and gut, except for L4 stage, where two were used. Parasites were Haemonchus contortus ISE(MHco3) strain
