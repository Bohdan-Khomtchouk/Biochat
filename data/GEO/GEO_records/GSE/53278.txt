TITLE
Profiling of miRNA expression of HeLa cells infected with Salmonella Typhimurium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified miRNAs differentially regulated upon Salmonella infection by comparative deep-sequencing analysis of cDNA libraries prepared from the small RNA population (10â€“29 nt) of HeLa cells infected with Salmonella (20 hpi) and mock-treated cells. Considering that at a MOI of 25 Salmonella is internalized in only 10-15% of the HeLa cells, we separated the fraction of cells which had internalized Salmonella (Salmonella+) from the bystander fraction (Salmonella-) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and extended the analysis of miRNA changes to these samples. Interestingly, we observed that Salmonella infection induces a significant decrease in the expression of all the detected members of the miR-15 family

DESIGN
miRNA profiles of HeLa cells infected with Salmonella Typhimurium were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
