TITLE
microRNA/UCR expression profiling of human Barrett's carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To test the hypothesis that there are specific miRNA/UCR expression signature which characterizes Barrett's esophagus development and progression, we performed miRNA/UCR microarray analysis comparing normal esophageal squamous epithelium with all the phenotypic lesions seen in the Barrett's carcinogenic process

DESIGN
miRNA/UCR microarray analysis was performed in a series of 14 normal esophageal squamous epithelium samples, 14 Barrett's mucosa samples, 7 low-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia samples, 5 high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia samples and 11 Barrett's adenocarcinoma samples
