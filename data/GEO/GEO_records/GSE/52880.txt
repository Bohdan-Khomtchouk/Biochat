TITLE
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 cells: wildtype vs. ΔfabR mutant

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 cells comparing wildtype with ΔfabR mutant. Salmonella strains were cultured under free-living TSB conditions (TSB 1/20, 200 rpm, 25 °C) for 6h (ca. 2 x 108 cells/ml).

DESIGN
two strain experiment. One biological repeat for each strain. Hybridizations were performed in color flip.

PLATFORM
GPL18010 S. Typhimurium arrays 70-mer oligos representing all LT2 annotated genes (Operon)
