TITLE
CGH Analysis of Murine Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Control vs. Tumors overexpressing Aurora Kinase A

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genomic alterationsin murine skin Squamous Cell Carcinoma(SCC) generated were analyzed from mice that expressed human Aurora Kinase A under control of Keratin 14 driven and RU486 inducible GLP65 activator protein.  Monogenic GLP65 (control) and bigenic GLP65; Aurora-A mice were treated with DMBA once and thrice per week with TPA and RU486 to generate SCCs.

DESIGN
Two conditions experiment: 12 control and 11 Aurora-A tumors were analyzed.
