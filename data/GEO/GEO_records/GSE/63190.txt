TITLE
High throughput analysis of three human adipose cell lines PAZ6, SGBS and SW872

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report molecular characterization of human brown and white adipocytes. We showed that PAZ6 and SW872 cells exhibit classical molecular and phenotypic markers of brown and white adipocytes, respectively. However, SGBS cells presented a versatile phenotype of adipocyte

DESIGN
Sequencing of three human adipocytes cell lines (SGBS, SW872 and PAZ6) in undifferentiated and differentiated stages.
