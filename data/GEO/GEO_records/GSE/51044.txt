TITLE
Gamma-secretase inhibitor plus fludarabine in CLL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Combination of GSI with fludarabine has a synergistic antileukemic effect in primary NOTCH1-mutated CLL cells We used microarrays to detail the mechanism of synergy of GSI and fludarabine combination in NOTCH1-mutated CLL cells

DESIGN
Global RNA expression in CLL primary cells treated with  GSI, fludarabine and the combination at 48 hours of treatment
