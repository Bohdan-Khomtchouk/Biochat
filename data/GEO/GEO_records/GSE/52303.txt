TITLE
Premature termination of in vivo reprogramming leads to cancer development through altered epigenetic regulation [RRBS]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report a reprogrammable mouse system in which reprogramming factor expression in vivo can be controlled temporally by treatment with doxycycline (Dox).  Transient expression of reprogramming factors in vivo results in tumor development in various tissues, consisting of undifferentiated dysplastic cells.  We analyzed the kidney tumors developed in reprogrammable mice for global gene expressions and DNA methylations.

DESIGN
Reprogrammable mice at 4 weeks of age were treated with Dox for 7 days followed by the withdrawal.  Seven days after the withdrawal, kidney tumors were analyzed for gene expressions and DNA methylations with microarray and RRBS method, respectively.  Normal kidney tissue at the same age and ES cells were analyzed as controls.  To examine the early changes of gene expressions, transgene-expressing kidney cells were FACS sorted and they are utilized for microarray analysis.  Primary liver tumors in reprogrammable mice and transplanted secondary kidney tumors in the subcutaneous tissues of immnodeficient mice were also analyzed for gene expressions.
