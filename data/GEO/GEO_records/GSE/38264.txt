TITLE
In vivo disruption of Rb-E2F-Ezh2 signaling loop causes bladder cancer development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bladder cancer (BC) is a highly prevalent human disease in which Rb pathway inactivation and epigenetic alterations are common events. However, the connection between these two processes is still poorly understood. Here we show that the in vivo inactivation of all Rb family genes in the mouse urothelium is sufficient to initiate BC development. The characterization of the mouse tumors revealed multiple molecular features of human BC, including the activation of E2F transcription factor and subsequent Ezh2 expression, and the activation of several signaling pathways previously identified as highly relevant in urothelial tumors. Whole transcriptional characterizations of the mouse bladder tumors revealed a significant overlap with human BC samples, and a predominant role for Ezh2 in the downregulation of gene expression programs. Importantly, we determined that in human superficial BC patients, the increased tumor recurrence and progression in these recurrences is associated with increased E2F and Ezh2 expression and Ezh2-mediated gene expression repression. Collectively, our studies provide a genetically defined model for human high-grade superficial BC and demonstrate the existence of an Rb-E2F-Ezh2 axis in bladder whose disruption can promote tumor development.

DESIGN
Gene expression was analyzed in normal bladder and bladder tumours, both in humans and in transgenic mice.
