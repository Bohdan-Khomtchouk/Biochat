TITLE
Exploring the response of Kluyveromyces lactis to arsenite and peroxide stress and the role of the transcription factor KlYap8 and KlYap1

ORGANISM
Kluyveromyces lactis

SUMMARY
The transcriptional response of  K. lactis yeast was investigated following exposure to sodium arsenite (As(III)) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH). We compared the genome-wide expression profile of Klyap8âˆ† mutant cells to that of the wild type.

DESIGN
3 conditions experiment  :  untreated (UT) , or  exposure to sodium arsenite (As (III))  or   to ter-butyl peroxide (t-BOOH) ; Four biological experiments with a dye switch for  Wild type cells Klwt (reference) and the yap8 mutant cells Klyap8D (test)

PLATFORM
GPL11307 Agilent custom Kluyveromyces lactis 11K Array [G2509F]
