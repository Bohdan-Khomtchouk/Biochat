TITLE
Characterization of a TUTase/nuclease complex required for Drosophila gametogenesis

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Total RNAs were cloned from wt, Dis3L2 and Tailor mutant testis tissues to study the role of Tailor and Dis3L2 TUTase/nuclease complex

DESIGN
Replicated total RNA samples from Dis3L2 and Tailor single mutant, and Dis3L2/Tailor double mutant and WT (w1118) testes
