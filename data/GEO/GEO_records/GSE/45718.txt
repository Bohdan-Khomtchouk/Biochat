TITLE
Expression data from early and late vegetative stages from rice hybrid and its parents

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
Heterosis is a complex phenomenon governed by many phenotypes in combination. In comparative account of the different stages a better understanding regulating this phenomenon in terms of gene action can be ascertained. We used microarrays to ascertained the kind and extent of gene actions in the different developmental stages to reach to the conclusion of contribution of different mode of gene actions.

DESIGN
A total of 45 arrays representing in triplicates of each five developmental stages of an Indica hybrid and its parents five vegetative developmental stages. Indica hybrid (MRP5401) has been take along with its parents (female parent PMS80 (B Line) and male parent PR319 (R line)) and five stages are selected  for rna extraction and hybridization on Affymetirx microarray comprising young leaf (Leaves of 14-days-old seedling), young root (Roots of 14-days-old seedlings), Leaves of 40-60-days-old plants, Roots of 40-60-days-old plants and Flag Leaves of 90-days-old plants. Further these stages are named accordingly as YL_B, YL_H, YL_R (Leaves of 14-days-old seedlings of B parent, hybrid and R parent), YR_B, YR_H, YR_R (Roots of 14-days-old seedlings of B parent, hybrid and R parent), ML_B, ML_H, ML_R (Leaves of 40-60-days-old plants of B parent, hybrid and R parent), BMR, HMR, RMR (Roots of 40-60-days-old plants of B parent, hybrid and R parent) and BFL, HFL, RFL (Flag leaves of 90-days-old B parent, hybrid and R parent).
