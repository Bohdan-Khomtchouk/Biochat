TITLE
Expression data from multiple myeloma cells treated with arsenic

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to examine changes in gene expression in multiple myeloma cell lines following treatment with arsenic trioxide and darinaparsin Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
Four multiple myeloma cell lines (U266, MM.1s, KMS11, 8226/S) were treated with either arsenic trioxide (ATO) for 6, 24, or 48 hours or darinaparsin (DAR) for 6 or 24 hours; RNA was extracted from treated and control cells for microarray analysis
