TITLE
Delineating the Transcriptional Network of Prognostic Gene Signatures Refines Treatment Recommendations for Lymph Node-negative Breast Cancer Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed Chip-Seq analyses of several DNA binding transcription factors predicted to function as " master transcriptional regulators " (MTRs) of breast cancer prognostic gene signatures in primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). These analyses demonstrated that these factors frequently co–bind the promoters of genes, the expression of which is associated with a proliferative phenotype and poor patient outcome. These data suggest that these predicted MTRs do indeed drive the expression of gene signatures associated with poor patient outcome in breast cancer.

DESIGN
Examination of the genome–wide binding of breast cancer prognostic/proliferative transcription factors in proliferating breast cells.
