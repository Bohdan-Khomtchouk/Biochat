TITLE
Impact of HP1gamma and HP1gamma S83 phosphorylation on the transcriptionnal effect of PMA stimulation of mouse fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have here followed the transcriptional effect of stimulation with the phorbol ester PMA in mouse fibroblasts from HP1gamma null mice recomplemented with either wild-type HP1gamma or an HP1g with an S83A mutation

DESIGN
Spontaneously immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts from HP1gamma null mice were used to stably integrate either an empty expression vector, or expression vectors for either WT or S83A mutant HP1gamma. These cells were then stimulated with PMA for 0 or 60 min. and used for transcriptome analysis by Next Generation sequencing.
