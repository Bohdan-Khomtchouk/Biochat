TITLE
LY294002 induced gene expression changes in Hodgkin lymphoma cell line KMH2.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated the effect of LY294002 on gene expression in Hodgkin lymphoma cell line KMH2 cells.

DESIGN
In experimental design, gene expression was going to be compared between LY294002-treated and DMSO-treated KMH2 cells in triplicates. However, one microarray had high background and therefore was excluded from further analysis.
