TITLE
Identification of cholangiocarcinoma-like gene expression traits in hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CC), and mixed type of combined HCC and CC (CHC). In comparison of the profiles, a novel class of HCC expressing CC-like traits was identified.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of 70 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 13 cholangiocarcinoma (CC), and 7 mixed type of combined HCC and CC (CHC) were performed.
