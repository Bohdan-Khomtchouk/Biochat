TITLE
Cytokinesis signals truncation of the PodJ polarity factor by a cell cycle-regulated protease

ORGANISM
Caulobacter vibrioides

SUMMARY
Supporting data for Chen et al., " Cytokinesis signals truncation of the PodJ polarity factor by a cell cycle-regulated protease " The microarray component of this work seeks to identify genes whose expression is controlled by the Caulobacter crescentus DivJ-PleC-DivK system. Keywords: time course, mutant/wild-type comparisons

DESIGN
We postulated that the DivJ-PleC-DivK system controls the expression of factors that regulate PodJ processing.  To identify such factors, we examined the transcriptional effects of the DivJ-PleC-DivK system using five perturbations. 1.  We compared expression between wild-type (CB15) and pleC deletion strains (LS3767, LS3768).  (4 arrays; all biological replicates; includes dye-swaps) 2.  We compared expression between wild-type (CB15) and strains with an allele of pleC in which amino acid 610 of the gene product was changed from a histidine to an alanine (LS3938, LS3939).  The H610A mutation abolishes both the kinase and phosphatase activities of PleC.  (5 arrays; all biological replicates; includes dye-swaps) 3.  We compared expression between wild-type (CB15) and strains with a divJ deletion (LS4107, LS4108) or disruption (LS4110, LS4117).  Two different divJ null alleles, each with a different antibiotic resistance gene cassette, were used to reduce the impact that the antibiotic resistance genes might have on the analysis.  (Cells were grown without antibiotics.)  (4 arrays; all biological replicates; includes dye swaps) 4.  We compared expression between wild-type (CB15) and a podJ deletion strain (LS3766).  PodJ is required for the normal localization of PleC.  (4 arrays; all biological replicates; includes dye-swaps) 5.  We monitored expression during the cell cycle in a synchronized population of cells carrying the cold-sensitive divKD90G allele.  Samples were taken throughout the cell cycle and each sample was compared to a common reference.  (22 arrays; 14 time points, of which 8 contain technical replicates)
