TITLE
Effects of the total replacement of fish meal and fish oil with plant protein and oil sources on the hepatic transcriptome of two European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) sub-families exhibiting different growth potentials on an all plant-based diet

ORGANISM
Dicentrarchus labrax

SUMMARY
Comparison of the hepatic transcriptomes for two half-sib-families of European sea bass fed on vegetable and fish diet. These two half-sib-families exhibit similar growth on fish diet while significantly different on vegetable diet. The aim of the study is to point out the large panel of metabolic and physiological effects induced by total substitution of both fish meal and fish oil in the diets of European sea bass and to reveal physiological characteristics associated to the two half-sib-families.

DESIGN
Fish from both two half-sib-families (G and g) were fed a a fish diet (FD) or a vegetable diet (VD) diet for 9 months.  Five to eight independent experiments were performed for each experimental groups (G-FD; G-VD; g-FD; g-VD)  using different fishes for each experiment.
