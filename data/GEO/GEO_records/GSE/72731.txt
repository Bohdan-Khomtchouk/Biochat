TITLE
Kinetic analysis of T cell anergy induction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
T cell receptor(TCR) engagement in the absence of costimulation leads to a state of T cell tolerance known as anergy. Anergy induction requires new protein synthesis since it is inhibited by cycloheximide. In this experiment, we tried to figure out kinetic properties of the gene expression in anergy induction phase and the subsequent anergy maintenance phase.

DESIGN
A.E7 cell, a murine CD4(+) T cell clone, was stimulated with anti-TCR antibody for 0, 2, 4, and 6hrs followed by RNA extraction. For the maintenance phase, A.E7 was stimulated for 16hrs and rested for 5days before RNA extraction.
