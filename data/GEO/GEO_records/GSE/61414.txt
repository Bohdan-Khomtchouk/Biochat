TITLE
Pancreatic Gene Expression from Wild-Type, Stat1-Transgenic, and Stat1-CC-Transgenic Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pancreatic Gene Expression from Wild-Type, Stat1-Transgenic, and Stat1-CC-Transgenic Mice. This data was part of the set of data utilized to identify PARP9/DTX3L as a novel antiviral gene. Keywords: transgene state analysis

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from the pancreas of 3 mice per genotype (wild-type, Stat1-Transgenic, Stat1-CC-Transgenic). Comparisons were made between Stat1-Transgenic and Stat1-CC-Transgenic mice.
