TITLE
Blood transcription profiling of infections of humans with Leishmania infantum.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling to address the effects of infection with Leishmania infantum during distinct clinical outcomes as active visceral leishmaniasis (VL), remission of disease and asymptomatic infection.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from whole-blood lysates obtained from VL patients, treated VL patients, asymptomatic individuals and uninfected controls. The aim was to evaluate  gene expression signatures associated with protective and pathological responses.
