TITLE
Integrated data analysis reveals distinct drivers and pathways disrupted by DNA methylation in papillary thyroid carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multiple joint data, including methylome, transcriptomic, BRAF V600E mutation results and clinical features, aiming to identify molecular drivers in papillary thyroid carcinomas.

DESIGN
Whole DNA methylation profile was evaluated in 41 papillary thyroid cancer matched with 41 non-neoplastic adjacent tissues. In addition, an integrative analysis was performed using 34 PTC with methylome and transcriptomic data (GSE50901). The reliable gene was identified by a cross-study validation using a external database (TCGA).
