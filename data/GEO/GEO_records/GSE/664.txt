SUMMARY
Approximately 500 surface sterilized seeds of Arabidopsis seeds (ecotype: Col-0) were sterilely sown on filter disks overlaying solid Â½ MS media 1% sucrose, stratified at 4C for 48 h and grown in darkness at 25C for 4 d. Seedlings were gently submerged by application to the plates of the different auxin solutions (made in ethanol carrier; 0.1% final concentration) and at the indicated times (20 min, 40 min, 60 min), the seedlings were lifted from the plate en mass and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Keywords: time-course
