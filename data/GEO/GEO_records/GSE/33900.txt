TITLE
The Role of the E2F1 transcription factor in the innate immune response to systemic LPS [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our recent study of gene expression in mice treated with LPS systemically identified the E2F1 transcription factor as a novel regulator of innate immune response in lung, liver, and spleen tissue. Our follow up studies showed that RNAi-mediated inhibition or E2F1 gene deficiency lead to reduced inflammatory response to LPS in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a clear role for the role of miRNAs in the regulation of innate immune response to LPS has emerged.  In the current study, we further examined B6;129E2F1-/- and B6x126 F2 mice in the systemic LPS model and used gene expression profiling to identify a defect in the coagulation cascade that contributes to increased morbidity of B6;129E2F1-/- mice despite their reduced systemic inflammatory response. We also studied miRNA expression profiles identified miRNAs that are differentially expressed in B6;129E2F1-/- but not B6x129 F2 mice.

DESIGN
32 mice (4-6) per group, E2F+/+ or E2F-/- genotype, treated with saline or LPS, 6 or 20 hrs
