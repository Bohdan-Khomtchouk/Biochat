TITLE
Expression data from wheat cultivar TAM 107 flag leaf

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
We used microarray to study the transcriptome response of wheat flag leaves to heat stress (40℃)

DESIGN
In order to study the transcriptome response of wheat flag leaf to heat stress, wheat cultivar ‘TAM 107’ plants were subjected to heat stress (40℃). After 1 hour of stress, flag leaves were sampled from both stressed and control plants and were used for microarray analysis.
