TITLE
Confluent versus Sub-confluent HUVEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HUVEC (N=3 isolates) were separately grown to sub-confluency, and to confluency. In order to study the effects of growth and contact inhibition on the transcriptome, the microarray gene expression profiles of these sub-confluent and confluent HUVEC were compared. Keywords: HUVEC, confluency, contact inhibition

DESIGN
N=3 biological replicates, separately grown to sub-confluency, and concluency, respectively. Total RNA molecules were then isolated, and linearly amplified (1 round) according to the Eberwine method. After labeling the amplified cRNA molecules of these 6 samples (N=3 sub-confluent, N=3 confluent) with Cy5 Dyes, these were separately hybridized against Cy3-labeled common reference RNA molecules on glass-based 19K oligonucleotide microarray chips.
