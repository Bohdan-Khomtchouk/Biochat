TITLE
Confluent versus Sub-confluent HUVEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HUVEC (N=3 isolates) were separately grown to sub-confluency, and to confluency. In order to study the effects of growth and contact inhibition on the transcriptome, the microarray gene expression profiles of these sub-confluent and confluent HUVEC were compared. Keywords: HUVEC, confluency, contact inhibition
