TITLE
Expression analysis, A. actinomycetemcomitans wild type (JP2) vs CRP deletion mutant both grown anaerobically.

ORGANISM
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans

SUMMARY
The goal of this analysis is to define the anaerobic regulon for the global transcription factor CRP (catabolite repressor protein) in the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The objectives were met by comparing the mRNA profile of a wild type strain, JP2, to that of an isogenic mutant deleted of the CRP gene.  Both strains were grown anaerobically.

DESIGN
A three biological replicates study using total RNA recovered from three separate cultures of wild-type Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans strain JP2 and three separate cultures of strain AAM167, an isogenic deletion mutant  in which the gene for cAMP-Receptor-Protein (CRP) has been replaced by a spectinomycin resistance gene cassette.  The cells were grown anaerobically in pairs (wild type paired with mutant). Each chip measures the expression level of 2,116 genes from A. actinomycetemcomitans strain HK1651.   There were 11 different 60-mer probes /gene for 94% of the genes, and the entire probe set (22,537 probes) was replicated (technical replicates) three times on each array.  Each probe set is contained on a quarter of a chip and there were also 4,426 random probes per array.  Wild type and mutant RNAs from cultures #1 and #2 were hybridized to the same chip and the RNAs from cultures  #3 were hybridized in different quadrants of a second chip.
