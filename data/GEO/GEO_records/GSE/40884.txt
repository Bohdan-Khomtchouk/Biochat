TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profile of thymus samples from prednisolone-treated and control cows.

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
A bovine oligo microarray platform (GPL7053) was used to evidence differences in gene expression profiles from eight (8) thymus samples from prednisolone-treated cows and seven (7) from control animals. Significance analysis of microarray found 154 up-regulated and 234 down-regulated transcripts in the prednisolone-treated animal group respect to the controls.

DESIGN
In this study, we analyzed fifteen (15) bovine thymus samples, eight (8) from prednisolone-treated cows and seven (7) from control animals. Gene expression profiling was performed using the Agilent-015354 Bos taurus Oligo Microarray platform (GPL7053) based on single-colour detection (Cyanine-3 only). Microarrays were scanned with Agilent scanner G2565BA (barcode on the left, DNA on the back surface, scanned through the glass) at a resolution of 5 microns; all slides were scanned twice at two different sensitivity settings (XDRHi 100% and XDRLo 10%); the scanner software created a unique ID for each pair of XDR scans and saved it to both scan image files. Feature Extraction (FE) 9.5 used XDR ID to link the pairs of scans together automatically when extracting data. The signal left after all the FE processing steps have been completed is ProcessedSignal that contains the Multiplicatively Detrended, Background-Subtracted Signal.
