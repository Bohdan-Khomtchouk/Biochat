TITLE
Innate and adaptive immunity in zebrafish: time course (zebrafish)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The interaction between fungal pathogen and host innnate and adaptive immunity during infection is a complex and dynamic process. To resolve this, we chose the zebrafish model organism as the host to study C. albicans infection via systems biology approach. Transcriptome microarray data and histological analysis of surviving fish were sampled at different post-infection time points. Time-course microarray data following primary and secondary infection of zebrafish by Candida albicans were obatined. From this set of data, we constructed two intracellular protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks for primary and secondary responses of the host.

DESIGN
Each fish in the first group was intraperitoneally injected with 1 × 10E5 and 1 × 10E7 CFU C. albicans at day 0 and 14, respectively. These infected fish were collected at 1, 2, 3, 6, 14, 17.5, 21 dpi (day post infection). For the second group, a second injection of C. albicans was given on 14th day of the first infeciton, and the repeated infeceted fish were collected at 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42 hours post second injection.   1.65 μg of Cy3 cRNA for zebrafish array was fragmented to an average size of about 50-100 nucleotides by incubation with fragmentation buffer at 60°C for 30 minutes. Each time points contain two biological repeats.
