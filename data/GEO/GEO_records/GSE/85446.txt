TITLE
Expression profiling of primary oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of 66 HPV-negative OSCC primary tumor was performed to identify gene expression that is related to lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. These gene expression profiles were combined in silico with gene expression profiles of 84 OSCC primary tumors retrieved from GSE30788.

DESIGN
Dual-color experiment of 66 samples combined with a reanalysis of 84 samples from GSE30788

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
