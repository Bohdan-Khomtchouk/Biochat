TITLE
miRNA expression differences in tumor and benign prostate tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the global miRNA expression in prostate tumor and benign tissues by qPCR expression profiling.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling.  miRNA expression was measured in prostate benign and tumor tissues from cancer patients by using miRNA Taqman plates.
