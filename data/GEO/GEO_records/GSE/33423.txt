TITLE
Environmental Toxicants Induce Epigenetic Transgenerational Inheritance of Ovarian Disease [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The epigenetic transgenerational actions of environmental toxicants and relevant mixtures on ovarian disease was investigated with the use of a fungicide, a pesticide mixture, a plastic mixture, dioxin and a hydrocarbon mixture. After transient exposure of an F0 gestating female rat during embryonic gonadal sex determination, the F1, F2 and F3 generation progeny adult onset ovarian disease was assessed. Transgenerational disease phenotypes observed included an increase in cysts resembling human polycystic ovarian disease (PCO) and a decrease in the ovarian primordial follicle pool size resembling premature ovarian failure (POF).   The F3 generation granulosa cells were isolated and found to have a transgenerational effect on the transcriptome and epigenome (differential DNA methylation). Epigenetic biomarkers for environmental exposure and associated gene networks were identified. Epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of ovarian disease states were induced by different classes of environmental compounds suggesting a role of environmental epigenetics in ovarian disease etiology. We used transcriptome microarray analysis to determine genes expressed differentially between F3 control and F3 vinclozolin lineage rat ovary granulosa cell and see which genes might be connected to or cause  observed ovary diseases

DESIGN
RNA samples from  granulosa cell of 3 F3-control lineage groups are compared to granulosa cell of 3 F3-vinclozolin lineage groups
