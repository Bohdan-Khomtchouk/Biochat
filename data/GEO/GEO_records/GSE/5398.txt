TITLE
Gene expression profiles in gastric mucosa from a transgenic mice infected with H. pylori and immunized with BabA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Many vaccination studies have revealed various degrees of protection in mouse models. However, the mechanism of protection is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to identify genes specifically expressed in H. pylori infection and prophylactic immunized mice. A prophylactic immunization with purified protein of H. pylori BabA combining with the mucosal CTA1-DD adjuvant was performed in a-1,3/4-fucosyltransferase transgenic FVB/N mice. Gene expression profile was analysed from the gastric mucosa among untreated, the infected and immunized mice. There were a set of genes were upregulated or downregulated respectively, in infected mice as compared with untreated mice. These include the adipokines released form adipose tissue, adhesion molecules and actin cytoskeletal rearragemet associated genes. In immunized mice, however, the host response was not as strong as in infected mice and significantly changed genes were completely overlapped with those in infected mice. The expression data from genechip was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR assay. The microarray analysis suggests that genes such as actin cytoskeletal molecules and adipokines may be as potential targets of H. pylori infection. Prophylactic immunization with purified protein of H. pylori BabA combining with the mucosal CTA1-DD adjuvant could reduce bacteria colonization without induced a severe degree of inflammation.
