TITLE
Gastric cancer: cancer vs. normal, chemoresistance signature that correlates with time to progression of disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA profiling of gastric cancer vs. normal, pre-/-post CF (cisplatin/fluorouracil) chemotherapy. Biopsy samples were collected prior to chemotherapy from 90 gastric cancer patients treated with CF and from 34 healthy volunteers.  At the time of disease progression, post-treatment samples were collected from 8 clinical responders. miRNA expression was determined using a custom-designed Agilent microarray.  In order to identify an miRNA signature for chemotherapy resistance, we correlated miRNA expression levels with the time to progression (TTP) after CF.

DESIGN
90 pre-treatment gastric cancer samples, 34 healthy volunteers, 8 post-treatment samples.
