TITLE
aCGH data from age-dichotomized ER+ breast tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the biological basis between aging and sporadic breast cancer incidence and prognosis, DNA samples from matched ER+ invasive breast cancers diagnosed in either young ( < 45) or old ( > 70) women were analyzed with aCGH Keywords: biomarker identification

DESIGN
