TITLE
Profiling transcriptomes of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells exposed to maleic acid

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A microarray-based transcriptome profiling was performed to provide a better understanding of  the effects of maleic acid on human. Gene expression profiles of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells exposed to three concentrations of maleic acid (10, 50 and 100 μM) for 24 h were analyzed.

DESIGN
To get better insights into the effects of maleic acid on neuronal cells, the gene expression profiles of SH-SY5Y cells treated with three doses (10, 50 and 100 μM) of maleic acid along with control cells were examined.
