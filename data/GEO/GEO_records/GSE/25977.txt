TITLE
Transcriptome of Proteus mirabilis in the murine urinary tract

ORGANISM
Proteus mirabilis HI4320

SUMMARY
The enteric bacterium Proteus mirabilis is a common cause of complicated urinary tract infections. In the study, microrarrays were used to analyze P. mirabilis gene expression in vivo from experimentally infected mice.  Urine was collected at 1, 3, and 7d postinfection, and RNA was isolated from bacteria in the urine for transcriptional analysis.  Across 9 microarrays, 471 genes were upregulated and 82 were downregulated in vivo compared to in vitro broth culture.  Genes upregulated in vivo encoded MR/P fimbriae, urease, iron uptake systems, amino acid and peptide transporters, pyruvate metabolism, and portions of the TCA cycle.  Flagella were downregulated.  Ammonia assimilation gene glnA (glutamine synthetase) was repressed in vivo while gdhA (glutamate dehydrogenase) was upregulated in vivo.  Contrary to our expectations, ammonia availability due to urease activity in P. mirabilis did not drive this gene expression.  A gdhA mutant was growth-deficient in minimal medium with citrate as the sole carbon source, and loss of gdhA resulted in a significant fitness defect in the mouse model of urinary tract infection.  Unlike Escherichia coli, which represses gdhA and upregulates glnA in vivo and cannot utilize citrate, the data suggest that P. mirabilis uses glutamate dehydrogenase to monitor carbon-nitrogen balance, and this ability contributes to the pathogenic potential of P. mirabilis in the urinary tract.
