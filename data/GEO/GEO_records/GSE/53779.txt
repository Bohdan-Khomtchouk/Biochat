TITLE
The RNA-binding protein RBM47 suppresses metastatic breast cancer progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Through integrative analysis of clinical breast cancer gene expression datasets, cell line models of breast cancer progression, and mutation data from cancer genome resequencing studies, we have identified RNA binding motif protein 47 (RBM47) as a candidate suppressor of breast cancer metastasis. RBM47 inhibited breast cancer progression in experimental models. Transcriptome-wide analysis of RBM47 localization by HITS-CLIP revealed widespread binding to mRNAs, preferentially at the 3' UTRs. RBM47 altered the abundance of a subset of its target mRNAs. Some of the mRNAs stabilized by RBM47, as exemplified by dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1 (DKK1), mediate tumor suppressive effects downstream of RBM47. This work identifies RBM47 as a suppressor of breast cancer progression and highlights the potential of global RNA modulatory events as a source of metastasis-promoting phenotypic traits.

DESIGN
Cancer cells transduced with doxycycline-inducible wildtype RBM47 or the RBM47-I281fs mutant, treated with increasing concentrations of doxycycline.
