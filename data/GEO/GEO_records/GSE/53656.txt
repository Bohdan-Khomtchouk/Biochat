TITLE
Microarray analysis of beta-catenin regulated target genes in SW480 colon cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Deregulation of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is one of the earliest events in the pathogenesis of colon cancer. Mutations in APC or CTNNB1 are frequent in colon cancer and cause aberrant stabilization of beta-catenin, which activates Wnt target genes by binding to chromatin via TCF/LEF transcription factors. In a comprehensive study, we conducted an integrative analysis of genome-wide chromatin occupancy of beta-catenin by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) along with gene expression profiling changes resulting from RNAi-mediated knockdown of beta-catenin in colon cancer cells. This experiment series represents the gene expression changes detected by microarray as a result of CTNNB1 perturbation.

DESIGN
SW480 cells were transfected with control and beta-catenin siRNAs.  Twenty-four hours after transfection, RNA was extracted from the cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and genome-wide cDNA microarray expression analysis was performed.   The data reported here are the microarray data as processed by the standard Rosetta Resolver(R) ratio method for Agilent microarrays.
