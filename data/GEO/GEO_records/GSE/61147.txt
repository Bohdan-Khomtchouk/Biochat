TITLE
Gene expression in WT and Ikaros-deficient LSK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Ikaros zink finger transcription factor is a critical regulator of the hematopietic system, and plays an important role in the regulation of the development and function of several blood cell lineages. We used microarrays to characterize how Ikaros deficieny affects global transcription in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from wild-type and Ikaros mutant mice.

DESIGN
lin- Sca1+ c-Kit+ (LSK) cells, that contains the hematopoietic stem cells and the multipotent progenitor cells, were sorted by FACS from the bone marrow of 6-7 weeks old WT and IkL/L mutant mice. Total RNA extracted from these cells was subjected to transcriptome analysis.
