TITLE
stem cell therapy of murine acute hepatitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of the liver and hepatic inflammatory cells in murine concanavalin A-induced acute hepatitis models by treatment with adipose tissue derived stem cells

DESIGN
C57Bl/6 female mice were treated with adipose tissue-derived stem cells immediately or 3 hours after concanavalin A injection. Two hours later, the liver tissues or hepatic inflammatory cells were obtained and gene expression of them were examined by DNA microarray.
