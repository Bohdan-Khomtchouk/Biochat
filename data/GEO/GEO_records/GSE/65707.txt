TITLE
RelA Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) Subunit binding Loci in Promoter Regions of PHM1-31 Myometrial Smooth Muscle Cells (expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A study to define the binding loci of RelA-containing NF-kappaB dimers and subsequent correlation with gene expression in a human myometrial smooth muscle cell line after exposure to TNF.

DESIGN
Monolayers of PHM1-31 cells were exposed to TNF (10ng/ml) for 1 hour or left unstimulated. Total RNA was isolated, prepared and used to probe AffymetrixU133Plus2 expression arrays. Both datasets were subsequently analysed in Partek Genomics Suite V6.6 and correlations between promoter occupancy (promoter arrays) and gene expression (expression arrays) were made.
