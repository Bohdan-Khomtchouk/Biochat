TITLE
Expression profiling, Miz1 location analysis and histone modification analysis in 70Z/3 and P6D4 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling by RNA-Seq was performed on 70Z3 and P6D4 cells as well as ChIP-Seq location analysis of Miz1, H3K4Me3, H3K27Ac and H3K9Ac. This was done as part of a larger study regarding the role of Miz1 as a regulator of Trp53 translation.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq was carried out in triplicate for each cell line. Miz1 and histone mark ChIP-Seqs were carried out once for each cell line from a single cell lysate preparation and thus have the same input control.

PLATFORM
