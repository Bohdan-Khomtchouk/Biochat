TITLE
Influence of p38 MAPK (PMK-1) on the heat stress response of C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
PMK-1 is involved in the heat stress response of C. elegans, translocates to the nucleus upon heat exposure and influences the expression of chaperone genes, proteasomal subunits and protein-biosynthesis related genes.

DESIGN
Differential Gene expression of WT and pmk-1 deletion mutant (KU25) after 5 hours at 35Â°C

PLATFORM
GPL13657 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Caenorhabditis elegans)
