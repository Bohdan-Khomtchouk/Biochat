TITLE
Tongue tissue gene profile in 4NQO induced tongue carcinogenesis before and after IL-1Ra interference

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Nine groups of rat tongue tissue RNA samples, including three from normal control, three from 4NQO induced tongue tissue, and three from 4NQO induced and IL-1Ra interference tongue tissue (3 rats per group) were collected for gene microarray hybridization.

DESIGN
Significant fold changes among genes were determined by taking the ratio of the expression between 4NQO group and 4NQO+IL-1Ra group versus normal control group in epithelia and fibroblasts cells
