TITLE
Expression Analysis of WR99210-treated Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis treated with the DHFR inhibitor WR99210, compared to untreated cells. The antimycobacterial properties of WR99210 are further described in Gerum, A., Ulmer, J., Jacobus, D., Jensen, N., Sherman, D., and C. Sibley. 2002. Novel Saccharomyces cerevisiae screen identifies WR99210 analogues that inhibit Mycobacterium tuberculosis dihydrofolate reductase. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 46(11):3362-3369 [PMID:12384337]

DESIGN
A nine chip experiment in which total RNA was collected from H37Rv after treatment with 100 uM WR99210 for 0, 4, and 24 hours.  Three separate cultures/biological replicates were interrogated for both treated and untreated cultures.  Labeled cDNA was hybridized to NimbleGen spotted oligo tiling arrays covering both strands of the M. tuberculosis genome at ~200 bp intervals between 60-mer probes.
