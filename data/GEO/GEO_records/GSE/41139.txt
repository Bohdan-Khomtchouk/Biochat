TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the injected mice overexpressing TFEB specifically in liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the effects of TFEB overexpression on the liver transcriptome, we performed Affymetrix Gene-Chip hybridization experiments for the injected mice

DESIGN
For the analysis on the injected mice overexpressing TFEB, total RNA was extracted from the liver of three mice; RNA extracted from the liver of not-injected mice was used as control.
