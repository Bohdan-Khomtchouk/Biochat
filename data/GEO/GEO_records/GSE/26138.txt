TITLE
Expression data from rat regenerating livers after autonomic nervous system is disrupted

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Autonomic nervous system is widely distributed in liver, and some reserchers have found that disruppted autonomic nerves will delay liver regeneration. We used microarrays to further highlight the regulatory role of autonomic nervous system in liver regeneration at gene transcription level.

DESIGN
Surgical operations of rat partial hepatectomy (PH) and its operation control (OC), sympathectomy combining partial hepatectomy (SPH), vagotomy combining partial hepatectomy (VPH), and total liver denervation combining partial hepatectomy (TDPH) were performed, and the expression profiles of regenerating liver at 2h were detected using Rat Genome 230 2.0 array. Then the significantly changed genes related to liver regeneration (LR)-, injury-, splanchnic nerve-LR-, vagal nerve-LR-, and autonomic nerve-LR-related genes were identified, respectively. The relevance of gene expression profiles and biological processes was analyzed by bioinformatics and systems biology.
