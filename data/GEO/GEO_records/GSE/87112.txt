TITLE
A Compendium of Chromatin Contact Maps Reveal Spatially Active Regions in the Human Genome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The three-dimensional configuration of DNA is integral to all nuclear processes in eukaryotes, yet our knowledge of the chromosome architecture is still limited. Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture studies have uncovered features of chromatin organization in cultured cells, however, genome architecture in human tissues has yet to be explored.  Here, we report the most comprehensive survey to date of chromatin organization in human tissues. Through integrative analysis of chromatin contact maps in 21 primary human tissues and cell types, we discover genomic regions that exhibit unusually high levels of local chromatin interactions. These frequently interacting regions (FIREs) are enriched for active enhancers and are located near tissue-specifically expressed genes. Unlike previously identified chromatin loops, FIREs tend to engage in promiscuous local chromatin interactions in a tissue-specific manner. FIRE formation is dependent on the Cohesin complex. Additionally, we show that FIREs can help annotate function of non-coding sequence variants.
