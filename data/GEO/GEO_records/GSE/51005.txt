TITLE
Next generation sequencing of advanced non-castrate prostate cancer treated with docetaxel chemotherapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Early chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic non-castration resistant prostate cancer (PCa) may improve overall patient survival.  We studied the safety, tolerability and early efficacy of up-front docetaxel chemotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) versus ADT alone for patients with newly-diagnosed advanced/metastatic PCa.  As proof of concept, we undertook in vivo gene expression profiling by next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq).

DESIGN
Tumour biposies from 6 patients were taken before and after treatment with combined ADT and docetaxcel for 6 weeks

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
