TITLE
Gene expression profiling of splenic monocytes from TCL1-AT mice and WT controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of CLL development on differentation and gene expression of splenic monocytes.

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice were transplanted with murine CLL cells from EÂµ-TCL1 mice and after 6 weeks total RNA was isolated from splenic monocytes from leukemic mice and matched WT controls.
