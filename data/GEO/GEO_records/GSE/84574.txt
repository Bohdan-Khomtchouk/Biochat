TITLE
Transcriptome analisys of bone marrow mononuclear cells derived from pediatric patients with acute myeloid leucosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this research was to explore activation/deactivation of signaling pathways in mononuclear cells from pediatric patients with acute myeloid leucosis and acute lymphoid leucosis.

DESIGN
Mononuclear cells were separated shortly after bone marrow samples collection. Cells were obtained by a density gradient centrifugation method using Ficoll.  Cells were dissolved in RNALater solution, aliquoted and stored at -20°C till RNA extraction and microarray hybridisation.

PLATFORM
GPL22166 CustomArray Signaling Pathway platform version 2
