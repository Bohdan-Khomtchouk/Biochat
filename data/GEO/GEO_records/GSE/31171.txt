TITLE
Exon level expression profiling of mutant U2AF35 transduced HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, to obtain the biological impact of the mutated U2AF35, HeLa cells were retrovirally transduced with either mock, wild-type or S34F mutant of U2AF35, and Exon array was performed.

DESIGN
Exon level analysis was performed for mock, wild-type U2AF35 or S34F mutant transduced HeLa in triplicate.
