TITLE
Circadian Epigenomic Control of Skeletal Muscle Fuel Metabolism by HDAC3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We address the function of HDAC3 in skeletal muscle metabolism

DESIGN
We performed HDAC3 ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and GRO-seq in mouse muscles at different times of the day and compared between WT and HDAC3-depleted muscles.
