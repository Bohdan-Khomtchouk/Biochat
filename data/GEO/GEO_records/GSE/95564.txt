TITLE
Mutations in EGFR compromise hypoxia associated radiation resistance through impaired repair of replication fork associated DNA double-strand breaks

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis in human bronchial epithelial cells expressing wild type EGFR or activating mutations, L858R or E7646-E750 EGFR in a normoxic environment (21% oxygen) or at 24 hours of exposure to a hypoxic environment (0.1% oxygen). The effect of EGFR mutations on base-line and hypoxia-induced gene expression was determined.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HBEC cells stably expressing WT, L858R or E746-E750 forms of EGFR. All three cell lines were incubated in either aerobic conditions (21% O2/5%CO2) or exposed for 24 hours to a hypoxic environment containing 0.1% O2/5%CO2
