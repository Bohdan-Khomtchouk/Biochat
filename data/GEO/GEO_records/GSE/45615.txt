TITLE
Expression analysis of HCT116 cells transfected using Tip60 or p400-targetting siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in HCT116 cells upon knockdown of Tip60 or p400, compared to control siRNA-transfected cells. Two different siRNA directed against Tip60 were used and experiments were done in duplicate. Same for p400-targetting or control siRNA.

DESIGN
Hybridization experiment using total RNA recovered from independent cell cultures of HCT116 transfected using control, Tip60-targetting or p400-targetting siRNA.
