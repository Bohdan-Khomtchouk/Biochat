TITLE
Studies of wax genes in cotton (Gossypium arboreum)

ORGANISM
Gossypium arboreum

SUMMARY
The aim of the present study is to list the genes involved in cotton (G. arboreum) leaf epicuticular wax production and deposition. For this purpose differentially expressed genes (especially, down-regulated in wax deficient mutant plant) in wild and epicuticular wax mutant (Gawm3) plants were founded through cDNA microarray, developed from the wild plant leaves.

DESIGN
3× (wild cotton leaf labeled with Cy3/ epicuticular wax mutant cotton leaf (Gawm3) labeled with Cy5) 3× (wild cotton leaf labeled with Cy5/ epicuticular wax mutant cotton leaf (Gawm3) labeled with Cy3)

PLATFORM
GPL8266 Gossypium arboreum 9.4K
