TITLE
Differential gene expression in neuroblastoma cells after transfection with control siRNA or linc00467 siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
N-Myc oncoprotein induces neuroblastoma by modulating gene transcription, and long noncoding RNAs exert biological effects by regulating gene expression. We have found that one of long noncoding RNAs modulated by N-Myc is linc00467. We analysed the target genes of the long noncoding RNA linc00467 in neuroblastoma cells.

DESIGN
Neuroblastoma BE(2)-C cells were transfected with control siRNA or linc00467 siRNA. RNA was extracted from the cells 48 hours after siRNA transfections, and subjected to differential gene expression studies with Affymetrix microarrays.
