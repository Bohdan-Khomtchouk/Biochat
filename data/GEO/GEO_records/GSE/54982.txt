TITLE
Probing In vivo Brachyury Function with Tc mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify Brachyury target genes in vivo and elucidate how Brachyury-mediated regulation contributes to early mouse developmental homeostasis and coordination, we performed mRNA-seq to compare gene expression profiles of WT and Tc/Tc embryos at both E7.5 ~ 8.0 and E10.0 ~ 10.5

DESIGN
WT and Tc/Tc embryos were isolated at both E7.5 ~ 8.0 and E10.0 ~ 10.5. Subsequently, directional mRNA-seq expriments were performed with wild-type and Tc/Tc whole embryos

PLATFORM
