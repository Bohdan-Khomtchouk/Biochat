TITLE
DNA methylation dynamics studies with MethylRO mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have knocked-in mCherry-MBD-NLS probe, which recognizes methylated CpG, to ROSA26 locus and named this reporter MethylRO (methylation probe in ROSA26 locus). In this study, we showed that MethylRO can capture DNA methylation dynamics both in vitro and in vivo.

DESIGN
The detection of DNA methylation

PLATFORM
GPL18603 Illumina Hiseq 1000 (Mus musculus)
