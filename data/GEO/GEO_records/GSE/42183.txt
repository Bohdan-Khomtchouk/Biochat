TITLE
Protein microarray analysis of expression of murine cytokines in spleen interfered with IFN-α and (or) LPS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
12 wild-type C57BL/6 (B6) mice were divided into 4 groups: control group, IFN-α group, LPS group, and IFN-α+ LPS group, every group contained 3 mice (n=3). IFN-α was administrated i.p. to IFN-α group and IFN-α+ LPS group once daily (QD) for 7 days at a medium dose of 105units/kg weight, PBS was administrated i.p. to control group and LPS group QD for 7 days at the same volume. LPS group and IFN-α+ LPS group were injected i.v. with 10 μg LPS for one mouse on the 8th day. Control group and IFN-α group were injected i.v. with PBS at the same volume. 6 h later, mice were sacrificed to harvest spleens for protein microarray experiment. Mouse Cytokine Antibody Array 3(62) was purchased from Ray Biotech, Norcross GA, US.

DESIGN
Protein microarray of murine cytokines expression. Spleens from 12 mice (4 group) were treated as indicated in the summary.  Equal amount total protein from each spleen was pooled prior to gene expression analysis.
