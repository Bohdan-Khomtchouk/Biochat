TITLE
Molecular classification of tumour cells in a patient with intravascular large B-cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a rare type of extranodal LBCL. It is characterized by the proliferation of tumour cells exclusively intraluminally in small blood vessels of different organs. We used microarray-based analysis of gene expression of tumour cells isolated from a patient with primary manifestation of the lymphoma in the skin and compared it with various other diffuse LBCLs (DLBCLs) as well as a previously published DLBCL classifier.

DESIGN
CD20+CD45+HLA-DR+ tumor cells were FACS sorted from a lesional skin biopsy of the patient and compared to FACS sorted tumor cells from (1) affected lymph nodes from patients with DLBCL (3 samples from patients with DLBCL, nonGCB type; three samples from patients with DLBCL, GCB type) and (2) tumor cells from two patients with primary cutaneous LBCL, leg type.
