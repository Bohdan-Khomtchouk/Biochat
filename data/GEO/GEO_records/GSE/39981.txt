TITLE
Purified human leukocyte subtype DNA methylation profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of the study was to identify differentially methylated regions of DNA (DMRs) that distinguish human leukocyte subtypes, and hence serve as biomarkers for those immune cell types. This file contains Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip data for human leukocyte subtypes that were purified from whole blood samples via magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) and purity confirmed by flourescence activated cell sorting (FACS).

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 73 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 Beadchip v1.2
