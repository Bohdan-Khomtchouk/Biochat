TITLE
GATA Transcription Factor (CGA1) Regulates Chloroplast Development in Rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
A transcription factor CYTOKININ-RESPONSIVE GATA FACTOR 1 (CGA1) regulates chloroplast development in rice (Oryza sativa) through modifying the expression of important nuclear expressed, chloroplast localized genes. A transcriptome analysis was done in wild type plants and transgenic rice over-expressing this OsCGA1 to identify the set of genes with altered expression.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from leaves of 4-wk old wild type and OsCGA1 overexpressing rice plants and hybridized to Affymetrix Rice Genome Array. Three biological replicates were sampled for wild type and OX plants.
