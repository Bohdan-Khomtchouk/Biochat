TITLE
CLIP-seq of eIF4AIII reveals transcriptome-wide mapping of the human exon junction complex

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The exon junction complex (EJC) is a central effector of mRNAs fate, linking nuclear processing to mRNA transport, translation and surveillance. Little is known about its transcriptome-wide targets. We used high-throughput sequencing after crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) in human cells to identify the binding sites of the DEAD-box helicase eIF4AIII, an EJC core component. CLIP reads form peaks mainly located in spliced mRNAs. Most expressed exons harbour peaks equally distributed between the canonical EJC region âˆ¼24 nucleotides upstream of exonic junctions and other non-canonical regions. Unexpectedly, both are preferentially associated to unstructured and purine-rich sequences containing the motif GAAGA, a potential binding site of EJC-associated factors. Therefore, EJC positions vary spatially and quantitatively between exons. This transcriptome-wide mapping of human eIF4AIII reveals unanticipated aspects of the EJC and broadens its potential impact on post-transcriptional regulation.

DESIGN
To identify direct RNA binding sites of the EJC core component eIF4AIII, two biological CLIP-seq replicates were performed in HeLa cells. Additionally, mRNA-seq of the HeLa transcriptome was performed to normalize for the mRNA expression levels.
