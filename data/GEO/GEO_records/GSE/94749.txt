TITLE
Cell origin dictates programming of resident versus recruited macrophages during acute lung injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The primary objective of this study was to compare global differences in transcriptional programming of resident and recruited alveolar macrophages in a time-limited murine model of lung inflammation. We first performed RNA sequencing of the resident and recruited alveolar macrophages from initiation through resolution of LPS-induced lung inflammation in the mouse.  Our results indicate that despite existing in a shared environment, cell origin is the major determinant of programming of resident and recruited AMs during an acute inflammatory response.  Major areas of difference include cell proliferation, inflammatory cytokine production and metabolism.

DESIGN
Comparison of two alveolar macrophage cell types transcriptomes at days 0,3,6,9, and 12 following lung injury.

PLATFORM
