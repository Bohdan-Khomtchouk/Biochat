TITLE
Bio-Electric Field Enhancement: The Influence on MDA-MB231 Cells in Vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We grew MDA-MB231 cells in a media that had been reconstituted with water that was treated by the Bio-Electric Field Enhancement device generated direct current dielectrophoretic electromagnetic field (Treated group) and cells that were grown in media that was reconstituted with water that was not treated by the BEFE device dc DEP EMF. They were grown for 3 days in each of these media and then analyzed with Affymetrix 2.0 Microarrary Analyses. It was an experimental controlled design.

DESIGN
10,000 Cells were plated in triplicate in 6-well plates. The cells were grown for 24 hours in standard growth media (DMEM with 10% FBS).  Then the treated media was made by diluting a 10X DMEM with 9 parts of a hypotonic saline solution that was exposed to the dc DEP EMF from the BEFE unit for 30 minutes and 1 part 10X DMEM.  The control media was made by diluting the 10X media with a hypotonic saline solution that was not exposed to the dc DEP EMF from the BEFE unit.  The cells were grown in the treated/control media for 3 days and then analyzed with the Affymetrix 2.0 Human Genome Microarray. We looked at the changes in gene expression between the treated and control groups.
