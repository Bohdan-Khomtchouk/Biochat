TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of WT and blmp-1(tm548) mutant L3 larvae

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-seq analysis of WT and blmp-1(tm548) mutant L3 larvae to identify genes regulated by the zing-finger transcription factor BLMP-1.

DESIGN
We analyzed three WT and three blmp-1 mutant biological replicates
