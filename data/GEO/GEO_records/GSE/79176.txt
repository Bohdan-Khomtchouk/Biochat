TITLE
Effect of polyphosphates on osteoblast mineralization

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat osteoblasts ROB17/2.8 cells were cultured in the presence of high (1mg/ml) or low (0.01mg/ml) concentration of polyphosphates.

DESIGN
Poly(P) induced gene expression in rat osteoblast ROS17/2.8 cells was measured after the treatment with high (1mg/ml) or low (0.01mg/ml) for 24 h.
