TITLE
Effects of far-infrared rays on normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Far-infrared rays activated DNA repair genes in human prostate epithelial cells after 7 or 12 days' exposure to far-infrared rays.  As far-infrared rays emitter, synthetic/natural rubber (RB) was used.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, RB-treated vs. non-RB-treated cells: 2 reference control without RB, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array. Channels 1 were exposed to RB.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
