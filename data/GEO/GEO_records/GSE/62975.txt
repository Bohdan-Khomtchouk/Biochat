TITLE
Expression data from injected mice overexpressing Tcfeb specifically in muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the effects of Tcfeb overexpression on the muscle transcriptome, we performed Affymetrix Gene-Chip hybridization experiments for the mice injected with an AAV vector expressing Tcfeb as compared with mice injected with an AAV vector expressing GFP as control. Transcriptome analysis of the injected mice overexpressing Tcfeb specifically in muscle.

DESIGN
For the analysis on the injected mice with an AAV vector expressing Tcfeb, total RNA was extracted from the muscle of three mice; RNA extracted from the muscle of mice  injected with an AAV vector expressing GFP was used as control.
