TITLE
Comparative Genomic Hybridization of S. cerevisiae industrial and laboratory strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The environmental stresses and inhibitors encounted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains are main limiting factors in bioethanol fermentation. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the stresses-related phenotypes diversities within and between S. cerevisiae populations could guide the construction of yeast strains with improved stresses tolerance and fermentation performances. Here, we explored the genetic characteristics of the bioethanol S. cerevisiae strains, and elucidated the genetic variations correlated with its advantaged traits (higher ethanol yield under sever conditions and better tolerance to multiple stresses compared to an S288c derived laboratory strain BYZ1). Firstly, pulse-field gel electrophoresis combined with array-comparative genomic hybridization was used to compare the genome structure of industrial strains and the laboratory strain BYZ1.

DESIGN
Yeast cells were cultured in YPD medium. Genome DNA was isolated and sonicated. The average length of DNA fragments was 200-1000bp. The shearing DNA was labeled with Cy5/Cy3 and hybridized to NimbleGen S.cerevisiae Whole-Genome Tiling arrays, which is single array design containing all chromosomes with 32bp median probe spacing and totally covered by ~385,000 probes. Scanning was performed with the Axon GenePix 4000B microarray scanner. YJS329 vs BYZ1 ZK2 vs BYZ1
