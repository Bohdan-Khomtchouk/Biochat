TITLE
Gene expression in pif1pif3pif4pif5 mutant under dark or red light conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Light initiates the seedling deetiolation transition by promoting major changes in gene expression mainly regulated by phytochrome (phy) photoreceptors. During the initial dark-to-light transition, phy photoactivation induces rapid changes in gene expression that eventually lead to the photomorphogenic development. Recent reports indicate that this process is achieved by phy-induced degradation of Phy-Interacting bHLH transcription Factors (PIFs) PIF1, PIF3 PIF4 and PIF5, which are partly redundant constitutive repressors of photomorphogenesis that accumulate in darkness. In order to test whether light/phy-regulated gene expression occurs through these PIFs, we have performed whole-genome expression analysis in the pif1pif3pif4pif5 quadruple mutant (pifq).

DESIGN
Wild-type and pifq mutant seeds were plated on GM medium without sucrose at room temperature. During this procedure the seeds were routinely exposed to white light (WL) for a total of 1.5 hours after imbibition. Seeds were then stratified for 5 days at 4ºC in darkness, induced to germinate with a 5-min red pulse (Rp) (46 μmol/m2/s) and then incubated in the dark for 3h at 21°C before exposure to a terminal 5-min far red pulse (FRp) (58 μmol/m2/s) to suppress pseudo-dark effects. Seeds were then placed in either dark (D) or constant red light (Rc) (6.7 μmol/ m2/s) at 21°C for 45h (2d-old seedlings). Alternatively, 2d-old dark-grown seedlings were treated with 1h of red light (R1) (7.5 μmol/m2/s). Seed samples were harvested after stratification (5d stratified seeds).
