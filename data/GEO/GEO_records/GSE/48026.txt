TITLE
mRNA-Seq of asi1-1, wild-type and MethlyC-Seq of asi1-1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
1, Using mRNA-Seq to get expression profiling of asi1-1 mutant and WT; 2, Using MethylC-Seq to provide single-base resolution of DNA methylation status in asi1-1 mutant

DESIGN
mRNA-Seq: 2 samples examined, Col-0 wild-type with 35S-SUC2 transgene(termed as WT) and asi1-1 mutant (Col-0 background with 35S-SUC2 transgene); MethylC-Seq: 1 sample examined, asi1-1 mutant

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
