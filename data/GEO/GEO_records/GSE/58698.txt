TITLE
Effect of TGF-β on gene expression of human prostate cancer cells PC-3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a key factor for the development of prostate cancer metastases in bone. In breast cancer and melanoma, studies have shown how TGF-β regulates gene expression to allow cancer cells to adapt to the bone microenvironment. We used microarray analyses to characterize the effect of TGF-β on gene expression in prostate cancer cells in vitro.

DESIGN
Human prostate cancer cells, PC-3, were cultured in the presence or absence of TGF-β. Total RNA was extracted for hybridization on Affymetrix microarray analyzed with Microarray Analysis Suite 5.0.
