TITLE
Genome-wide comparative ChIP-seq data of CTCF and RNA-seq data in Drosophila white prepupa on Illumina Genome Analyzer

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
This is a dataset which comprises the following two different kinds of genomic data in Drosophila species: First, triplicate ChIP-seq data of CTCF (CCCTC binding factor) binding profiles in each of the four closely related Drosophila species : Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans, Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila pseudoobscura at white pre pupa stage; Second, triplicate RNA-seq data of white pre pupa whole animals of three Drosophila species: Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans and Drosophila yakub. The binding site/region/peaks are called using a modified method of QuEST( please see details in our related publication). The sequence read counts and RPKM values are calculated following the method in Mortazavi et al 2008 Nature Methods paper. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
