TITLE
The LncRNA NEAT1 Nests RNA Binding Proteins and the Microprocessor to Globally Enhance Pri-miRNA Processing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA biogenesis is known to be modulated by a variety of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), but in most cases, individual RBPs appear to influence the processing of a small number of selective targets.  We herein report binding of the NONO/PSF heterodimer to hundreds of expressed pri-miRNAs in HeLa cells to globally enhance pri-miRNA processing by the Drosha/DGCR8 Microprocessor.  As NONO/PSF are key components of paraspeckles organized by the lncRNA NEAT1, we find that NEAT1 also has profound effects on global pri-miRNA processing.  Mechanistic dissection reveals that NEAT1 broadly interacts with NONO/PSF as well as many other RBPs, and that multiple RNA segments in NEAT1, including a “pseudo pri-miRNA” near its 3’ end, help attract the Microprocessor.  These findings suggest a bird nest model for a large lncRNA to orchestrate efficient processing of an entire class of small RNAs in the nucleus.we used small RNA-seq to identify miRNA level in response to secific knockdowns relative to siGFP treatment control

DESIGN
We profiled the miRNAs expression levels under conditions including siGFP(control), siNEAT1, siNEAT1_V2, siNONO, siPSF and siPSPC1 through small RNA-seq respectively.  And we also examined the in vivo interactions between NONO/PSF and RNA through CLIP-seq.
