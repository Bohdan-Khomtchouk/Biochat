TITLE
Statin-induced Myopathy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a genome-wide association study in pooled DNA samples from patients with severe statin myopathy and persistent symptoms post-therapy versus pooled DNAs from an age-adjusted statin-tolerant group.

DESIGN
Affymetrix 100K SNP arrays were used according to the manufacturers instructions with two pools of 19 and 20 statin myopathy patients and two pools of 20 statin-tolerant controls.
