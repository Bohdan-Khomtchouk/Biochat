TITLE
Specific expression of microRNAs and snoRNAs characterize ERG-related B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ERG-related B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP ALL) is a recently described childhood ALL subtype characterized by aberrant ERG protein expression and highly recurrent ERG intragenic deletions. Several studies reported a remarkably favourable outcome for ERG-related BCP-ALL despite a high incidence of apparently inauspicious IKZF1 aberrations.  In this study we investigated by integrative genomic analysis the main features of the ERG-related group in a cohort of B-others BCP ALL patients enrolled in the AIEOP ALL 2000 therapeutic protocol. We report a specific microRNA and snoRNA signature that characterizes ERG-related patients with up-regulation of the miR-125b-2 cluster on chromosome 21 and several snoRNAs in the Prader-Willi locus at 15q11.2, including the orphan SNORD116 cluster.  Given the current lack of parameters for a comprehensive classification we suggest toexploit the noncoding RNAs signature for differential diagnosis of ERG-related patients.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling by array. Class comparison between ERG-related and non-ERG-related patient groups; class comparison between ERG-related patients with or without ERG intragenic deletion.
