TITLE
Spike-in at 0.25pmol with 18 replicates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have conducted a study to determine which DNA microarray analysis method for identification of differential expression works best with a varying number of replicates, in particular, when the number of replicates is small. Using spiked-in mRNA with two-channel microarrays, as well as simulated data generated /in silico/, we measured the efficacy of five gene identification methods, namely /t/-test, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), median log ratio, median fold change and Wilcoxon ranksum test. By comparing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves as well as the ranking accuracy versus sample size plots, our results show that the simple median methods (median log ratio and median fold change) are more accurate and robust than the other statistical methods in identifying differential gene expression, especially when the number of sample replicates is small.
