TITLE
G-protein coupled receptor 3 (cAMP-receptor like) regulating genes involved in blastospore production of entomopathogen fungi Beauveria bassiana

ORGANISM
Beauveria bassiana ARSEF 2860

SUMMARY
G-protein coupled receptor 3 (BbGPCR3) played crucial roles in mediating blastospore production, a determinant to the biocontrol potential of fungal entomopathogens. We characterized for the first time that disruption of BbGPCR3 reduced  the blastospore production in glucose-based rich medium (Sabouraud dextrose broth, SDB), but the blastospore production of disruption mutant could be recovered in trehalose-modified SDB. The global transcriptome  related to blastospore production was analyzed by using high throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq). Our transcriptional profiles revealed that numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which involved in cell process, signal transduction, and stress response, were significantly involved in blastospore production.

DESIGN
1. Total RNA obtained from BbGPCR3 disruption mutant were compared to the wild type strain in glucose-based rich medium (SDB); 2. Total RNA obtained from BbGPCR3 disruption mutant in trehalose-modified SDB were compared to that of disruption mutant in SDB.
