TITLE
Expression profiling of FRG1 transgenic mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA from skeletal muscle of mice over-expressing selectively in the skeletal muscle the gene FRG1, a candidate of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, was compared to RNA from skeletal muscle of WT mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated vastus lateralis muscles of 4 weeks old females WT mice and vastus lateralis muscles of 4 weeks old mice over-expressing FRG1, FSHD region gene 1.
