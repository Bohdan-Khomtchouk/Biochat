TITLE
Epigenetic and genetic dissections of UV-induced global gene dysregulation in skin cells through multi-omics analyses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we performed integrative multi-omics studies to understand the complex mechanisms underlying UV photobiological effects. While H3K27ac and genetic mutations can both contribute to UV-induced transcriptomic changes, additional omics-based studies on other histone modifications, DNA methylation, and whole genome mapping of genetic mutations will provide a thorough understanding of UV-gene interactions in skin disease pathogenesis. The new UV target genes that we identified have important clinical implications in skin carcinogenesis..

DESIGN
In this study, we performed RNA-Seq, Chip-Seq and Exome-seq studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the photobiological effects of UV radiation on gene regulation in skin homeostasis
