TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of BRCA1 and PALB2 [RA stimulation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and PALB2 have enigmatic roles in cellular growth and mammalian development.  While these genes are essential for growth during early developmental programs, inactivation later in adulthood leads to increased growth and formation of tumors, leading to their designation as tumor suppressors.  We performed genome-wide analysis assessing their chromatin residence and gene expression responsiveness using high throughput sequencing in breast epithelial cells.  These experiments revealed a critical role for BRCA1 and PALB2 in transcriptional responsiveness to NF-kB, a crucial mediator of growth and inflammatory response during development and cancer.  Importantly, we also uncovered a vital role for these proteins in response to retinoic acid (RA), a growth inhibitory signal in breast cancer cells, which may constitute the basis for their tumor suppressor activity.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were infected with PALB2, BRCA1 and  non targeting (SCR) shRNAs. After puromycin selection, cells were stimulated with 10microM Retinoic Acid (RA) for 24 hours
