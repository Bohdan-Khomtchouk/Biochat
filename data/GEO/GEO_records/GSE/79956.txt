TITLE
Gene Expression Based Characterization of B7H3 In Prostate Cancer [BCR]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
B7-H3 (CD276), part of the B7 superfamily, has been shown to play an immunomodulatory role, however its regulation, receptor, and mechanism of action remain unclear.  Protein levels of B7-H3 have been previously shown to relate to prostate cancer outcomes and currently, humanized monoclonal antibodies are being investigated for clinical therapeutic use (enoblituzumab, MGA271, Macrogenics).  Here we use genomic expression data to examine the relationship of B7-H3 to prostate cancer clinical characteristics and molecular profile.

DESIGN
Retrospective case-cohort design for 294 men (genomic data available for 211) initially diagnosed with intermediate or high risk localized prostate cancer who had no neo-adjuvant treatment, underwent RP between 1992 and 2010, and subsequently experienced BCR. These men received no post-RP secondary therapy prior to metastasis.
