TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of Tfr suppression of Tfh and B cells by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tfh and B cells were cultured together with or without Tfr cells.  After 4 days Tfh and B cells were sorted and prepared for 3' targeted RNA-seq.

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptional changes upon suppression of Tfh and B cells.
