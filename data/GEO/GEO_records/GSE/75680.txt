TITLE
Expression data from NKYS transfected with siRNAs or plasmids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The siRNA transfection includes JAK3 and EZH2 siRNAs. The plasmid transfection includes EZH2 WT and its mutants. We used gene expression data from JAK3 siRNA to test whether it affected epigenetic regulation, and used EZH2 mutants to study how it affected EZH2 canonical function.

DESIGN
Whole genome microarray comparison of JAK3/EZH2 manipulations and control

PLATFORM
