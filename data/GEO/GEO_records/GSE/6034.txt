TITLE
Molecular targets of proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, on ATL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a fatal neoplasia derived from HTLV-1 infected T lymphocytes exhibiting constitutive activation of NF-kB.  To elucidate the complex molecular mechanism of anti-tumor effect of the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib in ATL cells, we attempted to perform gene expression profiling. Keywords: dose response

DESIGN
Four ATL cell lines were cultured with or without bortezomib, then analysed.
