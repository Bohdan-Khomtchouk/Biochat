TITLE
Expression data from SP and non-SP sorted anti-EpCAM treated A549 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Targeted therapies against cancer stem cells which are enriched in side populations (SP) involves interruption of Wnt-signalling. Furthermore, EpCAM is a SP marker and modulator of Wnt-signalling. Therefore, the effects of an anti-EpCAM treatment on SP-cells and WNT/Î²-catenin signalling was studied. SP of the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 was obtained by fluorescence activated cell sorting and whole genome scans helped to define their molecular phenotype after anti-EpCAM antibody treatment.

DESIGN
Anti-EpCAM treated and untreated A549 cells were subjected to Hoechst 33342 dye exclusion assay and sorted to SP and non-SP fractions by FACS. Three biological replicates.
