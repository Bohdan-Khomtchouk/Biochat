TITLE
TGF-beta-induced gene expression data and Smad2/3 binding sites of HaCaT keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Smad2/3 are transcription factors that engage in TGF-beta-induced transcription. Here we analyzed the effect of identified Smad2/3 binding sites to transcription.  We used expression microarrays to compare the Smad2/3 binding sites identified by ChIP-chip to TGF-beta-induced gene expressions. Keywords: time course We also examined the effect of either ETS1/TFAP2A/SMAD2/SMAD3 siRNAs on TGF-beta-induced gene expression change.

DESIGN
HaCaT cells were treated with TGF-beta3 for Smad2/3 ChIP-chip or RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
