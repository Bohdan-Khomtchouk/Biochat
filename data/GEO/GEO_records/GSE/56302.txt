TITLE
Induction of regulatory M2 macrophage-like immunosuppressive cells from mouse ES cells that contribute to prolong allogeneic immune rejection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A promise of cell replacement therapy using pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as donor source has been increased. However, particularly when ESCs were used, immune suppression should be required because the donor-recipient combination would be allogeneic. In this study, we examined a concept that some immunosuppressive cells could be induced from PSCs and those cells could prevent allogeneic immune rejection of the PSCs-based transplantation. In fact, we successfully induced immunosuppressive cells that resemble M2 macrophages in terms of cell surface molecule and gene expressions. They efficiently suppressed allogeneic T cell proliferative responses, at least partly, in nitric oxide dependent manner. We applied these cells to in vivoallogeneic transplantation and found that they substantially prolonged ESCs-derived graft survival. These results open a new insight for development of a practical immune-regulatory strategy in cell replacement therapy using PSCs.

DESIGN
Difference of the gene expression between ESdSC and ESdDC was analyzed. Two independent experiment were performed.
