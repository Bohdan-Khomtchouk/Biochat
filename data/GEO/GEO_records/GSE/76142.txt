TITLE
Divergence of Transcription Regulation and the Function of a Conserved Elongation Factor in Budding and Fission Yeast

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Complex regulation of gene expression in mammals has evolved from simpler eukaryotic systems, yet mechanistic details of this evolution remain elusive.  By comparing the transcriptional landscape of distantly related budding and fission yeast, we catch a glimpse of divergence in gene regulation. Using an adapted Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq) approach, we have mapped the positions of RNA polymerase (RNA Pol II) active sites genome-wide in S. pombe and S. cerevisiae at base-pair resolution. We further mapped preferred sites of transcription initiation in each organism, exposing the origins of nascent transcription.  Performing PRO-seq in strains lacking Spt4, a highly conserved elongation factor subunit, results in globally elevated levels of transcribing Pol II within genes in both species. Messenger RNA abundance, however, does not reflect the increases in RNA Pol II density, indicating a possible global elongation rate defect.  Unexpectedly, we identify a novel pause in early elongation, specific to S. pombe, which requires Spt4, suggesting regulatory potential similar to promoter-proximal pausing in mammals.

DESIGN
Examination transcriptional landscapes in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe and the changes that result from the deletion of Spt4.
