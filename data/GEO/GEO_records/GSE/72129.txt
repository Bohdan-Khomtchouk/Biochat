TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Sensory Neurons Transcriptomes in response to Trophic Withdrawal

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goals of this study are to uncover the changes in the transcriptome of sensory neurons in response to trophic withdrawal

DESIGN
Methods:  mRNA profiles of sensory neurons in response to trophic withdrawal were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx. Seven independent replicates of RNA purification from each condition were collected and pooled for each time point.
