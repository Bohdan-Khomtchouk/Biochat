TITLE
Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid - enriched high fat diet modulates immune genes in the spleen transcriptome of C57BL/6J mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Effects of EPA/DHA enriched high fat diets (HFD) compared to HFD-Corn oil after 8 weeks intervention on spleen immune function

DESIGN
Four mice representing each diet group on the basis of body weight, plasma triglyceride and plasma cholesterol levels were selected for RNA isolation and microarray analysis. Total RNA from skeletal muscle of these selected animals was purified using the RNeasyÂ® Plus Universal Mini kit (Qiagen Nordic, Sollentuna, Sweden) by following the manufacturer's instruction carefully. The extracted RNA was quantified by NanoDrop 2000c UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) and the quality of the RNA was estimated by RNA 6000 Nano LabChip for Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA).
