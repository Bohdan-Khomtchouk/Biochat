TITLE
Gene expression analysis of murine day 6 embryoid bodies (EBs ) with or without Notch1 (ICN1) induction.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD41 single positive, VE-cadherin single positive, double positive, and double negatvie populations among 7AAD-CD45- cells from day 6 EBs

DESIGN
Doxycline-inducible ICN1 ES cells were differentiated into EBs and ICN1 was induced from day 3-5. Non-induced or induced day 6 EBs were dissociated and subjected to FACS sorting and RNA extraction.
