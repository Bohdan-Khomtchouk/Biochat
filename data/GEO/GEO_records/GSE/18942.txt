TITLE
TAP-ORC2 and control ChIP experiments in Drosophila Kc167 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Expression data from Kc167 cells under normal conditions. Used to assess expression levels of genes with ORC bound at promoter. Control experiments in support of our previous modencode submssion GSE17282.

DESIGN
Kc167 cells were harvested from log phase gorwth.  RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with IgG against TAP-ORC2 or control cells.
