TITLE
Gene expression profiles of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and skin fibroblasts from orangutans

ORGANISM
Pongo abelii

SUMMARY
Orangutans are an endangered species whose natural habitats are restricted to the Southeast Asian islands of Borneo and Sumatra. For potential species conservation and functional genomics studies, we derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from cryopreserved skin fibroblasts obtained from captive orangutans. We report the gene expression profiles of iPSCs and skin fibroblasts derived from orangtuans.

DESIGN
The overall goal was to evaluate gene expression biomarkers of pluripotency in iPSCs and skin fibroblasts  derived from PBD-ZSD patients and healthy controls. Dermal fibroblast cultures from 2 orangutans were reprogrammed into iPSCs by transfection with retroviruses designed to express the human OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC cDNA.  Fibroblasts and iPSCs were cultured in 1:1 ratio of DMEM:F12 medium supplemented with 20% KOSR (knock-out serum replacement) at 37Â°C with 5% CO2 until confluence for RNA extraction. The overall goal was to evaluate gene expression biomarkers of pluripotency in iPSCs and original fibroblast cultures.
