TITLE
Next-Generation Sequencing of Small RNAs from HIV-Infected Cells Identifies Phased microRNA Expression Patterns and Candidate Novel microRNAs Differentially Expressed upon Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIV infection of CD4  T cells induces a range of host transcriptional changes in mRNAs as well as microRNAs that may coordinate changes in mRNAs.

DESIGN
We applied next-generation sequencing, analyzing the small RNA fraction of HIV-infected cells at 5, 12, and 24 h postinfection (RNA-Seq).
