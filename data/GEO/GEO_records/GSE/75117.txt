TITLE
Heterogeneous expression of zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 plays a pivotal role in metastasis via regulation of miR-200c in epithelial-mesenchymal transition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been implicated as the pivotal event in metastasis, there is insufficient evidence related to EMT in clinical settings. Intratumor heterogeneity may lead to underestimation of gene expression representing EMT. In this study, we investigated the expression of EMT-associated genes and microRNAs in primary colorectal cancer while considering intratumor heterogeneity.

DESIGN
One-hundred and thirty-three multiple spatially separated samples were obtained from 8 patients with metastatic colorectal cancers and 8 with non-metastatic colorectal cancers, from the tumor center (TC), invasive front (IF), and metastasis. Differences in gene and microRNA expression were investigated by microarray and quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. RNA collection from 38 sites of 8 patients and Universal Human Reference RNA (Agilent Technologies) were used for micro-array analysis.
