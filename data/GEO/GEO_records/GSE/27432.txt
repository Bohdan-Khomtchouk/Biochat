TITLE
Genomic distribution and inter-sample variation of non-CG methylation across human cell types

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation plays an important role in development and disease. The primary sites of DNA methylation in vertebrates are cytosines in the CpG dinucleotide context, which account for roughly three quarters of the total DNA methylation content in human and mouse cells. While the genomic distribution, inter-individual stability and functional role of CpG methylation are reasonably well understood, little is known about DNA methylation targeting CpA, CpC and CpT dinucleotides. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of non-CG methylation in 72 genome-scale DNA methylation maps across human pluripotent and differentiated cell types. We confirm non-CG methylation to be predominant in pluripotent cell types and observe an expected decrease upon differentiation and near complete absence in various differentiated cells. Our data highlight that non-CG methylation is highly variable and shows little conservation between different pluripotent cell lines. While we show a strong correlation of non-CG methylation and DNMT3 expression levels we find a statistical independence of non-CG methylation from pluripotency associated gene expression. Finally, non-CG methylation appears to be spatially correlated with CpG methylation. In summary these results contribute further to our understanding of DNA methylation in human cells and help clarify previous observations using a large representative sample set.
