TITLE
Expression analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type and rph1Δ two and 24 hours following menadione treatment

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression changes at short (2 hours) and extended (24 hours) timepoints in wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae treated with 50 μM menadione during exponential growth compared to an rph1Δ strain Transient treatment with 50 μM menadione elevates mitochondrial ROS and extends chronological lifespan in yeast. Deletion of RPH1, a H3K36me3 histone demethylase, block chronological lifespan extension. This study aimed to identify Rph1p-dependent gene expression changes induced by menadione treatment that may support chronological lifespan extension. Reference: Bonawitz, N.D., Chatenay-Lapointe, M., Wearn, C.M., and Shadel, G.S. (2008). Expression of the rDNA-encoded mitochondrial protein Tar1p is stringently controlled and responds differentially to mitochondrial respiratory demand and dysfunction. Curr Genet 54, 83-94.

DESIGN
A 24 chip study using total RNA recovered from two separate cultures each of Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type DBY2006 and rph1Δ. Each chip measures expression levels of 5,777 transcripts from NCBI build June 2008 with 8 probes per transcript and 3 replicate probe sets.
