TITLE
Microarray analysis of WT bone marrow myeloid progenitors, BM cultured with GM-CSF and M-CSF, and monocytes treated with GM-CSF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of genes induced in DC precursors and in BM cells and monocytes treated with GM-CSF

DESIGN
For progenitor arrays, bone marrow progenitors (CMP, GMP, CDP, and pre-cDC) were harvested from WT C57Bl/6 mice.  For culture arrays, BM was cultured in the presence of GM-CSF or M-CSF and adherent and non-adherent cells sorted.  For monocyte cultures, sorted BM monocytes were treated with GM-CSF for 0, 24 or 48 hours.
