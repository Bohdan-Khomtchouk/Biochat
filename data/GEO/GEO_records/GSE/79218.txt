TITLE
Primary human microvascular endothelial cell transcriptome (mRNA) response to a wild type MERS-CoV (icMERS-CoV EMC2012)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA analysis in primary human microvascular endothelial cells infected with wild type MERS-CoV (icMERS).

DESIGN
Human microvascular endothelial cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 5 PFU per cell.  Infected samples were collected in quintuplet; time-matched mocks were collected in quintuplet in parallel with infected samples. Time points: 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post-infection. MERSCOV002.0P references the write up of the experimental procedure.
