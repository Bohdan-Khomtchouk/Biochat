TITLE
ENU derived mouse line AEA001: A model for osteoporosis carrying a mutation in Ednra

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of white adipose tissue and bone (femur of the hind limbs) of the AEA001 mutant mouse. ENU generated mouse lines for osteoporosis. The mutation in the Ednra gene causes big ears and a flat short head. Due to a decreased body mass and a trend towards decreased glucose level white adipose tissue was analysed.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 4 male mutant mice was compared to 4 controls.
