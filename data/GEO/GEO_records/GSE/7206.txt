TITLE
Gene expression profiling in T-47D breast cancer cells following inducible expression of estrogen receptor beta

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T-47D breast cancer cells were stably transfected with a tet-off inducible construct encoding estrogen receptor beta. Microarray experiments were carried out at multiple time points 1-30 hours following treatment with estradiol and under induction and non-induction conditions. Keywords: Inducible expression of ERbeta

DESIGN
Single biological samples were taking at each time point for each of the four treatment condition (uninduced-untreated, induced-untreated, uninduced-treated, and induced-treated.
