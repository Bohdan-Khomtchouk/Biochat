TITLE
Molecular and Structural Bases of Hypothalamic Development

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
To compare the global profile of hypothalamic gene expression in agonadal male infants before and after activation of the neurobiologic brake that arrests pulsatile GnRH release during the juvenile phase of development.

DESIGN
Affymetrix arrays were used to detect global changes in gene expression in the hypothalamus of of the agonadal rhesus monkey during development.
