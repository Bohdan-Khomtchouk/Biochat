TITLE
The expression level of microRNA in CTGF-overexpressed SAS cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To screen the microRNA regulated by Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)

DESIGN
Establish stable transfectants of pcDNA3-CTGF in SAS cells and analyze the miRNA expression level of  by microRNA microarray. SAS transfected with pcDNA3 was used as a control experiment.
