TITLE
Genome-wide Expression of Trabecular Meshwork in POAG

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study compared genome-wide expression profiles of individuals with and without Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG). One POAG case (case #6 with two replicates #10 and #11) carried a Q368X myocilin mutation.

DESIGN
This study compared the genome-wide expression in human trabecular meshwork tissue between 13 controls and 15 POAG cases. Six controls and one POAG cases had the expression performed from both left and right eyes. One technical replicate was done between two cases. The average from the biological replicates for each inidividual was used for analysis.
