TITLE
Effect of  from Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled global gene expression in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells to determine the gene expression changes associated with knocking down PKM2 and p53. We identified a p53 dependent transcriptional response that remodels metabolism in cells lacking p53, thus limiting cell growth.

DESIGN
Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes targeting PKM2 and / or p53, RNA was extracted and subjected to RNA sequencing
