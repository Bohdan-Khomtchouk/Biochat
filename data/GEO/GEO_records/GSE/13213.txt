TITLE
Relapse-related molecular signature in lung adenocarcinomas identifies patients with dismal prognosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified a relapse-related molecular signature represented by 82 probes (RRS-82) through genome-wide expression profiling analysis of a training set of 60 patients. The robustness of RRS-82 in the selection of patients with a high probability of relapse was then validated with a completely blinded test set of 27 adenocarcinoma patients, showing a clear association of high risk RRS-82 with very poor patient prognosis regardless of disease stage. The discriminatory power of RRS-82 was further validated using an additional independent cohort of 30 Stage I patients who underwent surgery at a distinct period of time. Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
Expression profiles in 117 patients with lung adenocarcinomas.
