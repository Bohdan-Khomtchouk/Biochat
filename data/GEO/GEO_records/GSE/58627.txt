TITLE
Gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) after genetic depletion of Id1 and knock-down of Zrf1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Id proteins are dominant negative regulators within the HLH family of proteins. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), Id1 and Id3 maintain the pluripotent state by preventing neural differentiation. The Id1-interacting protein Zrf1 plays a crucial role as a chromatin-bound factor in specification of the neural fate from ESCs. Here, we show that Id1 blocks Zrf1 recruitment to chromatin, thus preventing the activation of neural genes during ESC differentiation. Moreover, genetic deletion of Id1 in ESCs caused misexpression of more than 6000 genes. Interestingly, the expression of almost half of those genes was restored upon further depletion of Zrf1. We therefore identified Zrf1 as a transcriptional regulator downstream of Id1 in ESCs.

DESIGN
In Id1KO mESCs, Zrf1 expression was depleted by using shRNAs. Four replicates corresponding to four independent biological samples per group were collected.
