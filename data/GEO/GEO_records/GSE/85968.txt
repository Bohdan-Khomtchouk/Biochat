TITLE
Blockage of hemichannels alters gene expression in osteocytes in a high magneto-gravitational environment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We tested how Cx43 hemichannels which mediate the exchange of small molecules between cells and extracellular environment impact genome wide gene expression under conditions of abnormal gravity and magnetic field. we subjected osteocytic MLO-Y4 cells to a high magneto-gravitational environment and used microarray to examine global gene expression and a specific blocking antibody was used to assess the role of Cx43 hemichannels.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was conducted to identify the alterations of global gene expression profile of osteocytic MLO-Y4 cells under HMGE. Furthermore, the effects of Cx43 hemichannels on gene expression were investigated by using a potent, Cx43 hemichannel-blocking antibody Cx43(E2)
