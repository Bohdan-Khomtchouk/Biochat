TITLE
miCLIP, RNA-Seq, and Ribo-Seq in MOLM13 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied the following conditions: m6A RNA methylation in MOLM13 AML cells; METTL3 deficiency on gene expression and translational efficiency

DESIGN
miCLIP was performed on poly(A) mRNA from MOLM13 as previously described(see GSE63753), RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq were performed on MOLM13 cells four days after lentiviral transduction with a control shRNA or two independent hairpins targeting METTL3 (shRNA#9 and shRNA#12).  All experiments were performed in biological triplicate.
