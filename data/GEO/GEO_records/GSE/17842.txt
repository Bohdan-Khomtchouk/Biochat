TITLE
Human osteoblast treated with chemotherapy-treated bone marrow stromal cell conditioned media

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global expression profile of human osteoblast treated with chemotherapy-treated bone marrow stromal cell conditioned media, compared to human osteoblast cells treated with diluent-control bone marrow stromal cell conditioned media. Goal is to identify genes regulated by chemotherapy in osteoblasts.

DESIGN
Dye-swap design with 6 biological replicates. Three arrays performed with chemotherapy treated samples on channel 1 and diluent-control treated on channel 2; three arrays performed with chemotherapy treated samples on channel 2 and diluent-control on channel 1.

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
