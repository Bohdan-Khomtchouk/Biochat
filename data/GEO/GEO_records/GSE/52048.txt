TITLE
Palmitate-induced inhibition of C2C12 insulin pathway modifies the release of exosomes and their biological actions on muscle cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exosomes are cell-released bioactive nanovesicles now considered as new partners in the inter-organ cross-talks. The possibility that skeletal muscle (SkM)-derived exosomes act as a mode of systemic communication has hitherto never been described. Thus, in this study we have tested the hypothesis that through the exosomal route, muscle cells might transmit specific signals during insulin-resistance.

DESIGN
C2C12 myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes and then treated with 0.5mM palmitate in order to alter insulin signaling pathway or BSA as control. Exosomes released from palmitate-treated cells (EXO-palm)  and from BSA-treated cells (EXO-BSA) were collected by ultracentrifugation. Then C2C12 were treated with either EXO-palm or EXO-BSA. RNA was extracted and global transcriptomic analysis was performed.
