TITLE
Transcriptional signatures associated with species divergence in New Zealand Pachycladon (Brassicaceae)

ORGANISM
Pachycladon cheesemanii ; Pachycladon fastigiatum ; Pachycladon novaezelandiae ; Pachycladon enysii ; Pachycladon exile

SUMMARY
Comparative gene expression profiling of a) above-ground tissues of three fruiting species (P. cheesemanii, ch, P. exile, ex, P. novae-zelandiae, nz), b) above-ground tissues of two rosette stage species (P. fastigiatum, fa, P. enysii, en) and c) roots of all five species using heterologous A. thaliana microarrays

DESIGN
8-12 specimens per species grown in common garden, RNA from roots and aboveground tissues extracted separately from each specimen, individual samples pooled in equal amounts resulting in five above ground samples (ch_l, ex_l, nz_l, fa_l, en_l) and five root samples (ch_r, ex_r, nz_r, fa_r, en_r), 36 two channel microarrays used in total: five above-ground samples hybridized in a loop-like fashion using 14 arrays, five root samples hybridized in a loop-wise fashion using 10 arrays; five root and three leaf samples hybridized in a loop-like fashion using 12 arrays, thus each sample hybridized multiple times (4-12) while being labelled either with cy3 or cy5

PLATFORM
GPL9670 Plant and Food Arabidopsis thaliana AROS version 1.0
