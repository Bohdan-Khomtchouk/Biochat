TITLE
dDsk2 stabilizes dHP1c binding at TSS [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The Drosophila ubiquitin receptor dDsk2 associates to chromatin and stabilizes binding of the euchromatic dHP1c/WOC/ROW-complex (dHP1EU) to the transcription-start site (TSS) of active genes

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq peak calling of WOC, ROW, Z4, HP1c and Dsk2 against Input sample in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells

PLATFORM
GPL11203 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Drosophila melanogaster)
