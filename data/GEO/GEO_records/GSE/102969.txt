TITLE
The different miRNA expression between cervical cancer tissues with or without lymph-node metastasis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the differences in miRNA profiles specially related to lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer, six primary cervical cancer tissues derived from stage І-ІІ patients with (n=3) or without (n=3) lymph node metastasis were collected. The differential expression of seven representative miRNAs (top seven miRNAs included: miR-135-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-25-3p, miR-96-5p, miR-182-5p, miR-183-5p, and miR-144-3p) was verified using qRT-PCR in the same tissues used for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Six cervical cancer tissues derived from stage I and II patients with (n=3) or without (n=3) lymph node metastasis collected.
