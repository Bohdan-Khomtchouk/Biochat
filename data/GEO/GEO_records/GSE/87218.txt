TITLE
Epigenome maps of time-resolved monocyte to macrophage differentiation and innate immune memory (ATAC-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Innate immune memory is the phenomenon whereby innate immune cells such as monocytes or macrophages undergo functional reprogramming after exposure to microbial components such as LPS.  We apply an integrated epigenomic approach to characterize the molecular events involved in LPS-induced tolerance in a time dependent manner. ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, WGBS and ATAC-seq data were generated. This analysis identified epigenetic programs in tolerance and trained macrophages, and the potential transcription factors involved.

DESIGN
Time-course in vitro culture of human monocytes. Two innate immune memory states can be induced in culture through an initial exposure of primary human monocytes to either LPS or BG for 24 hours, followed by removal of stimulus and differentiation to macrophages for an additional 5 days. Cells were collected at baseline (day 0), 1 hour, 4 hour, 24 hour and 6 days.
