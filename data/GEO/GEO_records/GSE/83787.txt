TITLE
SMAD2/3 binding pattern in a breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A MII [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that SMAD2/3 are redirected to novel binding sites on the genome after prolonged TGFβ stimulation.

DESIGN
SMAD2/3 ChIP-seq analyses were performed in MCF10A MII cells at 2 different time points after TGFβ treatment.
