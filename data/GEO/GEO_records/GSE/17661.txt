TITLE
Modulation of gene expression by rapamycin in hepatic cell lines, WB-F344 and WB311

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Two rat hepatic cell lines, WB-F344 and WB311, were characterized for the effect of rapamycin on gene expression.  The WB311 cell line, which is tumorigenic and resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of rapamycin, was originally derived from the WB-F344 parental hepatic epithelial cell line.  The goal of this experiment was to identify genes that responded to rapamycin in the sensitive cells but not the resistant cells, thereby providing insight into the mechanism of rapamycin resistance.

DESIGN
Total RNA for each of four experimental groups was prepared and analyzed in triplicate: WB-F344, vehicle control; WB-F344, rapamycin; WB311, vehicle control; WB311, rapamycin.
