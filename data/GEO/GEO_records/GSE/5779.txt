TITLE
Gene expression profiling of sporadic neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Integrated analysis of array-based comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) and gene expression profiling was conducted by using primary neuroblastomas. This submission corresponds the latter gene expression data. Keywords: other

DESIGN
Thirty mass screening-detected and 40 sporadic neuroblastomas were analyzed by both aCGH and gene expression profiling. A UCSF BAC array carrying 2,464 clones was used for the former experiment. For the latter experiment, an in-house cDNA microarray, carrying 5,340 cDNAs obtained from the oligo-capping cDNA libraries generated from anonymous neuroblastoma tissues, were used. Preparation of RNA, hybridization, reading of spots, and statistical analyses were conducted as reported previously [Ohira M, et al. Cancer Cell 2005;7:337-50.]. This series corresponds expression profiles for 40 sporadic neuroblastomas.
