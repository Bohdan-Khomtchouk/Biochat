TITLE
RNA-seq profiling of mouse PGC (Mus musculus)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PGCs undergo two distinct stages of demethylation before reaching a hypomethylated ground state at E13.5.  Stage 1 occurs between E7.25- E9.5 in which PGCs experience a global loss of cytosine methylation.  However, discreet loci escape this global loss of methylation and between E10.5-E13.5, stage 2 of demethylation takes place.  In this stage these loci are targeted by Tet1 and Tet2 leading to the loss of the remaining methylation and resulting in the epigenetic ground state.  Our data shows that Dnmt1 is responsible for maintaining the methylation of loci that escape stage 1 demethylation, and that it functions in a UHRF1 independent manner.  Our data further demonstrates that when these loci lose methylation prior to stage 2 it results in early activation of the meiotic program, which leads to precocious differentiation of the germ line resulting in a decreased pool of PGCs in the embryo and subsequent infertility in adult mice.
