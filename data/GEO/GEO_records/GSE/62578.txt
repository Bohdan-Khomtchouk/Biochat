TITLE
Gene expression in NIL-DOG1 and rdo5-1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We have identified RDO5 as a phosphatase that promotes seed dormancy, most likely independent from ABA and DOG1. To obtain an indication about the genetic and molecular pathways by which RDO5 functions, we performed a transcriptomic comparison between rdo5-1 and its wild-type NIL-DOG1 at different seed stages, using the Arabidopsis Affymetrix AGRONOMICS1 tiling microarrays

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from siliques at 14 days after pollination, freshly harvest seeds and 6 hours imbibed seeds. The transcriptome analysis was carried out using Affymetrix microarrays (Arabidopsis AGORONOMICS1 genome array)
