TITLE
Chip-chip from Mouse E11.5 distal limb tissue cells for Gabpa, Ets1, Elf1, Etv4, Etv5 antibody

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Two different groups of Ets transcription factors differentially act directly at the ZRS to define the spatial expression of Shh in the limb. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of Gabpa, Ets1, Etv4, Etv5 and Elf1 and by ChIP-on-chip analysis demonstrated that with the exception of Elf1 all bind  directly to the Shh limb enhancer, the ZRS.

DESIGN
Array design includes 2 biological replicates for Gabpa and Elf1, and two biological replicates and one dye swap replicate for Ets1, Etv4 and Etv5 samples.
