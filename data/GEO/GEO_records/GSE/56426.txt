TITLE
Expression data from proximal jejunum of WT vs. TLR2 KO mice after methotrexate (MTX) treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of innate immunity in modulating severity of chemotherapy-induced complications is so far unclear. The aim of this study was to determine how TLR2 may influence MTX-induced mucositis in the small intestine in mice. We used microarrays to assess gene expression profiles in proximal jejunum of WT vs. TLR2 KO mice after systemic treatment with MTX.

DESIGN
Mucositis was induced by i.p. injection of MTX [40mg/kg BW/d] for 4 days in WT or TLR2 knockout (KO) mice. On day 7, mice were sacrificed and RNA was extracted from proximal jejunum (n=3 mice/group) and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
