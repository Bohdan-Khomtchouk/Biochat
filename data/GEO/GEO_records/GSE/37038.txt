TITLE
Evaluation of microRNA expression in vehicle and metformin-treated breast cancer cells and evaluation of the dicer relevance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have evaluated the microRNA expression profile of SUM159 cells stably infected with a control shRNA or a dicer-targeting shRNA treated with vehicle or metformin for 24 hrs at non cytotoxic doses.

DESIGN
microRNA expression was evaluated from total RNA extracted from logaritmically growing SUM159 cells stably expressing a control shRNA or a dicer-targeting shRNA and  treated with vehicle (PBS) or metformin (0.5mM) for 24 hrs.
