TITLE
Expression data from murine natural killer cell subsets based on Ly49 receptor expression in C57BL/6 mice (C/I+ versus Ly49G2+ NK cells)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Natural killer (NK) cells have differential expression of inhibitory and activating receptors. NK cells that express inhibitory receptors with high binding affinity to self are considered licensed and normally functional cells, while those with low affinity are unlicensed are considered hyporesponsive. Microarray analysis was performed to better understand gene expression differences between these two subpopulations of NK cells after culturing the NK cells with IL-2 from splenocytes isolated from C57BL/6 mice and then sorting for CD3-CD122+Ly49G2+Ly49C/I- or CD3-CD122+Ly49G2-Ly49C/I+. Gene fold expression differences were compared between the Ly49G2+ and Ly49C/I+ NK cells to better understand the functional roles and characterisitics of these cells.

DESIGN
A total of 6 samples were analyzed, 3 for the CD3-CD122+Ly49G2+Ly49C/I- NK cells and 3 for the CD3-CD122+Ly49G2-Ly49C/I+. Samples were obtained from C57BL/5 splenocytes that were T cells depleted through anti-Thy1.2 and complement mediated depletion and cultured for 7 days with IL-2. Fold changes greater than 1.5 were recorded.
