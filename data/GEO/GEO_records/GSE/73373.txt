TITLE
The Candida albicans regulator ZCF21 controls the expression of cell wall components

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
We report that a transcriptional regulator that originated in the lineage that gave rise to multiple host-associated Candida species is a key component of the circuitry that governs the C. albicans cell surface composition. Specifically, we show that the transcription regulator ZCF21 controls the expression of genes encoding multiple cell surface proteins and cell wall modifying enzymes.

DESIGN
Transcriptome (RNA-seq) analysis of 2 Candida albicans strains (reference strain and zcf21 deletion mutant) grown under 4 culture conditions (YPD broth at 30째C for 24h; YPD broth at 30째C in the presence of 15 mM caffeine for 24h; Todd-Hewitt agar at 37째C for 24h; Todd-Hewitt agar at 37째C for 24h in the presence of 5 mM caffeine).

PLATFORM
GPL19036 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Candida albicans)
