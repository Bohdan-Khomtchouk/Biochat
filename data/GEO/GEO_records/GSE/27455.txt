TITLE
Wnt and Tcf3-mediated regulation of gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The observation that Tcf3 (MGI name: Tcf7l1) bound the same genes as core stem cell transcription factors, Oct4 (MGI name:Pou5f1), Sox2 and Nanog, revealed a potentially important aspect of the poorly understood mechanism whereby Wnts stimulate self renewal of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.  Although the conventional view of Tcf proteins as the β-catenin-binding effectors of Wnt signaling suggested Tcf3 should activate target genes in response to Wnts, here we show that Wnt3a and Tcf3 effectively antagonize each other’s effects on gene expression. Genetic ablation of Tcf3 caused similar effects as treating cells with recombinant Wnt3a. Moreover, Tcf3 was not necessary for Wnt3a-stimulation of gene expression as the majority of Wnt3a-stimulated genes exhibited a greater increase in Tcf3-/- ES cells than in Tcf3+/+ ES cells. These expression data, together with genetic experiments, show that Wnt3a stimulates ES cell self renewal by inhibiting Tcf3.

DESIGN
Tcf3+/+ and Tcf3-/- mouse embryonic stem cells were cultured in self renewal conditions containing recombinant Wnt3a for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
