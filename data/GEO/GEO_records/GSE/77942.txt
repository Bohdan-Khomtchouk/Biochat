TITLE
Human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) exposed to cigarette smoke extract

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human alveolar epithelial cells were exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) for 1, 3  and 5 weeks at 1%, 5% and 10%, and gene expression was evaluated by complete transcriptome microarrays. In this study we explored the effect of cigarette smoke on the gene expression profile.

DESIGN
Human alveolar epithelial cells stimulated with three different concentractions of CSE (1%, 5% and 10%) and for 1, 3 and 5 weeks were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
