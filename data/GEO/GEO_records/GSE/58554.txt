TITLE
Global analysis of photosynthesis transcriptional regulatory networks [Expression profiling]

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides

SUMMARY
To gain a deeper understanding of the transcription factors that regulate photosynthesis in Rhodobacter sphaeroides global gene expression analysis was used to determine the expression profiles of the deletion mutants of 4 transcription factors (FnrL, PrrA, CrpK and RSP_2888) known or predicted to be involved in the regulation of photosynthesis.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis conducted for deletion strains of 4 transcription factors known or predicted to be involved in the regulation of photosynthesis in Rhodobacter sphaeroides using the R. sphaeroides Affymetrix gene chip. These deletion mutant expression profiles were compared to that of wild type cells to determine differentially expressed genes regulated by these transcription factors.
