TITLE
Gene Expression in Bone-marrow derived Dendritic Cells stimulated with H. pylori lysate vs. E. coli lysate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene Expression changes in BMDCs stimulated with H. pylori vs. E. coli. The hypothesis tested was that the gene expression profile in BMDCs stimulated with H. pylori lysate will be less inflammatory than BMDCs stimulated with E. coli.

DESIGN
BMDCs were generated from bone marrow of wild type female C57BL/6 mice using 100ng/mL Flt3L. DCs were harvested at day 8 and stimulated with either media alone, H. pylori antigen lysate or E. coli lysate. At 24 hours, the cells were harvested and RNA was isolated for microarray analysis.
