TITLE
Desiccation and control transcriptomes of Rhodococcus jostii RHA1

ORGANISM
Rhodococcus jostii RHA1

SUMMARY
Here we report the first transcriptomic analysis of a Gram-positive bacterium to desiccation.  Filtered RHA1 cells incubated at either low relative humidity (20%), as an air drying treatment, or high relative humidity (100%), as a control, were transcriptionally profiled over a comprehensive time series. Keywords: stress response time course

DESIGN
Three biological replicates from both the desiccation and control experiments were analyzed using two-colour microarrays.  Over a time series for each experiment, Cy-labelled cDNA from treated and time-zero cells were hybridized, with a dye swap for one of the replicates.
