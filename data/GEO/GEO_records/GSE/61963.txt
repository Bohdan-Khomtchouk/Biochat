TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Hammondia hammondi and Toxoplasma gondii sporulated oocysts

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii ; Hammondia hammondi

SUMMARY
To date little is known about the transcriptome of Hammondia hammondi, the nearest extant relative of Toxoplasma gondii.  In this study we used an existing microarray to query Toxoplasma gondii and Hammondia hammondi transcript abundance in sporulated oocysts.

DESIGN
Oocysts of the VEG strain of Toxoplasma gondii, and the HhCatGer041 strain of Hammondia hammondi, were isolated from cat feces by sucrose flotation, and sporulated for ~3-6 months in 2% sulfuric acid.  RNA was isolated from Bleach-treated oocyst preparations using the Trizol reagent.  RNA was biotinylated for hybridization to Toxo 169 Affymetrix chips using the Illumina Total Prep RNA labeling kit (Ambion).  For each species 3 separate RNA isolations were performed on the same batch of oocysts and hybridized to individual microarrays.
