TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Hammondia hammondi and Toxoplasma gondii sporulated oocysts

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
To date little is known about the transcriptome of Hammondia hammondi, the nearest extant relative of Toxoplasma gondii.  In this study we used an existing microarray to query Toxoplasma gondii and Hammondia hammondi transcript abundance in sporulated oocysts.
