TITLE
Gene expression profiles associated with pediatric relapsed AML

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In high income countries 90% of the patients achieve complete remission after induction chemotherapy. However, 30-40% of these patients suffer from relapse. These patients face a dismal prognosis, as the majority ( > 60%) of relapsed patients die within 5 years. As a result, outcome for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients remains poor and has stabilized over the past 15 years. To prevent or better treat relapse of AML is the best option to improve outcome. Despite patient specific differences, most patients do respond to initial therapy. This suggests that at relapse, mechanisms are active that cause the altered response to chemotherapy. Detailed understanding of mechanisms that cause relapse remain largely elusive. To gain insight in the molecular pathways that characterize relapsed AML, we performed genome wide gene expression profiling on paired initial diagnosis and relapsed AML samples of 23 pediatric AML patients. We used pathway analysis to find which molecular pathways are involved in altered gene expression between diagnosis and relapse samples of individual AML patients.

DESIGN
23 paired diagnosis and relapse bone marrow or peripheral blood samples were collected and cryo-preserved. They were later thawed and processed for hybridization to Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.
