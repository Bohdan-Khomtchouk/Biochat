TITLE
Differential expression of microRNA and snoRNA of normal mucosa in patients with solitary and synchronous primary colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We evaluated the expression profile of miRNA and snoRNA of normal mucosa in five patients with synchronous CRCs and seven patients with solitary CRCs using the Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 1.0 array. We found that global dysregulated miRNAs and snoRNAs in normal mucosa between solitary and synchronous CRC. Our findings represent the first comprehensive miRNA and snoRNA expression signatures in normal mucosa between solitary and synchronous CRC, which increases the understanding of the molecular basis of synchronous CRC, and firstly implicates the difference of genetic background in patients with solitary and synchronous CRC.
