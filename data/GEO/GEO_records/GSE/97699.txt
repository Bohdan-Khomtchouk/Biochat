SUMMARY
12plex_vitis_2011-02 - 12plex_vitis_2011_02_48h - Biological question (15 lines max): Identification of grape genes regulated in response to resistance inducer treatments. This transcriptomic analysis should provide insight in the mode of action of the compounds under study and yield generic data relevant to grape defense reaction. - The experiment took place in the greenhouse. Six week-herbaceous grape cutting (cv Marselan) were spray-treated with 5 resistance inducers, an adjuvant (used along with some inducers) and water as control. Plants were inoculated by Plasmopara viticola (downy midew) 24 h post-treatment. We used 5 plants per treatment. Leaf samples were harvested 24 h post-treatment and 48 h post-inoculation. Three biological repetitions were done. Each hybridization experiment was performed in comparison with water.

DESIGN
18 dye-swap - normal vs disease comparison
