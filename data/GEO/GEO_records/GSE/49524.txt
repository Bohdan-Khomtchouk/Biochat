TITLE
Differential expression profiles of human primary endothelial cells (HUVECs) from umbilical cords of Gestational Diabetic mothers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary endothelial cells from umbilical cord vein (HUVEC) obtained at delivery from gestational diabetic (GD) women, represent an expedient model for the study of the effects of chronic HG in vivo. In fetal tissues genome-wide epigenetic changes are likely to occur with specific long term and even trans-generational effects. We have utilized this model to study the effects of chronic hyperglycemia on the transcriptome and to verify the presence of specific epigenetic changes associated to chronic HG in vascular cells.

DESIGN
HUVEC cells from Umbilical cords of 3 Caucasian Gestational Diabetes women  were compared with HUVEC cells from umbilical of from 3 Caucasian non diabetic women matching for age and Body Mass Index. [sample collection] Umbilical cords were obtained from 3 Caucasian Gestational diabetes  women (diagnosed not later than 28 th gestational week - gw) and from 3 Caucasian non diabetic women matching for age and Body Mass Index (BMI). All pregnants signed an informed consent. All donors were normotensive, and underwent a 100 g 3 hours Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) between the 24 -34th gw. Each woman performed a 7 points-blood glucose monitoring on 3 days at week 34 -36th gw.
