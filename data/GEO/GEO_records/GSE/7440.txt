TITLE
Early Response and Outcome in High-Risk Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Childrenâ€™s Oncology Group Study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cure rate for childhood ALL has improved considerably in part because therapy is routinely tailored to the predicted risk of relapse. Various clinical and laboratory variables are used in current risk-stratification schemes, but many children who fail therapy lack adverse prognostic factors at initial diagnosis. Using gene expression analysis, we have identified genes and pathways in a NCI high-risk childhood B-precursor ALL cohort at diagnosis that may play a role in early blast regression as correlated with the Day 7 marrow status. We have also identified a 47-probeset signature (representing 41 unique genes) that was predictive of long term outcome in our dataset as well as three large independent datasets of childhood ALL treated on different protocols. Keywords: ordered, case-control

DESIGN
Diagnostic marrow samples from 99 children with NCI high risk B-precursor ALL  treated on the protocol COG 1961 were analyzed. To study genetic profiles associated with early response to therapy, 82 of the total 99 patients were analyzed: 42 patients with a M1 marrow at day 7 of therapy were compared to 40 patients with a M3 marrow at day 7. To study the genes associated with long-term outcome, expression profiles of 59 (of the total 99) patients were analyzed: 28 patients who remained in complete continuous remission (CCR) for at least 4 years and 31 patients who suffered a bone marrow relapse within the first 3 years of initial diagnosis. Forty-two patients were common in both the early response and outcome analyses.
