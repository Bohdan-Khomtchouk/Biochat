TITLE
Ebf1 ChIP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ebf1 is a key determinant of B-lymphocyte specification. In order to identify unknown transcriptional targets, endogenous Ebf1 was isolated by chromatin-IP from primary pro-B cells and the copurified DNA was hybridized to promoter tiling arrays.

DESIGN
Ebf1 was ChIPed using a polyclonal antibody directed against an N-terminal peptide from primary pro-B cells grown in the presence of Il7. The resulting DNA was analyzed by tiling array hybridization.
