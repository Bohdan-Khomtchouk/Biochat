TITLE
Murine CD8 T cell gene expression in reponse to type I interferon

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate type I interferon regulated genes in CD8+ T cells, we used microarray analyses after stimulation of primary murine T cell cultures. Negatively sorted T cells from naive C57Bl/6 mice were incubated with PBS or anti-CD3 in presence or absence of type I interferon (IFN-4a, 500U/mL). After 6h total RNA was extracted from the primary T cell cultures and microarrays were performed after RNA quality control. Among significantly regulated genes, we identified NK cell receptor ligands to be affected by exposure to type I interferon.

DESIGN
10^6 negatively sorted CD8+ T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody in the presence or absence of IFN-4a. Additionally, CD8+ cells were mock treated with PBS in the presence or absence of IFN-4a. After 6h, total RNA was extracted from cell suspensions and microarray analyses were performed. All experiments were carried out in triplicates.
