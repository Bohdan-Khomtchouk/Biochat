TITLE
Expression data from Soybean leaves under drought stress and normally irrigated

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
BiP overexpression confers resistance to drought, through an as yet unknown mechanism that is related to ER functioning, has been described  that the delay in leaf senescence by BiP overexpression might relate to the absence of the response to drought. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying in soybean leaves overexpressing BiP and with different water potentials to elucidate the mechanisms by which BiP protects plant cells against cell death induced by dehydration.

DESIGN
BiP overexpressing plants and wild type as a control were subjected to dry slowly for 25 days. Third or fourth trifoliate leaves were collected from plants in water potential next 1.0 MPa, 1.5 MPa and 1.7 MPa for test weak and strong stress and subject RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays maintaining the hybridization of two chips per treatment.
