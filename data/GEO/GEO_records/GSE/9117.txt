ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Uterine tissue is highly responsive to estrogen, which plays a mayor role in sympathetic innervation remodeling in myometrium Microarrays were used to investigate which estrogen resposive myometrial proteins can be involved in innervation modulation Keywords: control vs. treatment, timepoints

DESIGN
