TITLE
The development of microRNA expression profile of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after exposed to HCCLM3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we have employed whole microRNA microarray to see the microRNA expression changes of HUVECs after exposed to HCCLM3 cells

DESIGN
examine the microRNA expression profile of HUVECs in the absence or presence of human HCC cells
