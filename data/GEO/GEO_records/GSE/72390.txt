TITLE
The olfactory transcriptome and progression of sexual maturation in homing chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus keta

SUMMARY
This study aimed at providing insights into the hypothesized functional link between olfactory sensing of the spawning ground and final sexual maturation. We have therefore assessed the presence and expression levels of olfactory genes by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of the olfactory rosettes in homing chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta Walbaum from the coastal sea to 75 km upstream the rivers at the pre-spawning ground. RNAseq revealed the expression of 75 known and 27 unknown salmonid olfactory genes of which 13 genes were differentially expressed between fish from the pre-spawning area and from the coastal area, suggesting an important role of these genes in homing. Olfactomedins and ependymin are candidates among the differentially expressed genes that may connect olfactory reception to the expression of sgnrh to regulate final maturation.

DESIGN
Deep-sequencing transcriptome analysis of twelve chum salmon olfactory rosette RNA samples: three females and three males from the pre-spawning area and three females and three males from the coastal area.
