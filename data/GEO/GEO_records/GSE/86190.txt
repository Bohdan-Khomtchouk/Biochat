TITLE
Effect daunorubicin treatment on the transcriptome of HCT116 cells [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq to measure the transcriptome of HCT116 in response to the DNA damaging agent daunorubicin

DESIGN
HCT116 cells were treated for 8h with 250 nM daunorubicin or  with vehicle
