TITLE
Effect daunorubicin treatment on the transcriptome of HCT116 cells [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq to measure the transcriptome of HCT116 in response to the DNA damaging agent daunorubicin

DESIGN
HCT116 cells were treated for 8h with 250 nM daunorubicin or  with vehicle

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
