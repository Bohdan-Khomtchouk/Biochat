TITLE
RNAseq transcriptome data from reprogramming human CD34+ cells to iPS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We reprogrammed human CD34+ cells from cord blood using a lentiviral vector encoding OCT4, SOX2 and KLF4.We collected RNA from parental CD34+ cells (3samples), reprogramming timepoints (9 timepoints), iPS clones derived from this experiment (6 clones), and human ES cell lines (9 samples). All samples were sequenced at 100bp reads.

DESIGN
Endogenous retroelement expression during reprogramming

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
