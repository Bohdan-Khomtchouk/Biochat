TITLE
Inositol regulation with Cryptococcus neoformans JEC21 70-mer whole genome array

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans JEC21

SUMMARY
Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common cause of fungal meningitis, with high mortality and morbidity. The reason for the frequent occurrence of Cryptococcus infection in the central nervous system (CNS) is poorly understood. In this study, we find that inositol plays an important role in the transversal of Cryptococcus across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) both in an in vitro human BBB model and in vivo animal models. The inositol stimulation of BBB crossing is dependent upon fungal inositol transporters. The upregulation of genes involved in the inositol catabolism pathway is evident in a microarray analysis. The expression of CPS1, a gene encoding the hyaluronic acid synthase in Cryptococcus, is also upregulated by the inositol treatment. The production of hyaluronic acid increased in cells treated with inositol, which leads to the enhanced binding ability of Cryptococcus cells to the human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) constituting the BBB. Overall, our studies provide a mechanism for inositol-dependent Cryptococcus transversal of the BBB, supporting our hypothesis that host inositol utilization by the fungus contributes to Cryptococcus CNS infection.
