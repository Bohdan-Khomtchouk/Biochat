TITLE
Expression profiling of wild-type Arabidopsis and an activation-tagged jaz7-1D line.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Jasmonate (JA) signaling plays a key role in mediating both resistance and susceptibility to the root-infecting fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. Within this system, the roles of the JA-signaling repressor gene family of JASMONATE ZIM-domain (JAZ) genes had not been investigated. By screening JAZ T DNA insertion lines for altered resistance or susceptibility to F. oxysporum, we identified a JAZ7 mutant (jaz7-1D) highly susceptible to F. oxysporum infection. Further analyses revealed jaz7-1D exhibits constitutively active JAZ7 expression, enhanced expression of JA-defense marker genes, and increased sensitivity to JA-inhibition of root elongation. To further explore altered JA-signaling and JA-responses in this mutant, we use whole transcriptome profiling of jaz7-1D versus wild-type (Col-0) plants after mock/control and JA treatment.

DESIGN
We grew both WT and jaz7-1D plants for four weeks in soil. After four weeks the plants were treated with 1 mL of 5% MeJA (dissolved in 100% ethanol) or 1 mL of Mock solution (100% ethanol) by applying the solutions to a cotton ball attached to a tray cover which was then used to enclose individual trays. Each tray and cover was then sealed by two layers of opaque plastic bags and secured with masking tape. There were four independent replicates of each treatment and each replicate contained leaf tissue from 20 plants. Each replicate (16 in total) was harvested after 6 hours and the resulting RNA was used for hybridization to an Affymetrix ATH1 chip.
