TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana three hours after infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study focuses on responses of the host plant to infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Genome wide changes in gene expression were integrated with the alterations in metabolite levels three hours after inoculation of agrobacteria. Plants were infected with the virulent strain C58, harboring a T-DNA, or with strain GV3101, containing a disarmed Ti-plasmid. This allows discrimination between signals which derive from the bacterial pathogen and the T-DNA encoded genes.
