TITLE
Transcript level coordination of carbon pathways during silicon starvation induced lipid accumulation in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana

ORGANISM
Thalassiosira pseudonana

SUMMARY
Nutrient-starvation induced lipid accumulation has been reported in diverse algae, including diatoms. Molecular mechanisms underlying lipid accumulation in nutrient-starved algae are of interest to inform genetic engineering strategies aimed at improving lipid productivity. Diatom cell walls are made of nanostructured silica which is a unique feature of the group and silicon deprivation induces both growth arrest and lipid accumulation. In this work, we report the whole cell transcript level response during silicon starvation induced lipid accumulation.

DESIGN
Analyzed mRNA from cells after 0, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 hr of silicon starvation using the Affymetrix GeneChip whole genome tiling array. Initial analysis of gene level expression was performed using the Affymetrix Expression Console Software, version 1.1. No biological replicates were performed. 0 hr is used as a reference point.
