TITLE
Expression data from neural crest cells and neural crest cell-derived MSCs from human pluripotent stem cells of FOP patients and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NCCs and NCC-derived MSCs were induced from FOP-iPSCs and control iPSCs, and their expresion profiles were compared.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expressions among hiPSCs, hESCs, hNCCs and hNC-MSCs from FOP-iPSCs and control-iPSCs.
