TITLE
Renal medullary genes in salt-sensitive hypertension

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Substitution of chromosome 13 from Brown Norway BN/SsNHsd/Mcw (BN/Mcw) rats into the Dahl salt-sensitive SS/JrHsd/Mcw (SS/Mcw) rats resulted in substantial reduction of blood pressure salt sensitivity in this consomic rat strain designated SSBN13. In the present study, we attempted to identify genes associated with salt-sensitive hypertension by utilizing a custom, known-gene cDNA microarray to compare the mRNA expression profiles in the renal medulla (a tissue playing a pivotal role in long-term blood pressure regulation) of SS/Mcw and SSBN13 rats on either low-salt (0.4% NaCl) or high-salt (4% NaCl, 2 wk) diets. Keywords: Dahl S rat; blood pressure; kidney; consomic rats

DESIGN
To increase the reliability of microarray data, we designed a four-way comparison experiment incorporating several levels of replication and developed a conservative yet robust data analysis method. Using this approach, from the 1,751 genes examined (representing more than 80% of all currently known rat genes), we identified 80 as being differentially expressed in at least 1 of the 4 comparisons.
