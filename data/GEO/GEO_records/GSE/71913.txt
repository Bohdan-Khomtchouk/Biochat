TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of uncapped and cleaved transcripts reveals a role for the nuclear messenger RNA cap-binding complex in plant co-translational RNA decay

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
RNA turnover is necessary for controlling proper mRNA levels post-transcriptionally. In general, RNA degradation is via exoribonucleases that degrade RNA either from the 5’ end to the 3’ end, such as XRN4, or in the opposite direction by the multi-subunit exosome complex. Here, we use genome-wide mapping of uncapped and cleaved transcripts to reveal the global landscape of co-translational mRNA decay in the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome. We found that this process leaves a clear three nucleotide periodicity in open reading frames. This pattern of co-translational degradation is especially evident near the ends of open reading frames, where we observe accumulation of cleavage events focused 16 to 17 nucleotides upstream of the stop codon because of ribosomal pausing during translation termination. Following treatment of Arabidopsis plants with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide, cleavage events accumulate 13 to 14 nucleotides upstream of the start codon where initiating ribosomes have been stalled with these sequences in their P site. Further analysis in xrn4 mutant plants indicates that co-translational RNA decay is XRN4-dependent. Additionally, studies in plants lacking CAP-BINDING PROTEIN80/ABA HYPERSENSITIVE1, the largest subunit of the nuclear mRNA cap-binding complex, reveal a role for this protein in co-translational decay. In total, our results demonstrate the global prevalence and features of co-translational RNA decay in a plant transcriptome.
