TITLE
Ploidy influences the cellular responses of gross chromosomal rearrangements in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of the ploidy on cellular response in strains carrying various types of gross chromosomal rearrangements.

DESIGN
Fourteen mutated strains (6 haploid strains and 8 diploid strains) were compared to their associated parental strain (haploid or diploid parental strain). For each comparison, 2 microarray experiments implying biological replicates were performed.
