TITLE
Skeletal myoblasts protect cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress via c-Met and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent paracrine pathways

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To study the effect of myoblast-derived paracrine factors on cardiomyocyte gene expression, microarray analysis was performed from isolated rat fetal cardiomyocyte cultures. These cultures were treated for 24 hours with fresh culture medium (control), skeletal myoblast-conditioned medium, or cardiac fibroblast-conditioned medium.

DESIGN
In total, 3 samples were analyzed.
