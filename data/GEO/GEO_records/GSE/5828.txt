TITLE
Gene expression profiling classifies lung squamous cell carcinomas with N1 positive lymph nodes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using gene expression microarrays, we tested whether lung SCCs that have metastasised to loco-regional lymph nodes (N1/2m) are different to those that directly invade and involve local nodes (N1d). Using 22,323 element microarrays, a non-parametric test identified 126 genes/transcripts that discriminated between N0 (n=35) and N1/2m (n=16) tumours (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.01). Hiearchical clustering of all 59 tumours (including 8 N1d tumours) demonstrated the N1d tumours clustered with the N0 tumours rather than the N1/2m tumours. Next, we built class prediction models from the 35 N0 tumours and 16 N1/2m tumours to predict the class of N1d tumours. All models consistently classified N1d tumours as similar to N0 tumours. This could explain some of the variable response of some N1 tumours to adjuvant chemotherapy, and suggest refinement of the TNM " N " stage nomenclature to adjust for this biological observation to ensure appropriate patients benefit from treatment.
