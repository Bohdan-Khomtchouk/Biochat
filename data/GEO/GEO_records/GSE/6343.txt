TITLE
Gene expression during oosporogenesis in Phytophthora

ORGANISM
Phytophthora infestans

SUMMARY
A screen for genes induced during sexual development was performed in the heterothallic oomycete Phytophthora infestans, the potato blight agent.  Of 15,644 unigenes on the Affymetrix chip, 87 were induced > 10-fold during mating, with 28 induced > 100-fold.  This was subsequently validated in independent matings using RNA blots and RT-PCR. Keywords: Developmental stage comparison
