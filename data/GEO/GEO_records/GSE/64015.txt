TITLE
Changes in gene expression caused by RhoH/TTF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RhoH/TTF is upregulated in eosinophils by exposure to cytokines. To find out which genes are regulated by RhoH, we investigated changes in gene expression in eosinophilic HL-60c15 cells overexpressing RhoH

DESIGN
HL-60c15 transduced with 4-OHT (4-hydroxytamoxifen)-inducible llentiviral constructs coding for RhoH (HL-60-RhoH) were treated or not treated with 4-OHT. 4-OHT-treated HL-60c15 cells transduced with a GFP control construct (HL-60-GFP) were included as an additional controls. Analysis was performed on 3 biological replicates
