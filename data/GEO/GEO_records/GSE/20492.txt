TITLE
Daoy gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using measurements of absolute protein and mRNA concentrations in cellular lysate from a Daoy medulloblastoma cell line, we quantitatively evaluate the influence of absolute transcript levels and a large number of sequence-encoded regulatory elements on steady-state human protein expression levels.

DESIGN
mRNA profiling: We prepared two biological replicates, each one was used in a 4-plex format array.
