TITLE
Transcriptional termini of genes on chromosomes 21-22 (RNA mapping)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of these experiments was to determine the 5' and 3' transcriptional termini of genes on chromosomes 21-22. Towards this end, we mapped the poly A + RNA isolated from 12 normal tissues and four cell lines. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
polyA+ RNAs from 11 tissues (Brain Frontal Lobe, Brain Hippocampus, Brain Hypothalamus, Cerebellum, Ovary, Placenta, Prostate, Testis, Fetal Kidney, Fetal Spleen, Fetal Thymus; all from BD Clontech) and 5 cell lines (GM06990, HeLaS3, HepG2, K562, tert-BJ) using the BD SMARTTM RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Clontech Cat. No.634914). A single array with no replicates was run for each sample with a pool of ~23-24 RACE reactions per sample.
