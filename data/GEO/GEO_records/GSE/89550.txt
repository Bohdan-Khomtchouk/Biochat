TITLE
A new model for long-range chromatin reorganization linked to enhancer activation [Agilent_ChIP]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The most prominent model for long-range enhancer regulation involves direct enhancer-promoter interaction by looping out the intervening chromatin. Using a synthetic biology approach, we have determined that a chromatin unfolding bteween Shh and its enhancers is regulated specifically by the Shh-Brain-Enhancers and is mediated by the recruitment of Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1.  This ‘chromatin unfolding’ model represents a new mechanism of long-range enhancer-promoter communication in addition to the looping and tracking models. ChIP-on-chip for H3K27me3 on the Shh regulatory region on ESCs and transfected ESCs and NPC showed no loss of Polycomb marks upon Shh activation.
