TITLE
The impact of exposure to serum lipids during in vitro culture on the transcriptome of bovine blastocysts

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
EtOH-Lipid form serum have been added in BSA-supplemented SOF during post-compaction development of IVP bovine embryos. Lipid-treated blastocysts were compared with control treated blastocysts (no lipid addition to BSA, EtOH balanced).

DESIGN
Amplified anti-sense RNA from each sample (4 pools of control and 4 pools of treated blastocysts) were labeled then hybridized on oligonucleotide microarrays following a dye-swap design (ex: pool 1 ctl in red vs. pool 1 treatment in green and then pool 1 ctl in green vs. pool 1 treatment in red).

PLATFORM
GPL13226 Agilent-028298 Embryogene Bovine 45K microarray
