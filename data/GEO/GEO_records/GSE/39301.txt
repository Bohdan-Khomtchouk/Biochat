TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of Xbp1s effect on gene expression in liver by Doxycycline induced TRE-Xbp1s overexpression in mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of Xbp1s overexpression in liver after 24 hr indution or 48 hr induction in LIXs mouse. As a control, WT mice after 2 hr refeed and 24 hr fast without refeed are used for analysis of postprandial gene expression. This microarray study was used to screen for target genes activated by Xbp1s in liver. Results provide important information for the role of Xbp1s during postprandial.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from liver tissues from mice on Dox200 chow diet for 24 hr or 48 hr. Mice were fasted for 6 hr before sacrifice for liver.
