TITLE
Microarray gene-expression profiles of 45 matching pairs of pancreatic tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 45 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify biologically relevant tumor markers with prognostic significance, we set out to analyze gene expression profiling of tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from PDAC cases. We compared the microarray gene-expression profiles of 45 matching pairs of pancreatic tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues. This data set were used to obtained genes that were differentially expressed and associated with survival. 51 genes were selected for further validation.

DESIGN
90 total samples were analyzed. We compared gene expression profile of 45 pairs of pancreatic tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays.  Tumor gene expression profiles were distinctly different from non-tumor profiles. Using ANOVA in PartekÂ®, 7352 independent genes were found to be differentially expressed in tumors (P < 0.01). We next performed Cox-regression analysis and identified 928 of the differentially expressed genes that were associated with survival (P < 0.1). The list of genes was then subjected to pathway and biomarker analyses using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA). Based on literatures supporting their roles in cancer, 51 genes were selected for further analyses
