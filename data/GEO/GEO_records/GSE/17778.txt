TITLE
ENCODE Tier2 cell phenotyping study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These samples are part of the ENCODE consortiumâ€™s proposed time-limited Pilot Study for confirmation of the utility of RNA abundance measurements as a standard reference phenotyping tool. Keywords: cell type comparison For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
Each of the 7 ENCODE laboratories submitted biological triplicates for at least one of the four Tier2 cell lines. These were processed on Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST arrays to obtain phenotyping data for each cell ine.
