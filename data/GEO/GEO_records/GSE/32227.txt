TITLE
Comparison of Sox9-EGFP cell type transcriptomes during irradiation-induced crypt regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of intestinal epithelial cells expressing either Negative, Sublow, Low or High levels of the Sox9-EGFP reporter transgene FACS-isolated from jejunum of non-irradiated mice or at 5 days after 14Gy abdominal irradiation.

DESIGN
4 distinct cell populations, FACS-isolated based on expression levels of the Sox9-EGFP reporter transgene (Sox9-EGFP Negative, Sublow, Low and High cells); 2 conditions: Non-irradiated vs Irradiated; Biological replicates: 7 independent non-irradiated mice and 3 independent irradiated (studied at day 5 post-irradiation) mice
