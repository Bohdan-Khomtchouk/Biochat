TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of seasonal and individual variation in blood transcriptomes of healthy captive bottlenose dolphins

ORGANISM
Tursiops truncatus

SUMMARY
Four captive bottlenose dolpins housed in Kona, Hawaii, were serially sampled at approximately monthly intervals over the course of one year, in order to establish baseline information on the content and variation of the dolphin blood transcriptome.

DESIGN
Illumina based RNA-seq analyses were carried out on globin-depleted RNA from blood using the Ensembl dolphin genome as a guide.  The data set was interrogated for transcripts exhibiting circa-annual rhymthicity, differential expression by season or sex, or correlation to hematological parameters
