TITLE
Expression data from OCUBM cells trasfected with 12G FEZL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes that influence resistance to mastitis, we scanned a whole genome of 181 susceptible and 297 resistant cows and revealed significant linkage to Bos taurus autosomal chromosome (BTA) 21 with a likelihood of odds (LOD) score of 28. Because FEZL is a transcription factor that influences resistance to mastitis, we compared LOD scores of BTA21 among cows carrying 12G/12G, 12G/13G, and 12G/13GFEZL to evaluate whether FEZL affects linkage in this chromosome. Cows carrying 13G/13GFEZL had the most significant linkage with a LOD score of 35, despite a decrease in the number of samples from 478 to 224. This finding suggested that the gene influencing resistance to mastitis on BTA21 might be controlled by FEZL. To investigate genes that might influence resistance to mastitis through FEZL, we screened human breast cancer-derived OCUB-M cells transfected with expression vector encoding 12GFEZL using microarray analysis. Keywords: overexpression comparison

DESIGN
OCUBM cells were transfected with/without 12G FEZL for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
