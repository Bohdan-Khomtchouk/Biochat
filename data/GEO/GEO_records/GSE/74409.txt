TITLE
Molecular function of Prdm1/Blimp1 in trophoblast giant cell differentiation.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of wild-type and Prdm1 null mouse trophoblast giant cell cultures using Illumina whole genome mouse V2 arrays. The hypothesis tested was that Prdm1/Blimp1 regulates expression of genes required for spiral artery trophoblast giant cell function.

DESIGN
Prdm1 null and littermate control wild-type trophoblast stem cell clones were generated from blastocyst outgrowths.  Total RNA was obtained from multiple replicates of four wild-type TS cell clones and four Prdm1 null TS cell clones differenitated for zero, two, four and six days by growth factor withdrawal and hybridized to Illumina WG6_V2 arrays

PLATFORM
