TITLE
Therapy-induced PML nuclear body re-formation and p53 activation trigger acute promyelocytic leukaemia cure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The therapy-induced PML/RARA catabolism elicits the loss of APL-initiating cell self-renewal through PML NB reformation and P53 activation. These results explain the curative activity of the RA/arsenic combination, the resistance to RA of PLZF/RARA-driven APLs and they raise the prospect that activation of this PML/P53 checkpoint might have therapeutic values in other malignancies.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of 36 transgenic induced APL and 36 viral transduction APL were hybridized using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays

PLATFORM
