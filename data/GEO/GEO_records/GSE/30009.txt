TITLE
Multidrug Resistance-Linked Gene Signature Predicts Overall Survival of Patients with Primary Ovarian Serous Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study assesses the ability of multidrug resistance (MDR)-associated gene expression patterns to predict survival in patients with newly diagnosed carcinoma of the ovary. The scope of this research differs substantially from that of previous reports, as a very large set of genes was evaluated whose expression has been shown to affect response to chemotherapy.

DESIGN
We applied a customized TaqMan Low-Density Array, a highly sensitive and specific assay, to study the expression profiles of 380 MDR-linked genes in 80 tumor specimens collected at initial surgery to debulk primary serous carcinoma of Mullerian origin. The RNA expression profiles of these drug resistance genes were correlated with clinical outcomes.
