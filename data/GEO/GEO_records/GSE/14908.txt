TITLE
Global expression profiling of CD4 T-cell responses to house dust mite allergens in human atopics and nonatopics.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to employ a systems-level analysis to elucidate gene expression networks operating in the CD4 T-cell responses which underpin human atopic disease. Keywords: Disease state analysis; T-cell response

DESIGN
The study design consisted of 45 subjects, including 30 HDM-sensitized atopics, and 15 nonatopic controls. For each subject, gene expression was profiled in paired samples of HDM-stimulated CD4 T-cells and in unstimulated CD4 T-cells (baseline control), thus the microarray data set consists of 90 microarrays.
