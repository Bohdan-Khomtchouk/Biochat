TITLE
Evaluating cross-hybridization of murine cDNA to the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 chipset

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic studies of human tumor xenografts are complicated by the presence of murine cellular mRNA. As such, it is useful to know the extent to which mouse mRNA cross-hybridizes to any given array platform. In this study, murine cDNA samples from diverse sources were hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. In this regard it is possible to identify specific probes that are potential targets of cross-species interference.

DESIGN
Array data was generated for 5 different mouse cDNAs and 5 different human cDNAs hybridized to human Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 arrays [3 replicates for each biological sample]. Samples included A) mouse and B) human universal RNA (Strategene, La Jolla, CA), C) B16F10 murine melanoma tumor and D) skin from same model [C57BL/6 mice] E) COLON-26 murine tumor xenograft and F) skin from same model [Balb/C mice] G) NCI-H522 human lung carcinoma xenograft and H) skin from same model (nude mice) I) LOX-IMVI human melanoma xenograft and J) skin from same model (nude mice).
