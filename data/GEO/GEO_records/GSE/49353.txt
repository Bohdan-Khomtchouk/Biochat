TITLE
Evaluating cross-hybridization of murine cDNA to the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 chipset

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic studies of human tumor xenografts are complicated by the presence of murine cellular mRNA. As such, it is useful to know the extent to which mouse mRNA cross-hybridizes to any given array platform. In this study, murine cDNA samples from diverse sources were hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. In this regard it is possible to identify specific probes that are potential targets of cross-species interference.
