TITLE
Transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq of gastric cancer derived from the Cancer Institute Hospital of Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed the RNA-seq experiments for mRNA of gastric cancer tissue.

DESIGN
Messenger RNA were extracted from primary tumor of 32 gastric cancer patients, prepared with ilumina TruSeq RNA Access sample Preparation Kit and sequenced  on the illumina HiSeq 2000 and 2500. > > Raw data are not available for this series due to patient privacy concerns. Furthermore, the raw data will not be available through controlled-access resources such as dbGaP or EGA. The IRB prohibits public access to the raw data. < <

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
