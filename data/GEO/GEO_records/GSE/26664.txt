TITLE
DNA sequencing of selected Globobulimina pseudospinescens organisms

ORGANISM
Globobulimina pseudospinescens

SUMMARY
We introduce FACIL ( ), a fast, reliable tool to evaluate nucleic acid sequences for non-standard codes that detects alternative genetic codes even in species distantly related to known organisms. Results are visualized in a Genetic Code Logo. To illustrate the use of our method, we analysed several contigs derived from the mitochondrial genome of the foraminifer Globobulimina pseudospinescens. These are particularly challenging data, as the genome is highly fragmented and incomplete. Approximately 10,000 single-cell Globobulimina pseudospinescens organisms were isolated by hand from Gullmar Fjord Sweden sediment. After washing, total DNA was extracted and sequenced by Illumina sequencing. The reads were assembled using Edena. To illustrate the use of our method, we analysed several contigs derived from the mitochondrial genome of the foraminifer Globobulimina pseudospinescens, an organism without any sequenced relatives in the databases. These are particularly challenging data, as the genome is highly fragmented and incomplete.
