Expression data from pulmonary arterial endothelial cells treated with siRNA control or siGLS in stiff or soft matrix

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dysregulation of vascular stiffness and cellular metabolism occur early in pulmonary hypertension (PH). Yet, the mechanisms by which biophysical properties of extracellular matrix relate to metabolic processes and downstream PH phenotypes remain undefined. In cultured endothelial and smooth muscle cells and confirmed in PH-diseased human samples, we found that ECM stiffening activates the mechanosensitive factors YAP/TAZ to increase glycolysis and induce glutaminase (GLS) expression and glutaminolysis. Glutaminolysis replenishes aspartate for anabolic biosynthesis, thus sustaining proliferation and migration within stiff ECM. In vitro GLS inhibition blocks aspartate production, consequently reprogramming entire cellular proliferative pathways, while aspartate restores proliferation. In a rat model in vivo, GLS inhibition prevents hemodynamic and histologic manifestations of PH. Thus, mechanical ECM stiffening sustains vascular cell growth and migration through YAP/TAZ-dependent glutaminolysis â€“ a paradigm that advances our understanding of the connections of mechanical stimuli with dysregulated vascular metabolism and identifies new metabolic drug targets in PH. We used microarrays to decipher the global program of gene expression  involved in response to matrix stiffening and determined the implication of glutaminolysis (GLS) in these process

DESIGN
PAECs were transfected with an siRNA control (siNC) or a siRNA against GLS (siGLS) and cultivated on soft hydrogel (1kPa) or stiff hydrogel (50kPa). After 48h of transfection cells were lysate and RNA extract for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
