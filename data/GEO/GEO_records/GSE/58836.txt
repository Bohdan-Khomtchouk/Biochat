TITLE
Chromatin and signaling pathways in reprogramming

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Reprogramming intermediates (pre-iPSCs) were subjected to control DMSO, ascorbic acid (AA), 2i ( MAP kinase inhibitor + GSKinhibitor) or AA+2i conditions to assess conversion to the iinduced pluripotent stem cell state (iPSC) after 10days.

DESIGN
Pre-iPSC cells  exposed to control DMSO, AA, 2i or AA+2i were harvested on day 2 for RNA sequencing after treatment, in biological triplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
