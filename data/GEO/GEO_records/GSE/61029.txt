TITLE
Gene expression analysis of DBC1 KO B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DBC1 KO B cells were either unstimulated, activated with anti-IgM, anti-CD40 of LPS for 4 hours. Genes differentially expressed in DBC1 KO B cells were compared to WT B cells.

DESIGN
RNA was collected from unstimulated for stimulated B cells, and gene expression between WT and DBC1 KO B cells were compared
