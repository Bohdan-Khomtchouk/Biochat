TITLE
Genome-wide CNVs within and between breeds

ORGANISM
Canis lupus ; Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
This study used two different NimbleGen platforms to identify canine CNVs.  The first identifies genome-wide CNVs while the second genotypes all known canine CNVs in a large panel of dogs from multiple breeds.

DESIGN
The genome-wide microarray used was designed by NimbleGen.  The genotyping chip was created by tiling all available probes to all known CNVs identified here and in previous studies.

PLATFORM
GPL11333 NimbleGen Dog 137K 12plex CGH array (090529_CanFam_TN_CGH) GPL11335 NimbleGen Dog Whole-Genome CGH 2.1M Tiling Array (CanFam2_CGH_HX1)
