TITLE
Expression Profiling of Livers From Female FC-ob Mice and MRKO-ob Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Objective: To investigate the effects of myeloid MR deletion on hepatic gene expression profiles in female mice Methods: 12-week old female FC-ob and MRKO-ob mice were euthanized and livers were collected and snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen. Total RNA were extracted using Trizol. After assessing the RNA quality with an Agilent 2000 Bioanalyzer, cDNA library was constructed using TruSeq RNA-Seq Sample Prep Kits. Deep sequencing was carried out on Illumina HiSeq 2000. Different gene expressions were confirmed by QRT-PCR. Results: With RNA-seq data, we identified 24 genes that differently expressed in MRKO-ob mice compared to FC-ob group. Confirmation with QRT-PCR revealed that the differently expressed genes were closely associated with hepatic steatosis, especially de novo lipogenesis. Conclusions: Our study investigated for the first time the gene expression profiles of female ob/ob mice with or without myeloid MR ablation. These findings provided clues to explore the mechanisms underlied the crosstalk between macrophages and hepatocytes in females. These findings have provided new knowledge basis for potential new strategies to treat or prevent NAFLD and T2DM.
