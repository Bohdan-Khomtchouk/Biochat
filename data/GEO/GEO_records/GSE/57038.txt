TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of high grade glioma in Nestin-creERT2 and NG2-creERTM driven tumor suppressors knockout mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse model with P53f/f;Nf1f/+;Ptenf/+ configuration driven by Nestin-creERT2 and NG2-creERTM induced at 1 month postnatal forms high grade glioma in the brain. Tumors were harvested and total RNA were extracted for gene expression profile.

DESIGN
Three tumors were harvested from the Nestin-creERT2 mouse model and 5 tumors were harvested from the NG2-creERTM mouse model with desired genotype when mice show neurological symptomes. Three control brain tissue for each model were harvested at corresponding anatomical position in the control mice. Total RNA were extracted from the tumor tissue and control tissue
