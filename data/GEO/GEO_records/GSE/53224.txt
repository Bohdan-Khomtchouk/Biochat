Gene expression data from Wilms tumor samples

SUMMARY
Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma) is a pediatric kidney tumor that arises from renal progenitor cells. Since the blastemal type is associated with adverse prognosis, we characterized such Wilms tumors by exome and transcriptome analysis. We detected novel, recurrent somatic mutations affecting the SIX1/2 â€“ SALL1 pathway implicated in kidney development, the DROSHA/DGCR8 microprocessor genes as well as alterations in MYCN and TP53, the latter being strongly associated with dismal outcome. The DROSHA mutations impair the RNase III domains, while DGCR8 exhibits stereotypic E518K mutations in the RNA binding domain - both may skew miRNA representation. SIX1 and SIX2 mutations affect a single hotspot (Q177R) in the homeodomain indicative of a dominant effect. In larger cohorts, these mutations cluster in blastemal and chemotherapy-induced regressive tumors that likely derive from blastemal cells and these are characterized by generally higher SIX1/2 expression. These findings broaden the spectrum of human cancer genes and may open new avenues for stratification and therapeutic leads for Wilms tumors.

DESIGN
53 Wilms tumor samples were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.
