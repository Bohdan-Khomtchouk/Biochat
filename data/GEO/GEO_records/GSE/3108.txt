TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles of p63 null skin versus wild type skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the absence of p63 expression, the epidermis fails to commit to stratification, resulting in aborted skin development.  In this study, gene expression profiles of E18.5 p63 null and wt skin, were compared in an effort to identify genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by p63. Keywords: Genetically modified mice

DESIGN
E18.5 embryos were obtained from matings between p63 heterozygous mice.  RNA was isolated from the skin of two p63 null and two wild type embryos.
