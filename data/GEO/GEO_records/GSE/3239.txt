TITLE
A Compendium of Microarrays for Normal Human Cell Cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used DNA microarrays from multiple commercial  from GE Healthcare (formerly Amersham Biosciences) to measure the large-scale gene expression profiles for 61 normal human cell cultures of epithelial, endothelial, and muscle cells provided by Biowhittaker/Cambrex.  This compendium of baseline gene expression patterns for pure cell cultures provides an essential database for understanding the cellular mechanisms for the maintenance of stable cell types and for studying the transformation pathways from undifferentiated stem cells to terminally differentiated cell types. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
There are 61 samples.  Certain cell types have replicates.  These replicates are denoted by a number annexed to the end of the sample title/name.

PLATFORM
