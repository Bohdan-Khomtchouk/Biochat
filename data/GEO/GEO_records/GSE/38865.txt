TITLE
Activity of a stem cell enhancer influences stem cell programs and clinical outcome in leukaemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chip-chip data from primary human AML patient blasts, normal CD34+ HSCs, normal neutrophils and normal T cells with H3K9 and H3K27 antibodies. Gene expression profiling from primary human AML patient blasts and CD34+ normal cells. Analysis of the chromatin landscape of the ERG locus using H3K9 and H3K27 as markers of euchromatin and heterochromatin respectively. Analysis of ERG expression in AML patients with normal CD34+ HSCs as control.

DESIGN
Correlation of the activity of a stem cell enhancer at the ERG locus in AML primary patient blasts with their transcriptome and clinical outcome data.
