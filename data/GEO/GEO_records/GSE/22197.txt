TITLE
Absolute expression level of Candida albicans genes

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Total RNA versus genomic DNA hybridization on custom arrays designed for all Candida albicans genes

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected in mid-log phase from Candida albicans cells grown in rich medium (abbreviated CM, in house recipe).   RNA was then converted to cDNA, Cy3-labeled and hybridized competitively against Cy5 labeled genomic DNA from Candida albicans
