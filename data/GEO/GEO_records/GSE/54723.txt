TITLE
Nutritional Strategy to Prevent Fatty Liver and Insulin Resistance Independent of Obesity by Reducing GIP Responses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
High intakes of carbohydrates, particularly sucrose, in Western societies are associated with the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and diabetes mellitus. It is unclear whether this is related to the carbohydrate quantity or the hormonal responses, particularly Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) which is released in the proximal intestine. We, therefore, used the glucose-fructose dimer as proximally resorbed, 1,4-linked sucrose or distally resorbed 1,6-linked palatinose. Palatinose compared to sucrose, indeed, resulted in slower glucose absorption and reduced postprandial insulin and GIP levels. After 22 weeks of isocaloric diets, palatinose feeding prevented hepatic steatosis (48.5%) compared to sucrose and improved glucose tolerance, without differences in body composition and food intake. Ablation of GIP receptor (GIPR) signaling in Gipr-/- mice completely prevented the deleterious metabolic effects of sucrose feeding. Furthermore, our microarray analysis indicated that sucrose increased the hepatic expression of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 (SOCS2), which is involved in the growth hormone signaling pathway and participates in the development of NAFL. Our results suggest that the site of glucose absorption and the GIP response determine liver fat accumulation and insulin resistance. GIP may play a role in sucrose induced fatty liver by regulating the expression of SOCS2.
