TITLE
Comparison of genome-wide DNA methylation in MEFs derived from wildtype or estrogen receptor beta null mice using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) is a ligand inducible transcription factor regulating gene expression in response to the female sex hormone estrogen. Previously, we found that ERβ deficiency results in changes in DNA methylation patterns at two gene promoters, implicating an involvement of ERβ in DNA methylation. In this study, we set out to explore this involvement on a genome-wide level, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this function. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), we compared genome-wide DNA methylation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from wildtype (wt) and ERβ knock-out (βerko) mice, and identified around 8000 differentially methylated positions (DMPs). This suggests that ERβ is involved in regulating DNA methylation at specific sites in the genome.

DESIGN
Genome-wide DNA methylation was analysed in MEFs derived from wildtype and ERbeta null mice by educed representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) on an Illumina Genome Analyser IIx platform.
