TITLE
RNAseq profiliing of Xenopus laevis animal caps expressing Xnr2 at st14

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
To determine if Xnr2 induces mesodermal genes expression in ectodermal tissues

DESIGN
We force the ectodermal tissues to express xnr2 by injecting xnr2 RNA at the 2-4cell stage. The animal caps were excised at st10, the blastula stage. Tissues are cultured at DFA and harvested at stage 14 for RNA extraction.

PLATFORM
GPL18936 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Xenopus laevis)
