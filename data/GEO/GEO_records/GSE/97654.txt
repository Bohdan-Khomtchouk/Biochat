TITLE
MYC activation cooperates with Vhl and Ink4a/Arf loss to induce clear cell renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We present three mouse models of kidney cancer that recapitulate the genomic alterations found in human papillary (pRCC) and clear cell RCC (ccRCC), the most common RCC subtypes.  MYC activation results in highly penetrant pRCC tumors (MYC), while MYC activation, when combined with Vhl and Cdkn2a (Ink4a/Arf) deletion (VIM), produce kidney tumors that approximate human ccRCC.

DESIGN
Kidney tumor tissue and cell lines from three GEMM models (M,VM and VIM) and normal tissue.  Cells lines were assessed on/off dox.
