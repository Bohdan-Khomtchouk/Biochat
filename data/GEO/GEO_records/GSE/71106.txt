TITLE
An Artificial Interfering lncRNA Mediated by Oncolytic Adenovirus Competitively Consumes OncomiRs to Exert Antitumor Efficacy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study generated an artificially-designed interfering long non-coding RNA (lncRNAi). The adenovirus-expressed lncRNAi with high level in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells competes with OncomiR target genes to bind to and consume OncomiRs, thereby achieving the targeted anti-HCC efficacy.

DESIGN
High expression of an artificially-designed lncRNAi mediated by oncolytic adenovirus can compete with the mRNAs of OncomiR target genes to bind to and consume OncomiRs, thereby achieving the targeted anticancer effect of HCC.
