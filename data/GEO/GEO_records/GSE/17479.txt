TITLE
Effect of auxin signaling on flg22 response

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Expression data after flg22 treatment on leaf discs in Col-0, 35S:AFB1 and 35S:miR393 We used microarrays to investigated the effect of auxin signaling on flg22 response pathway. We also compared if addition of auxin could simulated the 35S:AFB1 phenotype. Keywords: stress response, disease state analysis

DESIGN
Leaf discs were taken and let overnight in water to avoid the wound response. We then performed the treatment (flg22, flg22 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, flg22 +NAA, NAA) to the media. The samples where harvested and freeze in liquid nitrogen at 0, 1 and 2h after treatment.
