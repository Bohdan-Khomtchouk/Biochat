TITLE
Sodium arsenite induced gene expression changes in A549 human epithelial lung carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Arsenic is methylated during its metabolism, thereby depleting the intracellular methyl donor S-adenosyl-methionine, which may lead to disturbances in DNA methylation patterns which could lead to altered gene expression

DESIGN
Cells were exposed to sodium arsenite (NaAsO2, Sigma) at concentrations of 0.08 µM, 0.4 µM and 2 µM for 1, 2 and 8 weeks.
