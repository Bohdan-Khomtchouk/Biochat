TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from leukemia and breast cancer cell lines with/without treatment with microparticles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microparticles (MPs) comprise the major source of systemic RNA including microRNA (miRNA), the aberrant expression of which appears to be associated with stage, progression and spread of many cancers. We have shown MPs to transfer multidrug resistance proteins accross both haematological and and non-haematological cancers. using microarray miRNA profiling analysis we now analyze changes in miRNA profiles of both cancer types following microparticle transfer. We identified certain upregulated miRNAs in both cancer types.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted and pooled from duplicate experiments for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays from (i) the parental drug sensitive leukaemia (CEM) or breast cancer (MCF-7) cells, (ii) their Multidrug Resistant strains leukaemia (VLB100) or breast cancer ( DX cells), (iii) the microparticles isolated from the resistant cells: VLBMP or DXMP, and (iv) the cocultured samples: sensitive cell co-incubated with MPs from their resistant cells ( leukaemia: CEM+VLBMP) or(breast cancer:  MCF-7+DXMP). We sought to examine the miRNA profiles of the drug sensitve cells after MP transfer from drug resistant cells across leukaemia nd breact cancer cell lines.
