TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from leukemia and breast cancer cell lines with/without treatment with microparticles

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Microparticles (MPs) comprise the major source of systemic RNA including microRNA (miRNA), the aberrant expression of which appears to be associated with stage, progression and spread of many cancers. We have shown MPs to transfer multidrug resistance proteins accross both haematological and and non-haematological cancers. using microarray miRNA profiling analysis we now analyze changes in miRNA profiles of both cancer types following microparticle transfer. We identified certain upregulated miRNAs in both cancer types.
