SUMMARY
By employing miRCURY LNAâ„¢ microRNA Array, we have identified a subset of 21 top miRNAs that are differentially expressed between GM-BMM and M-BMM cells

DESIGN
To know the differential expression of miRNA in mouse GM-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (GM-BMM) vs. M-CSF-induced BMM (M-BMM)
