TITLE
Gene expression changes in human cardiomyocytes exposed to VX (O-ethyl S-[2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl] methylphosphonothiolate)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Organophosphorus compounds induce cardiotoxicity through currently unknown mechanisms, which need to be unraveled by a comprehensive and systematic approach such as genome-wide gene expression analysis. We used microarrays to study gene expression changes in human cardiomyocytes after exposure to VX, and identified pathways underlying these changes.

DESIGN
Human cardiomyocytes were exposed to sublethal concentrations (0, 0.1, 10 Î¼M) of VX. RNA were extracted at different timepoints (0, 6, 24, 72 h) after VX exposure and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. Four biological repeats were used for each condition.
