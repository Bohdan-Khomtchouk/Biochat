TITLE
Differential expression analysis of T. thermophilus HB8 TTHA0995-deficient strain in response to iron

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA in Thermus thermophilus HB8 TTHA0995 deficient strain at 0 and 30 min after the addition of FeSO4.

DESIGN
Three TTHA0995 deficient strain of T. thermophilus HB8 were pre-cultured at 70 degC for 16 hours in 3 mL of TT medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The cells (2 mL) were inoculated into 1 L of the same medium and then cultivated at 70Â°C for 5.5 hours (A600 value being ~1.53). Then the 1.0 mM of FeSO4 was added into the medium, and continued cultivation. Cells were collected at 0 and 30 min time point after the addition of iron ion, and then crude RNA was extracted. The expression of each mRNA at each time point was analyzed on a GeneChip as described under Sample Description Sheet of each sample.
