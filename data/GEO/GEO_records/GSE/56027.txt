TITLE
Rational design of a ligand-based antagonist of jasmonate perception

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The phytohormone (+)-7-iso-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) is a major regulator of developmental and stress responses in plants. The perception of JA-Ile involves the formation of a ternary complex with the F-box protein COI1 and a member of the JAZ family of co-repressors, which leads to JAZ degradation. Coronatine (COR) is a bacterial phytotoxin that functionally mimics JA-Ile and interacts with the co-receptor COI1-JAZ complex with higher affinity than JA-Ile. Based on the crystal structure of the co-receptor, we designed ligand derivatives that spatially impede the interaction of the co-receptor proteins and, therefore, should act as competitive antagonists of COR or JA-Ile. One derivative, Coronatine O-methyloxime (COR-MO), shows a strong activity preventing COI-JAZ interaction and the subsequent JAZ degradation. COR-MO efficiently reverts the effects of JA-Ile or COR treatments on JA-mediated responses, such as anthocyanin accumulation, root-growth inhibition and gene expression in Arabidopsis plants. Moreover, it potentiates plant resistance preventing the effect of bacterially produced COR during Pseudomonas syringae infections in different plant species. In addition to the utility of COR-MO for Plant Biology research, our results underscore its biotechnological and agronomical potential for a safer and sustainable agriculture.

DESIGN
