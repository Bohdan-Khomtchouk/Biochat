TITLE
Gene expression profile of MDL-860-treated RD cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze gene expression of RD cells after treatment with an anti-picornavirus compound MDL-860, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform. Human RD cells were treated with mock or MDL-860 (final concentration of 20 uM) for 24 hours. A cluster of genes regulated Nrf2-Keap1 antioxidant pathway were identified by gene ontology analysis.

DESIGN
RD cells (human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line) were treated with mock or MDL-860 (final concentration of 20 uM) for 24 hours. Total RNA purified from each treatment was used for microarray analysis.
