TITLE
Genomic DNA concentration series in Allele Specific Expression study

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Genomic DNA of COl-0 and Van-0 were labeled using Bioprime randon labeling kit. Labelled products were hybridized to AtSNPtile1 at a total amount of 6ug, 9ug, 12ug, 15ug, and 18ug. This experiment is to test whether the overall target amount affect the log allele intensity ratio.

DESIGN
Each genotype has 5 hybridizations each at 6ug, 9ug, 12ug, 15ug and 18ug. Single chanel. Total two genotypes (Col, Van). Total 10 samples.

PLATFORM
GPL8655 Arabidopsis thaliana SNP-tiling array AtSNPtile ver. 1
