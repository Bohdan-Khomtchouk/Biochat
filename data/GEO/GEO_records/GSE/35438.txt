TITLE
Transcriptomic analyses of Staphylococcus epidermidis in mixed-species biofilms with Candida albicans

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A

SUMMARY
To explain enhanced biofilm formation and increased dissemination of S. epidermidis in mixed-species biofilms, microarrays were used to explore differential gene expression of S. epidermidis in mixed-species biofilms. One sample from single species biofilm (S1) and mixed-species biofilm (SC2) were excluded from analyses for outliers. We observed upregulation (2.7%) and down regulation (6%) of S. epidermidis genes in mixed-species biofilms. Autolysis repressors lrgA and lrgB were down regulated 36-fold and 27-fold respectively and was associated with increased eDNA possibly due to enhanced autolysis in mixed-species biofilms. These data suggest that bacterial autolysis and release of eDNA in the biofilm matrix may be responsible for enhancement and dissemination of mixed-species biofilms of S. epidermidis and C. albicans.
