TITLE
Chromatin relaxation is a feature of advanced prostate cancer [expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Altered patterns of transcription factor (TF) binding are now accepted as a hallmark of many aggressive cancers including prostate and breast cancers1,2. This implies that underlying global changes in chromatin accessibility may drive cancer progression, as previously hypothesized3-5. In addition there are epigenetic readers such as bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4), which have been shown to associate with these TFs6-8 and also to contribute to aggressive cancers of many types8,9 including prostate cancer (PC)6,10. Here we show for the first time that formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements followed by sequencing (FAIRE-seq) applied to human prostate tumors tissue can define castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and can be used to inform the discovery of gene-level classifiers for therapy. In addition, we show that the androgen receptor (AR) overexpression alone is a primary driver for chromatin relaxation and that this effect can be reversed using bromodomain inhibitors. We also report that bromodomain-containing proteins (BRDs) are overexpressed in advanced CRPCs and that ATAD2 and BRD2 have prognostic value. In conclusion, this is the first study demonstrating a major impact of BRDs on chromatin accessibility in CRPC in patient samples. Consequently, targeting bromodomains provides a compelling rational for combination therapy in which BRD-mediated TF binding is enhanced or modified as cancer progresses.
