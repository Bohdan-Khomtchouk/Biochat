TITLE
Function of deubiquitinase USP21 in mouse embryonic stem cell [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation of key transcriptional factors is important to the self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells.  However, little is known about the deubiquitination in ES self-renewal and differentiation. Here, we report that deubiquitinase USP21 is an important positive regulator to keep ES cells under undifferentiation stasus by deubiquitination and stabilization of Nanog, a key transcriptional factor of ES cells. Loss of USP21 led to ES cells differentiation and defect in reprogramming.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic stem cell after USP21 knockdown were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HighSeq2000, respectively.
