TITLE
X-CGD iPS cells before and after genome editing by designer nucleases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
X-CGD (X-linked chronic granulomatous disease) patient derived CD34+ cells were reprogrammed into two X-CGD iPSC clones (7 and 25) and subsequently corrected using ZFN (clone 7) and TALEN (clone 25) by integrating a therapeutic gp91phox expression cassette into the AAVS1 " safe harbor " locus

DESIGN
Three condition experiment: before and after reprogramming and before and after genome editing.
