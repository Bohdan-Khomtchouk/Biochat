TITLE
B.thetaiotaomicron wt versus KO3172, PR chow, NMRI

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

SUMMARY
Genome wide trascriptional comparison of B. thetaiotaomicron wild-type vs. an isogenic mutant  (BT3172::pGERM).  Cecal populations of wt or BT3172::pGERM monoassociated 10d with NMRI gnotobiotic mice fed a standard-chow polysaccharide rich (PR) diet (n=5 samples/group) were profiled. Keywords: Wild-type versus Knockout, in vivo
