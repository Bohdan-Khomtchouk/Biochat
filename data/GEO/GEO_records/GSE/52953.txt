TITLE
A LncRNA-MAF/MAFB transcription factor network regulates epidermal differentiation [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we reveal a lncRNA-transcription factor network with the MAF/MAFB transcription factors as central players in directing the epidermal differentiation program.

DESIGN
Examination of global transcriptional changes and mapping genome-wide transcription factors occupancy during epidermal differentiation.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
