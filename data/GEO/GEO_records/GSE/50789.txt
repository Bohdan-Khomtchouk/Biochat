TITLE
Gene expression in mouse liver in response to short-term calorie restriction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The effect of a short-term calorie restricted diet was evaluated in six strains of mice The dietary intervention was initiated at 8 weeks of age and continued until 22 weeks of age

DESIGN
Tissues were collected from mice at 22 weeks of age; there were 96 microarrays used in total: for each of the 6 strains of mice, there were 8 control-fed mice and 8 calorie restricted mice (one individual mouse per microarray)

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
