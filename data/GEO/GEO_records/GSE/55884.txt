TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Arabidopsis smg7 mutant in immune signaling blocked background

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Goal of the study is the identification of transcriptome deregulation of smg7 pad4 mutants, which are deficient in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and are blocked in immune signaling, which should avoid secondary responses from immune signaling

DESIGN
Total RNA (ribosomal RNA depleted) illumina sequencing of three single end libraries respectively of adult pad4 leaves (control) vs adult smg7 pad4 mutant leaves (mutant)

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
