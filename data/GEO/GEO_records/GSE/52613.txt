TITLE
Characterizing the TRb1 cistrome in mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq data from mouse liver over-expressing GFP and fed a PTU diet and treated with saline, or overexpressing biotinylated TRb1 and GFP and fed a PTU diet, treated with either saline or T3

DESIGN
Mouse liver was infected with adenovirus that either expressed only GFP or GFP and biotinylated TRb1 and were fed a PTU diet, followed by injections with only saline (GFP-only livers) or with saline or T3 (Biotinylated-TRb1 and GFP livers). ChIP assays were performed using streptavidin agarose to capture biotinylated TRb1 followed by library construction and sequencing.
