TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Toxicogenomic Effects of Ortho-Phenylphenol on Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa GeneChip arrays to investigate the dynamics of global gene expression profiles during the cellular response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ortho-phenylphenol, which involved initial growth inhibition and metabolism. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
We conducted four independent microarray experiments (biological replicates) in the absence (control) and the presence (experimental) of ortho-phenylphenol. We calculated fold change as the ratio between the signal averages of four untreated (control) and four ortho-phenylphenol-treated (experimental) cultures for 0, 20 and 60 min exposures.
