TITLE
Differential gene expression in regulatory T-cells after activation by temporary contact with dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Regulatory CD4+CD25+ T-cells were isolated from human blood using MACS and were then left untreated or were cocultured overnight with immature monocyte-derived Dendritic cells. Treg's total RNAs were prepared after moDC-removal. Keywords: agent response
