TITLE
Expression data from regenerating prostates of wild-type or Gli1-/- mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Attenuation of Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activity leads to increased prostate branching during adult prostate regeneration. In order to identify genes regulated by the Hh pathway that might be involved in adult prostate branching, we performed transcriptional profiling of regenerating prostates from wild-type or Gli1-/- mutant mice, which have attenuated Hh pathway activity.

DESIGN
6 total samples were analyzed. 3 wild-type prostates and 3 Gli-/- mutant prostates were analyzed.
