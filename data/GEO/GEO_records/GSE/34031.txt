TITLE
Gene expression profilling in bovine mammary gland pathophysiology

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling in vivo in bovine secretory tissue from healthy (H) mammary gland and during infections with coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) and coagulase-positive Staphylococci (CoPS). The aim of this study was to examinate the global gene expression profiles of mammary gland tissues of infected and healthy (control) cows.

DESIGN
Transcriptomes were compared of in the mammary glands of Holstein Friesian cows in two experiments, (H) vs (CoNS) cows and (H) vs (CoPS).
