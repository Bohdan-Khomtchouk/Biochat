TITLE
Gene expression changes with induction of in-vitro platinum-resistance in ovarian cancer cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We treated 8 human ovarian cancer cell lines with cisplatin in treatment/recovery cycles to induce in-vitro resistance to the drug. Microarrays measured gene expression at baseline and after each dose schedule (after recovery).
