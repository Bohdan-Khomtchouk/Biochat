TITLE
Illumina GoldenGate Methylation array data for X-CGD patients and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report on the molecular and cellular events observed in two patients treated by gene therapy in 2004. After the initial resolution of bacterial and fungal infections, both patients exhibited silencing of transgene expression due to methylation of the viral promoter, and myelodysplasia with monosomy 7 as a result of insertional activation of EVI1. In line with this observation, a genome wide methylation analysis of 807 cancer related genes revealed a DNA methylation pattern characteristic of MDS and AML patients.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood cells of patient 1 (d 0 and month 27) and 25 healthy controls including 12 males and 13 females. The GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I array was used to compare methylation degree in 1.505 CpG sites from promoter regions or the first exon of 807 mostly cancer related genes between the patient 1 (d 0 and month 27) and 25 healthy controls.
