TITLE
Epigenomic analysis of primary human T cells reveals novel enhancers associated with Th2 memory differentiation and asthma susceptibility (3 cell types)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A characteristic feature of asthma is the aberrant accumulation, differentiation or function of memory CD4+ T cells that produce Th2 cytokines (Th2 cells). By mapping genome-wide histone modification profiles of T cell subsets isolated from peripheral blood of healthy and asthmatic individuals, we identified enhancers with known and potential roles in the normal differentiation of human Th1 and Th2 cells.  In addition, we discovered disease-specific T cell enhancers that differ between healthy and asthmatic individuals.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K4me2 histone modifications in 3 human cell types in 11 healthy and 12 asthmatic individuals .
