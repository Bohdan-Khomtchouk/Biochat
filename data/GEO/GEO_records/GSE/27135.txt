TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for different passages of mesenchymal stem cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cells in culture undergo replicative senescence and unequivocally stop proliferation after a limited number of cell divisions. In this study, we have expanded mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from human adipose tissue and analyzed genetic and epigenetic sequels. The subpopulation of highly proliferative cells and the in vitro differentiation potential decayed already within early passages. Relevant chromosomal aberrations were not detected by karyotyping and SNP-microarrays.

DESIGN
Comparison of early and late passage of five samples of mesenchymal stem cells from human adipose tissue.
