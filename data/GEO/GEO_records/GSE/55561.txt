TITLE
Gene expression profiles of PDX models with acquired resistance to endocrine treatments

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acquired resistance to endocrine therapy occurs with high frequency in patients with luminal breast cancer (LBC). We report here the establishment of four patient-derived xenograft models of LBC with acquired resistance in vivo to tamoxifen and estrogen deprivation.

DESIGN
CEL files represent expresison data generated from 5 replicates (independent mice) of the following tumor models: HBCx22 (parental), HBCx22 TamR (tamoxifen-resistant), HBCx22 OvaR (ovariectomy-resistant), HBCx34 (parental), HBCx34 TamR (tamoxifen-resistant), HBCx34 OvaR (ovariectomy-resistant)
