TITLE
The Role of RelA of Streptococcus mutans in Global Control of Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans

SUMMARY
The production of (p)ppGpp by Streptococcus mutans UA159 is catalyzed by three gene products, RelA, RelP and RelQ.  Here, we investigate the role of the RelA (Rel) homologue of S. mutans in the stringent response and in global control of gene expression.  RelA of S. mutans was shown to synthesize pppGpp in vitro from GTP and ATP in the absence of added ribosomes, as well as in vivo in an E. coli relA-spoT mutant.  Mupirocin (MUP) was shown to induce high levels of (p)ppGpp production in S. mutans in a relA-dependent manner, with a concommitant reduction in GTP pools. Keywords: (p)ppGpp, nutrient starvation, biofilm, virulence, stress
