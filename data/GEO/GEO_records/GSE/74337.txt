TITLE
Myc Depletion in Naïve ESCs Induces a Pluripotent Dormant State Mimicking Embryonic Diapause

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray expression analysis of mouse ESCs treated with the MYCi 10058-F4.

DESIGN
Mouse ESCs were analysed after 60h of treatment with DMSO or 10058-F4 (MYCi). The MYCi⇒Released (Resc) group was treated with 10058-F4 for 60h, followed by withdrawal of the inhibitor and culture in 2i medium for additional 48h.
