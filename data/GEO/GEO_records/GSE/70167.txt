TITLE
The deafness gene DFNA5 induces programmed cell death through mitochondria and MAPK-related pathways [HEK293T]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The function of DFNA5 remained unknown for a long time, but previous functional studies by Op de Beeck et al. (2011) revealed that DFNA5 induces a growth defect in mutDFNA5- transfected HEK293T cells, as well as other cells, leading to PCD (Op de Beeck et al., 2011). The cell death-inducing capacity of DFNA5 was not only restricted to human cell lines, but was also observed in the yeast model Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Van Rossom et al., 2012). This inspired us to perform a transcriptomic analysis using two different model organisms (mammalian, HEK293T, and yeast, S.cerevisiae) to further elucidate the mechanisms related to DFNA5.

DESIGN
Comparison of two HEK293T transfected cell populations, either with a WT or mutated DFNA5 gene. There are 5 biol reps for the WT transfected cells and 6 biol reps for the mut DFNA5 transfected cells.
