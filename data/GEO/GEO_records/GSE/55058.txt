TITLE
Imperfect centered miRNA binding sites are common and can mediate functional repression of target mRNAs [sequencing]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome identification of direct targets identify a new class of miRNA::mRNA interactions.

DESIGN
This is a qualitative experiment to check transcript structure of mRNAs that bind to miR-17-5p. HEK293T cells were transfected with biotinylated miRNAs. The miRNAs and target mRNA were pulled down with streptavidin and profiled using stranded RNA-seq.
