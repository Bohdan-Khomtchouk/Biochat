TITLE
Continued studies the glycosylation changes in a cell line model of embryo implantation of steroid-exposed and control Ichikawa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment continues our investigation of glycosylation in endometrial epithelium.  During the menstrual cycle, estrogen and progesterone sensitise the uterus to the implanting embryo. There is a major expansion of Golgi and secretory function with increases in mucin (MUC1) and the appearance of specific glycans.  We are using Ishikawa cells as a model for in vitro implantation, and have shown the presence of steroid receptors and alterations in glycosylation after hormone exposure.

DESIGN
We are using Ishikawa cells as a model for in vitro implantation, and have shown the presence of steroid receptors and alterations in glycosylation after hormone exposure.  We now wish to profile glycogenes in steroid (E+P) exposed and control cells. We now wish to profile glycogenes in steroid (E+P) exposed and control cells. Steroid conditions are: estradiol (E2 at 10exp -8M) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA at 10 exp -7M)): 24h with E2, followed by E2+MPA for 72h. Cells were grown on plastic or glass.
