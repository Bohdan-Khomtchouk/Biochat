TITLE
The transcription factors SOX9 and SOX5/SOX6 cooperate genome-wide through super-enhancers to drive chondrogenesis (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
SOX9 is a transcriptional activator required for chondrogenesis, and SOX5 and SOX6 are closely related DNA-binding proteins that critically enhance its function. We used RNA-seq to charatierize a rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cells as a faithful model for proliferating/early prehypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes and ChIP-seq to gain novel insights into the full spectrum of the target genes and modes of action of this chondrogenic trio.

DESIGN
RNAs were isolated  from three bioogical replicatse of rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cells and rib samples for RNA-seq experiments.
