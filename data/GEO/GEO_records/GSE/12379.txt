TITLE
Gene expression profile of M.tuberculosis espR (Rv3849) mutant complemented with an N-terminal Flag espR gene

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a pathogen of global importance, utilizes the ESX-1 protein secretion system to export virulence factors that disarm host macrophages. Although this secretory pathway is critical for virulence, how ESX-1 is regulated is completely unknown. Here we show that EspR (Rv3849) is a key regulator of ESX-1. EspR activates transcription of an operon that includes three ESX-1 components, Rv3616c-Rv3614c, whose expression in turn promotes secretion of ESX-1 substrates. Keywords: Strain comparison

DESIGN
Comparison of the global gene expression of four M.tb strains grown in log phase: Erdman strain of M.tb, espR transposon mutant, the espR transposon mutant complemented with the wild type copy of the espR gene, and the espR transposon mutant complemented with an N-terminal FLAG espR gene.
