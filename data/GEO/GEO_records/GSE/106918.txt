TITLE
Identification of CNBP binding mRNA and the binding sites/motifs in HCT116 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High-throughput RNA-IP sequencing was employed to identify the CNBP binding mRNAs and their binding sites in HCT116 cells.

DESIGN
In order to identify the CNBP binding mRNAs and their binding sites,  we performed CNBP RIP and High-throughput sequencing.

PLATFORM
