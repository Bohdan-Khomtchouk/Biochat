TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 and BY4741hsp30Δ cells grown at 30°C and following exposure at 40°C for 30 min.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The Target Of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway is down-regulated in hsp30Δ cells. We compared the gene expression program of hsp30Δ cells with that of its wild type counterpart (BY4741) to identify activities associated with Hsp30.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit from Log phase BY4741 and hsp30Δ::kanMX cells grown in YPD medium at 30°C and following exposure at 40°C for 30 min and sent to Ocimum Biosolutions India, to identify genes that were either up-regulated or down-regulated in hsp30Δ cells as compared to the control.
