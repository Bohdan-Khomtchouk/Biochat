TITLE
Temporal expression data from zebrafish pineal gland

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Microarray data allowed detection of genes that have circadian expression pattern in the zebrafish pineal gland

DESIGN
Adult (0.5-1.5 years old) transgenic zebrafish, Tg(aanat2:EGFP)Y8, which express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in the pineal gland under the control of the aanat2 regulatory regions, were used. Fish were raised under 12-hr light:12-hr dark (LD) cycles, in a temperature controlled room, and transferred to constant darkness (DD) for tissue collection. Fish were anesthetized in 1.5 mM Tricane (Sigma), sacrificed by decapitation, and pineal glands were removed under a fluorescent dissecting microscope. Starting from circadian time (CT) 14, pineal glands were collected at 4-hr intervals for 48 hours (12 time points identified as CT 14, 18, 22, 2, 6, 10, 14b, 18b, 22b, 2b, 6b and 10b). Pools of 12 pineal glands were prepared at each time-point and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
