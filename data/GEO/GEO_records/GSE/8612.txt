TITLE
SAGE and MPSS libraries from activated CD4+ T cell clone 29

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SAGE and MPSS libraries were produced from the same RNA sample extracted from an activated CD4+ T cell clone in order to compare the ability of these techniques to indentify the full range of genes expressed in a single cell type. Keywords: Technical comparison of tag-based technologies SAGE and MPSS

DESIGN
One very large LongSAGE library (~500,000 tags) and three separate MPSS libraries were produced from a single RNA sample. Tags were linked to the human genome sequence and to the Ensembl database of known human genes in order to determine how many transcripts had been identified in the cell by each technique.  Despite its much smaller library size, SAGE identified many more transcripts in the sample than MPSS.  Because SAGE libraries may include many erroneous tags, we consider just tags from known genes and still SAGE identified more transcripts in the sample than all three MPSS libraries combined.
