TITLE
Expression data from mouse T-cell lymphomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic expression of key transcritpion factors inducing T-cell leukemias in mice. We used microarrays to identify the gene expression signatures associated with TLX1transgenic /RUNX1 heterozygous tumors compared with different genetic models T acute lymphoblastic lymphoma.
