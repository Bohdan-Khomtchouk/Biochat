TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Escherichia coli K12 strain DH10B harboring A1501 nitrogen fixation island (NFI) under nitrogen fixation conditions

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. DH10B

SUMMARY
A1501 NFI is a genomic island derived from Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501. To study the molecular interactions of the P. stutzeri nif genes with the E. coli genome during nitrogen fixation, the NIF of A1501 was transferred into E. coli and comparative transcriptomics analyses were performed between nitrogen fixation conditions and nitrogen excess conditions.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from E. coli K-12 DH10B cells with NFI cultured 20 h in NFDM medium under nitrogen fixation conditions (30℃, anaerobic, no ammonium) or nitrogen excess conditions (30℃, anaerobic, 20 mmol ammonium).
