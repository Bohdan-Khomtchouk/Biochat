TITLE
Expression data for Saccharomyces cerevisiae oxidative stress response

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Oxidative stress is a harmful condition in a cell, tissue, or organ, caused by an imbalnace between reactive oxygen species and other oxidants and the capacity of antioxidant defense systems to remove them. The budding yeast S. cerevisiae has been the major eukaryotic model for studies of response to oxidative stress. We used microarrays to study the genome-wide temporal response of the yeast S. cerevisiae to oxidative stress induced by cumene hydroperoxide. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
The effects of oxidative stress induced by CHP on the transcriptional profile of S. cerevisiae was studied from a dynamical perspective. Yeast cultures were grown in controlled batch conditions, in 1 L fermentors. Three replicate cultures in mid-exponential phase were exposed to 0.19 mM CHP, while three non-treated cultures were used as controls. Samples were collected at t=0 (immediately before adding CHP) and at 3,6,12,20,40,70 and 120 min after adding the oxidant. Samples were processed for RNA extraction and profiled using Affymetrix Yeast Genome S98 arrays.
