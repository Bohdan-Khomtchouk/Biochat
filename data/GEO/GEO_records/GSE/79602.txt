TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of testis transcripts from Wt and Trf2-/- mice [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TRF2 is a paralogue of TATA-box binding protein (TBP) with highest expression in testis. Although Trf2 inactivation in mice leads to arrested spermatogenesis, there is no direct evidence that Trf2 is recruited to chromatin to directly regulate gene expression. We used genetically modified mice where endogenous Trf2 has been modified to carry a TAP-TAG  to perform ChIP-reChIP followed by deep sequencing. We found that Trf2 is recruited to all active promoters as a subunit of TFIIA/ALF complex together with TBP. To assess the effect of Trf2 inactivation on gene expression we performed RNA-seq on WT and Trf2-/- testes at 21 days of age when haploid cell gene expression is activated.

DESIGN
The testes from three 21 day old WT and three Trf2-/- males were taken to prepare total RNAs for deep sequencing.
