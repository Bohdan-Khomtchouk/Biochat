TITLE
Comparative transcriptional profiling analysis of developing melon (Cucumis melo L.) fruit from climacteric and non-climacteric varieties

ORGANISM
Cucumis melo

SUMMARY
Investigation gene expression level changes in four different melon fruits at four different developmental satges Transcriptomic analysis of developing melon fruits from two climacteric (cvs. VÃ©drantais and Dulce) and two non-climacteric (cv. Piel de sapo and accession PI 161375) at 15, 25, 35 Days After Pollination (DAP) and Harvest stage

DESIGN
The microarray contained 75,000 probes based on a previously validated microarray [Mascarell-Creus et al. 2009] but arranged in a modified 4-plex design, covering 17,443 melon unigenes derived from expressed sequence tags. These unigenes represent 10,649 genes in the melon genome (38% of the total predicted genes). A total of 48 samples were submitted. Only 47 were hybridize and a total of 41 were used to normalize the data.
