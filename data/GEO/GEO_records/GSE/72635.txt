TITLE
Gene expression signature of HoxA9-Meis1 AML cells treated with Pyrydopyrazine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pyrydopyrazine A2 induced in vitro the differentiation of leukemic cells (HoxA9-Meis1) into macrophages, we decided to perform a transcriptomic study in order to analyze the GM-CSF pathway regulation. We therefore compared effect with A2 to cells treated with Retinoic acid and D3 Vitamin, a combination known to induce also differentiation of leukemic cells.

DESIGN
HoxA9-Meis1 murine AML cells were treated in vitro during 24h, with Pyrydopyrazine( A2) at 3.4μM or a combination of all-trans Retinoic Acid (RA) and 1α-hydroxy-D3 Vitamin (D3V), 10μM each. Gene expression signature was compared to untreated control. One sample was tested for each condition
