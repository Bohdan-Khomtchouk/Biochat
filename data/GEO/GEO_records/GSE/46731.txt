TITLE
gene expression profile of CBZ treated mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Carbamazepine (CBZ) is widely used in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders as an anticonvulsant. A recent report revealed that CBZ has an anti-fibrotic effect on the livers of Î±1-antitrypsin-deficient mice, raising the possibility of a hepatology-related therapeutic use for the drug.Given the fact that CBZ has complicated pharmacokinetic properties,  to comprehensively understand the its mechanism of action, we performed microarray analysis of the mouse liver tissues 2 hours after CBZ administration.

DESIGN
The mice were orally administered 250 mg/kg of CBZ or DMSO and examined for the gene expression 2 hours later; 3 mice per group.
