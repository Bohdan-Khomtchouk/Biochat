TITLE
Testing mAbs generated by the PCRP pipeline in ChIP-seq application

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the applicability of multiple PCRP mAbs in ChIP-seq applications in human cell-lines using standard ENCODE protocols.

DESIGN
mAbs were tested in 1-4 ENCODE's default human cell-lines. Input control for each mAb and biological replicates for some mAbs are included.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
