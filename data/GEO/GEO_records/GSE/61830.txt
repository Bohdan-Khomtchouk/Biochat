TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and opaque2 mutant Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Analysis of  gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that opaque2 mutant influence the expression of storage proteins. Results provide important information of the gene expression level regulation of storage proteins and other biological processes.

DESIGN
Endosperm mRNA profiles of 15DAP wild type (WT) and opaque2 mutant were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2500 (Zea mays).
