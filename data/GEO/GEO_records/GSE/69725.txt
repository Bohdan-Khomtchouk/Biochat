TITLE
The expression profiles of angiogenesis-related genes in the presence or absence of the NUP160-SLC43A3 fusion gene as measured with PCR array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNAs from HDMECs transfected with the control vector or the fusion gene were prepared, and the mRNA expression profiles were evaluated using PCR arrays. The raw threshold cycle (Ct) was normalized using the values of housekeeping gene.

DESIGN
For PCR array, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from RNA using RT2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was mixed with RT2 SYBR Green/Rox qPCR Master Mix (Qiagen), and the mixture was added to 96-well Human Angiogenesis PCR Array (Qiagen). Real-time PCR was performed on Takara Thermal Cycler Dice TP800 (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). The raw Ct data were normalized using the values of housekeeping gene.
