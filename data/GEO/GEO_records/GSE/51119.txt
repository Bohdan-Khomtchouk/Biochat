TITLE
A basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors network mediates the brassinosteroid signal [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand how atypical bHLH, INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION1 (ILI1)-BINDING bHLH-1 (IBH1) (At2g43060), and close homologue, IBH1-like1 (IBL1) (At4g30410), interact to regulate cell elongation, genome-wide RNA-Seq expression analyses of IBH1 and IBL1 gain-(IBH1OE, IBL1OE) and loss-of-function (ibh1 (SALK 049177), ibl1(SALK 119457)) mutants were conducted.

DESIGN
For loss-of-function mutant, homozygous ibh1(SALK 049177) and ibl1(SALK 119457) were compared to wild type (Col). For gain-of-function mutant, homozygous 35Spro:IBH1-GFP and 35Spro:IBL1-GFP were compared to wild type (Col). Total RNAs were extactced from seedling of each genotypes. For each genotype two biological replicates were sequenced.
