TITLE
Comprehensive genomic profiling identified miRNA signatures associated with mammary tumor differentiation and development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed affymetrix gene expression profiling on mammary tumors from eight well-characterized genetically engineered Mouse (GEM) models of human breast cancer. The gene expression data will be combined with the miRNA gene expression data from the corresponding mammary tumors and tissues for integrated miRNA and mRNA gene expression analysis, which are useful in improving the identification of miRNA targets from potential targets identified in silico.

DESIGN
mRNA expression data for 41 mouse primary mammary tumors and 5 mouse normal mammary glands
