TITLE
Expression profile of Pseudomonas aeruginosa  Î”gcsR PAO1 using RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
The TyrR-like enhancer-binding protein GcsR (or PA2449) was shown to regulate the expression of genes required for glycine metabolism. In order to define the regulon of GcsR we compared the transcriptome of a gcsR deletion mutant of P. aeruginosa PAO1 with that of the wild-type using RNA-Seq.

DESIGN
Strains were grown under glycine rich conditions (peptone broth) and their transcriptomes were compared using RNA-Seq.
