TITLE
Identification of GATA1 transcriptional regulation in the megakaryoblastic cell line Meg01

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
chIP-on-chip analysis of GATA1 in the megakaryoblastic cell line Meg01.

DESIGN
The IP was obtained with a GATA1 C-terminus antibody.  The control sample was a normal goat IgG pull down done side by side with the GATA1 (C-20) antibody using the same soluble chromatin sample from non-treated Meg-01 cells. A 2-chip microarray set (Agilent 240K) was used for the chIP-on-chip analysis.
