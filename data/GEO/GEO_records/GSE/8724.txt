TITLE
Gene expression analysis in the zebrafish embryos silenced by zfPGRP-SC

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that serve as a strong link between invertebrate and vertebrate immunity.It has been demonstrated that PGRPs in insects function as bacterial recognition molecules which trigger proteolytic or signal transduction pathways, being thus important in the antimicrobial innate immunity. To explore the effect of zebrafish short-form PGRP (zfPGRP-SC) on proteolytic or signal transduction pathway, RNA interference (siRNA) and high-density oligonucleotide microarray methods were used to identify differentially expressed genes regulated by zfPGRP-SC. Keywords: RNA interference

DESIGN
The control siRNA, zfPGRP-SC siRNA were introduced into zebrafish zygotes at the concentration of 300 ng / Î¼l under a normal microscope.The injection volume was 1 nL per embryo. To insure the isochronous development, the embryos of one experimental and two different control samples (the group injected with the control siRNA and the uninjected group) were from the artificial fertilized embryos collected within 5 minutes. To eliminate the difference from the different parents, all embryos were randomly mixed. The microinjection was conducted within 30 minutes. Twenty-four hours later, 400 embryos for each group were collected.
