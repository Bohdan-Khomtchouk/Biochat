TITLE
Gene expression analysis in the zebrafish embryos silenced by zfPGRP-SC

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that serve as a strong link between invertebrate and vertebrate immunity.It has been demonstrated that PGRPs in insects function as bacterial recognition molecules which trigger proteolytic or signal transduction pathways, being thus important in the antimicrobial innate immunity. To explore the effect of zebrafish short-form PGRP (zfPGRP-SC) on proteolytic or signal transduction pathway, RNA interference (siRNA) and high-density oligonucleotide microarray methods were used to identify differentially expressed genes regulated by zfPGRP-SC. Keywords: RNA interference
