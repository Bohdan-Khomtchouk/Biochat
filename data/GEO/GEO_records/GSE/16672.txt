TITLE
All Tumor Sector Experiments (T1-T20)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
ROMA CGH experiments were conducted on four to six dissected sectors (S1-S6) from single primary ductal carcinomas (T1-T20).  T1-T4 were analyzed by sectoring and analysis by ROMA.  T5-T20 were analyzed using the Sector-Ploidy-Profiling (SPP) Approach.  SPP involves macro-dissecting the tumor, flow-sorting nuclei by differences in total genomic DNA content and profiling the genome of the tumor subpopulations. The genomic DNA from each tumor was labeled with Cy5 and a reference fibroblast genome was labeled with Cy3 and cohybridized to a ROMA microarray (85K or 390K). Experiments were performed in color-reversal by dye-swapping samples and hybridizing the labeled DNA to a second microarray for T1-T15 experiments, but not for T16-T20 experiments.
