TITLE
Mecp2_null_versus_wt

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to identify target genes of MECP2 in the mouse brain. Genes differentially expressed in Mecp2 null and wt brain were found. Keywords: Total brain tissue comparison

DESIGN
This was a dye-swap experiment. RNA was isolated from total brain tissue of a 74 day old Mecp2-/y (Mecp2 null) animal with late symptoms (gait ataxia, hind limb clasping, breathing irregularities, uneven teeth, small stature) and a wild-type male littermate. Sample1 (wt) was labeled with Cy3 and sample2 (Mecp2 null) was labeled with Cy5 in the first co-hybridization experiment. In the dye swap experiment, sample1 (wt) was labeled with Cy5 and sample2 (Mecp2 null) was labeled with Cy3.
