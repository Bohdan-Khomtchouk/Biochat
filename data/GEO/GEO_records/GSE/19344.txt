TITLE
Expression data from tamoxifen treated and control injection treated Tg(αMHC-MerCreMer) and wild type mus musculus.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
α-myosin heavy chain promoter controlled MerCreMer expression enables conditional, cardiomyocyte specific and tamoxifen dependent gene inactivation of floxed genes. Administration of tamoxifen has been linked to development of acute and transient cardiomyopathy. The mechanism for this is unknown. We used microarrays to sort out factors relevant for adverse effects following tamoxifen dependent gene inactivation, to develop a protocol with minimal adverse effects, and to identify the most proper control animals.

DESIGN
Mus musculus Tg(αMHC-MerCreMer) and wild type were sacrificed 4 days after 1 or 4 consecutive days of 40 mg/kg tamoxifen injected intraperitoneally, or after corresponding control injection treatment.
