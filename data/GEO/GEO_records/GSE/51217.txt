TITLE
TALEN-based knockout of mir-141 and mir-200c in SK-BR-3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to generate knockout cells for two related microRNAs (miRNAs), mir-141 and mir-200c, which belong to the deeply conserved mir-200 family. By carrying out deep sequencing, we identified the target genes of each miRNA. Interestingly, miR-141 and miR-200c, despite their overall similarity, suppressed largely non-overlapping groups of targets.
