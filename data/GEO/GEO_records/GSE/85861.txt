TITLE
Novel gene expression profile of women with intrinsic skin youthfulness by transcriptome sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our study is an unbiased, whole transcriptome search for genes associate with intrinsic skin youthfulness in healthy volunteers that is controlled for co-variates. We identify novel candidate skin youthfulness genes and detail why they are highly worthy of future study. Of particular interest are PHLDA1, a follicle stem cell marker, and HAS2-AS1, a non-coding gene.  We demonstrate that immunologic gene sets are the most significantly altered in skin youthfulness,suggesting the immune system plays an important role in skin youthfulness, a finding that has notpreviously been recognized.

DESIGN
Identify genes associated with intrinsic skin youthfulness in healthy volunteers  from sun protected skin.
