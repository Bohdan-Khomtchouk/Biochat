TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The progressive mechanism of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) remains unknown. We report that ROBO1 and ROBO2 are identified as novel progression-related somatic mutations using whole-exome and targeted sequencing in six of 16 (37.5%) paired MDS patients undergoing disease progression. To investigated the effect of ROBO1 or ROBO2 on ROBO1/2 CN number and LOH, we employed a Cytosan 750K chip to analyze the copy-number variations (CNVs) and loss of heterogeneity (LOH) in MDS patients with ROBO1 & 2 mutations.

DESIGN
Copy number and LOH analysis of Affymetrix CytoScan 750K array was performed for 14 MDS patients with ROBO1 or ROBO2 mutations
