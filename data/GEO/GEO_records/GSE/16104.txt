TITLE
IL-1b responses in receptor-reconstituted AcP-deficient neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose was to determine AcP- and AcPb-dependent gene responses to IL-1 by virally-reconstituting AcP-deficient mouse embryonic cortical neurons with CD25 (control), full length AcP, AcPb or the combination of both. A control population was transduced with a CD25-expressing virus. Half the samples were stimulated with IL-1-beta for four hours, RNA was analyzed by microarray.

DESIGN
Each in triplicate: CD25 cells, AcP cells, AcPb cells, AcP+AcPb cells. Cultures stimulated with IL-1b (10 ng/ml) for 4 hours then RNA was collected for processing and microarray analysis.
