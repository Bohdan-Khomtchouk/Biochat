TITLE
Comparative analysis of Musculus longissimus dorsi expression of Holstein x Charolais F2 cattle (SEGFAM) with high and low intramuscular fat (IMF) content

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
10 + 10 Holstein x Charolais F2 cattle were assigned to 2 groups with high and low IMF content, respectively; Musculus longissimus dorsi mRNA expression was determined by microarray analysis

DESIGN
pairwise comparison of Affymetrix GeneChip microarray expression profiles of Musculus longissimus dorsi samples derived from crossbred bulls with high and low IMF content Type: paired t-test
