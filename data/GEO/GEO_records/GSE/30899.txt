TITLE
Gene expression dynamics in yeast BY4741 and a strain lacking MSN2 and MSN4 responding to 0.4mM H2O2 over time (0-60min)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Numerous factors have been implicated in regulating gene expression changes, including changes to nucleosome occupancy.  Here we followed dynamic changes to nucleosome occupancy, gene expression and DNA binding of the transcription factor Msn2p genome-wide in yeast cells responding to hydrogen peroxide and reveal new relationships between regulators of stress-dependent gene expression in yeast.
