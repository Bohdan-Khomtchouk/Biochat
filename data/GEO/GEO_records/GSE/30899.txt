TITLE
Gene expression dynamics in yeast BY4741 and a strain lacking MSN2 and MSN4 responding to 0.4mM H2O2 over time (0-60min)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C

SUMMARY
Numerous factors have been implicated in regulating gene expression changes, including changes to nucleosome occupancy.  Here we followed dynamic changes to nucleosome occupancy, gene expression and DNA binding of the transcription factor Msn2p genome-wide in yeast cells responding to hydrogen peroxide and reveal new relationships between regulators of stress-dependent gene expression in yeast.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in response to 0.4mM H2O2 in the S288c derivative BY4741 in wild-type cells and cells lacking MSN2 and MSN4. A single replicate of a time course spanning from 4 to 60 minutes after treatment in each cell type.  An additional 3 repliactes were collected from cells 30 minutes after treatment.
