TITLE
Mincle-mediated signaling leads to characteristic gene expressions in rat mast cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat mast cell line RBL-2H3 was analyzed to investigate the molecular mechanism of Mincle-mediated activation and responses of mast cells. Mincle-mediated signaling stimulated characteristic gene expression, such as IL-3, IL-4, IL-9, IL-13, IL-31 and TNFÎ±.

DESIGN
RBL-2H3 cell line stably expressing Mincle was established. Non-stimulated cells (Control) compared to Mincle-stimulated cells (Myc) in order to comfirm Mincle-mediated signaling-inducible genes. Mincle-stimulated cells compared to Syk inhibitor R406-pretreated cells (R406) in order to examine the importance of Syk for Mincle-mediated gene up-regulations.
