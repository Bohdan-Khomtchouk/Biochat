TITLE
Analysis of the Zur Regulon of Moraxella catarrhalis

ORGANISM
Moraxella catarrhalis

SUMMARY
This series of microarrays explores the genes regulated by the Zur gene of Moraxella catarrhalis.

DESIGN
The gene expression profile of O35E Wild-type cells was utilized as the baseline and compared with the gene expression profile of a non-polar mutant of the Zur gene constructed in the O35E background.  There were two biologic replicates and two internal dye swaps performed.
