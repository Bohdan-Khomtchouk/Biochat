TITLE
SMARCAD1 Regulates Nucleosome Positioning and Maintenance of the Na√Øve Pluripotent State

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide maps of nucleosome positioning  in mouse ES cells with control shRNA and on Smarcad1 KD. MNase-seq data for human colo829 cells are also included.

DESIGN
We used the strategies of Mnase-Seq to detect the nucleusome positions features in E14 and Smarcad1-knock down cells. With global comparison, we described the fuction of Smarcad1 in switch pluripotent states.
