TITLE
Genome-wide expression profile in Fh1-competent vs Fh1-deficient mouse kidney cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of the transcriptome of immortalised mouse kidney epithelial cells either wt for Fh1 or Fh1-deficient. The cells were isolated from kidneys of P5 mouse(see Frezza et al, Nature 2011). Briefly, Fh1_fl (flox) are wt for Fh1 (floxed cassette not excised), clone 1 and clone 19 are two different Fh1-deificent clones (floxed cassette excised) and Rec are clone 19 with reconstituted Fh1 expression from exogenous plasmid.

DESIGN
Examination of gene transciption in 4 cell types.

PLATFORM
