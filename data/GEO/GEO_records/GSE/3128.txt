TITLE
Variation in gene expression and aberrantly regulated chromosomal regions in cloned mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA microarray analysis has been carried out to know the precise genome-wide gene expression profiles of somatic cloned mice derived from Sertoli or cumulus cells.   It demonstrated unexpectedly large epigenetic diversity in neonatal cloned mice, despite their normal appearance and genetic identity.  In three neonatal tissues of the cloned mice, a total of 9–40% of the examined genes exhibited more than two times higher or lower levels in donor cell-dependent or -independent manner compared to those in normal controls.  Relatively few (0.4–4%) of the genes exhibited up- or down-regulation in the same manner in both types of clones.  Cluster analysis of the variations in gene expression led to identification of several chromosomal regions in which gene expression was aberrantly controlled in the somatic clones.  These results provide a more complete understanding of how somatic clones differ from each other and from normal individuals produced by sexual reproduction and indicate the significant difficulties that exist for the application of somatic cloning in regenerative medicine.
