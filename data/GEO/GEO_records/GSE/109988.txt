TITLE
FHL3 overexpression microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the target genes of FHL3 in glioma cells, we conducted a gene expression microarray analysis to identify novel FHL3 regulating genes. The FHL3 overexpressed T98G glioma cells l were used as the experiments model. We conservatively established a minimum of 2-fold difference between FHL3 and control group, with an FDR-adjusted P value of less than 0.05, and identified 285 up-regulated and 420 down-regulated genes that met the threshold in all microarray analyses of 3 independent groups.

DESIGN
Total RNA from approximately 10e6 T98G cells transfected with vector or FHL3 was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The RNA integrity was measured at an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The gene expression microarrays including 3 technical replicates of FHL3 overexpression versus the empty vector were performed at the ShanghaiBio Corporation. We conservatively established at least 2-fold difference, with an FDR-adjusted P value of less than 0.05 as the cut-off values. The biological functions (gene ontology) of the preferential FHL3-regulating genes identified by microarray analysis were determined with the web-based SBC analysis system.
