TITLE
Expression data from P15 mouse testes control and Ikbkap-knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ikbkap/Elp1 regulates genes involved in spermatogenesis. Ikbkap deficiency causes male infertility by disrupting meiotic progression. In this dataset, we include the expression data for control and Ikbkap-knockout mouse testis.

DESIGN
We analyzed the gene expression in control and Ikbkap-knockout testes using the the Affymetrix MoGene-1_0-st-v1 platform. Three replicates per genotype.
