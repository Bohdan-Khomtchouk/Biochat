TITLE
Gene expression change after LSD1 siRNA treatment in ER-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knock-down of LSD1 using siRNA approach induced regulation of several proliferation-associated genes in ER-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231.

DESIGN
To identify changes on gene expression caused by treatment with siRNA directed against LSD1 (si) or control siRNA (control) in MDA-MB-231 cells, total RNA was purified from the cells after treatment for 6 days (2 rounds of transfection). Three biological replicates were used.
