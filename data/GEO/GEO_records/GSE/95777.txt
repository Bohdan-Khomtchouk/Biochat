TITLE
Factors regulating subcutaneous adipose tissue storage, fibrosis, and inflammation may underlie low systemic rates of fatty acid mobilization in insulin sensitive obese adults

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although the rate of fatty acid release from adipose tissue into the systemic circulation is very high in most obese adults, some obese adults maintain relatively low rates of fatty acid release, which helps protect them against the development of systemic insulin resistance.  The primary aim of this study was to identify factors in adipose tissue that may underlie low vs. high rates of fatty acid mobilization in a relatively homogeneous cohort of obese adults. We obtained subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue samples from 30 obese adults (BMI: 38±1 kg/m2, age: 30±2 yr) after an overnight fast.  We performed microarray analysis on the adiose tissue samples.

DESIGN
We obtained subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies from obese adults after an overnight fast.
