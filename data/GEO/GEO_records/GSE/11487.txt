TITLE
Global gene transcription analysis of Anaplasma phagocytophilum in tick and human cells using tiling microarrays

ORGANISM
Anaplasma phagocytophilum str. HZ

SUMMARY
A whole genome tiling microarray based on the published sequence of the Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Ap) strain Hz genome was used to measure transcriptional activity of Ap grown to late stage in three cell lines representing the diversity of host cells naturally infected by Ap: two human cell lines, HL-60 (promyelocytic leukocyte) and HMEC-1 (microvascular endothelial), and the tick (Ixodes scapularis) cell line ISE6. Keywords: cell type comparison
