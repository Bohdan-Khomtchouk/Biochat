TITLE
Comparison of transcriptional changes in Cre infected with Vector infected alpha4-floxed MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine the transcriptional changes that occur following alpha4 deletion, RNA microarray analysis was performed using RNA from alpha4-floxed MEFs 48 hours after infection with the Cre-containing or Vector control virus. Keywords: other
