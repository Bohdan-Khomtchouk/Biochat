TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of photoperiodic flowering in soybean.

ORGANISM
Glycine max ; Glycine soja

SUMMARY
In order to identify candidate genes that are involved in soybean flowering transition in response to photoperiods, we performed RNA sequencing analysis under different photoperiod treatments. We identified genes exhibiting daily oscillation patterns under different photoperiod treatments, genes under control of maturity loci (E1, E2, E3 and E5), and genes that constitute the soybean flowering gene network.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing analysis was performed using Williams 82, Clark and four NILs in Clark that are polymorphic for E loci (E1, E2, E3 and E5), as well as the wild soybean Glycine soja, under different photoperiod treatments.
