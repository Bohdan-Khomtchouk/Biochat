ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_5147 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Gary Karpen. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: The goal of these experiments are to a) validate/confirm the locations of 125 chromosomal proteins across the Drosophila melanogaster genome and b) evaluate their biological significance by assaying the impact of depletion on other proteins/marks. We are using RNAi to deplete individual non-histone chromosomal proteins in Drosophila BG3 and S2 tissue culture cells, followed by Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) assayed on genomic tiling arrays. Comparison of a protein factor's binding profiles before and after depletion will increase the confidence of our predictions.
