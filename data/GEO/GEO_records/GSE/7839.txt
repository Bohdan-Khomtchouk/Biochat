TITLE
Molecular landscape of modified histones in Drosophila heterochromatin

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to analyze the distribution of the modified histones in and around peri-centromeric heterochromatin at high resolutions for understanding the molecular nature of the heterochromatic genes and euchromatin-heterochromatin transition. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
Since heterochromatin is repeat-rich, stringent repeat-filtering was applied in the genome-tiling array design. When possible, parallel analyses were performed with two different types of reference controls, namely total genomic DNA and histone H3 C-terminus ChIP.
