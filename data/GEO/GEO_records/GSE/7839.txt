TITLE
Molecular landscape of modified histones in Drosophila heterochromatin

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to analyze the distribution of the modified histones in and around peri-centromeric heterochromatin at high resolutions for understanding the molecular nature of the heterochromatic genes and euchromatin-heterochromatin transition. Keywords: ChIP-chip
