TITLE
Comparison of endocrine enriched genes in islet beta cells versus induced beta cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Endocrine enriched genes in adult islet beta cells were identified and compared with that of induced beta cells (with M3 transcription factors) in adult.  The control sample is non-beta pancreatic cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile comparison of 3 samples, 3 independent repeats for each sample indicate a high degree of similarity between endogenous and induced beta cells in adult mouse.
