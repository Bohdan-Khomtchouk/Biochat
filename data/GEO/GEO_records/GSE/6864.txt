SUMMARY
Gene expression regulation of transporters and phase I/II metabolic enzymes in murine small intestine during fasting Keywords: metabolic state analysis

DESIGN
Pure bred wild-type (129S1/SvImJ) and PPARÎ±-null (129S4/SvJae) mice were maintained on AIN93M diet, and subsequently two sets of mice  were fasted for 24 hours. The complete intestines were then removed and total RNA was isolated. In total 4 experimental groups were present: wild type and knockout mice that had free access to feed (AIN93M) before they were killed; wild type and knockout mice mice that were fasted for exactly 24 hours before they were killed. RNA of 3 biological replicates was hybridized to Affymetrix MOE430A arrays. Five microgram total RNA was labelled according to the ENZO protocol, fragmented and hybridized according to Affymetrix's protocols.
