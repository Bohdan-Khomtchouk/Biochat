TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis wild-type (Col-0) and KO-nudx19  plants, which lacks nudix hydrolase 19, a NADPH hydrolase

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The NADPH status, which is regulated by AtNUDX19, a NADPH pyrophosphohydrolase, is involved in the regulation of stress and hormonal responses. To clarify how the status is involved in the regulation, we performed a microarray analysis using 3-week-old wild-type and KO-nudx19 leaves grown under normal light conditions.

DESIGN
Wild-type and KO-nudx19 plants were grown on MS medium containing 3% sucrose in a growth chamber kept at 25°C during 16 h of light (100 µmol/m2/s) and at 22°C during 8 h of darkness for 1 week, and then transferred to and further grown on soil for 2 weeks in the same chamber. At 3 weeks, leaves were collected as samples for microarray analysis.
