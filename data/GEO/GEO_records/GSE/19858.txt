TITLE
Effect of LIN28 on miRNA profile at day 5 of neurogliogenesis in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of mouse P19 and P19+Lin28 cells at day 5 of retinoic acid-induced differentiation The cell lines differ in that one constitutively expresses Lin28 from a heterologous promoter.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of two cell lines, one of which is stably transfected, harvested at a single day of differentiation in vitro.
