SUMMARY
The vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) is involved in various physiological processes such as angiogenesis or wound healing but is also crucial in pathological events such as tumor growth. Thus, clinical anti-VEGF treatments have been developed which could already prove to have enormous beneficial effects for cancer patients. In this article we describe the first VEGF-derived CD8+ T-cell epitope. The natural HLA ligand SRFGGAVVR was identified by differential mass spectrometry in two primary renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and was significantly over-presented on both tumor tissues. SRFGGAVVR is derived from a cryptic translated region of VEGF presumably by initiation of translation at the non-classical start codon CUG499. SRFGGAVVR specific T-cells were generated in vitro using peptide loaded dendritic cells or artificial antigen presenting cells. They were identified by HLA tetramer analysis after in vitro stimulation. SRFGGAVVR specific CD8+ T-cells were fully functional T-effector cells, which were able to secrete IFN-gamma upon stimulation and killed tumor cells in vitro. Additionally, we have quantitatively analyzed VEGF mRNA and protein levels in RCC tumor and normal tissue samples by gene chip analysis, qRT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and bead based immuno assay. In the future, T-cells directed against VEGF as a tumor associated antigen may represent a possible way of combining peptide-based anti-VEGF immunotherapy with already existent anti-VEGF cancer therapies.
