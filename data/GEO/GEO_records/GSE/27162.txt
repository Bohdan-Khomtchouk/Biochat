TITLE
Gene expression profiling of primary tumors, lymph node and liver metastases in midgut carcinoid tumors.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to clarify the gene expression and identify genes involved in tumor progression, gene expression profiling was performed on tumor specimens. Samples comprised 18 primary tumors, 17 lymph node (LN) metastases and 7 liver metastases. Patients were grouped according to clinical data and histopathology into indolent or progressive course. RNA was subjected to a spotted oligo microarray and B-statistics were performed. Differentially expressed genes were verified using quantitative RT-PCR. Self-organising maps demonstrated three clusters. Eleven primary tumors separated in one cluster, 5 LN metastases in another whereas all liver metastases, 7 primary and 12 LN metastases, formed a third cluster. There was no correlation between indolent and progressive behaviour. The primary tumors with Ki67 > 5%, with low frequency of the carcinoid syndrome and a tendency towards shorter survival grouped together. Primary tumors differed in expression profile from their associated LN metastases. ACTG2, GREM2, REG3A, TUSC2, RUNX1, TPH1, TGFBR2 and CDH6 were differentially expressed between clusters and subgroups of tumors. The expression profile that assembles tumors as being genetically similar on the RNA expression level may not be concordant with the clinical disease course. This study reveals different gene expression profiles and novel genes not previously known to be involved in neuroendocrine tumorigenesis, and which may be of importance for tumor progression.

DESIGN
Gene expression comparisons between 18 primary tumors, 17 lymph node metastases and 7 liver metastases.
