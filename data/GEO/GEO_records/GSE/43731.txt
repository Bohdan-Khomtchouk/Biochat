TITLE
Gene Expression of F. tularensis LVS in hepatocytic cell line FL83B vs LVS cultured in MH broth

ORGANISM
Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica LVS

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of LVS grown in hepatocytic cell line FL83B was compared to that of LVS cultued in MH broth to discover genes important for intracellular growth.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Intracellular  vs. Broth. Biological replicates: 4 Broth, 4 intracellular, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL4250 JCVI PFGRC Francisella tularensis 12K v1 array designed primarily based on strain Schu4
