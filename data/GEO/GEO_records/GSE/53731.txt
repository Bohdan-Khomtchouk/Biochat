TITLE
Expression data from hepatitis E virus inoculated PLC/PRF/5 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important causative pathogen of acute hepatitis. Because of the absence of an in vitro culture system for HEV, research has been greatly impeded. And interaction between HEV and host cells was mainly studied by tansfection/transinfection system, such as Adeno virus transinfection system. We developed an in vitro culture system for HEV in PLC/PRF/5 cells. With this in vitro culture system, we studied the gene expression profile change by HEV infection. Using a microarray assay, we analysed genes of PLC/PRF/5 cells, whose transcription level could be changed by HEV infection.

DESIGN
Five flasks of PLC/PRF/5 cells inoculated with HEV were used as test sample, and five flasks inoculated with serum-free DMEM/199 medium were used as control samples. Both test and control flasks were cultured under the same conditions. Sixty days after inoculation, the test and control flasks was resolved with Trizol and analysed with Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2 array.
