TITLE
Transcriptional changes in the absence of nth-1, xpa-1 and nth-1;xpa-1

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Background: The ability of an organism to repair damages to DNA is   inextricably linked to aging and cancer.  We have characterized and   compared the transcriptome of C. elegans mutants deficient in DNA   base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair or both to elucidate   the transcriptional changes incurred by the reduction of these repair   pathways. Results: The gene expression signatures from nth-1, xpa-1 and   nth-1;xpa-1 are deciphered. We find that the single mutants are more   similar in overall transcriptomic activity compared to the double mutant   and their corresponding wild-type (N2).  Interestingly, of the enriched   Gene Ontology terms for respective mutants are aging and   proteolysis for nth-1, aging, energy production and unfolded protein   response for xpa-1, and DNA repair and regulation of M-phase for   nth-1;xpa-1.  We also find striking similarities between the biological   processes found to be enriched in the single mutants, which show a shared   response in genes associated with aging and insulin signaling.  Loss of   either BER or NER induces an oxidative stress response, but does not   confer resistance to heat shock. Conclusion: Taken together, our study provides a general overview about   the global transcriptional changes in the absence of nth-1, xpa-1 and   nth-1;xpa-1.  Our results also point to a two-tiered global response to   combat the effects of decreased DNA repair capacity.

DESIGN
C. elegans RNAi mutants deficient in DNA excision repair, nth-1, xpa-1, nth-1;xpa-1 and the corresponding wild-type N2, were subjected to Affymetrix C. elegans microarrays. For nth-1, triplicates were run, whereas for xpa-1, nth-1;xpa-1 and N2, duplicates were run.
