TITLE
Utilization of a Genomic Classifier for Prediction of Metastasis Following Salvage Radiation Therapy after Radical Prostatectomy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To test whether a genomic classifier (GC) predicts development of metastatic disease in patients treated with salvage radiation therapy (SRT) after radical prostatectomy (RP).

DESIGN
70 primary prostate cancer tumor (radicalâ€…prostatectomy, FFPE) specimens from patients at the Durham VA who recieved post-RP radiation therapy.
