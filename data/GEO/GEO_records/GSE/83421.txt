TITLE
Human Parathyroid Gland: Normal vs. Adenoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of genes expressed in normal parathyroid glands (Normal) and adenomatous parathyroid glands from patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Stratagen Human Refernece RNA, pooled from 10 human cell lines, was used to identify genes, which are specifically expressed or suppressed in parathyroid tissue. Comparison between normal and tumor parathyroids shows genes that might be involved in hyperproliferation and PTH hypersecretion in tumors.

DESIGN
6 Normal parathyroid glands and 25 adenoma from PHPT patients.
