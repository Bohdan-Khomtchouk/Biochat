TITLE
Expression data from LoVo colon cancer lines +/- constitutive LIN28B expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms whereby LIN28B functions by comparing the gene expression profile of cells constitutively expressing LIN28B to empty vector controls. Accordingly, we performed microarray analysis on total RNA isolated from empty vector LoVo and LIN28B-expressing LoVo colon cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
Constitutive LIN28B expression was achieved in the LoVo (ATCC #CCL-229) colon cancer cell line via retroviral transduction of MSCV-PIG-LIN28B. Contol = empty vector MSCV-PIG.
