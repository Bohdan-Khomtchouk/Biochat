TITLE
The Nuclear Receptor Rev-erb alpha Regulates Adipose Tissue-Specific FGF21 Signaling (Microarray)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of the transcriptional repressor Rev-erb alpha in epididymal white adipose tissue, we performed a microarray analysis of gene expression in the epididymal white adipose tissue of wildtype and Rev-erb alpha knock-out mice.

DESIGN
Examination of the transcriptome in epididymal white adipose tissue of Rev-erb alpha kockout mice compared to wildtype mice.
