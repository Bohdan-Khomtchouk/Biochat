TITLE
Transcriptome-wide analysis of xylogenesis during growing season in Pinus canariensis

ORGANISM
Pinus taeda

SUMMARY
Wood in conifers is mainly composed of tracheids. Some taxa, such as Pinus, present tracheids also in the rays, but are axial tracheids which constitute the vast majority of secondary xylem. Nevertheless, radial and axial parenchyma surrounding constitutive and traumatic resin ducts is known to serve as crucial reserve storage. These reserves are mobilized in response to traumatism, insect and pathogen attacks and defoliation, allowing the synthesis of resin, healing and, in few taxa, even resprouting. However, due to the low proportion of parenchymatic cells in secondary xylem relevant genes involved in their differentiation may have been missed in studies of transcriptomics of conifer wood formation. In this study we have used Pinus canariensis as a model species, given its comparatively high proportion of axial parenchyma. We have prepared two normalized libraries from its cambial zone, covering early- and late-wood differentiation. We have de novo assembled a transcriptome, and have analyzed the transcriptional profiles during the growing season, getting a more complete picture of wood formation in conifers.
