TITLE
Effect of Malat1 ASO on Neuro2 neuroblastoma cells transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of transfecting Malat1 antisense oligonucleotides on the whole Neuro2 neuroblastoma transcriptome. In this work, global transcription analyses were combined with detailed analyses of some synaptic genes. Our results provide insight on Malat1 effect on the regulation of gene expression in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line. Keywords: Comparative transcriptome analysis from Mus Musculus Neuro2 neuroblastoma cells transfected by Malat1 or Scamble oligodeoxynucleotides.
