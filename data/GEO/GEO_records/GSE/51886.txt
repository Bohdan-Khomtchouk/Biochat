TITLE
Deep sequencing of HetR-bound DNA reveals novel HetR targets in Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120

ORGANISM
Nostoc sp. PCC 7120

SUMMARY
We employed chromatin pull-down and deep sequencing to globally identify HetR DNA targets in vivo at 6 hours after fixed-nitrogen deprivation. We identified novel DNA binding targets of tagged HetR-6xHis and defined a consensus HetR binding site from these HetR target sequences.

DESIGN
Chromatin pull down of hetR mutant strain UHM103 carrying pAM4375, which expresses HetR-6xHis, and a wild-type control. One dataset was collected.

PLATFORM
GPL17863 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Nostoc sp. PCC 7120)
