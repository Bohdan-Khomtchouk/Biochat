TITLE
NGS-mRNA in lung tissues in RAG1-/- and in RAG1-/- Sgo1-/+ mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared lung mRNA expression profiles between RAG1-/-  control and RAG1-/- Sgo1-/+ chromosome instability model mice. RAG1-/-Sgo1-/+ mice developed significantly more spontaneous lung tumors.

DESIGN
Characterize influence of chromosome instability on lung

PLATFORM
