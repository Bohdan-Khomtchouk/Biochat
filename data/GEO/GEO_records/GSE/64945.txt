TITLE
miRNA expression data from mouse fetus ear (pinnae) and back tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
There is not information regards the role of miRNAs in the development of the external ear in mammals. The aim of this study was to determine the stage-specific expression of miRNAs during external ear development in order to identify miRNAs and their possible targets.

DESIGN
GeneChip miRNA 3.0 arrays by Affymetrix were used to obtain miRNA expression profiles from mice fetal pinnae and skin back tissues at 13.5 dpc and 14.5 dpc, biological quadruplicates for each tissue were analyzed; one litter represents one biological replica, each litter with 16 fetuses in average.
