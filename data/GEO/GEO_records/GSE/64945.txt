TITLE
miRNA expression data from mouse fetus ear (pinnae) and back tissues

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
There is not information regards the role of miRNAs in the development of the external ear in mammals. The aim of this study was to determine the stage-specific expression of miRNAs during external ear development in order to identify miRNAs and their possible targets.
