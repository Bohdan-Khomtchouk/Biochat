TITLE
Genome-wide copy number variation in TP53 mutation negative ovarian tumours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide copy number variation was measured in TP53 mutation negative ovarian tumours. Analysis described in " Driver mutations in TP53 are ubiquitous in high grade serous carcinoma of the ovary " (Ahmed et al., 2010)

DESIGN
7 needle-dissected or whole tumours ( > 80% tumour content) were analysed by Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Microarrays

PLATFORM
