TITLE
Expression data from zebrafish depleted of Esco2

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Our study in zebrafish is the first to use an animal model to understand the biology of the developmental disorder Roberts Syndrome (RBS). RBS is caused by mutations in the ESCO2 gene. We have used morpholinos (MO) to knock down esco2 in zebrafish to better understand the pathology of this rare human syndrome. Our zebrafish model nicely phenocopies the developmental defects observed in RBS.

DESIGN
RNA from esco2 morphants and control (injected with buffer only) zebrafish embryos collected at 24 hours post-fertilization (h.p.f.) and 48 h.p.f. was hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays (Gene Chip zebrafish genome arrays cat. no. 900488).  Four pools of 50 embryos for each genotype and time point were used as the RNA source, and RNA from each pool was hybridized independently such that the experiment had four biological replicates. Note that the chip for the 2nd replicate of the control embryos at 48 h.p.f. was faulty and the data is therefore not included.
