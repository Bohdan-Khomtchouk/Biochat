TITLE
Expression data of  GMP and MDP from wild-type and Trib1-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Trib1 is critical for some myeloid cell differentiation. Therefore we used microarrays to investigate gene expression profiles in wild-type and Trib1-/- progenitor of myeloid cells.

DESIGN
Progenitor cells, such as GMP and MDP, obtained from wild-type and Trib1-/- mice were sorted, followed by RNA extraction. Then hybridization on affymetrix microarrays was performed.
