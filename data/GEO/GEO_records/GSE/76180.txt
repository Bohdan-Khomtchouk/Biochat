TITLE
Tissue engineered colorectal cancer metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To confirm that the biology of engineered liver and lung metastases are similar to in vivo metastases, we compared the global gene expression profiles of the engineered liver and lung metastases of HT-29 cells to that of standard tissue culture (plastic), Matrigel culture and in vivo liver metastasis (splenic injection).

DESIGN
HT-29 cells were grown on plastic culture dish (plastic), matrigel coated culture dish, liver biomatrix coated culture dish, lung biomatrix coated dish, or in vivo liver metastasis tumor through splenic injection. HT-29 gene expression was measured through microarray. Four different experiments were performed at each culture condition.
