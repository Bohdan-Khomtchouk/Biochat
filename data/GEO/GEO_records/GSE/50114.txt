TITLE
Identification of a gene expression signature in colorectal adenoma in comparison with normal mucosa

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We showed that a large number of genes were deregulated in colorectal adenomas in comparison with colorectal normal mucosae.

DESIGN
37 colorectal adenoma and 9 colorectal normal mucosa samples were analyzed. We generated a comparison between adenomas and normal mucosae.
