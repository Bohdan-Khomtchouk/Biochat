TITLE
Wild type versus PerR mutant Streptococcus pyogenes

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
In Streptococcus pyogenes, mutation of the peroxide sensor PerR results in avirulence despite producing hyper-resistance to peroxide stress. To understand the basis of this effect, global transcription profiling was conducted. Keywords: Study of the regulation of gene expression by PerR
