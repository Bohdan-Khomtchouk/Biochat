TITLE
Expression data from Sca-1 knockout  mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of Sca-1 on mammary tumorigenesis was assessed. Microarrays were used to analyse global gene expression changes in Sca-1 KO mice versus wild-type mice and determine the differential responses to MP and DMBA-induced Mammary carcinogenesis

DESIGN
RNA was isolated (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen) from MP-DMBA induced mammary tumor or  mammary gland tissue from nulliparious transgenic and wild-type mice maintained on normal rodent chow
