TITLE
KDM4B- and KDM6B-regulated genes in human mesenchymal stem cell osteogenic differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate how histone demethylases KDM4B and KDM6B may be involved in osteogenic commitment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), we performed gene expression profiling and comparison on control, KDM4B- and KDM6B-knockdown MSCs at different stages of osteogenic differentiation.

DESIGN
Human MSCs infected with scramble shRNAs, shRNAs against KDM4B or KDM6B are treated with BMP4/7 for 0, 4 and 24hrs. Total RNA were extracted from these 9 samples.
