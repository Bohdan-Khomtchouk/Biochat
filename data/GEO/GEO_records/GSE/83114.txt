TITLE
LTβR controls thymic portal endothelial cells for hematopoietic progenitor cell homing and T cell regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Continuous thymic homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) via the blood is critical for normal T cell development. However, the nature and the differentiation program of the specialized thymic endothelial cells (ECs) controlling this process remain poorly understood. Here, using conditional gene-deficient mice, we find that lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) directly controls thymic ECs to guide HPC homing. Interestingly, T cell deficiency or conditional ablation of T-cell-engaged LTβR signaling results in a defect in thymic HPC homing, suggesting the feedback regulation of thymic progenitor homing by thymic products. Furthermore, we identify and characterize a special thymic portal EC population with features that guide HPC homing. LTβR is essential for the differentiation and homeostasis of these thymic portal ECs. Finally, we show that LTβR is required for T cell regeneration upon irradiation-induced thymic injury. Together, these results uncover a cellular and molecular pathway that governs thymic EC differentiation for HPC homing.

DESIGN
