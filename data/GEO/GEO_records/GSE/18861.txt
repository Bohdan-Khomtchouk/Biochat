Mercury-Induced Hepatotoxicity in Zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Full title: Mercury-Induced Hepatotoxicity in Zebrafish: In Vivo Mechanistic Insights from Transcriptome Analysis, Phenotype Anchoring and Targeted Gene Expression Validation In this study, we performed microarray-based expression profiling on liver of zebrafish exposed to 200 Âµg/L of mercuric chloride for 8-96 h, to identify global transcriptional programs and biological pathways involved in mercury-induced adaptive responses under in vivo environment.

DESIGN
We analyzed 12 arrays for mercuric chloride treated zebrafish liver and 12 arrays for control liver.
