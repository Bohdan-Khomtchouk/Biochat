TITLE
Large conserved domains of low DNA methylation maintained by 5-hydroxymethycytosine and Dnmt3a (CMS bisulfite-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gains and losses in DNA methylation are prominent genomic features of all mammalian cell types.  To gain insight into mechanisms that could promote shifts in DNA 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmc) patterns and thus contribute to cell fate, including malignant transformation, we performed genome-wide mapping of 5hmc in purified wild type and Dnmt3a conditional knockout hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) using cytosine-5-methylenesulphonate sequencing (CMS-seq). Comparing anti-CMS pulldown to input control, we identified 107,549 and 175,682 peaks of 5hmc enrichment in control and Dnmt3a knockout HSCs, respectively.

DESIGN
Whole genome CMS-enriched bisulfite sequencing of secondarily-transplanted wild-type and Dnmt3a conditional knockout hematopoietic stem cells using Illumina HiSeq 2000

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
