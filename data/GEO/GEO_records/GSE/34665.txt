TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling of the response to D-limonene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Metabolic engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for efficient monoterpenes production was mostly restricted by the limited tolerance to these chemicals. Understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the tolerance of S. cerevisiae to monoterpenes was essential for the de novo biosynthesis these chemicals in S. cerevisiae. In this study, commercial oligonucleotide microarray assays were performed to investigate the global response of S. cerevisiae to typical monoterpene D-limonene under transcriptional level. Yeast cell treated with sublethal dose of D-liomonene, gene change profiles were investigated at transcription level and the microarry data were also verified with quantitative real time PCR.

DESIGN
D-limonene induced gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae at early logarithmic phase was measured at 2 hours after exposure to doses of 0.02% (v/v)  D-limonene. Three independent experiments were performed for each experiment (control or 2 hours).
