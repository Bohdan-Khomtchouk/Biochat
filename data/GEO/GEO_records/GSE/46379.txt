TITLE
miRNA transcriptome of Zmpste24-decifient mouse embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we employed massively parallel sequencing technology to identify miRNAs expressed in Zmpste24 WT MEF and Zmpste24-/- MEF. With data from 19.5 ×106 reads from WT MEFs and 16.5 × 106 reads from Zmpste24-/- MEFs, we discovered a total of 306 known miRNAs expressed in MEFs with a wide dynamic range of read counts ranging from 10 to over 1 million. A total of 8 miRNAs were found to be significantly down-regulated, with only 2 miRNAs upregulated, in Zmpste24-/- MEFs as compared to WT MEFs.

DESIGN
Examination of miRNA profile in Zmpste24 WT MEF and Zmpste24-/- MEF
