TITLE
ATM Requirement in Gene Expression Responses to Ionizing Radiation in Human Lymphoblasts and Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of ATM-dependent and dose-dependent, or -independent, responses were examined in human lymphoblast cells 6 hr following exposure to either 1 or 5 Gy ionizing radiation. Keywords: cDNA, dual-channel

DESIGN
Human lymphoblast cells from " apparently healthy " individuals and individuals with Ataxia telangiectasia were exposed to 1 Gy or 5 Gy ionizing radiation.  Gene expression responses 6 hr following IR were examined.  Untreated samples were hybridized together with their matched treated samples.
