TITLE
C/EBP Maintains Chromatin Accessibility in Liver and Facilitates Glucocorticoid Receptor Recruitment to Steroid Response Elements

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
DNase-seq and ChIP-seq determine that C/EBP maintains chromatin accessibility in liver and facilitates glucocorticoid receptor recruitment to steroid response elements

DESIGN
DNase-seq and ChIP-seq (GR, C/EBPb and RNAPII) in intact liver from adrenalectomized mice injected with dex (1h)

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
