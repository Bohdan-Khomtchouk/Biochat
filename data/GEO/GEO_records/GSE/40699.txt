SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Florencia Pauli ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track is produced as part of the ENCODE project. The track displays the methylation status of specific CpG dinucleotides in the given cell types as identified by the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 Bead Array platform ( ). In general, methylation of CpG sites within a promoter causes silencing of the gene associated with that promoter. The Infinium Human Methylation 450 platform uses bisulfite treated genomic DNA to assay the methylation status of more than 450,000 CpG sites covering all designatable RefSeq genes, including promoter, 5' and 3' regions, without bias against those lacking CpG islands. Additionally, the assay includes CpG islands and shores, CpG sites outside of CpG islands, non-CpG methylated sites identified in human stem cells, differentially methylated sites identified in tumor versus normal (multiple forms of cancer) and across several tissue types, CpG islands outside of coding regions, miRNA promoter regions, and disease-associated regions identified through GWAS. Detailed information for the CpG targets is in an CSV formatted spreadsheet in the supplemental directory ( ). For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
