TITLE
Dynamic gene expression response to altered gravity in human T cells (sounding rocket flight)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated differentially regulated genes in human Jurkat T lymphocytic cells in 20s and 5min microgravity and in hypergravity and compared expression profiles to identify potential gravity-regulated genes and adaptation processes.

DESIGN
Human Jurkat T cells were exposed to altered gravity during a sounding rocket flight
