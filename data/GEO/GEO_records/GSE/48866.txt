SUMMARY
We present a strategy to investigate regulatory elements that leverages programmable reagents to selectively inactivate their endogenous chromatin state. The reagents, which comprise fusions between transcription activator- like effector (TALE) repeat domains and the LSD1 histone demethylase, efficiently remove enhancer-associated chromatin modifications from target loci, without affecting control regions. We find that inactivation of enhancer chromatin by these fusions frequently causes down- regulation of proximal genes. Our study demonstrates the potential of 'epigenome editing' tools to characterize a critical class of functional genomic elements. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
