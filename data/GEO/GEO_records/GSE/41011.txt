TITLE
Dynamic Transcriptome Analysis Reveal New Prognosis Biomarker in Colorectal Cancer (gene expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene profile of TNM-specific sequence design and integrated network-based bioinformatic analysis in 20 Colorectal cancer patients(n=5 for each TNM stage) are carried out to find the dynamic gene expression pattern specific to TNM stage. microRNA microrray experiment of the same samples were also performed. Two different platform of microarray data were analyzed together to uncover the potential biomarker for progression of colorectal cancer.

DESIGN
Primary tumor and paired distant normal mucosa of 20 colorectal patient were collected to performed the microarray experiment. Data of five classes including 12 distant normal mucosa,5 stage I, 4 stage II, 5 stage III and 5 stage IV tumor sample(Total of 31 samples) passed the correlation-based data filtering and went for further analysis. Gene expression pattern in accordance with TNM stage were analyzed to uncover the dynamic gene expression pattern. Significant expression patterns with distinct biological features were uncovered for prognosis prediction and further functional experiment.
