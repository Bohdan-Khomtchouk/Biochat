TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation analyses by the MeDIP assay

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the genome-wide DNA methylation in Zscan4 overexpressing ES cells. Zscan4 overexpression induced slight DNA demethylation in telomere and major satellite regions. Subsequent genome-wide analysis of non-repeated regions revealed the significant reduction of DNA methylation at Zscan4-dependent hyperacetylation sites. This result indicates that Zscan4 is not only a marker of the Zscan4+ state of ES cells, but also indispensable for the dramatic epigenetic modifications occurring in the Zscan4+ state.
