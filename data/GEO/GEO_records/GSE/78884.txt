TITLE
Ubiquitin proteasome expression in Mulitple Myeloma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The ubiquitin proteasome system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Multiple Myeloma, highlighted by the unique success of proteasome inhibitors in this malignancy. Using topic-defined microarrays we have looked at expression of ubiquitin proteasome system genes in 2 multiple myeloma cell lines and normal bone marrow samples.

DESIGN
Normal bone marrow samples from 5 healthy donors and 2 multiple myeloma cell lines, OPM-2 (4 replicates) and U266 (3 replicates), were included in the study.
