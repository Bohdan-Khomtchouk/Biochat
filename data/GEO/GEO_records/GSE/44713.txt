TITLE
microRNA-190-mediated transcriptional changes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previously, we showed that miRNA-190 (miR-190) is among the most upregulated miRNAs in all dormant tumors analyzed. Up-regulation of miR-190 led to prolonged tumor dormancy in otherwise fast-growing glioblastomas and osteosarcomas. In this study, we investigated transcriptional changes induced by miR-190 expression in cancer cells and show similar patterns of miR-190-mediated transcriptional reprogramming in both glioblastoma and osteosarcoma cells. The data suggests that miR-190-mediated effects rely on an extensive network of molecular changes in tumor cells and that miR-190 affects several transcriptional factors, tumor suppressor genes and interferon response pathways.

DESIGN
For each cancer cell type, gene expression patterns in control cells that express GFP-only were compared to cells over-expressing microRNA-190.
