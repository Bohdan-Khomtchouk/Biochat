TITLE
Expression data from NKG2A/C/E+ and negative CD4 effectors after influenza A infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD4 T cells can differentiate into a hetergenous population of effector T cells. A population of cytotoxic CD4 T cells can be generated against influenza challenge, however identifying these cells have been challenging. The expression of NKG2A/C/E on CD4 T cells identifies CD4 T cells with cytotoxic potential thus allowing further characterization of this subset of CD4 effector cells. Microarray analysis comparing cytotoxic CD4 T cells versus non-cytotoxic CD4 T cells reveals unique differences in localization between these populations in the lung after influenza A challenge.

DESIGN
Congenically marked TCR transgenic HNT CD4 T cells were adoptively transferred into na√Øve host mice which were subsequently infected with influenza A virus[strain A/PR8]. At day 7 post infection, the transferred CD4 effectors were flow sort purified from lungs based on their expression of NKG2A/C/E. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix arrays.
