TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of control and MMP-14 (MT1-MMP) expressing MCF-7 cells growing in three-dimensional (3D) type I collagen gels versus monolayer cell culture conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the impact of MMP-14 (MT1-MMP) and three-dimensional (3D) culture conditions on the transcriptomes of a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, we performed a microarray analysis from RNAs isolated from MCF-7 cells expressing either an empty vector (CTRL) or human MMP-14 cDNA (MT1) in monolayer (2D) and 3D collagen (3D Col) growth conditions.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with either an empty vector (pcDNA3.1/Zeo) or human MMP-14 cDNA (pcDNA3.1-MMP-14/Zeo). Cells were grown for 24, 48 and 72 hours in three-dimensional (3D) type I collagen gels or in monolayer culture conditions. Cells were then lysed in TRIzol and total RNA was isolated. For each experimental condition, total RNAs isolated from 4 independant biological replicates were pooled.
