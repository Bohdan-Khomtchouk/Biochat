TITLE
To compare the expression profile of CD8 T cells from mice vaccinated with Ad85A via the intranasal (IN) or intradermal (ID) routes isolated from lungs or spleen.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In Balb/c mice, the presence of effector CD8 T cells in lungs after intra-nasal (IN) immunization with replication deficient recombinant Adenovirus expressing the 85A antigen from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) (Ad85A) correlates with protection against aerosol MTb infection. In order to identify differentially expressed transcripts which contribute to protection by IN immunized lung CD8 T cells, total RNA from CD8 T cells isolated from target tissue (lungs) and lymphoid organ (spleen ) after a protective (IN) and non-protective (intradermal, ID) immunization regime will be analyzed in a whole-genome microarray study.

DESIGN
Total RNA from CD8 T cells isolated from lungs or spleens of Balb/c mice 3 weeks post-immunization with Ad85A through the IN (protective) or ID (non-protective) route will be compared.
