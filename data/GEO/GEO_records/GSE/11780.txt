TITLE
Muscle gene expression of lambs with maternal callipyge allele

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Lambs that inherit a callipyge allele from their dam have an up-regulation of maternally imprinted transcripts near the callipyge mutation but do not exhibit muscle hypertrophy. It is not clear what effects these maternally expressed transcripts have in the muscle or how the inheritance of a maternal callipyge allele prevents the expression of the callipyge phenotype which is seen paternal heterozygotes only. This experiment utilized bovine gene expression arrays to profile the gene expression of the semimembranosus muscle of 30 day old half-sibling lambs of all four possible genotypes with respect to the callipyge allele (+/+, C/+, +/C, and C/C). Keywords: allele effect
