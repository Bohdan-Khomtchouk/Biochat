TITLE
Genome wide analysis of binding of Polyhomeotic and polymerization defective Polyhomeotic in Drosophila S2 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To understand the role of the conserved Sterile Alpha Motif of the Polycomb Group protein Polyhomeotic, the genome wide distribution of wild type and polymerization defective Polyhomeotic containing mutations in the SAM domain was determined by ChIP-SEQ.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq Identification of polyhomeotic wild type (PH-WT) and mutant (PH-ML)  binding sites.

PLATFORM
