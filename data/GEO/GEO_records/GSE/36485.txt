TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of quorum sensing-dependent genes in Burkholderia glumae BGR1

ORGANISM
Burkholderia glumae

SUMMARY
Burkholderia glumae causes rice grain rot and sheath rot by producing toxoflavin, whose expression is regulated by quorum sensing (QS). The QS systems of the bacterium rely on N-octanoyl homoserine lactone, synthesized by TofI and its cognate receptor TofR, to activate toxoflavin biosynthesis genes and an IclR-type transcriptional regulator gene, qsmR. To understand genome-wide transcriptional profiling of QS signaling, we employed RNA-Seq of the wild type Burkholderia glumae BGR1 and two QS-defective mutants, BGS2 (BGR1 tofI::Ω) and BGS9 (BGR1 qsmR::Ω), with two different types of culture conditions including 6hr liquid culture (before onset QS) and 10hr liquid culture (after onset QS).

DESIGN
3 samples examined: Burkholderia glumae BGR1 wild type, and two QS-defective mutants, BGS2 (BGR1 tofI::Ω) and BGS9 (BGR1 qsmR::Ω). Two conditions: cultured in LB media for 6hrs or 10hrs.

PLATFORM
