TITLE
Study the function of miR-195 and miR-30d in prostate cancer cell (LNCap and DU145)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNAs are related with the initiation and development of prostate cancer. We discover the miR-195 and miR-30 can be as a biomarker of prognosis of prostate cancer in clinical patients. miRNA functions through affecting the mRNA degradation by binding the mRNA 3â€™UTR. So we test the change of transcriptional profile of miR-195 and miR-30d cell line respectively to further study the function of miR-195 and miR-30d. To study the function of miR-195 and miR-30d in prostate cancer, we setup the over-expression cell line of the miR-195 and miR-30d respectively in prostate cancer cell(LNCap and DU145), then study the change of transcriptional profile in cell line by microarray experiment (Affymetrix PrimeView human gene expression).

DESIGN
We order the over-expression plasmid of vector, miR-195 and miR-30d from System Biosciences company (Cat No: Scramble Vector PMIRH000PA-1 as Control, miR-195 PMIRH195PA-1, miR-30d PMIRH30dPA-1), and packaged the virus and construct the stable cell line (LNCaP_Control, LNCaP_mir195, LNCaP_mir30d,DU145_Control, DU145_mir195, DU145_mir30d,).    We test the transcriptional profile in cell line by microarray experiment (Affymetrix PrimeView human gene expression).
