TITLE
Gene expression analysis of MCF-10a breast epithelail cells upon enforced expression of G alpha 13 (GNA13)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
G alpha 13 is known to be upregulated in multiple cancer types including breast, prostate, head and neck etc. This analysis was carried out ot identify the down stream effectors of G alpha 13 signaling in breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
MCF-10a cells were transfected with pMSCV-vector ( a retroviral vector) or pMSCV-GNA13. Cells were kept under selection in Blasticidine. MCF-10a cells  stably expressing either pMSCV-Vector or pMSCV-GNA13 are seeded in a 10 cm dish.
