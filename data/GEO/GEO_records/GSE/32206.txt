TITLE
Identity by descent mapping of founder mutations in cancer using high-resolution tumor SNP data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We present a computational tool, FounderTracker, for discovering founder mutations in cancer, based on the detection of significantly conserved haplotypes in tumor SNP profiles. We demonstrate the relevance of the approach by identifying founder mutations in two different cancers, and we show with simulated data that FounderTracker can detect rare founder mutations with high power and negligible false discovery rate. FounderTracker is a powerful tool for discovering novel founder mutations that may explain part of the " missing " heritability in cancer. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
