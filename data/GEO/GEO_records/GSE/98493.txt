TITLE
Expression data of dorsolateral prostates from wild type, prostate-specific Pten knockout, and prostate-specific Pten and Pml double knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to analyze the global gene expression and to identify the differentially expressed genes among wild type, prostate-specific Pten knockout, and prostate-specific Pten and Pml double knockout prostates at 12 weeks of age.

DESIGN
Prostate-specific Pten inactivation leads to indolent, non-lethal invasive prostate cancer after long latency, while compound loss of Pten and Pml drives lethal and metastatic disease. To gain insight into the molecular determinants by which loss of Pml promotes Pten-loss-driven prostate tumorigenesis, we conducted transcriptome comparison using microarray among 12-week-old wild type, Pb-Cre4;PtenLoxP/LoxP, and Pb-Cre4;PtenLoxP/LoxP;PmlLoxP/LoxP prostates.
