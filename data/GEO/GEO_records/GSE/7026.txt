TITLE
Alox5 Knockout Signature in Mouse White Adipose Tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the murine white adipose expression traits that were changed in response to knocking Alox5 out. Keywords: gene specific knockout signature

DESIGN
White adipose tissue from five Alox5 KO mice were arrayed against a pool of white adipose tissue from wildtype B6 animals.  All samples were hybridized as fluor-reverse pairs, and then the data between the pairs was combined to form a single experiment.  Five repeats were performed to increase the power to detect expression changes and to reduce effects of experimental noise.
