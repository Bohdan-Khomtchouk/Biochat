TITLE
Large scale gene expression of Vero cell correlated to infection of infectious bursal disease virus

ORGANISM
Chlorocebus aethiops

SUMMARY
Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is the pathogenic agent of infectious bursal disease (IBD). Scine it was observed in 1957, IBD spread worldwidely in the chicken flocks, is a important immunosuppressive disease and an threat to poultry industry. Although many studies have be done about IBDV, interaction of IBDV infection and IBDV-encoding genes to host cell gene expression are little known. In this study, the LongSAGE library of Vero-cell, IBDV- infected vero cell, Vero-cell transfected with IBDV-VP5 gene, Vero-cell transfected with IBDV A frament and Vero-cell transfected with IBDV VP243 frament were obtained. We got 96,213 gene tags (17 nucleotides), which represented 24,475 transcripts. Keywords: Transcripts of different state vero-cell

DESIGN
1.Cloning of the full-length genomic A-segment, VP5 ORF cDNA, VP243 ORF cDNA of IBDV 2.Establishing cloned Vero cell lines expressing VP5, VP243 and A fragment of IBDV 3.Construction of Long-SAGE libraries 4. Sequencing

PLATFORM
