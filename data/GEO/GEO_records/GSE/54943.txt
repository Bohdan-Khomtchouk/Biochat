TITLE
Identification of Angiotensin II-senstive microRNAs in mouse abdominal aortic endothelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Endothelial-enriched total RNAs were obtained from the suprarenal region of the abdominal aorta which is the murine AAA prone area in AngII-infused C57BL/6 mice.

DESIGN
At 12 or 36h post-AngII pump implantation, endothelial-enriched RNAs from four abdominal aortas were pooled to obtain ~30 ng total RNA as one array sample, performed in triplicates. All RNA samples used for miRNA microarray study passed the initial quality control test and each sample was linearly amplified.
