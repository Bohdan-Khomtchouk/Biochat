TITLE
Formaldehyde exposure alters miRNAs expression profiles in olfactory bulb

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neurotoxicity of formaldehyde (FA) in the human health attracted intensive studies Long-term exposure to FA leads to learning and memory decline and is responsible for the multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) or sick building syndrome (SBS). It was cleared that Formaldehyde impairs Learning and Memory in Hippocampal. however ,it is unclear if FA can disturb the olfactory bulb function miRNAs alterations were related to environmental chemical exposure. It was reported that  FA inhale altered  miRNAs  expression in the nasal Epithelium and lung cells. In the present study, FA inhalation significatly alters miRNA expression profiles within olfactory bulb

DESIGN
Eight week ICR male mouse. Mice were randomly assigned to three groups. The FA group exposed to 3ppm FA for six hours for consecutive 1 and 7days in a chamber which was described previously. The standard group was kept in same condition except the FA. After expose, both group mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. The OB was rapidly dissected
