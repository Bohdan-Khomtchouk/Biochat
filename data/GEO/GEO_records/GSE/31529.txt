TITLE
Genome-wide binding of STAT3 in peritoneal macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To try to identify the mechanism of STAT3âs indirect action we have used a genomic approach to map the binding sites of STAT3 within the genome and also used RNA-seq technology to map the changes in RNA expression and transcript isoforms in response to IL-10.

DESIGN
Examination of STAT3 binding by ChIP-seq in Unstimulated and IL-10 treated peritoneal exudate macrophages purified from mice. We sequenced anti-STAT3 ChIP-seq as well as corresponding control (Input) libraries

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
