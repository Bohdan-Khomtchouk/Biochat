TITLE
The endfeetome, a astroglial translatome of the neurovascular unit

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify astroglial transcripts preferentially translated in the neurovascular unit. The translatome of whole astrocytes extracted following the bacTRAP protocol was compared to a translatome of astrocyte perivascular endfeet.

DESIGN
BAC array purification of astroglial translatome in whole astrocytes and in the neurovascular unit

PLATFORM
GPL18480 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Mus musculus)
