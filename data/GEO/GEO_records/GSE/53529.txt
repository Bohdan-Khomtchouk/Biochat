TITLE
NANOG amplifies STAT3 activation and they synergistically induce the na√Øve pluripotent program

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated Nanog-/- iPSCs from both EpiSCs and pre-iPSCs. We wanted to compare the global gene expression profile of these iPSCs to their parental cells lines and to wild-type and Nanog-/- ESCs.

DESIGN
We analysed two technical replicates of each cell line.
