TITLE
Stochastic anomaly of methylome but persistent SRY hypermethylation in disorder of sex development in canine somatic cell nuclear transfer

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
To infer potential epigenetic variations during SCNT procedure that could occur and lead to abnormal sex-reversal phenotype, we performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on DNAs extracted from primary fibroblast cells isolated from seven dog samples. These samples include two normal donors, two sex-reversed cloned dogs, one sex-reversed re-cloned dog as well as a pair of independent replicate samples taken as controls

DESIGN
Comparing between sex-reversal SCNT-generated dogs with their original donors
