TITLE
Gene expression of innate immune response in endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was investigated by microarray analysis after 4 h infection with S. aureus isolated from healthy nasal carriers (n=5) and from blood (n=5) of septic patients. All bacterial isolates were spa-typed and characterized with a DNA microarray to determine the presence of virulence genes. Keywords: infection studies, pathogen, S. aureus
