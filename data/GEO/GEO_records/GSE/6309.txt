TITLE
Transcriptional profile of E14.5 micro-dissected kidney structures: renal vesicle, s-shaped body

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our laboratory's interest is in understanding the molecular principles that underlie the regional organization of the mammalian metanephric kidney. Our goal is to generate a detailed spatial map of the cellular expression of selected regulatory genes during mammalian kidney development.  The goal of this study is to identify genes expressed during the morphogenesis of the nephron.  By profiling two specific developmental nephron structures, we expect to identify genes expressed in both, and unique to each, which suggests they may play a role in the underlying mechanism responsible for the morphogenesis. Keywords: kidney component comparison
