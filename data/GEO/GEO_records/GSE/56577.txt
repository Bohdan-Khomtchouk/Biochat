TITLE
Differential expression of microRNA in Muc2-/- mouse colonic epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Intestinal epithelia are protected by a layer of mucin secreted by goblet cells against mechanical and chemical injuries, potent causes of inflammation, and the most abundant secreted intestinal mucin is encoded by the Muc2 gene. Genetic deletion of Muc2 causes intestinal inflammation in early stage and tumors after 3 months. The underlying mechanisms are not clear, but epigenetic alterations, particularly, up- and down-regulated microRNAs are involved in the malignant transformation from colitis to cancer. We used miRNA array to profile the differential expression of the miRNAs in Muc2-/- mouse colonic epithelial lin comparison with those in wild-type mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from mouse colonic epithelial cells and Muc2-/- and +/+, and the RNA were hybridized on Affymetrix miRNA microarray to determine the alterations of miRNAs during colitis development and its malignant transformation from colitis to cancer. To the end, we found miRNA were differential expressed in the Muc2-/- mice, among them 20 miRNAs were significantly downregulated and 71 miRNAs were significantly upregulated  in Muc2-/- mice, in comparison with Muc2+/+ mice (change fold > 2 or < 0.5; T < 0.01, p value < 0.05, q value < 0.05).
