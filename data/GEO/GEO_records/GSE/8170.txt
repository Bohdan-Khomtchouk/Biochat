TITLE
Resting and activating NK cells_gene signatures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide transcriptional profiling was used to identify gene expression signatures and pathways in resting and IL2 activated NK cell isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors Keywords: Time series_NK cells gene profile

DESIGN
The aim of the study was to investigate the activation of human NK cells by IL2 through analyzing the global gene expression at different time points (0, 2, 8 and 24 hours) after culture with the cytokine IL2 at 100 IU/ml. NK cells with the CD56+/CD16+ and CD3- phenotype were negatively selected by immunomagnetic beads and re-examined by flow-cytometry to ensure greater than 90% purity (Figure1). Equivalent amount of total RNA from NK cells derived from 3 or 4 different donors for each time point was pooled, amplified and labeled before duplicate hybridizations was performed on spotted (pre-synthesized oligonucleotide) microarrays.
