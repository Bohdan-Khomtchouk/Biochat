TITLE
MiRNA-127 Inhibits IgG Immune Complex-induced Lung Inflammation by Targeting IgG Fcγ Receptor I

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanisms of acute lung injury are incompletely understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial biological regulators that act by suppressing their target genes and are involved in a variety of pathophysiologic processes. MiR-127 appeared to be down-regulated during lung injury. We set out to investigate the role of miR-127 in lung injury and inflammation. Expression of miR-127 significantly reduced cytokine release by macrophages. Looking into the mechanisms of the regulation of inflammation by miR-127, we found that IgG Fcγ Receptor I (FcγRI/CD64) was a target of miR-127, as evidenced by reduced CD64 protein expression in macrophages over-expressing miR-127. Furthermore, miR-127 significantly reduced the luciferase activity with a reporter construct containing the native 3’-UTR of CD64. Importantly, we demonstrated that miR-127 attenuated lung inflammation in an IgG immune complex (IgG IC) model in vivo. Collectively, these data show that miR-127 targets macrophage CD64 expression and promotes the reduction of lung inflammation. Understanding how miRNAs regulate lung inflammation may represent an attractive way to control inflammation induced by infectious or non-infectious lung injury.

DESIGN
MH.S-miR127 and MH.S-Sico cells were cultured for RNA extraction.Total RNA were assessed for quality with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer G2939A (Agilent Technologies,Santa Clara, CA)) and Nanodrop 8000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific/Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE). Hybridization targets were prepared with MessageAmp™ Premier RNA Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX) from total RNA, hybridized to GeneChip® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays in Affymetrix  GeneChip® hybridization oven 645, washed in Affymetrix GeneChip®  Fluidics Station 450 and scanned with Affymetrix GeneChip® Scanner 7G according to standard Affymetrix GeneChip® Hybridization, Wash, and Stain protocols.
