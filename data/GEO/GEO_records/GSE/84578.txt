TITLE
Integrated analyses identify phenotype specific BMP4 signaling in breast cancer [Dnase-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) plays an important role in cancer pathogenesis. In breast cancer, it reduces proliferation and increases migration in a cell line-dependent manner. To characterize the transcriptional mediators of these phenotypes, we performed RNA-seq and DNase-seq analyses after BMP4 treatment in MDA-MB-231 and T-47D breast cancer cells that respond to BMP4 with enhanced migration and decreased cell growth, respectively.

DESIGN
We characterized the Dnase I hypersensitive sites BMP4 treated and non-treated MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cells using Dnase-seq
