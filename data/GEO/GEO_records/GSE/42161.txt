TITLE
Chromatin occupancy of key transcriptional regulators in the presence of the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MM1.S cells are an aggressive dexamethasone sensitive multiple myeloma cell line whose transcritional program is driven by deregulated c-Myc activity.  We present ChIP-seq analysis of key transcritional regulators that are implicated the c-Myc transcriptional network in MM1.S cells treated with vehicle or 500nM JQ1.

DESIGN
Brd4, Cdk9, cMyc, Max, Med1, RNA Pol II, and the chromatin modifications H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac were profiled in MM1.S cells treated with 500nM JQ1 for 24hr

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
