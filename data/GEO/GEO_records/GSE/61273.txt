TITLE
Human Schwann cells generated from human epidermal neural crest stem cells (hEPI-NCSC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal was to determine differentially expressed genes between hEPI-NCSC and Schwann cells generated thereof. RNA was isolated from (a) ex vivo expanded hEPI-NCSC (XP; Clewes O et al, 2011) and from (b) human Schwann cells that were differentiated from hEPI-NCSC (unpublished data)

DESIGN
Three samples of each, XP and Schwann
