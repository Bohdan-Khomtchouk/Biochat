TITLE
To study gene expression by xylose fermenting strains in the presence and absence of furfural

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The main objective is to develop a strain tolerant to furfural for ethanol production from lignocellulosic hydrolysates. We compare gene expressions among three genetically modified S. cerevisiae (control, TAL-expressing and TAL-ADH expressing strain) under the presence and absence of furfural.

DESIGN
Samples for 3 strains (control, TAL-expressing and TAL-ADH expressing strain) were taken after 6h of exposure to furfural. Furfural concentration were 0 and 70 mM. Each samples were duplicated resulting in total of 12 samples.
