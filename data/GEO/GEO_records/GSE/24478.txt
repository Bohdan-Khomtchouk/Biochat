TITLE
Escherichia coli global gene expression in urine from women with urinary tract infection

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Examination of E. coli transcripts present in bacteria in urine samples from 8 patients attending a urology clinic with symptoms of cystitis, as compared to transcripts present in the same E. coli strains during mid-exponential growth in filter-sterilized human urine in vitro.

DESIGN
A 48 array study using total RNA recovered from eight clinical E. coli isolates immediately following collection from women and following culture in pooled human urine ex vivo.  Each array measures the expression of the 5,379 ORFs in the CFT073 genome, using an average of 14 60-mer probes per ORF.  Arrays were performed in triplicate: biological replicates of the in vitro-cultured samples and technical replicates of the in vivo samples.
