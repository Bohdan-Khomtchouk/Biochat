TITLE
Solanaceae comparative gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Capsicum annuum ; Solanum lycopersicum ; Nicotiana tabacum ; Nicotiana benthamiana ; Petunia x hybrida ; Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Six different Solanaceae species, Potato (Solanum tuberosum), Tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum), Pepper (Capsicum annuum), Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), Petunia and Nicotiana benthamiana were grown at 25C, 16h light and 8h darkness. Mature leaves were harvested after 4-6 weeks. RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy. Tomato, pepper, petunia tobacco and N. benthamiana samples were hybridized against potato samples. Keywords: Direct comaprison
