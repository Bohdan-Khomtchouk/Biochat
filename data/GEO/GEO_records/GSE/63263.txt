TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of the eight Drosophila SR protein family members

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Using RNA-seq, we characterize the global AS regulation of the eight Drosophila SR protein family members

DESIGN
RNA-seq experiments on two replicate samples from 8 individual SR protein knockdown (exptGroup=S), two replicates of simultaneous SR protein knockdown (XL6:B52 & SC35:B52) (exptGroup=D).  Each exptGroup includes duplicate of its own non-specific (NS) controls.

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
