TITLE
ChIP-chip data of Npl3-Myc and Rrm3-Flag in wild-type and npl3∆ cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcription is a major obstacle for replication fork progression and a cause of genome instability. Such instability increases in mutants with a suboptimal assembly of the nascent messenger ribonucleo-protein particle (mRNP), as THO/TREX and some heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) mutants. Here we show that yeast npl3∆ cells show genome-wide replication obstacles as determined by accumulation of the Rrm3 helicase. Such obstacles preferentially occur at long and highly expressed genes, to which Npl3 is preferentially bound in wild-type cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip studies were perfomed with antibodies against Myc-tagged Npl3 protein in wild-type cells of the yeast S. Cerevisiae, as well as Flag-tagged Rrm3 protein in both wild-type and npl3∆ cells.
