TITLE
Microarray-based identification of age-dependent differences in gene expression of human dermal fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression approach to differences in stress response between human skin fibroblasts derived from chronologically young (~20 years) and old (~90 years) subjects. Expression of CDKN2A was most different between fibroblasts from young and old subjects and

DESIGN
Human skin fibroblasts were isolated from skin biopsies of 6 young subjects and 6 old subjects and were treated for 3 hours and 3 days with 0.6 uM rotenone. Also there were control samples, not treated but grown for 3 days, making a total of 36 samples. No experimental replicates were included. The expression of CDKN2A  was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR.
