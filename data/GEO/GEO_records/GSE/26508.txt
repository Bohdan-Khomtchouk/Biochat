TITLE
Transcritptome of a revR deletion mutant during Clostridium perfringens exponential phase growth.

ORGANISM
Clostridium perfringens str. 13

SUMMARY
RevR is a putative orphan response regulator with a high degree of similarity to YycF from Bacilus subtilis and PhoB from Clostridium kluyveri.  A revR deletion mutant of C. perfringens strain 13 was generated and the transcriptome analysed using microarrays.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells from the revR mutant and the wild-type control.  Gene expression levels were compared between the revR mutant and wild-type strain 13
