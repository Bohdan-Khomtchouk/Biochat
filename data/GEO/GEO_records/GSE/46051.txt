TITLE
Deep sequencing of endogenous mRNA from Caenorhabditis elegans in the presence and absence of rotenone at 4 different time points

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Background: We here show that inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I promote physical activity, stress resistance as well as lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans despite normal food uptake, i.e. in the absence of DR. Dietary restriction (DR) extends lifespan and promotes metabolic health in evolutionary distinct species. The RNA-seq data comprises 4 age groups (1, 5, 10 and 20 days  after L4) and 2 different conditions (rotenone and normal feeding (DMSO))

DESIGN
22 samples: mRNA profiles of 1-day, 5-day and 10-day old worms as triplicates for each, rotenone and solvent control treatment; mRNA profiles of 20-day old worms as duplicates for each, rotenone and solvent control treatment
