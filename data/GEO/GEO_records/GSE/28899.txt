TITLE
Identification of GLI1 direct target genes in human prostate cancer cell line PC3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PC3GLI1ER and PC3ER were established from human prostate cancer cell line PC3. PC3GLI1ER cells express a chimeric transgene composed of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged version of the amino-terminal half of GLI1, fused to the AF2 domain of the mouse estrogen receptor 1(Esr1) cDNA. On the other hand, PC3ER harbor only EGFP-tagged AF2 domain. To identify GLI1 direct target genes, total RNAs were purified from the cells before and 3 hours after the beta-estradiol (E2) treatment. Gene expression profiles were analyzed by AGILENT human 4x44 cDNA microarray. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
GLI1 direct target genes were identified in PC3 cells. Gene expression profiles of PC3GLI1ER and PC3ER cells were analyzed by AGILENT human 4x44 cDNA microarray before and 3 hours after treatment of beta-estradiol (E2) at doses of 10nM.
