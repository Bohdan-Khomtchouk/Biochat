TITLE
Transcriptome-guided functional analyses reveal novel biological properties and regulatory heirarchy of human embryonic stem cell derived ventricular cardiomyocytes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Profiling global gene expression of undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells, artificially derived cardiomyocytes, fetal ventricular cardiomyocytes, and adult ventricular cardiomyocytes to determine transcriptomic variation between these cell types.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from 10 human samples representing four stages of cardiac development from undifferentiated stem cells to mature adult cardiac tissue.
