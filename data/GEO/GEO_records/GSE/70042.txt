TITLE
Tiling array hybridizations of genomic DNA from Staphylococcus aureus HG001.

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
This analysis is part of the study Whole-transcriptome analysis of Staphylococcus aureus under laboratory and infection-mimicking conditions (MÃ¤der, Nicolas et al., to be submitted) where the S. aureus HG001 transcriptome was analyzed under more than 40 different bilogical conditions. Genomic DNA was prepared from four independent cultures of S. aureus HG001 cells; after sonication, DNA was labeled with Cy3 and hybridized to tiling arrays. The data are used in transcriptome studies to compute expression intensities from raw intensity data using a model of shift and drift.

DESIGN
