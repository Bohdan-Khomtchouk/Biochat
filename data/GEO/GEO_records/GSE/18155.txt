TITLE
Malignant Germ Cell Tumors Display Common microRNA Profiles Resulting in Global Changes in Expression of mRNA Targets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of miRNA expression profiles in malignant germ cell tumors compared to non-malignant control group. Use of bioinformatic algorithm Sylamer to interrogate mRNA expression profiles from malignant germ cell tumors for enrichment or depletion of binding sites for differentially expressed miRNAs. Use of Gene Ontology (GO) analysis to demonstrate functional significance of differentially expressed miRNAs in malignant germ cell tumors.
