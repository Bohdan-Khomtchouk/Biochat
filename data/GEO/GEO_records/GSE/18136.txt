TITLE
Punctual ablation of Foxp3+ T cells unleashes an autoimmune lesion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
How do Treg cells control an autoimmune lesion? We depleted Foxp3+ Treg cells in autoimmune prone TCR transgenic BDC2.5 mice on the NOD background Kinetic of gene-expression changes in CD4 T cells isolated for pancreas and pancreas draining lymph node (PLN) of Foxp3-DTR.BDC2.5/NOD mice after Treg cell ablation Keywords: T cell activation/ differentiation after Treg depletion timecourse

DESIGN
CD4 T cells were isolated from pancreas and PLN at 0, 15 and 24 hours after diphtheria toxin application into 4-6 week old female Foxp3-DTR.BDC2.5/NOD transgenic mice
