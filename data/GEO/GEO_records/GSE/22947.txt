TITLE
Expression data from in-vitro induced Interfascicular Cambium of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In-vitro induced establishment and activity of the interfascicular cambium in Arabidopsis thaliana stems under auxin treatments. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the establishment and activity of the interfascicular cambium and identified tissue-speciffic up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Different tissue types from in-vitro auxin treated stems were selected at successive stages of cambium establishment using laser capture microdissection for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We aimed to obtain genes exclussively upregulated in the interfascicular region responsible for cambium establishment and activity.
