TITLE
miRNA profiling of primary breast cancers from patients treated with radiotherapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Radiotherapy is essential to the treatment of most solid tumors  and acquired or innate resistance to this therapeutic modality is a major clinical problem. This study aimed to identify miRNAs associated with local relapse following radiotherapy.

DESIGN
Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor material was used from 20 patients, consisting of two groups of 10 patients matched for all clinico-pathologic variables and differing only in local relapse status. Radiotherapy consisted of 45 Gy in 25 fractions plus a tumor bed boost of 16 Gy in 8 fractions.

PLATFORM
