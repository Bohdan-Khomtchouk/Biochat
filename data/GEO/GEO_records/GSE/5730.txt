TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of laser-capture micro-dissected embryonic tissues

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The aim of this BBSRC-funded project is to develop laser-capture microdissection (LCMD) to isolate small cell clusters in different regions of arabidopsis embryos at different stages of development; to develop RNA amplification procedures on dissected tissue sampes; and to use DNA microarray techniques to investigate global transcriptional differences between samples. Cryosectioned embryos of ecotype Col-O of globular, heart and torpedo stage were used to isolate cell clusters from the apical and basal regions, for RNA isolation and amplification. !Samples will be provided as T7-primed cDNA, with three biological replicates for each tissue to be analysed. Each replicate comprises cDNA from pooled tissue samples from ca. 15 embryos. The experimental details have been discussed with Sean May et al. at NASC.
