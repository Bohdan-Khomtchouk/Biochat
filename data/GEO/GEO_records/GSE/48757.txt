TITLE
Pro-inflammatory stimulation of human skin-derived precursor cells modulates several of their immunology-related pathways.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human skin-derived precursor cells (hSKP) are a stem cell population that represents key candidates for cell based-therapy. Inflammation, however, is often present in situations where cellular replacement therapy is required. These inflammatory conditions, and more specifically the presence of the cytokine interferon (IFN)-γ, might result in an increase of MHC class II antigens in hSKP-derived grafts and facilitate their rejection. We used microarray analyses to confirm the activated status of the pro-inflammatory condition, induced by exposure to a cocktail of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IFN-γ, TNFα and IFN-α). Consequently, we investigated the modulation by inflammation of canonical pathways related to immunology in hSKP.

DESIGN
hSKP obtained from 3 different donors (passage 4) were cultivated in the presence or absence of the pro-inflammatory cocktail. Control and pro-inflammatory stimulated samples were collected 18h after treatment.
