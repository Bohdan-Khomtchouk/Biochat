TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of long-term hematopoietic cells (LT-HSCs) with or without mutations in JAK2 and Ezh2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of mRNA expression profiles of LT-HSCs with or without mutations in JAK2 and Ezh2 by RNA sequencing. LT-HSC mRNA was extracted from six different transgenic mice (SclCre, SclCre;Ezh2+/-, SclCre;Ezh2-/-, SclCre; JAK2V617F, SclCre; JAK2V617F;Ezh2+/-, SclCre; JAK2V617F;Ezh2-/-) 10 weeks after tamoxifen injection. Our study represents the first detailed analysis of mRNA expression profile of LT-HSC with or without mutations in JAK2 and Ezh2 , with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. Our results revealed that mRNA expression profile of LT-HSC with different genotype showed specific gene expression patterns, which allows to do biological comprehensive and quantitative analysis for hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
LT-HSCs mRNA profiles six different transgenic mice (SclCre, SclCre;Ezh2+/-, SclCre;Ezh2-/-, SclCre; JAK2V617F, SclCre; JAK2V617F;Ezh2+/-, SclCre; JAK2V617F;Ezh2-/-) were generated by deep sequencing.
