TITLE
Memory-like CD8 T-cells sustain the immune response to chronic viral infections.

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We have discovered a small subpopulation of virus-specific CD8 T-cells that sustains the T-cell response in chronic infections.  These cells are defined by - and depend on - the expression of the transcription factor Tcf1 (T cell  factor 1) and show key characteristics of central memory cells while lacking an effector signature.  Unlike conventional memory cells, Tcf1+ T-cells display hallmarks of an “exhausted” phenotype,  including the expression of certain inhibitory receptors.

DESIGN
Naive Tcf1-GFP+ P14 cells (Naive) were transferred into Vb5 recipient mice  (CD45.1)  prior to infection with LCMV clone 13 (c13). Tcf1-GFP+ P14 cells (chronic Tcf1+) and Tcf1-GFP- P14 cells (chronic Tcf1-) were flow sorted on day 28 post infection. Naive Tcf1-GFP+ P14 cells (Naive) were also  transferred into C57BL/6 hosts (CD45.1.2) prior to infection with LCMV Armstrong (Arm). Tcf1-GFP+ P14 cells (memory Tcf1+) and Tcf1-GFP- P14 cells (memory Tcf1-) were flow sorted on day 28 post infection. Total RNA was extracted, cDNA libraries prepared and sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500 technology.
