TITLE
Expression study of liver smaples of 2-days old  Mfp2 knockout mice as compared to wild type

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Study on gene expression in multifunctional protein 2 deficient mice. Liver samples of two days old mice in normal conditions are used. In total 8 arrays were hybridized corresponding to 4 KO mice and 4 WT mice Results: Cholesterol synthesis is induced and ppar alpha targets also differentially expressed between KO and WT. Keywords: Knockout gene expression study; genetic modification
