TITLE
Differential gene expression between Salmonella Typhimurium biofilms on glass vs cholesterol surfaces

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. LT2

SUMMARY
Salmonella spp. biofilms have been implicated in persistence in the environment and plant surfaces. In addition, Salmonella is able to form biofilms on the surface on cholesterol gallstones. The ability of Salmonella spp. on these surfaces is superior to biofilm formation on surfaces on glass or plastic. Thus, we hypothesized that Salmonella gene expression is specific during biofilm development on cholesterol surfaces.
