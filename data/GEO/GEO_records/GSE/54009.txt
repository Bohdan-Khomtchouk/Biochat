TITLE
Small RNA expression throughout the development of Drosophila virilis

ORGANISM
Drosophila virilis

SUMMARY
Examination of temporal small RNA expression during the embryonic development, larval and adult stages of Drosophila virilis

DESIGN
Small RNA sequencing of samples representing different stages of D. virilis development, including eight 2-hour intervals during the first 16 hours of development (0-2h, 2-4h, etc.), late embryos until hatching (16-30h), 3rd instar larvae and adults

PLATFORM
