TITLE
Cyp1b1-mediated suppression of lymphoid progenitors in bone marrow coordinately impacts spleen and thymus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C57BL/6j mice were treated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzo(a)pyrene, 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, and 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1 deletion separately and in combination were evaluated relative to the intact WT mice

DESIGN
Nine comparison experiment. Comparison of C57BL/6J WT oil-treated control with BP (6h post-treatment), DMBA (12h post-treatment) and  TCDD (12h post-treatment). Comparison of Cyp1b1-null (1b1-ko) oil-treated control with WT oil-treated control and DMBA (12h post-treatment). Comparison of Cyp1a1-null (1a1-ko) oil-treated control with WT oil-treated control and BP (12h post-treatment). Comparison of Cyp1b1/1a1-null (DKO) oil-treated control with WT oil-treated control and BP (12h post-treatment).
