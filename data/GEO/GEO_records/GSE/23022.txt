TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from human prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules of about 21-25 nucleotides that regulate gene expression via posttranscriptional inhibition of protein synthesis. They play a vital role in the process of tumorigenesis. To identify and characterize the diagnostic potential of miRNAs in prostate cancer, a leading cause of tumor mortality, we performed microarray based screening of miRNA expression profiles.

DESIGN
We selected 20 cases of moderately differentiated prostate cancer and generated pairs of tumor and corresponding normal tissue by microdissection
