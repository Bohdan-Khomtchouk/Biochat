TITLE
caArray_willm-00090: Gene Expression Profiling Reveals Novel Genes for Improved Risk Classification and Outcome Prediction in Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Identification, Cloning, and Validation of OPAL1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix HG_U95Av2 oligonucleotide microarrays were used to perform gene expression profiling of 254 cases of pediatric ALL in order to determine genes predictive of outcome that may be useful in refining risk classification.
