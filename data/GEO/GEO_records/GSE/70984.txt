TITLE
Expression data from quadriceps of utrn+/-;mdx mice treated with spironolactone plus lisinopril compared to untreated

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the gene expression differences in skeletal muscles resulting from treatment of dystrophic mice with spironolactone plus lisinopril

DESIGN
6 total samples were analyzed; 3 biological replicates for each spironolactone plus lisinopril and untreated groups; a pairwise comparison between groups was carried out and a fold-change â‰¥2 were selected.
