TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of maize developing earshoot, IBMRIL X IHP1 hybrid

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Maize earshoot is a metabolic sink espcially related to nitrogen metabolism. Studies on the transcriptomic and metabolic changes occuring in earshoot can provide interesting answers about the nitrogen metabolic potential of the maize variety under study. Intermated B73 X Mo17 recombinant inbred lines (IBMRIL) belong to a predominantly used mapping population. Illinois high protein (IHP) line is a metabolic extreme with respect to nitrogen mebolism with around 30% seed protein. Developing earshoots from this genotype grown at nitrogen-deficient and nitrogen-sufficient conditions were sampled, processed and analyzed through microarray technology. IBMRIL population was crossed to IHP to find the allelic interaction related to nitrogen metabolism. Microarray experiment was conducted using the developing earshoots from IBMRIL X IHP1 lines that deffered in their grain yield significantly. Keywords: Yield response
