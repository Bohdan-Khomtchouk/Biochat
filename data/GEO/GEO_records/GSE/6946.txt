TITLE
Transcript analysis of aluminum tolerance responses in Medicago truncatula

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
For transcript analysis of aluminum tolerance responses in Medicago truncatula we compared transcripts from 2.5 ÂµM Al-treated and control (-Al) root tips corresponding to 12 and 48 h after Al treatment in Al-tolerant (T32) and Al-sensitive (S70) lines. Keywords: 2 time points and 2 lines

DESIGN
Time course of 2 time points and 2 lines consists of 24 microarrays. Each time point experiment consists of three direct (reps1, 2, 3) and three dye-swapped (reps 4, 5, 6) technical replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL4799 Medicago truncatula 16K Genome Oligo Set
