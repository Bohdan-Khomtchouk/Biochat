TITLE
Role of Manganese Efflux for Signaling and Pathogenesis in Streptococcus pneumonia

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 transcriptome in response to manganese as the transcriptome changes in response to intracellular manganese accumulation via a mutation in sp1552/mntE a manganese efflux protein.

DESIGN
Investigating role of manganese efflux and accumulation in S. pneumoniae: 3 TIGR4 in ThyB vs. TIGR4 in Mn  and 3 TIGR4 in Mn vs mntE1 in Mn replicate 3

PLATFORM
GPL8038 Streptococcus pneumoniae 3K version 6
