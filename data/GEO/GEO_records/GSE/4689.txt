TITLE
clp1 induction

ORGANISM
Ustilago maydis

SUMMARY
The clp1 gene is a b-dependent gene required for clamp formation during the biotrophic growth phase of U. maydis. The gene was induced by means of a fusion to the arabinose inducable crg1 promoter. To exclude effects from the b-mating type locus, the experiments were performed in strain JB1 carrying a deletion of the entire b-locus. Keywords: gene induction
