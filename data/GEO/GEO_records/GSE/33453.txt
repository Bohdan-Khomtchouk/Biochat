TITLE
MiR expression profiles in M1-polarized compared with unstimulated (MÐ¤) bone marrow-derived macrophage cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The global change of the miR expression profile during atherosclerosis is due to the infiltration of different types of leukocytes into the arterial vessel wall in addition to disease-specific regulation in vascular cells. Monocyte-derived macrophage accumulation in the subintimal region is critical in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. It is currently unknown which miRs are involved in the atherogenic macrophage response. The comparison of the miR expression profile in LPS/Interferon-gamma activated mouse macrophages with the miR expression in the unstimulated mouse macrophages was performed to detect M1-type macrophage-enriched miRs. This screening combined with our miR profiling in atherosclerotic vessels may help to identify M1-type macrophage-enriched miRs in atherosclerotic vessels that may play a role in the macrophage function during atherogenesis.
