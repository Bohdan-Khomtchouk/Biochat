RNA-seq analysis of human cardiosphere cells with different tubule supportive potential

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis of Cardiosphere derived cells from 6 patients, three were good supporters of angiogenesis and three were poor supporters of angiogenesis

DESIGN
Cardiosphere derived cells were tested for their ability to support HUVEC supportive ability. 6 samples were expanded, RNA isolated and RNA-seq experiments carried out

PLATFORM
