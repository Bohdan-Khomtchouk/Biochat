TITLE
Identification of microRNA as novel circulating markers for presence of intracranial aneurysms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We carried out a case control study in an attempt to identify changes in circulating microRNAs in patients with intracranial aneurysms (IAs). We selected 40 cases (20 ruptured and 20 unruptured) and 20 healthy controls. We randomly selected 5 samples from each group and combined them into a sample pool. In this way we obtained 12 sample pools and one pool was used for a single microarray. Changes in microRNA levels in the plasma were surveyed with Agilent Human microRNA Microarray (Release 14.0, 8x15K). We identified 20 microRNAs that were unanimously changed in both ruptured and unruptured patients.

DESIGN
We included 40 cases (20 ruptured and 20 unruptured) and 20 healthy controls. We randomly selected 5 plasma samples from each group and combined them into a sample pool. In this way we obtained 12 sample pools and one pool was used for a single microarray. Total RNA was isolated from 1 ml plasma from each sample pool and resuspended in the same volume of buffer. A fixed volume of RNA sample was used for microarray detection.
