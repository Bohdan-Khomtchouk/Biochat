TITLE
Chromosomal status of GM00285 and GM05563 fibroblast and iPSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from ring chromosome patients' cells.  To examine chromosomal status in these iPSCs, we performed SNP microarray analysis using Agilent Sureprint G3 Human CGH + SNP 4x180k microarray platform.

DESIGN
SNP analysis of fibroblast of GM00285 and GM05563 and iPSCs of GM00285 clone 1, GM00285 clone 3, GM05563 clone 1

PLATFORM
GPL11358 Agilent-029830 Human Genome CGH + SNP Microarray (Feature Number version)
