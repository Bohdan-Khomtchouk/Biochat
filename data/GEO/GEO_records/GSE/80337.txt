TITLE
Genome wide gene-expression analysis of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae after transfer from their common host (bean) to either cotton, maize or soy

ORGANISM
Tetranychus urticae

SUMMARY
A genetically diverse strain (labelled as London) of the phytophagous mite Tetranychus urticae was transferred from its common host (bean) to other host plants (cotton, maize or soy). Three different host plant species were included in the experimental set-up: cotton (Gossypium spp.), maize (Zea mays cv. Ronaldinio) and soy (Glycine max cv. Merlin). Five generations after host-transfer, total RNA of all mite populations (London, London-SOY, London-MAIZE and London-COTTON) was collected and used in a genome-wide gene expression microarray (Sureprint G3 microarray, Agilent) Microarray analysis revealed large-scale differential expression of genes coding for enzymes of detoxification families, secreted proteins with unknown functions and regulatory enzymes.

DESIGN
Three major comparisons were investigated: 4 biological replicates of soy adaptation (London-SOY vs London), 4 biological replicates of maize adaptation (London-MAIZE vs London) and 3 biological replicates of cotton adaptation (London-COTTON vs London).
