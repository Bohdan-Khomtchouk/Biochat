TITLE
Expression of Arabidopsis cis-NAT pairs in inflorescences, leaves and roots

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We systematically identified long noncoding natural antisense transcripts (lncNATs), defined as lncRNAs transcribed from the opposite DNA strand of coding or noncoding genes. We identified in total 37,238 sense-antisense transcript pairs and found 70% mRNAs are associated with antisense transcripts in Arabidopsis. To detect the expression levels of these NAT pairs, we designed an Agilent custom array, ATH NAT array, and analyzed RNA samples from Arabidopsis inflorescences, leaves and roots, with 3 biological replicates each.

DESIGN
Expression levels of cis-NAT pairs were investigated in WT inflorescences, leaves and roots with 3 biological replicates.
