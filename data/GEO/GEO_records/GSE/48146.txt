TITLE
Expression data from Ribonuclease Inhibitor (RI/Rnh1) deficient  E9.5 yolksac

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ribonuclease Inhibitor (RI also known as Rnh1) is a 50 kDa, ubiquitously expressed leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein. It is localized in cytosol and binds to pancreatic-type ribonucleases and inhibit their function. However the entire biological role for Rnh1 is unknown. We generated Rnh1 knock out mice by homologous recombination. Here we studied differential gene expression from wild type (Rnh1 +/+), Heterozygous (Rnh1+/-) and Knock out (Rnh1-/-) yolk sacs isolated from embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5). We used microarrays to study global gene expression regulated by Rnh1 in yolk sacs.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from E9.5 yolk sacs of Rnh1 Wild type, heterozygous and knock out.
