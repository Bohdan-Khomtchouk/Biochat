TITLE
UMI-based, single cell RNA sequencing of human nasal epithelial cells grown for 52 days at air liquid interface

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
5' selective RNA-seq of 96 single cells from human nasal epithelial cells. Cells grown for 52 days at an air liquid interface. RNAseq profiling  was performed with N4H4 unique molecular identifiers processed on a Fluidigm C1. Sequencing was performed on a Ion Proton (Life Technologies).

DESIGN
Single cell from human nasal epithelium. 5' selective RNAseq profiling, 96 cells, unique molecular identifiers, custom library preparation.

PLATFORM
GPL17303 Ion Torrent Proton (Homo sapiens)
