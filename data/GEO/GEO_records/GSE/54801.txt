TITLE
Gene regulation by Ffr2 in the conjunctival epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild type or Fgfr2 fx/fx; Le-Cre-positive (Fgfr2-/-) conjunctival epithelium of E14.5 mouse embryos was laser micodissected from three embryos of each genotype. Total RNA was purified and reverse transcribed and amplified using a NuGEN kit. cDNA was biotinylated and hybridized to Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 bead arrays.

DESIGN
Three wild type and three Ffr2 knockout embryos were used. cDNA obtained from each was used for microarray analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using Illumina Genome Studio software.
