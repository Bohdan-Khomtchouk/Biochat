TITLE
DNA binding sites of KLF6 in murine HCC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced DNA isolated from performing ChIP of full-length KLF6 and an Input sample in an HCC cell line. The goal is to determine KLF6 binding sites in a mouse-derived HCC cell line.

DESIGN
Determination of KLF6 binding sites in an HCC cell line using 2 control input libraries and 2 KLF6-ChIP libraries

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
