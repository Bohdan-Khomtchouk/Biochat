TITLE
Expression analysis of colorectal carcinoma cells with defunct P53 (D53wt cells)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome expression analysis of colorectal carcinoma cells with defunct P53 on Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0 array set. Transcriptome-wide expression data was assessed by using TileShuffle (Otto C, Reiche K, Hackerm√ºller J. " Detection of differentially expressed segments in tiling array data " . Bioinformatics. 2012 Jun 1;28(11):1471-9. Epub 2012 Apr 6.).

DESIGN
We analyzed one Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0R set
