TITLE
The gene expression data of OsNPR1 overexpression and its wild type Taipei 309 plants.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We have found that overexpression of OsNPR1, a master gene for SAR in rice, greatly enhanced disease resistance. However, the growth and development of the OsNPR1 overexpression (OsNPR1-OX) lines were restrained and the mechanism remained elusive. In this study, we used microarray to identify the differential expression genes to explain the OsNPR1-induced growth inhibition.

DESIGN
We used the uppermost two  internodes of Taipei309 and OsNPR1-OX to isolate total RNA.
