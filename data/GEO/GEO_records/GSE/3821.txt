TITLE
Short term perturbation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Study of the short term (within the first 330 seconds)  transcriptional response of S.cerevisiae  upon a sudden addition of glucose. Keywords: glucose pulse, chemostat culture, glucose catabolite repression

DESIGN
Chemostat cultivation – Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CEN PK 113-7D) was cultivated in an aerobic carbon-limited chemostat culture in a 7-litres fermentor (Applikon, The Netherlands) with a working volume of 4-l on the adapted doubled mineral medium (Verduyn et al., 1992) with 27.1 g.l-1 of glucose and 1.42 g.l-1 of ethanol, to support a biomass concentration of about 15 g dry weight.l-1. The dilution rate was set to be 0.05 hr-1 and the airflow rate was set to be 200 l.hr-1. Other fermentation parameters are: a pH controlled at 5, a temperature controlled at 30˚C, an overpressure of 0.3 bar and stirrer speed of 600 rpm. The chemostat was considered to obtain its stable steady state condition 5 resident times after the end of its batch phase. Glucose pulse experiment - At the age of 7 dilution times, the steady state chemostat culture was perturbed by the addition of 20 ml of glucose solution (200 g/l) to the fermentor so that the residual glucose concentration was suddenly increased to about 1 g/l (5.56 mM). The glucose solution was rapidly injected by a pneumatic system ( < 1 s). Samples were taken prior to the glucose pulse (steady state samples) and within 360 s transient after the perturbation.
