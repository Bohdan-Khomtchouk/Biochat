TITLE
Gene expression microarray of RMEL3-silenced A375-SM melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previous work identified RMEL3 as a lncRNA with enriched expression in melanoma. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data confirmed RMEL3 enriched expression in melanoma and demonstrated its association with the presence of BRAFV600E. RMEL3 siRNA-mediated silencing markedly reduced (95%) colony formation in different BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines. Multiple genes of the MAPK and PI3K pathways found to be correlated with RMEL3 in TCGA samples were experimentally confirmed. RMEL3 knockdown led to downregulation of activators or effectors of these pathways, including FGF2, FGF3, DUSP6, ITGB3 and GNG2. RMEL3 knockdown induces gain of protein levels of tumor suppressor PTEN and the G1/S cyclin-Cdk inhibitors p21 and p27, as well as a decrease of pAKT (T308), BRAF, pRB (S807, S811) and cyclin B1. Consistently, knockdown resulted in an accumulation of cells in G1 phase and subG0/G1 in an asynchronously growing population. Thus, TCGA data and functional experiments demonstrate that RMEL3 is required for MAPK and PI3K signaling, and its knockdown decrease BRAFV600E melanoma cell survival and proliferation.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from RMEL3-silenced A375-SM melanoma cells (3 biological replicates) in 72 hours after siRNA transfection compared to control siRNA transfection (3 biological replicates).
