TITLE
Combining ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data in early placental development to study trophoblast invasion [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The placenta is an understudied organ that has a critical role in mammalian development. In early placental development, the essential process of trophoblast invasion establishes adequate blood flow between mother and fetus.  Despite its importance, little is known about the genomic regions responsible for regulating trophoblast invasion.  In order to identify enhancers that are important for regulating the process, we carried out ChIP-Seq for an enhancer-associated mark at two time points during early placental development.   Combining these data with RNA-Seq data and protein interaction data allowed us to construct a gene-enhancer network describing trophoblast invasion.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq at two time points in early placenta development (e7.5 an e9.5).  There are 3 biological replicates per time point.  Samples were pooled and sequenced on two lanes.
