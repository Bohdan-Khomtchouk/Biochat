TITLE
Evolution of gene expression during an adaptive diversification event

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
During a 1,000 generations evolution experiment, two types of bacteria (S and L) repeatedly diverged from a common ancestor (A) in a fully sympatric seasonal environment containing glucose and acetate. We compare the transcription profile of the two derived types and the common ancestor in order to investigate the metabolic modifications associated with this adaptive diversification event. Keywords: time point, experimental evolution
