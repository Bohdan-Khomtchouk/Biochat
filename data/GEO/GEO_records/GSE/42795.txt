TITLE
Genome-wide studies of murine ovarian follicle maturation in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A microarray study to compare gene expression during ovarian follicle development to better understand transcriptional changes during follicular growth.  Multi-layered secondary follicles (150-180 Âµm in diameter) were mechanically isolated from ovaries of 16-day old CD-1 mice and individually encapsulated in 0.5% alginate. Follicles were culture for up to 8 days. Day 0 samples correspond to follicles that were isolated and immediately frozen.

DESIGN
Samples were collected after 0, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8 days in culture in triplicate and day 0 was collected 5 times.

PLATFORM
