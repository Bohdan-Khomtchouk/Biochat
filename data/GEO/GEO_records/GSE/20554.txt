TITLE
Molecular Hydrogen Impact on Chalcopyrite Bioleaching by the Extremely Thermoacidophilic Archaeon Metallosphaera sedula

ORGANISM
Metallosphaera sedula

SUMMARY
Hydrogen served as a competitive inorganic energy source, impacting the CuFeS2 bioleaching efficiency of the extremely thermoacidophilic archaeon Metallosphaera sedula. Open reading frames encoding key terminal oxidase and electron transport chain components were triggered by CuFeS2. Evidence of heterotrophic metabolism was noted after extended periods of bioleaching, presumably related to cell lysis.

DESIGN
One 3 slide loop for Mse cells includes 3 conditions: M. sedula inoculum prior to introduction to chalcopyrite (d0~day 0), M. sedula after 3 days on chalcopyrite (d3~day 3), and M. sedula after 9 days on chalcopyrite (d9~day 9). Half of an RNA sample for one condition (consisting of pools of RNA from multiple cultures) was labeled with Cy3 while the other half was labeled with Cy5. The two differently labeled samples were run on different slides. Each probe is spotted on each slide 5 times (5 spots/slide x 2 slides = 10 technical replicates per condition; spot intensities for all replicates on slide provided in associated raw data file).
