TITLE
Transcriptional Maintenance of Pancreatic Acinar Identity, Differentiation and Homeostasis by PTF1A [6-day RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis documented mRNA changes in total pancreatic RNA preparations 6 days after Ptf1a inactivation.

DESIGN
pancreas mRNA profiles of Tamoxifen treated adult control mice [Ptf1a(CreER/+)] and Ptf1a conditional knockout mice [Ptf1a(CreER/fl)] were generated by deep sequencing using an Illumina Hiseq 2500.

PLATFORM
