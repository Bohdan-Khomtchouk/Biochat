TITLE
Expression profile in Overexpression of GST,GST-Med3

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We have used microarrays to study the gene expression changes in Overexpression of GST,GST-Med3  of yeast cells to detect how the overexpressioin may affect global  gene expression.

DESIGN
RNA samples were taken from yeast cells overexpressed GST or GST-med3 and hybridized to affymetrix microarrays: GST and GST-Med3

PLATFORM
GPL2529 [Yeast_2] Affymetrix Yeast Genome 2.0 Array
