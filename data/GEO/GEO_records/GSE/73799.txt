TITLE
Molecular profile of ketamine in comparison to memantine and phencyclidyne and other psychotropic drugs [mouse striatum]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ketamine has been found to elicit a rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-refractory affective disorders. To indicate the underlying mechanism of action we have performed whole-genome microarray profiling. Moreover, the effects of ketamine were compared to other NMDA receptor antagonists phencyclidine and memantine. Type: Drug response, Time-course, Gene expression profiling with Illumina Microarrays Keywords: Ketamine, NMDA antagonist, Phencyclidyne, Memantine, Time-course, Gene Expression, Acute treatment

DESIGN
The microarray experiment was performed to analyze time-course of drug-induced transcriptional response in C57BL/6J mouse striatum. Three NMDA antagonists (ketamine 20 mg/kg, phencyclidine 5 mg/kg and memantine 15 mg/kg i.p.) were selected for the comparison. Drug doses were based on the literature. To analyze dynamics of early, intermediate and relatively late changes of mRNA abundance the experiment was performed in four time points (1, 2, 4 and 8h after drug administration). To exclude influence of drug injection and circadian rhythm on gene expression profile, control groups of saline treated and naive animals were prepared for each time point. Samples from 2 mice were pooled per microarray, 3 biological replicates were used per time point and 12 arrays per each drug. To provide appropriate balance in the whole dataset groups were equally divided between the array hybridization batches.  'Complete' normalized data and non-normalized data (containing control rows not represented in Platform GPL6105) are linked below as supplementary files.
