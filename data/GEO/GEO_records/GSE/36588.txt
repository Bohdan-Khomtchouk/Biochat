TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of HCT116 cells subjected to stable gelsolin overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression levels altered by stable gelsolin overexpression. Results provide important information of the modulation of various genes by gelsolin.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from stable gelsolin-overexpressing HCT116 clones  (C1, C2, C3, C8) as well as emtpy vector control HCT116 cell lines (V4, V5)
