TITLE
The nuclear RNA exosome is co-opted to enhance host:viral RNA hybrids that propel influenza virus ribogenesis and infectivity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The nuclear RNA exosome is an essential multi-subunit complex that controls RNA homeostasis.  Congenital mutations in exosome genes are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we show that transient depletion of nuclear RNA exosome subunits in epithelial cells inhibits influenza virus replication. Similarly, viral biogenesis was suppressed in cells derived from mice with conditional ablation of the RNA exosome subunit Exosc3. Furthermore, patient-derived cells with a congenital EXOSC3 mutation were less susceptible to influenza virus infection. Using proteomics and next generation sequencing during infection, we show that the viral polymerase complex (PA, PB2, PB1) co-opts the nuclear RNA exosome complex and cellular RNAs en route to 3â€™ end degradation. Mechanistically, the nuclear RNA exosome coordinates the initial steps of viral transcription with RNAPII at host promoters. Exosome deficiency uncouples chromatin targeting of the viral polymerase complex and the formation of cellular:viral RNA hybrids, which are essential RNA intermediates that license transcription of antisense genomic viral RNAs.  Overall, we discovered a critical nexus between an essential component of the influenza virus (polymerase) and an essential component of the cell (exosome), alteration of which leads to breakage of host-pathogen symmetry and a lose-lose scenario (viral impairment and neurodegeneration).
