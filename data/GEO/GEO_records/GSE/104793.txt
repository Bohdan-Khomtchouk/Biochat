TITLE
Interleukin-1β effect on primary mouse articular chondrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of primary mouse articular chondrocyte treated with interleukin-1β. In this study, we have attempted to explore the effects of interleukin-1β on mouse transcriptome and have identified numerous genes which are involved in osteoarthritis pathogenesis.

DESIGN
Primary mouse articular chondrocytes were isolated from mouse femoral condyles and tibial plateaus cartilage tissue (WT ICR 5-day-old mice) and incubated with interleukin-1β for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted from untreated primary mouse articular chondrocytes (3 biological replicates) or primary mouse articular chondrocytes cultured with IL-1β for 24 hours (3 biological replicates) and subjected to microarray analysis.
