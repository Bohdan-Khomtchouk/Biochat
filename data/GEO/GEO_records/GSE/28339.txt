TITLE
Gene expression data following Cyclin T2 and Cyclin T1 depletion by shRNA in HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have characterized gene expression changes in HeLa cells following long term depletion of Cyclin T2 or Cyclin T1 using shRNA

DESIGN
HeLa cells were transduced with VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA against either Cyclin T2 or Cyclin T1.  As a control, cells were transduced with shRNA vector with four nucleotides mismatch in the Cyclin T1 mRNA that has been previously shown to have minimal effects on mRNA expression levels. The vectors have a GFP reporter that can be used to estimate transduction efficiency.  Five days post-transduction, cells were harvested and total RNA extracted.  Transcriptional profiling was carried out on these RNA samples.  Two independent biological replicate experiments were carried out in this analysis and the xpression values normalized by GC-RMA and averaged.  The following comparisons were made: MM to Cyclin T2 and MM to Cyclin T1.
