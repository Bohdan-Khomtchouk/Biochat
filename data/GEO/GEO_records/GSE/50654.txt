TITLE
Commitment to the phosphate starvation response after replenishment of phosphate

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Diploid wild type cells in a chemostat, in different times after changing the feeding medium from low to high Pi.

DESIGN
Diploid cells were also grown in a chemostat at a dilution rate of 0.3[1/hr] and phosphate concentration in the feeding vessel of 0.3mM Pi. Cells were allowed to reach steady state and then feeding medium was replaced to 7.3mM Pi. Samples from the chemostat were harvested in different times after the transfer (t= 0.35, 2, 5, and 10 days). Total RNA was extracted using MasterPureâ„¢ Kit (Epicentre). The samples were amplified, labeled, hybridized to yeast dual color expression microarrays and scanned, all using standard Agilent protocols, reagents, and instruments. The scanned images were analyzed using SpotReader software (Niles Scientific).
