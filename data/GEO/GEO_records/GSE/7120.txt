TITLE
Chronic Pentylenetetrazol treatment induced successive gene expression changes in Drosophila head

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling in rodents is an established model of epileptogenesis. The molecular basis of the associated long-term plasticity is however not clear. Further, rodent models of kindling plasticity are not amenable to large-scale screening of compounds for identifying antiepileptogenic drugs. In this context, we have developed a fly model of chronic PTZ- and withdrawal-induced behavioral plasticity. In our model, the chronic treatment is given for 7 days, followed by 7 day long withdrawal. Gene expression profiles of fly heads secondary to chronic PTZ were examined to identify molecular correlates of behavior in our model. Expression profiling of fly heads at three time points in the 7 day long chronic PTZ - 12 hrs, 2nd day, and 7th day - showed a dynamic and widespread alteration of various functional categories of genes.
