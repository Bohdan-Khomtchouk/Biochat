TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of CD8 cells laser captured from skin biopsies at dermal-epidermal junction and at deeper dermal area near blood vessel during the healed phase of mucocutaneous HSV-2 reactivation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aim to get a comprehensive analysis on gene expression of CD8a+ T-cells during the post healed phases of HSV-2 reactivation at different anatomic location (CD8a+ cells at dermal-epidermal junction versus CD8a+ cells in deeper dermal area near blood vessel). Our hypothesis is that JC_CD8 cells may function as a resident effector-like T-cells while BV_CD8 cells may be infiltrating cells from circulation.

DESIGN
CD8 cells were immunofluorescently stained and laser captured from genital skin biopsies at dermal-epidermal junction at 2 and 8 weeks post healed (JC_2wks_CD8 and JC_8wks_CD8) and at deeper dermal area near blood vessel (BV_2wks_CD8 and BV_8wks_CD8); total RNA were purified from captured cells and cDNA were amplified from the total RNA using NuGEN pico kits
