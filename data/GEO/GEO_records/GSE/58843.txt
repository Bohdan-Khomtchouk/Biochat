TITLE
Rapid transcriptional response to physiological neuronal activity in vivo revealed by transcriptome sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA-seq of olfactory bulbs from odor-deprived and odor-stimulated mice (RNA-seq done in triplicates)

DESIGN
Control mice were kept in a clean air environment (using an activated carbon filter). Stimulated mice were exposed to a cocktail of odorants for 30 minutes ( " 30 min " time point), or for 30 minutes followed by a period of 90 minutes of clean air ( " 120 min " time point.) Mice were sacrificed immediately at end of time point, and olfactory bulbs were dissected out for RNA extraction and RNA-FISH. Three adult mice (6-8 weeks of age or older) were used in each condition.

PLATFORM
