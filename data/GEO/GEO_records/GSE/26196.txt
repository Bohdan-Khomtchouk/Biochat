TITLE
The expression profiles of 82 novel and 245 known human imsRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression profiling of 245 known and 82 novel imsRNAs (intermediate-size noncoding RNAs, 50-500nt, which were identified from human fetal brain tissue) across different human fetal tissues (brain, heart, liver, lung and spleen at the 24-week gestation stage), different fetal brain gestational stages (13w, 14w, 20w, and 24w) and two human brain tumor cell lines (SHSY-5Y and U251).

DESIGN
The analysis was based on the loop design method, in which all combinations of two samples  were simultaneously hybridized to a microarray, each of the two sample labeled with a different fluorescent probe (Cy3 or Cy5).
