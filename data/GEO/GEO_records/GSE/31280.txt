TITLE
Transcript level in F9 teratocarcinoma WT and RARalpha knockout in presence and absence of all-trans retinoic acid

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) α, β and γ are key regulators of embryonic development. Hematopoietic differentiation is regulated by RARα, and several types of leukemia show aberrant RARα activity. We demonstrate that RARα plays an important role in cellular memory and imprinting by regulating the CpG methylation status of specific promoter regions. We used microarrays to identify genes, which display differential expression in F9 RARalpha knockout (RARaKO) cells relative to F9 wt cells.

DESIGN
F9 teratocarcinoma cells (WT and RARaKO) were treated for 8 hours with either vehicle (EtOH) or all-trans Retinoic Acid (atRA) in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor Cycloheximide
