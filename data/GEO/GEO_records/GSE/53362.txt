TITLE
Genome-wide maps of transcription factor and co-factor binding during B-cell to Macrophage lineage switching

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using homogenous populations of cells undergoing cell switching we observed an interplay between lymphoid and myeloid transcription factors during lineage switching

DESIGN
Examination of transcription factors genome-wide binding profiles several time points after induction of B-cell to macrophage lineage switching

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus) GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
