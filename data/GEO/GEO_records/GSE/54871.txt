TITLE
Gene expression analysis in AML cell lines and in primary blasts of AML patients after 6 hours of HDACi treatment.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AML cell lines (K562, U937 and NB4) were treated with MS27-275 (MS) and SAHA for 6 hours and the gene expression analysis revealed commonly regulated genes by the 2 HDACi. AML blasts were treated with SAHA for 6 hours and gene expression profiles were compared to commonly regulated genes by MS and SAHA in AML cell lines. The analysis revealed commonly regulated genes in these systems by SAHA.

DESIGN
Total RNA were obtained from 3 AML cell lines and AML blasts after 6 hours of treatment with SAHA and MS and gene expression profiles were compared.
