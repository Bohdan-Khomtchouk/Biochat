TITLE
Expression in liver tissue of wildtype (wt) or hepatocyte specific Klf6 knockout (DeltaKLF6) after partial hepatectomy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Kr√ºppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) is a transcription factor and tumor suppressor. Loss or reduction of KLF6 is linked with progression of experimental and human hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite its important contributions to liver homeostasis and growth, there are no data characterizing the involvement of KLF6 to hepatic regeneration. Microarray data from wildtype and DeltaKlf6 mice were used to identify regulating mechanisms and potential mediators within liver regeneration

DESIGN
Wildtype and hepatocyte specific Klf6 knockout mice (DeltaKlf6) were employed for 70% partial liver resection/hepatectomy (PHx) in order to analyse liver regeneration. Twelve hours after partial hepatectomy animals were scrificed and remnant liver tissue was used for further experiemnts. For the overall study we used 6 animals per group, and included RNA from liver tissue of 3 wildtype and 3 DeltaKlf6 animals for the microarray analysis. Wildtype animals were used as controls.
