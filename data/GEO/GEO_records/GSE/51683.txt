TITLE
Differences in gene expression in A2780C20 vs. A2780

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differences in gene expression in A2780C20 vs. A2780 and A2780 treated with temsirolimus at 24-hr and 48-hr. The A2780 are human ovarian carcinoma  cellls were purchased to the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC). The A2780CP20 are cisplatin resisatnt cells derived of the A2780 cells. A2780CP20 cells were generated by Dr. Robert Ozols (J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 84, 264-267 (1992) by treatment of A2780 cells with incresing concentrations of cisplatin. The goal of this study is to determine whether the cisplatin and temsirolimus resistance are co-regulated. The objectives of this study are to identify additional genes differentially expressed in cisplatin sensitive and cisplatin resistant ovarain cancer cells and the changes in gene expreession upon temsirolimus treatment of A2780 cells.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from A2780, A2780CP20, A2780 plus temsirolimus 24-hr, and A2780 plus temsirolimus 48-hr. Labelled samples were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Gene 1.0 ST Human Arrays.
