TITLE
Expression of long non-coding RNAs during spermatogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total RNA from purified stages of spermatogenesis were subjected to next generation RNA-seq (100bp, paired-end, strand-specific). The expression of mRNAs and lncRNAs was calculated as FPKM values.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of spermatogonia, pachytene and round spermatids were utilized for RNA isolation.

PLATFORM
