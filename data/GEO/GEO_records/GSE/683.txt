TITLE
Gene expression profiles in normal and Otx2-/- early gastrulating mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression profiles in wild-type and Otx2(-/-) 6.5 days postcoitum embryos by using a serial analysis of gene expression assay adapted to microdissected structures. Among a broader list, the study of six genes found to be differentially expressed allows defining a role for Otx2 in the orchestration of cell movements leading to the adequate organization of the embryo before gastrulation.
