TITLE
Affymetrix microarray data for the fibroblasts isolated from mice lacking the plasma membrane calcium ATPase isoform 4 and wild type controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The heart responds to pathological overload through myocyte hypertrophy. In our study, we found that this response is regulated by cardiac fibroblasts via a novel paracrine mechanism  involving plasma membrane calcium ATPase 4 (PMCA4). PMCA4 deletion in mice, both systemically and specifically in fibroblasts, reduces the hypertrophic response to pressure overload; however, knocking out PMCA4 specifically in cardiomyocytes does not produce this effect. Mechanistically, our microarray data on fibroblasts isolated from PMCA4 WT and PMCA4 knockout animals showed that cardiac fibroblasts lacking PMCA4 produce higher levels of secreted frizzled related protein 2 (sFRP2), which inhibits the hypertrophic response in neighbouring cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we show that treatment with the PMCA4 inhibitor aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) inhibits and reverses cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload in mice. Our results reveal that PMCA4 regulates the development of cardiac hypertrophy and provide proof of principle for a novel approach to treat this condition.

DESIGN
RNA was obtained and pooled from three batches of fibroblasts isolated either from PMCA4 WT and knockout either treated or not treated with 30uM phenylephrine for 72 hours
