TITLE
Gene expression profile of hepatic lincRNAs in female mouse liver using nuclear RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in adult female mouse liver was assayed by nuclear RNA-seq, as part of a study of hepatic lincRNAs.

DESIGN
Three independent pools, comprised of nuclear RNA isolated from 4 individual livers per pool, were prepared and used for unstranded RNA-seq.

PLATFORM
