TITLE
mRNA microarray analysis on HepG2 cells exposed to Grpahene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) Nanomaterials

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to evaluate the identification of genes and pathways, the global gene expression profiles were assessed in response to GO and rGO on Human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. We performed whole genome DNA microarray experiments using HepG2 cells exposed to GO and rGO for 24h. We used whole genome microarrays to screen for global changed in HepG2 transcription profiles and with subsequent quantitative analysis conducted on selected genes.

DESIGN
24h GO and rGO exposed HepG2 cells were used for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
