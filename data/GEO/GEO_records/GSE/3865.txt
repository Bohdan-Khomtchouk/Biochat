TITLE
CSN4-1 mutant analysis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcript profiling analysis of csn4-1 light grown mutant seedlings compared to wild type using Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip array Keywords: 7 day old light grown seedlings, wild type and mutant

DESIGN
Three replicate samples were harvested and prepared from 7 day-old light grown wild type and csn4-1 mutant seedlings. RNA for microarray analysis was extracted using the RNeasyTM kit (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). Complementary RNA was prepared from 6 µg of total RNA as described in Affimetrix _Expression Analysis Technical Manual using the One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents (Affimetrix, Santa Clara, CA). In brief, double-stranded cDNA was synthesized. Biotin-labeled target cRNA was prepared by cDNA in vitro transcription in the presence of biotinylated UTP and CTP. After purification, cRNA was fragmented and used to hybridize to the Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip array (Affimetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Hybridization, washing, staining, scanning and data collection were performed in an Affymetrix GeneChip® Fluidics Station 450 and GeneArray® Scanner. The microarray computaional analysis was performed on *.CEL and *.CHP data files.
