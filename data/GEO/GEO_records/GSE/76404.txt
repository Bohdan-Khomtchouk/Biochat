TITLE
Human adipose transcriptome reveals primate-specific long intergenic noncoding RNAs that modulate adipocyte metabolic function

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Through deep RNA-seq in human subcutaneous adipose bioposies and established long noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) annotations, we identified human lincRNAs expressed in all subjects, including subsets of lincRNAs that exhibit differential expression by sex and race. Our comprehensive profiling on subcutaneous adipose lincRNA transcriptome provides great resource to advance novel understanding of genetic regulation in adipose biology.

DESIGN
Gluteal subcutaneous adipose from 25 healthy subjects were sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2000 with poly-A selection.
