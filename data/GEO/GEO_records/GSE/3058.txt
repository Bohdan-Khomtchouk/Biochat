SUMMARY
Investigation of Gene Expression Profiling in Unstaged Head Hair Follicles Plucked from Men and Women Keywords: Gene Expression Profiling of Normal Hair Follicles

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 1-3 unstaged follicles plucked from the scalp of each of 36 adult human volunteers.  The average quantifiable yield of RNA per follicle was 112.5 ng.  Ten samples were selected, based on ribosomal ratio, relative integrity number and total yield, for expression profiling.  By preamplifying the extracted RNA (starting with as little as 30 ng), sufficient labeled RNA was generated to conduct Afymetrix-based gene expression analysis.
