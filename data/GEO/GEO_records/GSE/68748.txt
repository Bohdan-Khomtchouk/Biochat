TITLE
Accumulated α-synuclein affects the progression of GM2 gangliosidoses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The accumulation of α-synuclein (ASyn) has been observed in several lysosomal storage diseases (LSD), but it remains unclear if the accumulation of ASyn contributes to the pathology. The mitochondria degeneration, reduced expression of manganese superoxide dismutase 2, and reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative damage were observed in the neurons of Hexb-/- mice.

DESIGN
Gene expression in the brain of 14-week-old Hexb-/- ASyn+/+, Hexb-/- Asyn-Tg, and Hexb-/- ASyn-/- mice were analyzed.
