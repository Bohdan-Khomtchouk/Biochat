TITLE
Genome wide WT1 binding sites in developing mouse kidneys

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the the identification of chrosomal regions bound by the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene WT1 during embryonic mouse kidney development.

DESIGN
Two indepednent ChIP-Seq experiments on microdissected E18.5 developing mouse kidneys were carried out using either WT1-specific or IgG-antibodies as a negative control.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
