TITLE
Microarray analysis on brains of mice fed a normal diet and supplemented with either oil palm phenolics (OPP) or distilled water

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
OPP (1500 ppm gallic acid equivalent (GAE)) was supplemented to BALB/c mice given a normal diet to observe for possible neuroprotective effects. Brains were harvested six weeks after the feeding regimen for gene expression studies. Results from the separate microarray data analysis carried out on the different organs show that OPP have neuroprotective properties in vivo.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from brains of BALB/c mice given OPP (six weeks after the feeding regimen) were compared to controls given distilled water (three replicates in the treatment group versus three replicates in the control group)
