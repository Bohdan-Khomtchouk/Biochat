TITLE
Epigenomic Profiling of Primary Gastric Adenocarcinoma Reveals Super-enhancer Heterogeneity [methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Regulatory elements in cancer remain poorly characterized in primary solid tumors. Here we applied microscale histone modification profiling to delineate the landscape of somatic promoters and super-enhancers in primary gastric adenocarcinoma, analyzing 94 epigenomic  profiles of primary tumors, normal tissues, and cell lines

DESIGN
DNA methylation profiles of 19 T/N pairs

PLATFORM
