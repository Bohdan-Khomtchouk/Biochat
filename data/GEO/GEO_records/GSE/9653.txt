TITLE
NSF 20K Oligo Arrays to Dissect Rice Defense Response Pathways

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
With the availability of a high quality draft rice genome sequence, large mutant collections, and gene expression oligo arrays for rice, we are now well positioned to dissect rice defense pathways. To do this, we performed global expression analyses to identify genes that are differentially expressed in 10 mutant lines (i.e., Xa21, NH1ox, NRR1ox, GR978, spl11, spl17, NBS2-PI9ox, MPK5ox, OsCoi1ox, and OsNahG1ox), exhibiting altered defense responses. As controls, we used wild typle varieties same with these mutants. Keywords: disease response
