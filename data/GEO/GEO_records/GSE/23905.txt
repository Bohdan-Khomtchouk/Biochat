TITLE
miR-126 over-expression in highly metastatic LM2 breast cancer cells.

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
miR-126 were over-expressed using the miR-Vec system in highly metastatic LM2 cells. The LM2 cell line are described in detail in Minn et al. Nature 2005 This approach was used to conduct an unbiased search for specific miR-126 target genes in breast cancer cells.
