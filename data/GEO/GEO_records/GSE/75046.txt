TITLE
Alternative polyadenylation in the anti-bacterial immune response of zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We profiled the variation in tandem 3’ UTRs in pathogen-challenged zebrafish and identified hundreds of APA genes with approximately 10% being immune genes. The detected APA immune genes were enriched in Toll-like receptor signaling, apoptosis and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. A greater number of microRNA target sites and AU-rich elements were found in the extended 3’UTR regions than in the common 3’ UTR regions of these APA genes. Further analysis suggested that microRNA and AU-rich element mediated post-transcriptional regulation plays an important role in modulating the expression of APA genes.

DESIGN
Poly(A) site profiles of zebrafish spleen in anti-bacterial immune response were generated by SAPAS stragedy using Illumina GAIIx. PRJNA298967
