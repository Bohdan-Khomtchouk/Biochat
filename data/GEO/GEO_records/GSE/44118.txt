TITLE
Expression Data from Endothelial Cells as a Consequence of Ets2 Signaling in PyMT Tumor Associated Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumor associated fibroblasts are known to play an important role in angiogenesis, however the specific signaling pathways playing an important role in this cross talk remain ill defined.  Here, we studied how Ets2 transcrpiton factor signaling in tumor associated fibroblasts effected gene expression in surrounding endothelial cells in the MMTV-PyMT mammary tumor model. Inactivation of Ets2 specifically in fibroblasts using Fsp-cre significantly reduced tumor associated angiogenesis, and was indicated to effect ECM remodeling, cell adhesion and cell chemotaxis processes in neighboring endothelial cells.  We have identified Ets2 in fibroblasts as a key signaling molecule to induce tumor associated angiogenesis.  Additionally, this function does not rely on the presence of tumor cells, indicating a memory in fibroblasts to induce angiogenesis.

DESIGN
Primary mammary endothelial cells were isolated from mice with or without fibroblast Ets2 in the presence of the PyMT oncogene through sorting with a CD31 antibody. RNA was extracted and samples were submitted for Affymetrix gene expression arrays
