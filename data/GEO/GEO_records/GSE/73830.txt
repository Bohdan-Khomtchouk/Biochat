TITLE
Whole Blood long non-coding RNA and mRNA Expression Profiles in Humans Exposed to Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As the application of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in consumer products continues to rise, studies have expanded to determine the associated risks of exposure on human and environmental health. In particular, several lines of evidence indicate that exposure to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) could pose a carcinogenic risk similar to asbestos fibers. However, to date the potential markers of MWCNT exposure are not yet explored in humans.

DESIGN
Global mRNA and lncRNA expression profiles in the whole blood of exposed workers, having direct contact with MWCNT aerosols for atleast 6 months (n=8), were compared with expression profiles of non-exposed (n=7) workers (e.g., proffessional and/or technical staff) from the same manufacturing facility.
