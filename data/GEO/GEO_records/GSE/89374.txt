TITLE
Expression data from SKOV3.ip cells by knockdown RAD51-AS1 expression.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have been shown to play crucial roles in tumorigenesis. Little is known about lncRNA RAD51-AS1 in diseases. Here, we investigated the role of RAD51-AS1 in Epithelial ovarian cancer. Silencing RAD51-AS1 inhibited proliferation through cell cycle arrest and promotion in apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo. But the mechanism of RAD51-AS1 downstream regulation remains unclear. In order to identify the downstream regulation of RAD51-AS1 in epithelial ovarian cancer, we used antisene oligotides targeting RAD51-AS1 / negative control to transfect Skov3.ip cells. Then, we used microarrays to identified differential expression genes and to look for possible target genes by knockdown RAD51-AS1 expression.

DESIGN
SKOV3.ip cells transfected with antisene oligotides targeting RAD51-AS1 or negative control siRNA were analyzed. There are three samples in each group.
