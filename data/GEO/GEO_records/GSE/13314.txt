TITLE
Gene expression profiling of pulmonary MALT lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Molecular pathways activated in MALT lymphoma are not well defined. In this study, we perform gene expression profiling on 35 pulmonary MALT lymphoma using fresh frozen biopsy samples Keywords: Cell type analysis and disease state analysis

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from fresh frozen tisues of 35 newly diagnosed Pulmonary MALT, as defined by WHO classification, and hybridized to Affymetrix U133plus2 chip. Gene expression profile from other B and T cell malignancies and normal cellular and tissue counterpart were obtained from published dataset for comparison.
