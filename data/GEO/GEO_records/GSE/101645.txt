TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of wild-type and lin-22 mutants in C.elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq to identify gene expression changes associated with lin-22 mutations affecting seam cell pattering in C. elegans

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from synchronised C. elegans L3 larvae

PLATFORM
GPL18245 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Caenorhabditis elegans)
