TITLE
Effect of DNMT3A R882H mutation or WT expression on global DNA methylation patterns of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells with NRAS G12D co-transduction (eRRBS)

SUMMARY
DNA Methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is frequently mutated in various hematopoietic malignancies; however, the underlying oncogenic mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that DNMT3A mutational ‘hotspot’ at Arg882 (DNMT3A-R882H) cooperates with constitutively activated RAS in transforming murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) ex vivo and inducing acute leukemias in vivo. DNMT3A-R882H potentiates aberrant transactivation of ‘stemness’ gene expression programs, notably transcription factors Meis1, Hox-A, Mn1 and Mycn. Mechanistically, R882-mutated DNMT3A directly binds to cis-regulatory elements of these genes and induces focal CpG hypomethylation reminiscent of what was seen in human leukemias bearing DNMT3A R882 mutation. Furthermore, DNMT3A-R882H induced DNA hypomethylation facilitates gene enhancer/promoter activation and recruitment of Dot1l-associated transcription elongation machineries. Inactivation of Dot1l represses DNMT3AR882H-mediated stem cell gene dysregulation and acute leukemogenicity. In this dataset, we provided enhanced Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (eRRBS) DNA methylome profiling data showing effect of DNMT3A R882H mutation or WT expression on hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells with NRAS G12D co-transduction.

DESIGN
eRRBBs DNA methylome analysis of Lin- enriched hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells with retroviral infection of NRAS G12D alone (EV-RAS), DNMT3A R882H with NRAS G12D (RH-RAS) or DNMT3A WT with NRAS G12D (WT-RAS) at day 16 post-transduction.
