TITLE
Expression data for LDHA KD 4T1 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LDHA is key enzyme for tumor glycolysis metabolism and knocking down LDHA would change a lot of gene expression We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression in 4T1 cells with LDHA knocked down by shRNA

DESIGN
LDHA was knocked down by shRNA and positive cells were selected by 10Âµg/ml puromycin and mixed together

PLATFORM
GPL17400 [MoGene-2_1-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.1 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
