SUMMARY
The in vivo effects of Ocoxin Oral solution (OOS) were evaluated on acute myeloid leukemia mice models. With that purpose RNA from 3 control untreated animals and 3 daily-OOS treated animals was purified and their gene expression profiles compared using the Affimetrix Transcriptome Analysis console.
