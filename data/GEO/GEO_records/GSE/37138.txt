TITLE
Exon array analysis of the response to bevacizumab/erlotinib in advanced non-small cell lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the current study, we used exon arrays and clinical samples from a previous trial (SAKK 19/05) to investigate the expression variations at the exon-level of 3 genes potentially playing a key role in modulating treatment response (EGFR, KRAS, VEGFA). Exon-level biomarkers for the response to targeted therapy bevacizumab/erlotinib were identified in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer

DESIGN
Multicenter, prospective, open-label, single-arm, phase II trial.

PLATFORM
GPL5188 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
