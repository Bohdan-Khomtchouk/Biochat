TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of whole blood transcriptional response to Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Influenza and Rhinovirus lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptional profiles in whole blood from children < 2 years of age (and healthy matched controls) with RSV, rhinovirus and influenza infection. The hypothesis tested is that transcriptional profile heterogeneity will reflect patient clinical heterogeneity and that RSV infection induces a distinct host response compared with influenza and rhinovirus infection

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from whole blood (lysed in Tempus tubes) drawn from individual pediatric patients with acute RSV, influenza and Rhinovirus lower respiratory tract infection. A total of 241 samples are analyzed: 135 with acute RSV LRTI, 30 with Rhinovirus LRTI, 16 with influenza LRTI, 39 age-sex matched healthy controls and 21 samples obtained one month after the acute hospitalization in children with RSV. Samples GSM1226237-GSM1226272, which were hybridized to Platform GPL10558, were normalized separately from the other Samples in this Series, which were hybridized to Platform GPL6884. 'GSE38900_non-normalized_GSM1226237-GSM1226272.txt.gz' includes the non-normalized data for Samples GSM1226237-GSM1226272; 'GSE38900_non-normalized.txt.gz' includes the non-normalized data for the other Samples.
