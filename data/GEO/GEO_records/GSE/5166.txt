TITLE
D. nodosus grown in the presence/absence of ground hoof

ORGANISM
Dichelobacter nodosus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to identify genes that were differentially expressed when D. nodosus was grown on agar media supplemented with ground hoof compared to the standard agar media. Keywords: growth response to hoof material

DESIGN
Bacteria were grown on EYE agar or EYE agar with 2% ground hoof agar plates for 2 days before Trizol extraction of RNA. Four biological replicates including two dye swaps were analysed. Raw data was compiled using IMAGENE. Normalisation and statistical analysis was undertaken using BASE. Statistics were performed using the Wilcoxon signed ranked test.
