TITLE
The histone deacetylase inhibitor Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (SAHA) alleviates salinity stress in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz)

ORGANISM
Manihot esculenta

SUMMARY
To elucidate the molecular mechanism involved in increased tolerance to high-salinity stress by the application of HDAC inhibitor named SAHA

DESIGN
Cassava cultivar TMS6044 was asexually propagated in a plastic pot with MS medium. The 5-cm length shoot top of 3-month-old cassava plantlets were cut and then transferred to liquid MS media without agar. After one week incubation, the plantlets showing root elongation were treated with 100 ÂµM SAHA for 24 h, followed by treatment with 200 mM NaCl for 2 and 24 h. 100 ng of total RNA were used.
