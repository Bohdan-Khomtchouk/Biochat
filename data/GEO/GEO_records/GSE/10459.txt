TITLE
Expression profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from type C cirrhotic patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Study goal is to disclose features of gene expression profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from type C cirrhotic patients with or without hepatocellular carcinomas. Keywords: gene expression profile, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, type C liver cirrhosis

DESIGN
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 32 type C cirrhotic patients without hepatocellular carcinoma (LC) or from 30 type C cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mRNA was amplified and expression profile was comprehensively analyzed with reference RNA using oligo-DNA chip.
