TITLE
Gene expression data from MCF-7 cells treated with Lacciac Acid A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lacciac Acid A was indentified as an inhibitor of DMNT1. MCF-7 cells were treated with Lacciac Acid A (200 uM) for 5 days. Changes in gene expression were identified by using Affymetrix Human gene ST1.0 arrays. We used microarrays to determine global changes in gene expression upon treatment with Lacciac Acid A an inhibitor of DMNT1.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells near mid passage were treated with Lacciac Acid A for 5 days. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Treated and untreated cells were from the same cell passage. Two sample sets from the same passage and the third set from the previous passage were used.
