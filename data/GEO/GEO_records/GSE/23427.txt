TITLE
Gene expression after felodipine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cholangiocarcinomac ells have bee treated with felodipine and gene expression analyzed. In order to identify genes with differential gene expression between the groups cb-f and cb-g we study 2 hybridizations on the HG-U133_Plus_2_IVT array using analysis of variance.  The analysis identified 7068 genes with significant gene expression differences between the groups (p < 0.01).

DESIGN
Cells were treated for 24 hrs with felodipine and collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
