TITLE
Root transcriptomes for the 19 parents of the Arabidopsis thaliana MAGIC lines

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We produced RNA-Seq reads from messenger RNA isolated from root tissue for the 19 MAGIC founder accessions (inbred strains) of Arabidopsis thaliana (see Gan et al. 2011. Nature 477:419-23 for a description of the MAGIC genetic mapping resource). The read data was generated with biological replication (two replicates). The resulting RNA-Seq data provide a resource to assess root gene expression across different accessions of A. thaliana. Comparable RNA-Seq read data for the MAGIC founder accessions for aerial seedling tissue has previously been released under GEO series GSE30720 (Gan et al. 2011. Nature, 477:419-23).

DESIGN
Examination of RNA expression in root for the 19 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions used as parents for the MAGIC lines (parental accessions are Bur-0, Can-0, Col-0, Ct-1, Edi-0, Hi-0, Kn-0, Ler-0, Mt-0, No-0, Oy-0, Po-0, Rsch-4, Sf-2, Tsu-0, Wil-2, Ws-0, Wu-0, Zu-0).

PLATFORM
GPL11221 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Arabidopsis thaliana)
