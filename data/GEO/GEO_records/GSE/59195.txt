TITLE
Transcriptional responses of Bdtf1-deletion mutant to the phytoalexin brassinin in the necrotrophic fungus Alternaria brassicicola

ORGANISM
Alternaria brassicicola

SUMMARY
Brassica species produce antifungal indolyl compounds, brassinin and its derivatives, during microbial infection.  The fungal pathogen Alternaria brassicicola detoxifies brassinin and possibly its derivatives.  This ability is an important property for the successful infection of brassicaceous plants.  Previously, we identified a transcription factor, Bdtf1, essential for the detoxification of brassinin and full virulence.  To discover genes that encode putative brassinin-digesting enzymes, we compared gene expression profiles between a mutant strain of the transcription factor and wild-type A. brassicicola under two different experimental conditions.  A total of 170 and 388 genes were expressed at higher levels in the mutants than the wild type during the infection of host plants and saprophytic growth in the presence of brassinin, respectively.  In contrast, 93 and 560 genes were respectively expressed at lower levels in the mutant than the wild type under the two conditions.  Fifteen of these genes were expressed at lower levels in the mutant than in the wild type under both conditions.  These genes were assumed to be important for the detoxification of brassinin and included Bdtf1 and 10 putative enzymes.  This list of genes provides a resource for the discovery of enzyme-coding genes important in the chemical modification of brassinin.
