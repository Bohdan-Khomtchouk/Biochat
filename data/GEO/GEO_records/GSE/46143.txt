TITLE
LMP2A mediated gene expression changes in transfected CD10+ GCB cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we have investigated the effect of LMP2A on gene expression in normal human GC B cells using a non-viral vector based system Keywords: transfection of viral oncogene in normal human B cells

DESIGN
Gene expression was compared between LMP2A-transfected and control vector-transfected GC B cells from three patients. RNA from the FACS-sorted transfected GC B cells was amplified. 10ug of fragmented cRNA was hybridized to HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. Differentially expressed probe sets were identified using limma with a fold change > 1.3 and p < 0.01
