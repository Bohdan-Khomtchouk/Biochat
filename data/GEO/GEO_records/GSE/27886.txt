TITLE
MicroRNA Profiling of Rhesus Macaque Embryonic Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
We established three new rhesus embryonic stem cells lines and conducted their microRNA profilings by Solexa sequencing. Sequencing of small RNA libraries yielded 12.66 million, 13.12 million and 11.57 million raw reads from IVF1.2, IVF3.2 and IVF3.3, respectively. After filtering, we obtained 10.89 million (IVF1.2), 10.60 million (IVF3.2) and 9.26 million (IVF3.3) clean reads (18-30nt).

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different small RNA expression profilings in 3 rhesus embryonic stem cell lines
