TITLE
Gene and microRNA expression profiling of breast tumors from Chinese and Italian women [gene]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene and miRNA profiles from a unique Chinese/Caucasian trans-ethnic collection of breast cancer from Shanghai (China) and Milan (Italy) were compared using an unsupervised approach that identified similar clusters of correlated features in Chinese and Caucasian datasets. Partition of gene expression data using previously published gene signatures, such as the PAM50 intrinsic gene list and the extracellular matrix (ECM) genes, revealed Chinese and Caucasian subgroups with equivalent gene and miRNA expression profiles. A significant reduction of Luminal-A tumors was observed in the Chinese series.

DESIGN
Tissue samples from 78 Chinese (Han Chinese) and 97 Italian (South Europe Caucasian) consecutive primary breast tumors were subjected to gene and miRNA profiling. Tissue specimens, initially collected respectively in the Chinese and Italian hospitals, were all stored, randomly processed and analyzed in identical experimental conditions in the Italian center to minimize pre-analytical, instrumental and computational variability, enabling direct comparison of gene and miRNA profiles from the two groups.
