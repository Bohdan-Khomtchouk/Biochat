TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed miRNAs in BM+ vs. BM- lung cancer samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Brain metastasis (BM) can affect up to 25% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients during their lifetime. Efforts to characterize patients that will develop BM have been fairly disappointing. Small non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the expression of target mRNAs by repressing their translation or regulating their sequence-specific degradation.  miRNAs play a role in regulating a variety of targets and, consequently, multiple pathways, which makes them a powerful tool to be exploited for early detection of disease, risk assessment, and prognosis.  In this study, we investigated miRNAs that may serve as biomarkers to differentiate between NSCLC patients with and without BM.   miRNA microarray profiling was performed on samples from clinically matched NSCLC from patients with BM (BM+) and without BM (BM-).  miR-328 and miR-330-3p were able to correctly classify BM+ vs. BM- patients.  Gene expression analysis comparing NSCLC parental and stably transfected miR-328 cells identified several significantly differentially-expressed genes, whose expression may be directly or indirectly regulated by miR-328.

DESIGN
NSCLC Cell Line A549 analysis: Two-condition experiment, A549 GFP Control vs. A549 miR-328 cells. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 miR-328 replicates. miRNA microarray analysis was performed on RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) NSCLC tumor specimens from 7 BM+ patients and 5 BM- patients.
