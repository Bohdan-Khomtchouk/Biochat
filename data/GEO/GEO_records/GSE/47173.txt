TITLE
Microarray analysis of P. aeruginosa PAO1 expression PA5060 (phaF) on pJN105

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
The Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 gene phaF (PA5060) is a transcriptional regulator in the closely related pseudomonad P. putida. phaF is expressed at higher levels in P. aeruginosa clinical isolates from the cystic fibrosis respiratory tract. To determine the role of phaF in regulating P. aeruginosa gene expression, we cloned it under control of the pBAD promoter in expression vector pJN105 and compared expression in this strain relative to an empty vector control strain. We used microarrays to study overall gene expression in a P. aeruginosa PAO1 phaF  overexpression strain.

DESIGN
A P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain over-expressing the transcriptional regulator phaF, PAO1 pJN105-phaF, and the corresponding empty control strain, P. aeruginosa PAO1 pJN105, were grown to exponential phase, RNA was isolated, and gene expression was analyzed via microarray analysis and compared.
