TITLE
Differential gene expression profiles between SKOV3.ip1-S116A cells (Ser116 of PEA-15 substituted with alanine) and SKOV3.ip1-S116D cells (Ser116 of PEA-15 substituted with aspartic acid).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To dissect the molecular mechanisms of PEA-15-mediated paclitaxel sensitization in ovarian cancer cells, we performed cDNA microarray analysis using SKOV3.ip1-S116A cells (Ser116 of PEA-15 substituted with alanine) and SKOV3.ip1-S116D cells (Ser116 of PEA-15 substituted with aspartic acid). cDNA microarray data analysis showed that SCLIP (SCG10-like protein), also known as STMN3, was highly expressed in SKOV3.ip1-S116D cells and was involved in pPEA-15-mediated paclitaxel sensitization in ovarian cancer cells.

DESIGN
SKOV3.ip1-S116A cells (Ser116 of PEA-15 substituted with alanine) and SKOV3.ip1-S116D cells (Ser116 of PEA-15 substituted with aspartic acid) were used. Total RNA was extracted and purified using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The integrity of the obtained RNA was assessed using an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The Affymetrix HGU133 plus platform was used for hybridization, staining, and imaging of the arrays by following the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene expression analysis was performed in triplicate.
