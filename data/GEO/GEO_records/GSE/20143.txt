TITLE
Study of Gastric Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of my study was to identify the genes differentially expressed in gastric adenocarcinoma associated with prevalent risk factor such as tobacco use (Meiziol, Tuibur etc) in high-risk Indian population. The Tumor tissue and matched normal tissue distant to the tumor were collected during endoscopy in RNA later, Snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C until processed. Data of clinicopathologic parameters were obtained from patients’ clinical report, operative notes and pathologic report. Institutional Human ethics committee approved the study.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from tumor and matched normal of five patients. We pooled total RNA of normal tissue from three patients in one slide and the other two in another slide. Individual slide were used for each tumor samples. Isolation Kit: RNeasy mini Kit (Qiagen) Scanner Used: AFFYMETRIX,428 Array
