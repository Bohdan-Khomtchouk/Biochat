TITLE
Sequence dependency and regulatory function of dimeric NOTCH1/RBPJ complexes on coding and non-coding transcription in T-lymphoblastic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NOTCH/RBPJ/MAML ternary transcriptional complex binds to regulatory element and drives gene expression. The complex can function as monomer and dimer. How dimeric complexes regulate gene expression in human cancer is not well studied. Here, we integrate genomic data sets and analyze Notch dimeric complexes-regulated transcriptome and cis-regulatory elements. A subset of coding and non-coding RNA is Notch dimeric complexes-associated. Dimeric complexes recognition sequence enriched in functional dynamic Notch sites and majority of dimer recognition sequence located in (super-)enhancers.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling for Notch-sensitive TLL cell lines using RNA-seq, with replicates
