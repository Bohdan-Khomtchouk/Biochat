TITLE
Daphnia magna exposed to non-polar narcotics (aliphatic alcohol) and polar narcotics (substituted benzene derivatives)

ORGANISM
Daphnia magna

SUMMARY
MOA categorization of chemicals with narcotic mechanism by combining gene transcription profiling and physiological effect assessment after EC10 exposure in systems biology approach in Daphnia magna.

DESIGN
Universal reference design, reference is a mixture of aliquots from control and exposed samples. One of the three biological replicates of each exposure condition was labeled with one dye, the remaining two samples were labeled with the second dye.

PLATFORM
GPL17975 Agilent-023710 DM15k_01_Of_1
