TITLE
Expression from Slamonella Typhimurium infected murine peritoneal macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Infection of macrophages by Salmonella induces a transcriptional inflammatory response. The pattern of Salmonella induced genes is significantly altered by the expression of type I interferons. We used microArray analysis to identify changes in global gene expressioncaused by type I interferons following Salmonella infection

DESIGN
Wild type and IFN-beta null thioglycollate elicited macrophages were mock infected or infected with Salmonella typhimurium for 6 hrs and RNA was extracted
