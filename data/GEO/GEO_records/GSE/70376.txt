TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of quiescent versus activated muscle stem cells (satellite cells)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide gene expression analysis of quiescent/activated muscle stem cells isolated from mouse skeletal muscle by flow cytometry.

DESIGN
We analyzed the global changes in gene expression occurring within muscle stem cells (satellite cells) in homeostatic conditions or after cardiotoxin (CTX) injury (3 days).  Pure satellite cell populations from dissociated skeletal muscle from mice were isolated using a well-established flow cytometry protocol gating on integrin a7(+) (positive selection) and Lin- (CD31, CD45, CD11b, Sca1) (negative selection).
