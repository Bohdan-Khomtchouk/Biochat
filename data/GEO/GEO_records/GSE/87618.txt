TITLE
Identifying ASCL1 target genes in primary GBM stem cell cultures [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ASCL1 mediates neuronal differentiation of GBM stem cell (GSC) cultures. We sought to identify genomic targets of ASCL1 in primary human GSC cultures. In this dataset, we include ChIP-seq data obtained from GSC cultures harbouring a CRISPR-deletion of ASCL1. We assessed differential ASCL1 binding between control and GSC cultures induced to overexpress ASCL1 after 18 hours of doxycycline treatment.

DESIGN
Glioblastoma cells with a genetic knockout of ASCL1 is compared to genetic knockout of ASCL1 overexpressing ASCL1 (n = 3 biological replicates; n = 2 input samples; total = 8 samples)
