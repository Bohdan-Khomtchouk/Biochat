TITLE
FSH and Testosterone treated Infant Monkey Sertoli cells vs FSH and Testosterone treated  pubertal Monkey Sertoli cell

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Sertoli cells of Monkey origin comparing infant Sertoli cells with pubertal Sertoli cells, isolated from Monkeys in which puberty was induced by extrinsic GnRH administration. Both Infant and pubertal cells were treated with FSH and Testosterone in vitro.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, infant Sertoli cells vs Pubertal Sertoli cells. 2 biological replicates infant sertoli cells, 2 biological replicates pubertal sertoli cells. Dye  swap was performed. In experiment #1 Infant sample is labelled with Cy3 and Pubertal sample with Cy5. Vice versa in Experiment #2

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
