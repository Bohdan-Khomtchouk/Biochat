TITLE
Gene expression profiling of murine skin transgenically generated to express HPV16 E7 oncoprotein

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A validated animal model would assist with research on the immunological consequences of the chronic expression of HPV16 E7 oncoprotein expression. Here we performed RNA-seq analysis of normal C57BL/6 skin versus mouse transgenically generated to express HPV16 E7 oncogene under the keratin 14 promoter (K14E7). Mice present with epithelial hyperplasia and increased immune cell infiltrate associated with immune suppression.

DESIGN
Ear skin (n=6) 8-week old C57BL/6 and K14E7 mice Grafted samples (n=18) of donor C57BL/6, K14E7 and CD1d-/-xK14E7 skin on C57BL6 recipients

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
