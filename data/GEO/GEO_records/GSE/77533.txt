TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of SW480 cells treated or untreated with Floxuridine (FUdR)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Colorectal cancer cells with TP53 mutation are highly resistant to chemotherapeutics. In order to identify potential chemo-resistance signatures, here; we explored the global gene expression profiles of drug resistant colorectal cancer cell line SW480 upon Floxuridine (FdUrd) treatment using  Illumina Human HT-12 v4.0 Expression Beadchip Array. Further, significantly altered genes were subjected to the pathway analysis in GeneCodis3 and crucial signaling pathways were found to be enriched. Upon further functional validations, these pathways could be targeted to enhance therapy in human cancers harboring mutant p53.

DESIGN
