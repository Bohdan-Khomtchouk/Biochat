TITLE
ChIP-Seq of constitutively expressed Ndt80A-Myc and constitutively and endogenously expressed Ndt80B-Myc in C. albicans

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to identify the genes bound by the two Ndt80 paralogs in C. albicans when constitutively expressed, and for Ndt80B when endogenously expressed. Both paralogs were tagged with c-myc, and the protein was immunoprecipitated with a c-myc antibody.  For constitutive expression, each native Ndt80 promoter was replaced by the C. albicans Tdh3 promoter.  Cells were grown unti log-phase in YPD.  Each experiment was repeated twice and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.

DESIGN
C. albicans constitutively expressed Ndt80A-myc vs. untagged control, Ndt80B-myc vs. untagged control, and endogenous Ndt80B-myc vs. untagged control, with two technical replicates for each
