TITLE
Genetic architecture of murine skin inflammation and tumor susceptibility

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in self-renewing epithelial tissues is controlled by cis- and trans-activating regulatory factors that mediate responses to exogenous agents capable of causing tissue damage, infection, inflammation, or tumorigenesis.  We used network construction methods to analyze the genetic architecture of gene expression in normal mouse skin in a cross between tumor-susceptible Mus musculus and tumor-resistant Mus spretus. We demonstrate that gene expression motifs representing different constituent cell types within the skin such as hair follicle cells, haematopoietic cells, and melanocytes are under separate genetic control. Motifs associated with inflammation, epidermal barrier function and proliferation are differentially regulated in mice susceptible or resistant to tumor development. The intestinal stem cell marker Lgr5 is identified as a candidate master regulator of hair follicle gene expression, and the Vitamin D receptor (Vdr) links epidermal barrier function, inflammation, and tumor susceptibility.
