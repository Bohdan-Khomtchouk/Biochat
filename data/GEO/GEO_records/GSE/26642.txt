TITLE
Pathology and Protective Immune Response in Pigs Infected with Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) of High and Low Virulence

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Porcine reproductive and respiratory disease (PRRS) is the most important disease in swine industry worldwide. However, strategies such as vaccination and good biosecurity are not consistently successful to eliminate PRRSV. Though some interesting pathways have been tentatively examined recently, host molecular pathways utilized by PRRSV and the protective immune responses in resistant to PRRSV are largely unknown. In order to answer these questions, we herein characterize changes in global gene expressions in multiple tissues [tonsil, tracheobronchial lymph nodes (TBLN), Cranial lung (CR Lung), and distal lung (D Lung)] in response to PRRSV of high and low virulence. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs are used for this study. Based on Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), molecule bases of some “black boxes” underlying immune responses are further identified. Our results indicate that cross talks among these pathways and immune balances/competition between host and virus are always happened during the pathogenesis of PRRS.

DESIGN
connected loop design was used to accommodate samples from 4 treatment groups.
