TITLE
Gene expression in wild type and Mgat3 mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dr. Stanley's laboratory is interested in 1) understanding the biological roles of specific classes of N-glycan in development and immunity through studies of glycosyltransferase mutant mice, 2) identifying complex binding specificities of galectins using a panel of CHO glycosylation mutants, and 3) determining how O-fucose glycans function in Notch receptor signaling and in modulating the interaction of Notch receptors with their ligands.

DESIGN
The bisecting GlcNAc on N-glycans inhibits ricin binding and enhances E-PHA binding. It is expected that mammalian CBP's, including galectins, may have their binding affected positively or negatively by the presence of the bisecting GlcNAc. In fact unpublished experiments have identified reduced binding of at least one galectin to LEC10 CHO cells that express GlcNAc-TIII compared to CHO cells that do not. We have shown that the Mgat3 gene that encodes GlcNAc-TIII, the glycosyltransferase that adds the bisecting GlcNAc, is barely expressed in E9.5 mouse embryos and robustly expressed in E10.5 embryos (J. Biol. Chem. 277, 26300-26309; 2002). We wish to compare glycosylation and lectin genes that are expressed at E10.5 in the brain of embryos from wild type and Mgat3 knockout embryos. RNA samples were prepared from several embryo heads (3) from Mgat3+/+ and Mgat3-/- E10.5 embryos. We hybridized the RNA to glyco-chips (in triplicate per sample for a total of 6) so we can detect changes in the expression of glyco-genes as well as signaling pathway genes that may be affected.
