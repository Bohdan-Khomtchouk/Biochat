TITLE
Gene expression in wild type and Mgat3 mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dr. Stanley's laboratory is interested in 1) understanding the biological roles of specific classes of N-glycan in development and immunity through studies of glycosyltransferase mutant mice, 2) identifying complex binding specificities of galectins using a panel of CHO glycosylation mutants, and 3) determining how O-fucose glycans function in Notch receptor signaling and in modulating the interaction of Notch receptors with their ligands.
