TITLE
Gene expression profiles of adult renal capsule isolated from kidneys using micro-dissection. (GUDMAP Series ID: 36)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing kidney.  The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in FACS isolated components of the developing kidney. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone.

DESIGN
CD-1 mice were utilized to isolate the capsule cells from the adult  kidneys.  The capsule cells were isolated from the kidney using microdissection treatment.   RNA was isolated and the gene expression profiles were determined by microarrays.
