TITLE
Loss of the Inhibitory Immune Checkpoint CD85j/LILRB1 on Malignant Plasma Cells Contributes to Immune Escape in Multiple Myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mechanisms of immune regulation may control proliferation of aberrant plasma cells (PCs) in patients with the asymptomatic monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) preventing progression to active multiple myeloma (MM). We investigated the role of CD85j (LILRB1), an inhibitory immune checkpoint for B cell function, in MM pathogenesis. We used microarrays to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying CD85j functions in myeloma cells.

DESIGN
MM cell lines (U266, RPMI-8226, ARP-1) were lentivirally transduced to express CD85j-GFP or GFP-control in the presence of 8 µg/mL polybrene. Lentiviral particles were generated using HEK293T cells and the Lenti-vpak packaging kit (packaging plasmids and MegaTran1.0 transfection reagent)  with Lenti ORF clone of human LILRB1, transcript variant 1, pLenti-C-mGFP vector purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). After 3 days, cells were FACS-sorted and total RNA was isolated using Trizol® reagent according to the manufacturer's guidelines. RNA samples had a RNA integrity number (RIN) above 8 determined using a Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument (Agilent Technologies).
