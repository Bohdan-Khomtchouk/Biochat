TITLE
Identification of intermediate-sized non-coding RNAs involved in the UV-induced DNA damage response in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We utilized high-throughput RNA-seq to uncover the intermediate-sized noncoding RNAs invovled in UV-DNA Damage Responses in C. elegans. 450 novel transfrags were discovered, some of which show dramatic expression change between the UV irradiation and control. This study should lead to a better understanding of the role of is-ncRNAs invovled in UV-DDR.

DESIGN
Examination of intermediate-sized transcripts (70-500nt) in L4 larvae of C. elegans strains, including wild-type (N2), UV-irradiated (N2-UV100J/m2) and NER-deficient mutant (xpa-1) strains.
