TITLE
Transmission of xanthomonads to Medicago truncatula seeds

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
Plant pathogenic bacteria disseminate and survive through transmission to and by seeds of hosts and non-hosts plants. To investigate the interaction between xanthomonads and developing seeds of Medicago truncatula,   plants at the ï¬‚ower bud stage were spray inoculated until runoff with xanthomonads suspensions. Using the Medicago NimbleGen chip, a transcriptomic analysis was performed on seeds to characterize the molecular dialogue between Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris in an incompatible situation with M. truncatula seeds and Xanthomonas alfalfae pv. alfalfae in a compatible situation at two developmental time points (16 and 32 days atfter pollination (DAP).

DESIGN
Six-condition experiment, 16dap_Mock versus 16dap_Xaa, 16dap_Mock versus 16dap_Xcc, 32dap_Mock versus 32dap_Xaa, 32dap_Mock versus 32dap_Xcc. Biological replicates: 6 controls (16dap_Mock, 32dap_Mock), 12 treatments (16dap_Xaa, 16dap_Xcc, 32dap_Xaa, 32dap_Xcc), independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL16373 NimbleGen custom IRHS_Medtr_102K_v1
