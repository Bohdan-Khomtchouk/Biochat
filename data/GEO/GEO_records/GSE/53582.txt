TITLE
Beauveria bassiana SNF1 (BbSNF1) regulating genes involved in devolopment of blastospore

ORGANISM
Beauveria bassiana

SUMMARY
Gene BbSNF1 played crucial roles in mediating devolopment of blastospore, a determinant to the virulence of fungal entomopathogens. We characterized for the first time that disruption of BbSNF1 reduced  blastospore yield in culture broth using peptone as single nitrogen source. The global transcriptome  involved in the response to the thermal stress was analyzed by using high throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq). Our transcriptional profiles revealed that numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which involved in metabolism, cell transport and cell rescue, were significantly involved in deveopment of fungal blastospore.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from BbSNF1 disruption mutant were compared to that of WT strain in the indicated culture medium.
