TITLE
TFB5 (YDR079c-a) Knockout Study

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
RNA expression analysis of polyA+ RNA isolated from a TFB5 (YDR079c-a) deletion strain and an isogenic wild type strain. Comparison of RNA expression levels in TFB5 deletion strain compared to a wild type strain at 30C in YPD medium Keywords: repeat sample
