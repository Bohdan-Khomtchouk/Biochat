TITLE
MicroRNA screening in human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
No reliable predictors of susceptibility to gemcitabine chemotherapy exist in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. MicroRNAs (miR) are epigenetic gene regulators with tumorsuppressive or oncogenic roles in various carcinomas. This study assesses chemoresistant PDAC for its specific miR expression pattern. Gemcitabine-resistant variants of two mutant p53 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines were established. MicroRNA screening was investigated by microarray.
