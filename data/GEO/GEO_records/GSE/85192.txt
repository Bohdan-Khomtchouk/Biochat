TITLE
lncRNA Expression Signatures in Response to Jiangtang Tiaozhi Formular in T2DM with Obesity and Hyperlipidemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the study, patients with type 2 diabetes with obesity and hyperlipidemia were treated by traditional Chinese medicine Jiangtang Tiaozhi Prescription of 24 weeks, we chosed 6 effective cases, 6 invalid cases and 6 health people  as control to analysis the molecular mechanism of TCM treatment. According to the research of LncRNA microarray, GO analysis, Pathway analysis, we found out the target LncRNAs, as well as their associated mRNAs were contribute to the good outcome of Jiangtang Tiaozhi Formula. Then we expand to 12 cases in each group for qPCR validation.

DESIGN
We took 30 serum samples separately from 6health people ,6 effective cases and 6  invalid cases with type 2 diabetes with obesity and hyperlipidemia(including before treatment and after treatment), based on lncRNA expression signatures to and analysised the response to traditional Chinese medicine treatment of Jiangtang Tiaozhi Formular.
