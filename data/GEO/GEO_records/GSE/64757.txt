TITLE
Zinc Finger Protein 407 (ZFP407) Regulates Insulin-Stimulated Glucose Uptake and Glucose Transporter 4 (Glut4) mRNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using RNA-Seq, we compared the transcriptomes of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes for control and ZFP407-deficient cells

DESIGN
Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were electroporated with control or 1 of 2 Zfp407 siRNAs. Six independent siRNA electroporations were conducted for the control siRNA and 3 independent electroporations were conducted for each Zfp407 siRNA.

PLATFORM
