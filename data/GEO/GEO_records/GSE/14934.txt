TITLE
Gene expression profiles of Ras mutants.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were collected from HEK-HT cells expressing H-Ras with Ras-activating (G12V), Raf-activating (G12V,T35S), RalGEF-activating (G12V,E37G), or PI3K-activating (G12V,Y40C) mutations. Keywords: Comparison of Ras pathway components.

DESIGN
THX=control; 12V=G12V mutation; 35S=G12V,T35S mutation; 37G=G12V,E37G mutation; 40C=G12V,Y40C mutation.  5 replicates of each.  Total of 25 samples.
