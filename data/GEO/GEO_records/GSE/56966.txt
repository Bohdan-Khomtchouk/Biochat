TITLE
Gene expression profiles of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells from mice carrying T cell-specific deletions of MyD88 or IL6Ra

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
2W:I-A(b) specific CD4+ T cells were isolated from immunized knock-out mice and wild-type controls on day 7 post immunization and the gene expression profiles of the cells were compared

DESIGN
Antigen-specifc CD4+ T cells were isolated and pooled from 4 independent experiments. The samples represent antigen-specific T cells from 15-30 mice per genotype.
