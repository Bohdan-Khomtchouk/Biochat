TITLE
The LncRNA MetaLnc9 is Transcriptionally controlled by NONO/CRTC Complex and Facilitates Lung Cancer Metastasis through PGK1-Activated AKT/mTOR Pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We discovered that elevated LINC00963, termed MetaLnc9 (Metastasis Associated LncRNA in chromosome 9q34), expression in NSCLC tissues correlated with poor prognosis and promoted NSCLC cell migration and invasion in vitro and lung metastasis formation in vivo

DESIGN
We identified a lncRNA signature associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell metastasis by comparing the lncRNA expression profiles between SPC-A-1sci (highly metastatic) and SPC-A-1 (weakly metastatic) cells
