TITLE
Expression profile of Arabidopsis pistil/silique upon induction of FRUITFULL

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To determine the genes that are regulated by FRUITFULL (FUL) in the pistil/silique, we identied differentially expressed genes after induction of FRUITFULL in ful-1 FUL-GR lines using the AGRONOMICS1 tiling array. The inflorescences of flowering plants were dipped in 10 uM DEX solution or in Mock Solution, and the flowers/siliques from stages 12-16 were harvested after 8 hours. RNA was extracted and DNase treated, and subsequent steps and hybridization to the AGRONOMICS Tiling array were performed by the Functional Genomics Center Zurich.

DESIGN
We generated several control samples to be able to identify genes that were differentially regulated by the DEX alone treatment instead of by the induction of FUL. A considerable number of genes was found to respond to DEX (samples ful-1 DEX vs ful-1 Mock). To identify the genes that were actually differentially upregulated because of FUL, we compared the samples ful-1_FUL-GR_DEX and ful-1_FUL_GR_Mock). All samples were performed in duplicate.
