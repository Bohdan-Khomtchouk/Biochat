TITLE
Effect of virX regulator on the expression of chromosomal genes of Clostridium perfringens

ORGANISM
Clostridium perfringens str. 13

SUMMARY
The microarrays were subjected to two-color hybridization using Cy5 and Cy3 dyes incorporated in the cDNAs synthesized from total RNA samples of strains. We compared each geneâ€™s transcription level between the wild-type (WT) strain 13 (labeled by Cy5) and the virX-mutant strain (TS186) (labeled by Cy3) on a single DNA microarray.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells from thevirX mutant and the wild-type. Gene expression levels were compared between thevirX mutant and wild-type strain 13
