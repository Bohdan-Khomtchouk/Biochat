TITLE
Differential gene expression of meiotic drive system of Aedes aegypti

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
We conducted a whole transcriptome analysis of testes from a meiotic drive-carrying strain (T37) in comparison with a drive-sensitive strain (RED) using microarrays based on the complete annotated Ae. aegypti gene set. The T37 strain, which carries a strong meiotic drive gene (Mori et al., 2004 (PMID 15605641)), was established from mosquitoes collected in Trinidad. The RED strain is highly sensitive to the meiotic drive gene (Hickey and Craig, 1966 (PMID ); Mori et al., 2004 (PMID 15605641)).

DESIGN
A six-chip study using total RNA recovered from three biological samples of the T37 strain and another three biological samples of the Red strain of Aedes aegypti. Each chip measures the expression level of 16,092 genes annotated from the Aedes aegypti genome sequence, with twenty 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
