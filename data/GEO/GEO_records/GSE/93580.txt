TITLE
Possible roles of CC- and CXC- chemokines in regulating bovine endometrial function during early pregnancy

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The aim of the present study is to determine possible roles of chemokines in regulating bovine endometrial function during early pregnancy. A 15 K bovine oligo DNA microarray detected 344 and 1336 differentially expressed genes ( > 2-fold; P < 0.05) in the bovine endometrium of 15 and 18 days of pregnancy compared with these days of the estrous cycle (cyclic, n=4). The expression of six chemokines, including CCL2, CCL8, CCL11, CCL14, CCL16 and CXCL10 was higher in the endometrium of early pregnancy than that in the cyclic stage.

DESIGN
Bovine uteri were obtained from Japanese-Black cows in the institute ranch within 10-30 min of exsanguination. Tissue samples were collected from cows on 15 and 18 days of the estrous cycle (NP15 and NP18) and the gestation (P15 and P18)(n=4 animals/each day). The day of artificial insemination was designated as day 1.
