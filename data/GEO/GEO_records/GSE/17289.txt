SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_722 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of David MacAlpine. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: Most terminally differentiated Drosophila tissues are either polyploid or polytene.  Unlike  normal chromosomes, where the entire chromosome must be replicated exactly once, polytene chromosomes are often differentially replicated with many regions underreplicated and some overreplicated. We will characterize five different polytene tissues using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to identify differentially replicated regions of each chromosome. These studies will also identify tissue specific amplicons, where the replication mediated amplification of specific loci is essential for up-regulation of mRNA levels encoding proteins critical for development. The differential replication of polytene chromosomes in Drosophila will provide a unique opportunity to understand how developmental cues and chromosomal domains influence replication initiation.
