TITLE
miR-142-3p over-expression in the Raji B-cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-142-3p is highly expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and has been described as a hematopoietic-restricted lineage, suggesting immune functions (Chen, Li et al. 2004; Landgraf, Rusu et al. 2007; Merkerova, Belickova et al. 2008). In order to determine the roles of miR-142-3p in B lymphocytes, we over-expressed this miRNA in the Raji B-cell line using a synthetic mimic of miR-142-3p and analyzed gene expression 24 hours after the transfection.
