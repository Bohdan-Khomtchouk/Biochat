TITLE
Gene expression profile of A549 cells cultured with normal 2D condition and xenografted tumor tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Preclinical cancer drug discovery efforts have employed two-dimensional (2D)-cell-based assay models, which fail to forecast in vivo efficacy and contribute to a lower success rates of clinical approval.  Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models are recently expected to bridge the gap between 2D and in vivo models. We compared between A549 cells cultured in ordinal 2D condition and xenografted tumor tissue. Gene microarrays were used to observe the global gene expression in A549 cells cultured with petri dish (2D, control) or xenografted tumor tissue and identified distinct classes of up or down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
A549 cells were cultured in with petri dish (2D).  5 × 10^6 cells in 100 μL PBS was injected subcutaneously into one or both scapulars of 7-8 week old male BALB/cAJcl-nu/nu mice. The tumors were harvested within 21 days.
