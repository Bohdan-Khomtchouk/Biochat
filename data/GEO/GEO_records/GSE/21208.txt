TITLE
Gene expression profiling of neural stem cells and their neuronal progeny reveals IGF2 as a regulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neural stem cells (NSCs) generate new neurons throughout life in two distinct areas of the mammalian brain: the subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral ventricles and the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). How gene expression signatures differ among NSCs and immature neurons within and between these adult neurogenic regions is unknown. We isolated NSCs and their progeny using transgenic mice expressing GFP under the control of the Sox2 promoter (labeling NSCs) and transgenic mice expressing DsRed under the control of the doublecortin (Dcx) promoter (labeling immature neurons). Comparison of the transcriptomes of SOX2+ cells derived from both neurogenic areas revealed that NSCs are highly similar but that functionally significant differences in gene expression exist: IGF2, which is expressed only in SOX2+ cells in the DG but not in the SVZ, is required for proliferation of DG-derived but not SVZ-derived NSCs. Gene expression profiles strongly diverged in immature neurons, and we provide evidence that ephrinB3, which was up-regulated only in the DG but not in the SVZ during neuronal differentiation, regulates the survival of newborn granule cells. Thus, the data provided here show that stem cell populations in the adult DG and SVZ are similar but have unique properties that manifest themselves later during neural differentiation, resulting in distinct neuronal populations

DESIGN
Hippocampi and SVZ from 6 week old DCX-DsRed and Sox2-GFP Reporter mice were dissected and cell sorted using FACS. cDNA were generated and analysed using Agilent Platform.
