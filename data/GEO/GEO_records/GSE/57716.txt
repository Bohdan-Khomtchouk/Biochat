TITLE
Meg3 regulated genes in pancreatic beta cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Meg3 is a long non-coding RNA. It's target genes are unknown. The mouse pancreatic beta cell line MIN6-4N was used to assess the expression of genes upon stable Meg3 overexpression

DESIGN
Stable cell lines were isolated that have integated pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-mMeg3.The cells were processed for RNA isolation.  The level of Meg3 expression  was assessed by RT-PCR. RNA preps  were used for microarray analysis.
