TITLE
Expression data from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and re-derived cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our recovered cell lines, derived from bone marrow (BM), expressed all markers known for embryonic stem cells and were able to differentiate into three germ layers although germ line transmission is yet to be further defined. No germline transmission of the re-derived cell lines indicated their pluripotency decreased. We used gene array to compare the gene-expression of ESCs and re-derived cell lines.

DESIGN
We derived two cell lines, Sorted (D10) and No.2 (D5) cell lines, from bone marrow at two different time points after C57OG2 ESCs (oGFP+ ESCs) transplantation.
