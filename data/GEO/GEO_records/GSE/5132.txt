TITLE
Molecular Correlate to Gleason Grade in Prostate Adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Twenty-nine radical prostatectomy samples were laser capture microdissected (LCM) to obtain the most common Gleason patterns (patterns 3, 4, and 5) and matched benign adjacent luminal prostate epithelial cells.  We performed cDNA microarrays on matched cancer and adjacent normal samples and identified an 86-gene model capable of distinguishing low Gleason grade (pattern 3) from high Gleason grade (pattern 4 and 5) cancers, which contributes a set of potential targets for modulating the development and progression of the lethal prostate cancer phenotype. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
12 Gleason pattern 3, 12 Gleason pattern 4, and 8 Gleason pattern 5 laser-capture microdissected prostate cancers hybridized with random dye-swaps against patient-matched normal-adjacent controls.
