TITLE
Characterization of Gene Expression in hepatic stellate cell (HSC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The HOA OneArrayÂ® 60-mer, oligonucleotide microarray consists of a total of  probes covering 31,747genes of human. Through a validation study, total RNA isolated from HSC were used for comparison of gene expression profiles via microarray examination. A list of significantly differentially expressed genes was generated; 1,205  genes were  up-regulated genes, and1,323 genes were  down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
The Phalanx microarray platform is based upon the hybridization of a single labeled sample (derived from RNA), followed by one-channel detection. The intensity of the hybridization signal is used to determine target concentration. In order to validate the technical quality of each probe in our arrays, we carried out 6 independent hybridizations on samples representing two different treatments. HSC cells treated with Syy (a small compound that can inhibit exocrine of hepatic stellate cells) or control.
