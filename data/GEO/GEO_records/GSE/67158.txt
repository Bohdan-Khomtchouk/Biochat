TITLE
Eomes+ natural Th1 (nTh1) T cells share functional features with classical Th1 (cTh1) cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of intrathymic Eomes+ natural Th1 cells creates a novel idea that there is more than one way for the generation of innate CD4 T cells. To more deeply characterize this type of innate T cells, we compared the gene expression profile between nTh1 cells generated in CIITAtg mice and classic Th1 cells differentiated from naive CD4 T cells in Th1-polarizing condition.

DESIGN
We compared data from four different cells: Na√Øve (CD4+CD62Lhi) CD4 T cells from wild-type spleen, TT Naive (CD4+CD62L+CXCR3-) thymocytes from CIITAtg mice, classic Th1 cells (naive T cells of wild-type spleen differentiated in Th1-polarizing condition), nTh1 cells (CD4+CD62L+CXCR3+ thymocytes from CIITAtg mice). Total RNA was extracted using Rneasy Micro Kit (qiagen) and then subjected to Affymetrix gene array. 1 sample for each cell type was used for analysis.
