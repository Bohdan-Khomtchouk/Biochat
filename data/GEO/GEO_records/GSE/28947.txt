TITLE
Glycan and gene chip analysis of purified osteoclast cell populations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Osteoclast derived from macrophage lineage cells are responsible for bone resorption and important in bone remodeling. Emerging of a new discipline-osteoimmunology highlights the important connection between immunology and bone biology.

DESIGN
We had mouse osteoclast's RNA samples analyzed by the consortiumâ€™s gene microarray and identified a number of significant changes in expression of genes involved in glycan biosynthesis. Osteoclasts were treated with: control, Rankl (Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), tunicamycin, and both rankl and tunicamycin. RNA preparations from osteoclasts purified from mice: control (1,2,3), Rankl (1,2,3), tunicamycin (1,2,3), and both rankl and tunicamycin (1,2,3) were sent to the Microarray Core (E). The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays.
