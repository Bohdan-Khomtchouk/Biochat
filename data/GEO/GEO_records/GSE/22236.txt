TITLE
microRNA-target RNA pairs revealed by Parallel analysis of RNA ends in Solanum lycopersicum

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Solanum lycopersicum RNA degradome sequencing

DESIGN
Isolated polyadenylated RNA from total RNA extracts of Solanum lycopersicum, were ligated to 5'-adapter that includes an MmeI recognition site. The ligated products were purified again, reverse transcribed and cleaved with MmeI. The 5' fragments were purified from gel and ligated to a 3'- dsDNA adapter and PCR amplified. After PCR amplification the sample was subjected to Solexa/Illumina high throughput pyrosequencing. Please see www.illumina.com for details of the sequencing technology.
