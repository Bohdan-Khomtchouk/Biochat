TITLE
Modeling of WGBS data from normal and cancer tissues, young and old cells, passaged fibroblasts and stem cells III

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We develop a novel analysis method for WGBS data that allows us to measure diverse aspects of methylation information genome-wide.

DESIGN
modeling of WGBS data for a diverse set of samples. BAM files for data generated in this study can be found in SRP072078 (PRJNA315696), SRP072071 (PRJNA315694), SRP072075 (PRJNA315695) and SRP072141 (PRJNA315903). The rest of the data was downloaded from other studies: GSE46644, GSE49629, GSE52972, GSE31742. For the latter, N/As have been used in BioSample and instrument model fields.
