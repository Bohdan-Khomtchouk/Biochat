TITLE
Biological Research in Canisters-16 (BRIC-16): Investigations of the plant cytoskeleton in microgravity with gene profiling and cytochemistry

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
These investigations studied the fundamentals of how plants perceive gravity and develop in microgravity. It informs how gene regulation is altered by spaceflight conditions.

DESIGN
transcription profiling by array Microgravity/Weightlessness

PLATFORM
GPL198 [ATH1-121501] Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array
