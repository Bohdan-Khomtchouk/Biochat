TITLE
Expression profiling of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (cell line V6.5, 129SvJae/C57B6 F1 background), and mouse ESC-derived Neural Precursor Cells (NPCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ESCs and NPCs are two setm cell types which rely on expression of the transcription factor Sox2.  We profilled gene expression in ESCs and NPCs to correlate genome-wide Sox2 ChIP-Seq data in these cells with expression of putative targets

DESIGN
Three biological replicates each of ESCs and NPCs were prepared and assays using Affymetrix Gene Expression Arrays
