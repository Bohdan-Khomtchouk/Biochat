TITLE
c-MYC drives a subset of high-risk pediatric neuroblastomas and is activated through mechanisms including enhancer hijacking and focal enhancer amplification [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Childhood neuroblastoma is known for MYCN gene amplification, and here we show that in a separate subset of cases MYC-itself is activated due to enhancer hijacking from chromosomal translocations or duplications, thus defining a unique subset of high-risk disease.

DESIGN
RNA-seq in zebrafish overexpressing human c-Myc or n-Myc

PLATFORM
GPL20828 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Danio rerio)
