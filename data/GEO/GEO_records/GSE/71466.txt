TITLE
Systems genetics analysis of a recombinant inbred mouse cell culture panel reveals Wnt pathway member Lrp6 as a regulator of adult hippocampal precursor cell proliferation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stem/precursor cells were isolated from the hippocampal subgranular zone of adult mice and maintained as adherent cultures. Cultures from 20 different strains of the BXD recombinant inbred poulation were established in this study. For each cell line (strain), cells from 3 different passages were hybridised to Illumina Mouse-6 microarrays (1 replicate (strain/passage) per array).

DESIGN
A total of 60 proliferating cell cultures on 60 arrays

PLATFORM
GPL17543 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 R2 expression beadchip
