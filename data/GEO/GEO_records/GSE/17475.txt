TITLE
Expression data from lung adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix Human Genome U133A platform was used to obtain gene expression profiles of 28 pathologically and clinically well characterized adenocarcinomas of the lung. In addition, EGFR status was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The classification of the cases using a clustering algorithm applied to the expression data correlated significantly with the histopathological tumor grades. In contrast, no correlation of gene expression data and EGFR status could be detected.

DESIGN
In this study we evaluated the gene expression of 28 clinico-pathological well characterized lung adenocarcinomas.
