TITLE
Gene expression data of allodiploid embryonic stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq was used to assess the gene expression profiles of 4 allodiploid embryonic stem cell lines and 4 control embryonic stem cell lines. Moreover, single-cell RNA-Seq was used to quantify the transcriptomes of 87 allodiploid single cells.

DESIGN
Comparison of mRNA profiles of 4 allodiploid embryonic stem cell lines to 4 control mouse and rat embryonic stem cell lines using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Single-cell RNA-Seq was conducted to check the transcriptomes of single allodiploid embryonic and differentiated cells.
