TITLE
Expression data from adult wistar female rat 5mm spinal cord tissue

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarray gene expression analyses to unveil the mechanisms underlying NT-3-chitosan-induced spinal cord regeneration.

DESIGN
Complete transaction of thoracic spinal cord at T7/8 was performed, with a 5 mm segment of the spinal cord being removed. The emptied space where either refilled with a 5mm chitosan tube loaded with or without NT-3 (NT-3 or empty tube, ET, respectively) or left alone (lesion control, LC). At 1, 3, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90days post surgery, animals were sacrificed, and 5mm segments of spinal cord at the lesion site, as well as immediately caudal or rostral to the lesion segment were collected labeled with R for rostral, C for caudal, and M for lesion site
