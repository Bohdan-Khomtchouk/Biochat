TITLE
MicroRNA Expression profiles of mature hepatocytes and foetal liver progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human liver progenitor cells (LPCs) show therapeutic potential, however, their in vitro culture results in inadequate function and phenotypic instability reflecting incomplete understanding of in vivo processes. Foetal LPCs capable of differentiation to a hepatocyte phenotype were isolated and mRNA expression profiling carried out using Exiqon miRCURY microarrays. This was compared to profiles from mature human hepatocytes. Foetal LPCs exhibit a distinct miRNA profile consistent with a stem cell signature, cell division, and some liver-specific functions.

DESIGN
3 independent samples of second trimester liver progenitor cells were prolfiled along with 3 independent mature hepatocyte samples.
