TITLE
Unique Molecular Signature of Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (Affy)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compare the transcriptome of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), adult stem cells with apparent greater differentiation potential such as multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neurospheres (NS). Mouse and rat MAPCs were used in this study and two different array platforms (Affymetrix and NIA) were used for mouse samples. Keywords: mRNA expression profiling, oligonucleotide microarrays, stem cells
