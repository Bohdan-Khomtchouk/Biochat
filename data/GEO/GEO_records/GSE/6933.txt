TITLE
Unique Molecular Signature of Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (Affy)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We compare the transcriptome of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), adult stem cells with apparent greater differentiation potential such as multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neurospheres (NS). Mouse and rat MAPCs were used in this study and two different array platforms (Affymetrix and NIA) were used for mouse samples. Keywords: mRNA expression profiling, oligonucleotide microarrays, stem cells

DESIGN
Three mRNA samples (biological replicates) per cell type taken at different passage number were compared. Cell types include mouse ESCs, mouse MSCs and three clones isolated using mouse MAPC culture condition: mMAPC-1, mMAPC-2 and mClone-3.  mMAPC-1 and mClone-3 were obtained from same bone marrow isolation, mMAPC-2 was obtained in a different bone marrow isolation. Two clones derived from same rat bone marrow using rat MAPC culture conditions were compared. Three mRNA samples (biological replicates) per clone were taken at different passage numbers
