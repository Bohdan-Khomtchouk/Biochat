TITLE
Quantitative Genomics study of sex dimorphism in D. Melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
A diallel including reciprocals but not selfs experiment. Keywords: Agilent microarray, sexual dimorphism, genetical genomics, genetic variation

DESIGN
Nine randomly selected D. melanogaster lines were used as parents for this diallel. Male and female intact adult progeny were collected.  Crosses were repeated in four independent sub blocks such that every cross appeared with every other cross at least once.  Two sub blocks were pooled for each replicate.  Each array was a pair of male and females from the same cross with the dye flipped between replicates
