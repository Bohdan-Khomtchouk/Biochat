TITLE
Gene expression profiles for human bone marrow-mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare the gene expression profile of hBM-MSCs at early (P3), late-passage (P7), and UBC gene knockdown (KD) from three different donors, we performed one-color microarray-based gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
hBM-MSCs from three different donors: passage-3, passage-7, and UBC knockdown
