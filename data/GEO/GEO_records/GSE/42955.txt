TITLE
Expression data from human heart

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression is altered in heart failure. This syndrome can be caused by cardiovascular diseases, including dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, viral or toxic myocarditis, hypertension, and valvular diseases. We used microarrays to evaluate the impact of heart failure on human nucleocytoplasmic transport-related genes examining simultaneoulsly both dilated and ischemic human cardiomyopathies compared to normal hearts.

DESIGN
Transmural samples were taken from near the apex of the left ventricle. 29 heart samples were used in the microarray assay (dilated cardiomypathy, n = 12; ischemic cardiomyopathy, n = 12, and control hearts n = 5).
