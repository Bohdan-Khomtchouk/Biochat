TITLE
Deterministic direct reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency [Microarray/Expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Somatic cells can be directly reprogrammed to pluripotency by exogenous expression of transcription factors, classically Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc. While distinct types of somatic cells can be reprogramed with varying efficiencies and by different modified reprogramming protocols, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) induction remains inefficient and stochastic where a fraction of the cells converts into iPSCs. The nature of rate limiting barrier(s) preventing majority of cells to convert into iPSCs remains elusive. Here we show that neutralizing Mbd3, a core member of the Mbd3/NURD co-repressor and chromatin-remodeling complex, results in deterministic and synchronized reprogramming of multiple differentiated cell types to pluripotency. 100% of Mbd3 depleted mouse and human somatic cells convert into iPSCs after seven days of reprogramming factor induction. Our findings delineate a critical pathway blocking the reestablishment of pluripotency, and offer a novel platform for future dissection of epigenetic dynamics leading to iPSC formation at high resolution.

DESIGN
Samples include Mbd3+/+, Mbd3flox/- and Mbd3-/- cells from mouse ES cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) before and after DOX induction (initiating reprogramming by OSKM factors). Cells were expanded on irradiated mouse MEFs.
