TITLE
Aspergillus niger : Control (fructose) vs. xylose + arabinose (XA)

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. niger comparing different strains (WT, ΔXlnR, ΔaraR and ΔaraRΔXlnR) treated with 25mM xylose + 25mM arabinose for 2 and 8h. The main objective was to identifiy genes related to primary metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism in general, for instance, cellulases and hemicellulases. The study will compare the differences between WT strain and the strains with the disrupted xylanolytic transcriptional activator gene, XlnR, the arabinolytic transcriptional activator gene, AraR, and the double mutant,after treatment with xylose+arabinose (XA treatment). The experiment was further validated by real-time PCR and enzymatic assays.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment : A. niger mutant strains on XA for 2 and 8 h at 30 oC in batch culture. Firstly, the strains were pre-grown in minimal medium with fructose as carbon source (control), and then transferred to xylose+arabinose (25 mM each) as carbon source.
