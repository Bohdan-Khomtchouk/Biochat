TITLE
CTCF promotes RNA pol II pausing and links DNA methylation to alternative splicing [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to investigate the role of intragenic CTCF in alternative pre-mRNA splicing through a combined CTCF-ChIP-seq and RNA-seq approach. CTCF depletion led to decreased inclusion of weak upstream exons.
