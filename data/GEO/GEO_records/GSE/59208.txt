TITLE
Comparative analysis of transcriptome profiles of a lintless-fuzzless mutant XinWX and its near-isogenic line linted-fuzzless mutant XinFLM during fiber initiation development stages

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
To gain novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of fiber initiation development,transcription profiling of the lintless-fuzzless mutant (XinWX) and its near-isogenic line,XinFLM (fuzzless-linted mutant) were compared using cDNA microarray technology. The expression profiling was performed at 3 developmental time points: -1, 0, and 1 dpa. fiber initiation development related genes were identified by differentially expressed gene analysis. And these genes could be used as potential candidate genes for manipulation to improve fiber yield.

DESIGN
Cotton plants were grown under field condition. Flowers were tagged and cotton bolls were collected during Fiber initiation stages. Total RNA was isolated from ovule and fiber mixtures of XinWX and XinFLM at -1, 0, and 1 dpa. A total of 9 hybridizations with three biological replicates including a swap-dye experiment for each fiber developmental stage were employed.

PLATFORM
