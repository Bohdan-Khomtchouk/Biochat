TITLE
Analysis of Rice microRNAs Expression under Drought Stress

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We used this microarray to monitor rice miRNA expression profile under osmotic stress. Most of rice miRNAs have no significant change. miR-169f showed osmotic-responsive up-regulation. However, the others members of miR-169 family displays no responses to the osmotic stress. Keywords: microRNA,rice,osmotic stress,miR-169
