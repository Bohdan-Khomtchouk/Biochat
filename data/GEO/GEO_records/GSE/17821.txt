TITLE
Heterosis-associated gene expression in maize (Zea mays L.) embryo and endosperm 6 days after pollination

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
We demonstrated the manifestation of heterosis in hybrid maize embryo and endosperm tissue six days after fertilization in crosses of several inbred lines. Here we analyzed heterosis-associated gene expression pattern in these tissues of reciprocal crosses of two european maize inbred line combinations. Differences in gene expression were analyzed with custom microarrays by a combined approach of suppression subtractive hybridization and microarray hybridizations

DESIGN
Analysis used isolated embryos and endosperm samples for a total of 48 microarray hybridizations of hybrid genotypes generated by reciprocal crosses of UH301/UH005 and UH250/UH301 and the corresponding inbred lines. The investigations are based on two biological replicates of the UH250/UH301 genotype combination and four biological replicates of the UH301/UH005 genotype combination. The hybridization experiments employed a loop design.
