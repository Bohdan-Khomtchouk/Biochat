TITLE
Expression data for filamentous-form yeast with genetic perturbations

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We construced combinations of genetic deletions to infer genetic interactions in genomic expression data. Keywords: combinatorial genetic perturbations

DESIGN
The yeast transciptome was measured in rich media for a wild-type strain as a reference. We then collected genomic expression data in filamentous-growth conditions for 16 strains: wild-type, TEC1 gene deletion, CUP9 gene deletion, SFL1 gene deletion, SOK2 gene deletion, SKN7 gene deletion, and all possible pairwise combinations of deletions.
