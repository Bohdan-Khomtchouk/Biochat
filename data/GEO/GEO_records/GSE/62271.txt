TITLE
PRDM5 regulates collagen gene transcription by association with RNA polymerase II in developing bone

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PRDM family members are transcriptional regulators involved in tissue specific differentiation. PRDM5 has been reported to predominantly repress transcription, but a characterization of its molecular functions in a relevant biological context is lacking. We demonstrate here that Prdm5is highly expressed in developing bones; and, by genome-wide mapping of Prdm5 occupancy in pre-osteoblastic cells, we uncover a novel and unique role for Prdm5 in targeting all mouse collagen genes as well as several SLRP proteoglycan genes. In particular, we show that Prdm5 controls both Collagen I transcription and fibrillogenesis by binding inside the Col1a1 gene body and maintaining RNA polymerase II occupancy. In vivo, Prdm5 loss results in delayed ossification involving a pronounced impairment in the assembly of fibrillar collagens. Collectively, our results define a novel role for Prdm5 in sustaining the transcriptional program necessary to the proper assembly of osteoblastic extracellular matrix.

DESIGN
A total of six ChIP-Seq samples are available: two directed against Prdm5, using different antibodies (named ab1 and ab2), two directed against histone modifications (H3K4Me3 and H3K9Me3), one directed against the active transcribing RNA Polymerase II and a background model obtained using an unrelated IgG

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
