TITLE
Effect of Amphiregulin on global gene expression in injured skeletal muscle in the presence or absence of CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of injured skeletal muscle showed that amphiregulin (Areg), a growth factor over-expressed by muscle Treg cells, enhances muscle regeneration both in the presence and in the absence of Tregs.

DESIGN
Foxp3-DTR+ and Foxp3-DTR- mice were injured with cardiotoxin in TA muscle at day 0 and treated with diphtheria toxin every other day from day 0 until dissection. Amphiregulin or PBS were administered im on day 0 and ip every other day until dissection. TA muscle was flash-frozen and RNA was extracted using Trizol. RNA from whole tissue samples was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
