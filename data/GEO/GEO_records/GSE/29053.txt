TITLE
In-depth analysis of microRNA in bat hibernating regulation

ORGANISM
Myotis ricketti

SUMMARY
We report the application of the Illumina/Solexa sequencing-by-synthesis platform to identify microRNA, which invovled in bat hibernating regualtion, in brain and adipose tissue. Total 866 microRNAs (including 477 novels) were identified and 269 microRNAs showed significant expression differences during hibernation, including 183 in brain and 199 in adipose tissue. Expressed pattern analysis indicated that two-thirds of differential expressed microRNAs showed down-regulated during hibernation in both tissues. This study will provide clules to in-deep analysis the molecular mechanism of hibernating regualtion.

DESIGN
Identification of microRNA on hibernating regulation in 2 different tissues and 2 physiological states of bat.

PLATFORM
GPL13491 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Myotis pilosus)
