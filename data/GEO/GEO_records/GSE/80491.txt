TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Caco-2 cells following exposure to VTEC isolates derived from diverse origins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This project has two goals. Firstly, to compare the gene expression profiles of Caco cells following exposure to Verocytotoxigenic E. coli0157:H7 (VTEC) isolates from food animals (bovine, ovine, porcine) and human in an effort to assess the invasive and toxigenic potential of isolates of different origin. All sources contain the common virulence and type 3 secretory system genes. Secondly, to compare the gene expression profiles of Caco-2 cells following exposure to VTEC isolates that contain (positive) or do not contain (negative) the genes of the type 3 secretory system (TTSS).

DESIGN
Eight groups (TTSS positive), four replicates (32 arrays in total):1. Control x 4, 2. Human x 4, 3. Ovine x 4, 4. Bovine x 4, 5. Porcine x 4, 6. International Reference x 4, 7. TTSS_NEG_Human x 4, 8.TTSS_NEG_Ovine x 4

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
