TITLE
MEK5 is Activated by Shear Stress, Activates ERK5 And Induces KLF4 To Modulate TNF Responses in Human Dermal Microvascular Endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MEK5 is activated by shear stress in large vessel endothelial cells (ECs) and contributes to the suppression of pro-inflammatory changes in the arterial wall. We used microarray analyses of total RNA from MEK5/CA-transduced HDMECs compared to LacZ control-transduced HDMECs to identify distinct classes of several regulated genes, including KLF4, eNOS, and ICAM. We conclude that MEK5 activation by shear stress may modulate inflammatory responses in the microvasculature, and these actions are partly mediated by KLF4.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 8 separate paired (derived from same primary isolate) MEK5/CA and LacZ transduced HDMEC lines
