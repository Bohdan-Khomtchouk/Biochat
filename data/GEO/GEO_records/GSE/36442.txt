TITLE
Functional genomic analyses of Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010 highlight how this microorganism interact with the human host

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010

SUMMARY
Bifidobacteria represents one of the dominant group of microorganisms colonizing the intestine of infants. However, the genetic determinants supporting the establishment and the interaction with the human hosts are still largely unknown. Most commensal bacteria interacting with eukaryotic hosts express adhesive molecules on their surfaces that modulate interaction with host cell receptors or with soluble macromolecules. Whole genome transcription profiling of B. bifidum PRL2010, a strain isolated from infant stool, under in vitro as well as in vivo conditions revealed the expression of few common extracellular proteins among which type 1 pili encoding genes.
