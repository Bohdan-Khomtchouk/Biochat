TITLE
Functional genomic analyses of Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010 highlight how this microorganism interact with the human host

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium bifidum

SUMMARY
Bifidobacteria represents one of the dominant group of microorganisms colonizing the intestine of infants. However, the genetic determinants supporting the establishment and the interaction with the human hosts are still largely unknown. Most commensal bacteria interacting with eukaryotic hosts express adhesive molecules on their surfaces that modulate interaction with host cell receptors or with soluble macromolecules. Whole genome transcription profiling of B. bifidum PRL2010, a strain isolated from infant stool, under in vitro as well as in vivo conditions revealed the expression of few common extracellular proteins among which type 1 pili encoding genes.

DESIGN
To investigate the molecular mechanisms sustaining the interaction of PRL2010 strain with the human gut, we first explored the global genome transcription profiling of this strain in a in vitro human model such as in the presence of HT29 cell lines. The transcriptome was analyzed using a custom B. bifidum PRL2010 array representing the 90% of this organism’s protein coding genes. To better evaluate the conserved responses by B. bifidum, the in vivo transcriptomes were quantified against a diverse set of transcriptome patterns identified for in vitro laboratory cultures of the strain, i.e., B. bifidum responses after growth on an cell’s monolayers growth medium (DMEM); B.bifidum responses after growth on synthetic medium (MRS). Briefly, we analized  five conditions, two of which are also used as references. Every experiment was performed in duplicate and in vivo condition was performed in quadruplicate.
