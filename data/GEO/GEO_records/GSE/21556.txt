TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana treated with NO donor SNP, compared to NO depletion by cPTIO

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Nitric oxide (NO) is considered a key regulator of plant developmental processes and defense. Characterization of root-related phenotypes and the involvement of NO in the regulation of primary root growth.

DESIGN
Three-experimental condition, SDW, SNP and cPTIO. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates (SDW) , 3  replicates treated with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), 3 replicates treated with 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO)

PLATFORM
GPL198 [ATH1-121501] Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array
