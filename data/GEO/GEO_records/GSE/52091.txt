TITLE
p53 reactivation in liver tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We induced liver tumors by transforming liver progenitor cells (LPC) with retroviruses expressing oncogenic Ras coupled to tetracycline transactivator  together with an inducible shRNA targeting p53. Transformed LPCs were orthotopical transplanted into recipient livers and after tumor onset mice were fed with either  Doxycycline containing chow or normal chow. 8 days later tumors were harvested and RNA was extracted.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted using Trizol. For microarray experiment, HrasV12 driven liver tumors harboring tet-off shp53 were treated with Doxycycline for 0 day (p53 OFF, as control) or 8 days (p53 ON). Samples were assessed by Affymetrix 430 2.0 mouse microarray.
