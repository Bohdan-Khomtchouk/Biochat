TITLE
Transcriptome characterization of IFNa response in MaSC and luminal progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome response to IFNa treatment in MaSC, Luminal progenitor cells were studied. The MaSC, Luminal progenitor cells enriched subpopulations were sorted based on CD24/CD29 expression from mammary epithelial cells of virgin female mice . (Tiede BJ et al., 2009, PLoS ONE 4(11): e8035. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008035). The cells were cultured in mammosphere condition in vitro and treated with Ifna for 8 days. The total RNA samples are collected and compared using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
2x2 design. Comparison of two subpopulations MaSC (P4) and Luminal progenitor (P5) enriched subpopulations and two treatment conditions, control and IFNa treated.
