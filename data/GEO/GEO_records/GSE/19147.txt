TITLE
CD3+ T-cells of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of T-cells isolated from CD3+ T-cells of patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). In contrast to other types of cancers, the non-malignant T-cell compartment of B CLL patients is expanded. Results provide insights into the role of T-cells in B-CLL.

DESIGN
Purified T-cells of B-CLL patients and normal donor T-cells were analyzed on microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes. The normal donor T-cell control data sets (n=8) have been previously  published in the GDS2908 record.
