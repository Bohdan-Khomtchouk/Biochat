TITLE
GPR56/ADGRG1 inhibits Mesenchymal Differentiation and Radioresistance in Glioblastoma [GIC7]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A mesenchymal transition occurs both during natural evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) and in response to therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying mesenchymal differentiation are not well understood. We have found that the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor GPR56/ADGRG1 inhibits mesenchymal differentiation and radioresistance in glioblastoma stem-like initiating cells (GICs). Here, we have performed microarray analysis of parental- versus GPR56 knockout-GICs to identify gene expression changes upon GPR56 knockout

DESIGN
To interrogate the effect of GPR56 loss on the transcriptome of glioma initiating cells (GICs) we compared the gene expression profile of parental- and GPR56 knockout-GICs by genome-wide microarray analysis. Patient-derived GICs (parental and KO5) were cultured under adherent conditions on laminin in serum-free neural stem cell medium (in the presence of bFGF and EGF) at 37Â°C, 5% CO2 and 5% oxygen. Total RNA was extracted, labeled and hybridized in a SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60k array (Agilent Technologies). Four paired biological replicates of each parental- and GPR56 knockout-GICs were used
