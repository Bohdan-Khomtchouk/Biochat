TITLE
MicroRNA-10a Regulation of Proinflammatory Mediators: An Important Component of Untreated Juvenile Dermatomyositis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to identify differentially expressed microRNAs in muscle between JDM and normal healthy controls, and to better understand the pathophysiology of JDM.

DESIGN
Global microRNA expression from the skeletal muscle of 18 children with JDM and 6 healthy pediatric controls was performed on the miRCURY LNAâ„¢ microRNA Array (6'th GEN) using Exiqon microRNA array service (Skelstedet 16, 2950, Vedbak, Denmark) and was compared to determine differentially expressed microRNAs between JDM and healthy controls.

PLATFORM
GPL17382 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, 6th generation - hsa, mmu & rno [miRBase 17.0]
