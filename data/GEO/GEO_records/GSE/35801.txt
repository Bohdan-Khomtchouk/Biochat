TITLE
Gene expression profiles of decidualized human endometrial stromal cells knockdown for HOXA10

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The homeobox gene HOXA10 plays a key role in endometrial differentiation during embryogenesis and is abundantly expressed in the adult endometrium and decidual cells. In the adult endometrium the expression of HOXA10 is regulated by estrogen and progesterone and the levels are highest in the decidualized cells. We have shown that HOXA10 is required in the endometrial cells to maintain the decidual cell phenotype. In this study we aimed to determine the molecular mechanisms by which HOXA10 maintains the decidual phenotype and the other roles it might have in decidual physiology. In vitro decidualized human endometrial stromal cells were knocked down for HOXA10 using siRNA and gene expression profiles of the scrambled and HOXA10 siRNA transfected cells were compared at 24, 48 and 72 h post transfection. Several genes having multiple functions were found to be differentially expressed. We postulate that HOXA10 is required by the decidual cells to support immune cell differentiation, trophoblast invasion and cellular remodeling.

DESIGN
In vitro decidualized priamry cultures of human endometrial strmal cells transfected with a siRNA againts HOXA10 or a scrambled siRNA. Cells harvested at 24, 48 and 72 h post transfection.  Dual channel hybridization with dye swap design in biological replicates
