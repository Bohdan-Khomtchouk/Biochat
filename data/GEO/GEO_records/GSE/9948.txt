TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of Leishmania major methotrexate resistant strains using full-genome DNA microarrays

ORGANISM
Leishmania major

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of the drug resistant strain L. major MTX60.4 compared to the wild-type strain LV39 The full-genome DNA microarrays includes one 70-oligonucleotides probe for each gene of L.major LV39 Keywords: drug resistance

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, resistant strain MTX60.4 vs wild-type LV39. Four biological replicates for each strain, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array

PLATFORM
