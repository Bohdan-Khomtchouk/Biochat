TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation and expression identifies CIMP in myelodysplastic syndrome [Illumina]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes hypermethylated and transcriptionally downregulated, we have employed the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8x60K. And we validated selected genes in cases and controls. eventually we estalished CIMP of MDS.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 4 patients and 4 controls were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
