TITLE
Genes regulated by PRDM5 in U2OS cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PRDM5 is a recently identified member of the PRDM family of proteins, which functions as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting histone methyltransferase G9A to DNA, and behaves as a putative tumor suppressor in different types of cancer. We investigated PRDM5 function by identifying its target genes in U2OS cells at different time points after expression of PRDM5 protein. Keywords: Transcriptional regulation, time course

DESIGN
We analyzed gene expression profiles of a U2OS cell line conditionally expressing HA-tagged PRDM5 (U2OS-PRDM5), where PRDM5 is under the transcriptional control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. Expression of PRDM5 protein is detectable after 8 hours of induction with 2ug/ml doxycycline, and increases steadily up to 48 hours, after which cells begin to undergo apoptosis. U2OS cells containing the empty cloning vector (U2OS-pSG213) were used as controls for each condition.
