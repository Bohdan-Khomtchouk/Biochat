TITLE
Genes regulated by PRDM5 in U2OS cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PRDM5 is a recently identified member of the PRDM family of proteins, which functions as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting histone methyltransferase G9A to DNA, and behaves as a putative tumor suppressor in different types of cancer. We investigated PRDM5 function by identifying its target genes in U2OS cells at different time points after expression of PRDM5 protein. Keywords: Transcriptional regulation, time course
