TITLE
Expression data from Triticum aestivum L. roots

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
To better understand the regulatory mechanisms of water stress response in wheat, the transcript profiles in roots of two wheat genotypes, namely, drought tolerant 'Luohan No.2' (LH) and drought susceptible 'Chinese Spring' (CS) under water-stress were comparatively analyzed by using the Affymetrix wheat GeneChipÂ®. A total of 3831 transcripts displayed 2-fold or more expression changes, 1593 transcripts were induced compared with 2238 transcripts were repressed, in LH under water-stress; Relatively fewer transcripts were drought responsive in CS, 1404 transcripts were induced and 1493 were repressed. Comparatively, 569 transcripts were commonly induced and 424 transcripts commonly repressed in LH and CS under water-stress. 689 transcripts (757 probe sets) identified from LH and 537 transcripts (575 probe sets) from CS were annotated and classified into 10 functional categories, and 74 transcripts derived from 80 probe sets displayed the change ratios no less than 16 in LH or CS. Several kinds of candidate genes were differentially expressed between the LH and CS, which could be responsible for the difference in drought tolerance of the two genotypes.

DESIGN
Two common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars, Luohan No.2 (LH) and Chinese Spring (CS), were used for this study. Seedlings at the two leaf stage were stressed by cultured in PEG solutions for 6h, and some other seedlings were cultured in tap water as control. Root samples of LH and CS at 6h after the stress treatment and untreated control were prepared for microarray analysis.
