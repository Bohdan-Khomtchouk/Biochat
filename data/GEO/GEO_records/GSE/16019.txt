TITLE
Profiling of chromosomal alterations in renal cell carcinoma using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied Illuminaâ€™s 317K high-density SNP-arrays to profile chromosomal aberrations in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) from 80 patients and analyzed the association of LOH/amplification events with clinicopathological characteristics

DESIGN
Log_R_Ratio and differece of Allele frequency were calculated by comparing the tumor sample to reference DNA, which is from the peripheral blood of corresponding patient
