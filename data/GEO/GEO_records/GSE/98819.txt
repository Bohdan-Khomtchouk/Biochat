TITLE
Expression data from Germ-Free (GF) and L.NK318.1-colonized (NK318.1) mice intestinal epithelial cells and Peyer's patches cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lactobacillus NK318.1 is a commensal microbe isolated from the mouse intestinal feces in our lab. To examined the potential role of L. NK318.1 in the gut immunity, we monocolonized GF mice with L.NK318.1. And, we conducted a microarray experiment to compare the transcriptomes of GF and NK318.1 mice intestines under the same experimental condition We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and Peyer's patches cells (PP) of GF and NK318.1 mice.

DESIGN
IEC and PP of GF and NK318.1 mice of the same physiological and maintaining condition were isolated and then total RNAs were extracted from them, which could reflect the respective transcription profile of  GF and NK318.1 mice. These RNAs were detected by microarray and the influence of L.NK318.1 on intestine could be revealed to some extent.
