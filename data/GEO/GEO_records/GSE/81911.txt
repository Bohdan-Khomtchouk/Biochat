TITLE
ChIP-sequencing of histone marks in WT and Fmr1-/- (KO) neurons and mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Widespread misregulation of histone modifcations occur in FXS, most notably increases in marks associated with active transcription.

DESIGN
7DIV cultured cortical neurons from WT or Fmr1 KO mice were processed for H3K4me3 and H3K27ac ChIP. In addition, neurons sorted from cerebellar tissue from WT and Fmr1 KO BAC-TRAP NeuroD1 P15 mice were used for H3K4me3 ChIP, performed in triplicate
