TITLE
P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NPS3121 responses to bean pod extract

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. phaseolicola

SUMMARY
P. syringae pv. phaseolicola is the causal agent of the halo blight disease of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L). The disease attacks both foliage and pods of plant host. Many genes involve in pathogenicity and virulence are induced only in plant or in the presence of host components. In this work we investigated the effect of bean pod extract on the transcriptomic profile of the bacterium, when grown at low temperature in minimal medium with or without bean pod extract.

DESIGN
Two RNA samples were compared, one prepared from cells grown in minimal medium M9 and the other from cells grown in minimal medium supplemented with bean pod extract.To control de biological variation that might interfere with data interpretation, a minimum of three biological replicates and two technical replicates (swap) were prepared.
