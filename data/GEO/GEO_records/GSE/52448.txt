TITLE
Gene expression change in Gata2 conditional knockout mice adult renal collecting duct

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We would like to know the gene expression pattern in absence of transcription factor GATA2 in adult renal collecting duct We used Gata2 flox::Pax8-rtTA::Tet-Cre to make a doxycycline induced Gata2 renal tubule cell specific knockout mice

DESIGN
We performed microarray analyses using DBA-lectin and magnetic beads purifed collecting duct cells from WT (n=3) or Gata2 CKO mice (n=3) at 4-weeks after doxycycline induction
