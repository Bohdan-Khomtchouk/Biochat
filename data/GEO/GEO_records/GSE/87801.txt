TITLE
Maternal BCG scar is associated with enhanced infant proinflammatory responses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prenatal exposures such as infections and immunisation may influence infant responses. We had an opportunity to undertake an analysis of responses in infants within the context of a study investigating the effects of maternal mycobacterial exposures and infection on bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine-induced responses in Ugandan infants. Gene expression profiles for pathways associated with maternal LTBI and with maternal BCG scar were examined using samples collected at one (n=42) and six (n=51) weeks after BCG immunisation using microarray. Interferon and inflammation response pathways were up-regulated in infants of mothers with LTBI at six weeks, and in infants of mothers with a BCG scar at one and six weeks after BCG immunisation.  Maternal BCG scar had a stronger association with infant responses than maternal LTBI, with an increased proinflammatory immune profile.
