TITLE
Gene expression profile in CD11c+ splenic dendritic cells and CD11c+CD103+ dendritic cells from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of mice with DC-specific targeting of TGFBR2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of dentritic cells from the spleen (CD11c+) or MLN (CD11c+CD103+) of mice with DC-specific deletion of TGFBR2 gene, or their control littermates. TRGFR2 gene was deleted in dendritic cells using Cre/lox approach. Mice with this deletion develop spontaneous multi-organ autoimmune inflammation and die by 15 weeks of age.

DESIGN
Splenic CD11c+ Dc were isolated by magetic cell sorting. MLN CD11c+CD103+ DC were flow sorted. RNA was isolated using RNAqueous-Micro kit (Ambion) and analyzed using Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array

PLATFORM
GPL6096 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
