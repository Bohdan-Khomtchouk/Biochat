TITLE
Midgut transcriptome response to a Cry toxin in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae)

ORGANISM
Plutella xylostella

SUMMARY
We investigate the functional complexity of the Plutella xylostella transcriptome in defending against a Bt toxin using Illumina sequencing technology. Over 2,900 differentially expressed unigenes were obtained in resistant P. xylostella comparison to their susceptible counterpart.

DESIGN
All the P. xylostella were maintained on cabbage.The susceptible strain (MM) was cultured without exposure to any Bt toxins.Before the sample collected, Cry1Ac-resistant P. xylostella were treated with 750Î¼g/mL Bt toxin Cry1Ac to eliminate the heterozygous individuals. Then the survivors were collected after 48 hours and designed as the resistant sample (MK and GK). Then fourth-instars larvae midgut tissues of MK,GK and MM were collected, respectively, The RNA was extracted and sequenced using Illunima HiSeq 2000.
