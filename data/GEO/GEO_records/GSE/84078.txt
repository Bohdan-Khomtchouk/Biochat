TITLE
Ovarian transcriptome associated with reproductive senescence in the long-living Ames dwarf mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the current work was to evaluate the ovarian transcriptome in Ames dwarf (df/df) mice. df/df mice have a delayed ovarian aging compared to normal (N) mice. Although a high number of genes were differentially expressed during aging of N mice, only a small fraction of these changed with aging in df/df mice. These alterations involved more than 500 categorized biological processes. The majority of these biological processes, including inflammatory/immune responses, were up-regulated with aging in N mice, while old df/df mice were characterized by down-regulation of these same processes in comparison to age matched N mice. However, biological processes related to DNA damage and repairing were commonly down-regulated with aging in both genotypes. In conclusion, delayed ovarian aging in long-living df/df mice was associated with reduced expression of genes related to the inflammatory and immune responses.

DESIGN
Ovarian mRNA profile of 6 and 22 month old Ames dwarf (df/df) and Normal (N/df) female mice. Twenty mice were used in this study, for each age/genotype 5 ovarian samples were processed. PRJNA327085; SRP077508
