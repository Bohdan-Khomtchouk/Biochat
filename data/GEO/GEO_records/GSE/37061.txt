TITLE
RNA-sequencing analysis of NB4 cells overexpressing miR-125b

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better understand the mechanisms of blockage of myeloid differentiation and apoptosis and induction of proliferation by miR-125b, we proceeded to identify miR-125b target genes involved in these pathways. We analyzed the total cellular gene expression pattern by RNA-sequencing of the parental NB4 myeloid cell line and that transiently transfected with miR-125b. We generated four cDNA libraries corresponding to duplicates of miR-125b and control cells.

DESIGN
Compare the gene expression levels in miR control transfected cells with that in miR-125b transfected NB4 cells.Â
