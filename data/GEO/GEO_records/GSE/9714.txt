TITLE
Interferon response of radioresistant and radiosensitive human head & neck tumor cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nu61, a radiation-resistant human tumor xenograft, was selected from a parental radiosensitive tumor SCC-61 by eight serial cycles of passage in athymic nude mice and in vivo irradiation. Obtained tumors xenografts were profiled in two independent experiments using Affymetrix U133A arrays. Most abundant gene pattern associated with radioresistant phenotype was presented by IFN-inducible, Stat1-dependent pathway. In these experiments we detected genes responding to IFN alpha, beta and gamma in nu61 and SCC61 Keywords: Pair-wise comparison of un-treated and treated tumor cell lines

DESIGN
Cell lines derived from nu61 and SCC61 were grown in vitro and treated by the mixture of IFNalpha, IFNbeta and IFN gamma (100,100 and 5ng/ml respectively). 5 hours after administration of IFNs cells were lysed, RNA collected and used for hybridization with U133A chips to detect genes responding to IFN treatment in nu61 and SCC61
