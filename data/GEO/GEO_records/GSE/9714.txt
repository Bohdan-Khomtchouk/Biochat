TITLE
Interferon response of radioresistant and radiosensitive human head

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nu61, a radiation-resistant human tumor xenograft, was selected from a parental radiosensitive tumor SCC-61 by eight serial cycles of passage in athymic nude mice and in vivo irradiation. Obtained tumors xenografts were profiled in two independent experiments using Affymetrix U133A arrays. Most abundant gene pattern associated with radioresistant phenotype was presented by IFN-inducible, Stat1-dependent pathway. In these experiments we detected genes responding to IFN alpha, beta and gamma in nu61 and SCC61 Keywords: Pair-wise comparison of un-treated and treated tumor cell lines
