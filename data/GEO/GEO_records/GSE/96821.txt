TITLE
MicroRNAs expression data from two different types of human breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of microRNAs differences between MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells.Sample 1- Human breast cancer cell MCF-7,which exibits ER and PR expression, belongs to non-triple negative breast cancer cell with epithelial morphology and character.Sample 2-human breast cancer cell MCF-7/ADR,derived from MCF-7 and cultured with 1 ug/ml adriamycin for at least one year and pocesses adriamycin-resistance with mesenchymal morphology and character. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of microRNA expression between two distinct classes of breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
Two types of breast cancer cells were selected at successive stages for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain homogeneous populations of cells in order to normalize resolution of expression profiles.
