TITLE
Synechocystis PCC6803 time course responses to H2O2 3mM.

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
The transcriptome approach was used to characterize the kinetics (5 time points) of the global change in Synechocystis gene expression in response to continuous exposure to H2O2 (3 mM). For each time point, total RNA were isolated from stressed and unstressed cells, reverse-transcribed, differentially labelled (dye swapped), hybridized together (stressed versus unstressed samples) and analyzed with DNA glass microarrays (two slides per each time point) (Custom-commercial array : IntelliGeneTM CyanoCHIP version 2.0, TAKARA). To identify differentially expressed genes, the median of the normalized ratio of Cy5/Cy3 intensity was calculated for each spot of the replicated dye-swap. The results of the analysis were carefully examined to exclude the dye effect between the 2 Cy-swapped arrays. Keywords: time course, stress responses

DESIGN
We made a kinetic (5 time points) of exposure to H2O2 (3 mM). For each time point, we analyzed 2 arrays (dye swap).
