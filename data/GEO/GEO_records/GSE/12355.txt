TITLE
Detection of Notch1-IC, Notch2-IC and EBNA2 target genes in human B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Notch1-IC, Notch2-IC or EBNA2 have been induced in a conditionally immortalized human B cell line (EREB2-5) in order to identify similar and unique target genes in B cells. CAT was used as a control. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
RNA was isolated at different time points after induction of Notch1-IC, Notch2-IC or EBNA2 in EREB2-5 cells. Three independent experiments were performed (except Notch1-IC at 3day).
