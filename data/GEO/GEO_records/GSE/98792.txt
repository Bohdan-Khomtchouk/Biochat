TITLE
Transcriptional response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ΔlucA::hyg and complemented strains vs. WT in resting murine bone marrow-derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ΔlucA::hyg mutant and complemented strains vs. WT  in resting murine bone marrow-derived macrophages was analyzed in this study. This data demonstrates that deletion of lucA leads to perturbed expression of the genes linked to fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism of the pathogen during macrophage infection. It supports an overall conclusion of the publication that LucA serves an important role in function of fatty acid and choletserol transporters.

DESIGN
Transcriptional responses of M. tuberculosis to macrophage infection (day 3) were studied for 3 strains: wild type (WT), ΔlucA::hyg mutant and complemented strain (Comp). Biological replicates: 3 control (WT) replicates, 3 ΔlucA::hyg mutant replicates and 3 complemented strain replicates.
