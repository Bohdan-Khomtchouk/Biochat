TITLE
IMM_IL-17RC_KO mice_exp1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study identifies a novel mechanism linking IL-17A with colon tissue repair and tumor development. Abrogation of IL-17A signaling mice attenuated tissue repair of DSS-induced damage in colon epithelium and markedly reduced tumor development in AOM/DSS model of colitis-associated cancer. The goal of these studies is to identify genes associated with IL-17RC deficiency during AOM-DSS induced tumorigenesis

DESIGN
Wild-type and IL-17RC KO mice were subjected to AOM-DSS induced tumorigenic protocol. Treated/untreated mice were sacrificed and their colons resected for total RNA at different time points during the AOM-DSS treatment.
