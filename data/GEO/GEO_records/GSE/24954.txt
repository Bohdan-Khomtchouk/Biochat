TITLE
miRNA profile of Neonatal Rat Cardiomyocytes treated with 0.5% or 1.5% Oxygen for 48 h versus Normoxia

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The Purpose of this study is to screen for microRNAs regulated by hypoxia in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates were perfomed for each each group, normoxia and hypoxia.  One normoxic and one hypoxic sample was hybridized to each chip for a total of 6 2-color experiments.  A dye swap for each oxygen treatment were performed.
