TITLE
OBP4 modifies root growth, cell elongation and callus formation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Arabidopsis roots by overexpressing OBP4 transcription factor under teh control of an estradiol inducible promoter This work analyzes the effect of overexpression the transcription factor OBP4 in gene transcription. Details of how ectopic expression affects root development and callus formation are described in Rammirez-Parra et al. (submitted)

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA extracted from three independent experiments of Arabidopsis roots overexpressiong GFP and three  independent experiments of Arabidopsis roots overexpressing OBP4 during 8 hours.
