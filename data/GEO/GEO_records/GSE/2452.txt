TITLE
Effects of fescue toxicosis on rat hepatic tissue

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rats (n=24) were fed ad libitum diets containing either ground endophyte-free (E-) seed or endophyte–infected (E+) seed for five days at thermoneutrality (21°C).  Rats (n=24) with intraperitonial transmitters were used with core temperature (Tc) and general activity measured every 5 minutes during the study. At treatment end, the liver was removed, weighed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Twelve rats were selected for microarray experiments, based on degree of sensitivity to fescue toxicosis.  Degree of sensitivity was based on changes in relative liver weights, feed intake, average daily gain, and Tc from pretreatment levels. RNA was extracted from liver samples, converted to cDNA, and hybridized with the printed oligonucleotide slides. The microarray data was analyzed using Wolfinger's two step ANOVA model.
