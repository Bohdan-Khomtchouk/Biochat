TITLE
Gene expression in diploid and evolved tetraploid RPE-1 and BJ-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Both diploid RPE-1 and BJ-1 cells were made tetraploid by transient treatment with the cytokinesis inhibitor DCD. Proliferating tetraploids from both BJ-1 and RPE-1 were selected and isolated. The gene expression profiles of the proliferating tetraploid cells were then compared to the diploids from which they originated.

DESIGN
Triplicate biological samples were collected and analyed.
