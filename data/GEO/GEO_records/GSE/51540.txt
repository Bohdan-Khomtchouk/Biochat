TITLE
Effects of TNF-alpha blocking in sorted Th17 cells from co-cultures of human CD4-positive and CD14-positive cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human CD4+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes from healthy donors were co-cultured with anti-CD3 for three days in the presence or absence of TNF-alpha mAb (Adalimumab). Classical Th17 cells (Th17) or those generated in the presence of the inhibitor (iTh17) were then sorted and analyzed by full transcriptome microarray analysis.

DESIGN
A total of 18 samples consisting of paired samples from 9 healthy volunteers were compared. Sorted Th17 cells from co-cultures containing either Adalimumab (1 microgram/ml) or not were obtained from each of the donors, and compared by full transcriptome profiling.
