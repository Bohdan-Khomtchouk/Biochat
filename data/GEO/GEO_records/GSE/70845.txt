TITLE
Gene expression profiling of SHSY5Y cells exposed to manganese

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The trace element manganese is essential for normal development for all the organisms. Overexposure of manganese may leads to multiple neuronal disorders such as Parkinson, manganism. To explore the molecular mechanism of manganese induced neurotoxicity, gene expression profiling was performed on human neuroblastoma SHSY-5Y cells. Cells were exposed to sub-lethal concentration of manganese (100 Î¼M) for 24 hrs. Our result demonstrates that manganese alter multiple biological pathways including chromatin assembly, neurogenesis and apoptotic pathways.Cells grown in  75mm2 flask. three replicates for each sample

DESIGN
SHSY5Y cells grown in MEM:F12 media (1:1) were treated with manganese and total RNA was isolated from cells after 24 hour exposure Three replicate were used for the experiment

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
