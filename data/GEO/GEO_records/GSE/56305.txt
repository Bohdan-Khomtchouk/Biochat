TITLE
Plasmodium falciparum custom resequencing array testing and validation

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
A custom resequencing array for analysis of field isolates of plasmdium falciparum was created. Test of DNA with genotypes known at all loci genotyped by the microarray as well as test of accuracy correlation with amounts of DNA added to each array

DESIGN
Comparison of test DNA from lab and clinical isolates between genotyped generated by next-generation sequencing and this new custom DNA microarray.
