SUMMARY
Title: Total Skeletal Muscle PGC-1 Deficiency Uncouples Mitochondrial Derangements from Fiber Type Determination and Insulin Sensitivity Abstract: Evidence is emerging that the PGC-1 coactivators serve a critical role in skeletal muscle  metabolism, function, and disease. Mice with total PGC-1 deficiency in skeletal muscle (PGC-1α-/-  βf/f/MLC-Cre mice) were generated and characterized. PGC-1α-/-βf/f/MLC-Cre mice exhibit a  dramatic reduction in exercise performance compared to single PGC-1α- or PGC-1β-deficient mice and  wild-type controls. The exercise phenotype of the PGC-1α-/-βf/f/MLC-Cre mice was associated with a  marked diminution in muscle oxidative capacity and mitochondrial structural derangements  consistent with fusion/fission and biogenic defects together with rapid depletion of muscle glycogen  stores during exercise. Surprisingly, the skeletal muscle fiber type profile of the PGC-1α-/-βf/f/MLCCre  mice was not significantly different than the wild-type mice. Moreover, insulin sensitivity and  glucose tolerance were also not altered in the PGC-1α-/-βf/f/MLC-Cre mice. Taken together, we  conclude that PGC-1 coactivators are necessary for the oxidative and mitochondrial programs of  skeletal muscle but are dispensable for fundamental fiber type determination and insulin sensitivity.

DESIGN
RNA from PGC-1alpha-/- beta f/f/Mlc1fcre was obtained and gene expression pattern compared with PGC-1alpha -/-, PGC-1beta f/f, and PGC-1beta f/f/Mlc1fCre controls. Results file descriptions: 1. GSE23365_skfloxAKO_PPexcl_genesup_GEO-8-16-2010: This table contains genes that were upregulated ≥2.0 fold in gastrocnemius muscle from PGC-1alpha-/- - mice, PGC-1beta f/f/Mlc1fCre mice and PGC-1alpha-/- - beta f/f/Mlc1fCre mice. All groups are normalized to PGC-1beta f/f mice and values are expressed as mean±SEM. The column “description’ contains the gene name, and the column “ID” contains Agilent probe names. 2. GSE23365_skfloxAKO_PPexcl_genesdown_GEO-8-16-2010 This table contains genes that were downregulated ≤0.7 fold in gastrocnemius muscle from PGC-1alpha-/- - mice, PGC-1beta f/f/Mlc1fCre mice and PGC-1alpha-/- - beta f/f/Mlc1fCre mice. All groups are normalized to PGC-1beta f/f mice and values are expressed as mean±SEM. The column “description’ contains the gene name, and the column “ID” contains Agilent probe names.
