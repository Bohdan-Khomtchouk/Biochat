TITLE
Identification of early response genes to Pratylenchus coffeae in resistant ramie by digital gene expression analysis

ORGANISM
Boehmeria nivea

SUMMARY
Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed to study differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between CK and P. coffeae challenged (CH) roots of ramie. A total of 10.16 and 8.07 million clean reads were detected in the CK and CH libraries, respectively. A total of 137 genes were identified as DEGs, 117 and 20 of them were up- and down- regulated respectively, in response to P. coffeae infection.

DESIGN
Roots samples of Pratylenchus coffeae infected(E2) and un-infected (E1) ramie were RNA-Seq sequenced to compare differented expressed genes.
