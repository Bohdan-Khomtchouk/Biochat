TITLE
Cerebellar Gene Expression Profile Analysis in a Rat Model of Acute Alcohol Intoxication

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To identify possible target molecules for acute alcohol intoxication therapy, we used microarray analysis to compare cerebella gene expression profiles of control and acute alcohol-intoxicated rats. We first established a model of acute alcohol intoxication in SD rats, and then used rat cDNA microarray to profile mRNA expression in the cerebella of alcohol-intoxicated rats (experimental group) and saline-treated rats (control group).

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate experimental groups and three separate control groups. We first established a model of acute alcohol intoxication in SD rats, and then used rat cDNA microarray to profile mRNA expression in the cerebella of alcohol-intoxicated rats (experimental group) and saline-treated rats (control group). Cerebellar tissues from three rats were ground to a mixed sample,so we use 3 rats in one group.
