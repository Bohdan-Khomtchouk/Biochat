TITLE
Expression of Intergenic Clusters

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Contains a row for each intergenic cluster in each sample, indicating whether our analysis called the cluster " present " or " absent " in the sample. Intergenic clusters are novel (unannotated) genes detected by aligning Arabidopsis cDNAs/ESTs to the genome. Cluster coordinates refer to version 3 of the TIGR annotation as submitted to GenBank (GI numbers 22330780, 22326553, 22331929, 22329272, 22328163). Keywords: other
