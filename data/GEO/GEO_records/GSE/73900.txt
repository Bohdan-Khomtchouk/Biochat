TITLE
Gene Regulation by microRNA-16 forced expression in ErbB-2 positive murine breast cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miR-16 is a potent tumor suppressor in ErbB-2 positive breast cancer. The primary objetive of this study was to identify previously uncharacterized putative mRNA targets of miR-16 in ErbB-2 postitive breast cancer cells. To achieve our objective we studied the effects of exogenously expressed miR-16 on the gene expression profile of primary cultures of ErbB-2 positive murine breast cancer tumors. The C4HD tumor line displays high levels of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, overexpresses ErbB-2 and ErbB-3, exhibits low ErbB-4 levels, and lacks EGF-R expression.

DESIGN
Primary cultures of the C4HD murine breast tumor were transfected with a miR-16 precursor (pre-miR-16) or a scrambled sequence (pre-miR-Control) that does not form any known mammalian miRNA. Three biological replicates were obtained for each experimental condition.
