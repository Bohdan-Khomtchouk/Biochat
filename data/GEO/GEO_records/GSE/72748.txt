TITLE
Transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a Guillain-Barre Syndrome patient and her healthy twin sampled at three different points of the disease evolution

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated peripheral neuropathy that debilitates the voluntary and autonomous response of the patient. In this study the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a GBS patient and her healthy twin were compared to discover possible correlates of disease progression and recovery.

DESIGN
Blood samples were collected simultaneously from the Guillain-Barré patient (A) and from her control healthy twin (B) at three different time points during disease progression from hospitalization in the intensive care unit (T1), passing to intermediate care (T2),  and at conclusion of locomotion rehabilitation program when the patient was close to abandon the hospital (T3).
