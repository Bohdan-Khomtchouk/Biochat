TITLE
Response of gcr1 null mutant to glucose

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
This experiment was done to detect the transcriptomic defects in the gcr1 null mutant, relative to an isogenic wild type, in the immediate response to glucose. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Both gcr1 mutant and wild type cells were grown in YEP containing 3% pyruvate to early/mid log phase. The 0min sample was taken just prior to glucose addition. After addition of glucose, samples were taken at 20min and 60min. Total RNA was extracted for both strains and expression was measured by competitive hybridization of the mutant and wild type labeled cRNA for each time point.
