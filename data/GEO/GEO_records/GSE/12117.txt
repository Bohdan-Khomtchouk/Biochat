TITLE
Role of inherent strain differences in prenatally induced differential metabolic syndrome phenotype and gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
There is much evidence suggesting that gene-environment interactions underlying the developmental origins of the metabolic syndrome. Previously, we have induced a metabolic syndrome phenotype in mice though prenatal undernutrition; however, the C57BL/6J strain exhibited significantly more metrics of the metabolic syndrome than the A/J strain. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the strain differences in the prenatal induction of the adult development of the metabolic syndrome. We focused on liver function and gene expression because of it's centrol role in many aspects of the metabolic syndrome including glucose and lipid control. Keywords: disease state analysis between mouse strains
