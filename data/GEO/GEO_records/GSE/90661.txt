TITLE
ChIP-Seq of Ndt80-Myc in S. cerevisiae during meiosis and sporulation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to identify the genes bound by Ndt80 in S. cerevisiae during meiosis and sporulation.  Ndt80 was tagged with c-myc and the protein was immunoprecipitated with a c-myc antibody.  Cells were grown in liquid YPA (2% Peptone, 2% Potassium Acetate, 1% Yeast Extract) at room temperature for 22 hours.  Each experiment was repeated twice and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000.

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae Ndt80-myc vs. untagged control with two technical replicates for each
