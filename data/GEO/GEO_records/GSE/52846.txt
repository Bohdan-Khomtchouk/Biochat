TITLE
Expression data from human glioma cancer stem cell (CSC) specimens following knockdown of GREM1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CSCs differentially secrete the BMP antagonist Gremlin1 compared to non-stem glioma populations.  Knockdown of Gremlin1 decreases CSC proliferation and tumorigenicity, establishing Gremlin1 as an essential effector for CSC maintenance. We used a microarray to determine the gene expression programs that are activated downstream of Gremlin1 that might be responsible for CSC maintenance.

DESIGN
Glioma CSC cultures from two distinct patient-derived specimens (528 and 3691) were transduced with lentivirus expressing non-targeting scrambled shRNA or one of two distinct Gremlin1 shRNAs (shGrem1_485 and shGrem1_2456) for 72 hours (total of six samples).  RNA was extracted for array hybridization.
