TITLE
Defective K-Ras Oncoproteins Initiate Cancer In Vivo and Evolve to Overcome Impaired Effector Binding

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The oncogenic proteins expressed in human cancer cells are exceedingly difficult targets for drug discovery due to intrinsic properties of the Ras GTPase switch. As a result, recent efforts have largely focused on inhibiting Ras-regulated kinase effector cascades, particularly the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3 kinase/Akt/mTOR pathways. We constructed murine stem cell leukemia virus (MSCV) vectors encoding oncogenic K-RasD12 with additional “second site” amino acid substitutions that that impair PI3 kinase/Akt or Raf/MEK/ERK activation and performed bone marrow transduction/transplantation experiments in mice. In spite of attenuated signaling properties, defective K-Ras oncoproteins induced aggressive clonal T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). These leukemias exhibited a high frequency of somatic Notch1 mutations, which is also true of human T-ALL. Multiple independent T-ALLs restored full oncogenic Ras activity by acquiring “third site” mutations within the viral KrasD12 transgenes. Other leukemias with undetectable PTEN and elevated phosphoryated Akt levels showed a similar gene expression profile to human early T progenitor (ETP) T-ALL.  Expressing oncoproteins that are defective for specific functions is a general strategy for assessing requirements for tumor maintenance and uncovering potential mechanisms of drug resistance in vivo. In addition, our observation that defective Kras oncogenes regain potent cancer initiating activity strongly supports simultaneously targeting distinct components of Ras signaling networks in the substantial fraction of cancers with RAS mutations.

DESIGN
WT Balb/c mice were lethally irradiated and transplanted with WT Balb/c bone marrow cells transduced with MSCV-IRES-Kras mutant-GFP vectors.  Mice developed T-cell lymphoproliferative disease.
