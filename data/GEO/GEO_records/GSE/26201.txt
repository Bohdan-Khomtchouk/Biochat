SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_3154 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Jason Lieb. For full list of modENCODE projects, see Project Goal: To complement our extensive ChIP-chip characterization of chromosomal regulators in C. elegans, in select experiments we also isolate total RNA from parallel cultures of staged animals.  Labeled cDNA will be prepared and used to probe either gene-specific microarrays, or genomic tiling microarrays to assess the transcriptional state of genomic sequences flanking the protein-binding regions localized by ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq.  To investigate possible correlations between putative regulatory proteins and transcription state, data from such experiments (i.e., protein binding sites and steady-state mRNA levels) will be integrated during downstream analysis.
