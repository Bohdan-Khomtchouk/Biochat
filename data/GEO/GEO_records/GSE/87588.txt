TITLE
Restoring miR-150-5p to an estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cell line [ZR-75-1]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of these experiments is to identify novel direct and indirect targets of miR-150-5p in breast cancer cell lines. The goal is that these will give direction as to what targets or pathways may be contributing to the reduced growth observed in these cell lines upon restoration of miR-150-5p. A therapy directed towards one or more critical subtype-specific targets could be developed as a therapeutic for breast cancer patients. Using has-miR-150-5p mirVana miRNA mimic (Ambion, 4464066), miR-150-5p was restored to an estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cell line, ZR-75-1.

DESIGN
Cells were transfected in triplicate for 48 hours with either mock, negative control, or mimic, and RNA isolated from each sample was hybridized onto Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Human Gene Array 2.0 ST ( probesets).
