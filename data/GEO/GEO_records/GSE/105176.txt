TITLE
ERRBS dataWT and TET2cKOgp33+ CD8+ T cells isolated on D8 LCMV-Armstrong infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The epigenetic modifier TET2 plays a role in cell fate decisions in hematopeotic stem cells and CD4+ Th1 and Th17 differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that loss of TET2 promotes CD8+ memory differentiation following acute viral infection with LCMV-Armstrong.

DESIGN
To identify methylation changes in WT versus TET2-deficiency gp33+ CD8+ T cells, we sorted gp33+CD44+CD8+ T cells from WT and TET2fl/flCD4Cre+ mice on day 8 of LCMV-Armstrong infection

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
