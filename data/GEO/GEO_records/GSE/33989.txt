TITLE
Expression data from  third instar Drosophila larvae offspring from maternal control or high-sucrose fed diets

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Maternal obesity and diabetes is associated with increased risk of obesity and diabetes in offspring.  We generated a model of maternal caloric excess in Drosophila and noted altered body composition in offspring from females fed a high-sucrose diet. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying this response, we profiled gene expression in mid-third instar larvae (mid-L3) offspring from either control or high-sucrose fed females.  All offspring were raised on control food. We used microarrays to detail the response of Drosophila larvae to maternal high calorie diet

DESIGN
Virgin female w1118 flies were fed control (0.15M) or high (1M) sucrose food for 7 days, mated with male w1118 flies such that all embryos were laid on control food.    Mid-L3 larvae were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  Mid-L3 were selected as L2, aged overnight until early L3, then transferred to fresh control food for 12 more hours before selection.
