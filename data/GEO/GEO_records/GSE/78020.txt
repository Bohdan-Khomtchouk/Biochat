TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and Human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify leukocyte adhesion receptors which differentially regulate recruitment in human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells compared to a protoptypic venular endothelium

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in four groups Group 1: cultured human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSEC) Group 2: cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) Group3: Interferon gamma and tumour necrosisfactor alpha treated HSEC and Group 4: Interferon gamma and tumour necrosisfactor alpha treated HUVEC. Two replicates were used for each group.
