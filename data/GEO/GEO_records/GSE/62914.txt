TITLE
Efficient generation of stable chondrocytes from human iPSC through early induction of a pre-chondrogenic population

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Regeneration of human cartilage is inherently inefficient; an abundant autologous source like human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) is therefore attractive for engineering cartilage. Here, we report a defined growth factor based protocol for differentiating hiPSC into articular-like chondrocytes within two weeks with a high efficiency. The hiPSC-derived chondrocytes (hiChondrocytes) are stable and comparable to adult articular chondrocytes in global gene expression, extracellular matrix production and in their ability to generate cartilage tissue in vitro and in immune-deficient mice. Molecular characterization identified an early Sox9lowCD44lowCD140low pre-chondrogenic mesodermal population during hiPSC differentiation that eventually generates a homogenous population of Sox9highCD44highCD140high hiChondrocytes. Additionally, global gene expression analyses revealed two distinct Sox9-regulated gene networks in the Sox9low and Sox9high populations providing novel molecular insights into chondrogenic fate commitment and differentiation. Our findings present a favorable method for generation of hiPSC-derived articular chondrocytes in terms of safety and efficiency.

DESIGN
10 samples were analysed (duplicate sets of 5 time points) to assess changing gene expression over the course of differentiation from iPSC to hiChondrocyte. All samples were compared relative to the undifferentiated iPSC. Adult chondrocytes (2 samples) were also included for comparison. We analyzed the changes in gene expression with differentiation; genes with a fold-change ≥ or ≤1.5, with a difference in intensity of > 100 and within the lower 90% confidence bound were selected.
