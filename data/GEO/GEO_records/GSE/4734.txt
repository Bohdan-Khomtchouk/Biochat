TITLE
Mouse brain region gene expression (430 2.0 Array)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression patterns were determined from five brain regions (bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hippocampus, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, and pituitary gland) in six mouse strains (129S6/SvEvTac, A/J, C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ, DBA/2J, and FVB/NJ). At least two replicate samples per brain region/strain were analyzed using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays. Keywords: mouse strain and brain region comparison

DESIGN
six mouse strains and five brain regions were analyzed
