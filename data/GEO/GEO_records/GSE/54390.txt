TITLE
mRNA profiling of GGT-HIF1aM3 (γ-HIF1αM3, TRACK) kidney cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The complete transcriptomes of kidney cortex from 3 TRACK/γ-HIF1αM3 ~15 month old TG+ male mice and 3 age matched TG- C57BL/6 male mice were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 Sequencer.

DESIGN
Examination of complete transcriptome of kidney cortex between TRACK/γ-HIF1αM3 TG+ male mice and TG- C57BL/6 male mice

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
