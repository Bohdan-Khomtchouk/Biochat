TITLE
The role of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in hypoxic and M2-polarized macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Macrophages (MФ) skewn towards a regulatory-like phenotype are known to promote tumor progression. They tend to accumulate in hypoxic tumor areas and activate hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1 and HIF-2). HIFs are known to alter the gene expression profile of MФ. To define direct HIF-1 and HIF-2 target genes in hypoxic and IL-10 treated human MФ we used chromatin immuno-precipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) and microarray analysis on a genome-wide scale.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of HIF1a and HIF2a in human macrophages under hypoxic and normoxic conditions with and without Interleukin-10 treatment

PLATFORM
GPL9052 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Homo sapiens)
