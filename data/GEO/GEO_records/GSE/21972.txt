TITLE
Mock or KSHV cells (BJABJ, BCBL, TIME and HUVEC) vs common reference (mixture of RNA from both infected and uninfected cells)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of latently infected cells using a custom tiling microarray HUVEC and TIME cells were infected BCBL-1-derived KSHV. Mock infected HUVEC and TIME cells served as controls for each of these two stably infected cells, respectively. BJAB cells served as uninfected controls for the BCBL-1 cells. KSHV-infected cells are induced to enter lytic cycle with valproate or Adenovirus-RTA. Cells were harvested at indicated time points and analyzed.

DESIGN
Three condition experiment: mock infected, latently infected cells and lytically infected. Three cell types (BJAB cells served as uninfected controls for the BCBL-1 cells).
