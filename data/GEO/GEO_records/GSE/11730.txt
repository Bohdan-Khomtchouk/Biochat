TITLE
mRNAs in un-injured and injured rat cortical axons isolated after 13 days in culture

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Efficient growth cone regeneration requires protein synthesis in the adult mammalian brain and spinal cord.  Recent evidence suggests that the local availability of protein synthesis machinery in adult mammalian axons may be an indicator of their regenerative capacity.  Here we investigated the local protein synthesis capacity in matured cortical axons, which have poor regenerative capacity, yet are critical for recovery following injury due to traumatic brain injury and stroke.  This work is the first to biochemically isolate and identify mRNA from mammalian cortical axons, making use of a unique microfluidic platform to isolate axons free of other cellular debris.  We first sought to identify mRNA in na√Øve axons that makes up the pool of mRNA available for translation initiated following axotomy.  Next, we investigated changes in the mRNA population localized to axons 2 days following axotomy and growth cone regeneration. Keywords: axonal expression analysis; injury state analysis

DESIGN
Cortical axons were harvested using the compartmentalized microfluidic platform after 13 days in culture at a time when they express mature synaptic proteins.  A total of 7 Genechips were used for the uninjured cortical axons from 3 different culture batches.  3 Genechips were used for neurons isolated from the neuronal compartment of the microfluidic platfrom.  The neuronal Genechip were used to compare mRNA populations with axonal Genechips and for quality control purposes.  3 Genechips were used for regenerating axons; for these, axons were axotomized at 11 days in culture, then allowed to regrow for 2 days before harvesting.
