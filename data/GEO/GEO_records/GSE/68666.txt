TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of zebrafish embryos developmentally exposed to oxygenated PAHs 1,9-benz-10-anthrone and benzanthracene-7,12-dione

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to identify transcripts differentially expressed in zebrafish embryos exposed to two oxygenated PAHs, 1,9-benz-10-anthrone and benzanthracene-7,12-dione, which cause abnormal development.

DESIGN
We used RNA-seq (Illumina HiSeq) to identify mRNA profiles of whole zebrafish embryos exposed to 10 Î¼M 1,9-benz-10-anthrone, benzanthracene-7,12-dione or vehicle control (1% DMSO) from 6-48 hours post fertilization
