TITLE
An analysis of the effect of the long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist, indacaterol, on gene expression changes in the BEAS-2B human airway epithelial cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed on RNA from BEAS-2B cells treated with indacaterol to identify differentially expressed genes that may contribute to the beneficial and deleterious effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist in asthma.

DESIGN
Confluent BEAS-2B cells were treated with vehicle or indacaterol (10nM) for 1h, 2h, 6h or 18h. Total RNA was extracted, quantified (NanoDrop 2000) and the quality of each sample determined by using the Agilent 2100 Lab-on-a-Chip system before being processed for gene expression chnages by Expression Analysis Inc (Dunham, NC, USA).
