TITLE
RNA-Seq Analysis in hES/ iPS cell-derived neuronal samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We characterized the gene expression by Hierarchical Clustering and one-matrix clustering in hESC, day 12 progenitors, day 25-day 27, day82 differentiated hypothalamic neurons from hESCs and day 45 neurons derived from iPSCs generated from controls (2 independent) and BBS (Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, 3 independent) subjects.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from cells of 13 samples (1 hESC, triplicate for day 12 progenitors, 1 day 25 neuron sample, duplicate for day 27 neuron samples, 1 day 82 neuron sample, five day 45 neuron samples made from 5 independent iPSC lines ) using RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN). Quality control of the RNA was carried out with the Agilent Bio-analyzer, Qubit 2.0 at the MPSR of Columbia University. 100 ng of RNA with RIN â‰¥ 9 were used for generating mRNA-focused libraries using TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 and sequencing on an Illumina 2000/2500 V3 Instrument offered by the Columbia Genome Center.
