TITLE
Effects of 20 months Dietary Methionine Restriction on Gene Expression in inguinal white adipose tissue of Fischer 344 Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Dietary methionine restriction (MR)  has been shown to increase lifespan and decrease adiposity in rodents. This study was designed to examine the transcriptional effects of MR in metabolically relevant tissues. This experiment contains data from the inguinal white adipose tissue (IWAT).

DESIGN
We analyzed MR-induced changes in gene expression using pooled RNA from IWAT of rats fed either a control purified amino acid diet (DL-methionine content of 0.86%) (CON) or a methionine-restricted diet (DL-methionine content of 0.172%)(MR). Rats were fed Purina rodent diet 5001 until 32 days of age and were then randomly assigned to be fed CON diet or MR diet  for 20 months.
