TITLE
The role of ER stress transducer ATF6 in the long bone growth

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the non-canocical role of ATF6α and ATF6β in the long bone growth plate, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform.

DESIGN
Total RNA from growth plate in the tibia of 4-weeks aged mice was extracted using laser microdissector.

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
