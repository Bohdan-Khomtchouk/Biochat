TITLE
Global lncRNA/mRNA expression analysis of colorectal tumor and non-tumor samples from 6 colorectal cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Given the role of lncRNAs and mRNAs in tumor pathogenesis, we set out to identify transcripts that potentially drive colorectal tumorigenesis. To do this, we performed microarray analysis on matched colorectal tumor and non-tumor samples from 6 colorectal cancer patients, and determined their lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles with Agilent microarrays (Arraystar Human LncRNA Array v3.0).

DESIGN
Fresh colorectal tumor samples and matched non-tumor samples (obtained from unaffected colorectal at least 5 cm from the tumor) from 6 colorectal cancer patients were selected randomly for microarray analysis.
