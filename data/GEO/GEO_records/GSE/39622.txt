TITLE
Gene expression profiles for Endotropin-transgenic mice in the background of MMTV-PyMT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of endotrophin-induced tumor progression at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that endotrophin contributes to tumor growth and metastasis. Results provide important information of the response of endotrophin, such as specific immune response, cell cycle regulation and EMT related genes, up- or down-regulated.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from tumor tissues of 12-week-old PyMT/Endotrophin and PyMT mice.
