TITLE
BATSeq of ESC-FCS/ESC-2i/NSC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single-cell polyadenylation site quantification

DESIGN
48 single cells each of murine embryonic stem cells maintained in FCS+LIF medium ( " ESC " ), embryonic stem cells maintained in serum free, 2i containing medium ( " 2i " ) and neural stem cells ( " NSC " ) were sequenced by BATSeq, a single cell transcriptomic protocol for mapping polyadenylation sites in single cells.
