TITLE
hMTR4 plays a central role in creating balanced nuclear RNA pools for degradation and export V

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine whether the competition between hMTR4 with AlyREF is important for the specific exosome recruitment,we sequenced the RNAs associating with hMTR4 in control and AlyREF overexpression cells.

DESIGN
hMTR4 associated  RNAs isolated from control or AlyREF overexpression HeLa cells were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq X Ten.
