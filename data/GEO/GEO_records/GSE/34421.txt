TITLE
Expression data from Hh signaling-deficient OP9 stromal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the bone marrow B cell development occurs in initimate and essential association with stromal cells.  Known effects of stromal cells on B cell development have been shown to be mediated through direct contact and by soluble factors produced by stromal cells. Our findings suggest that cell-nonautonomous Hh signaling may play an important role in B cell lymphopoiesis.  We therefore interrogated OP9 stromal cells for Hh-dependent transcripts that may confer B lymphopoietic identity.

DESIGN
We generated OP9 stromal cells deficient in Hh signaling through targeting the non-redundant, pathway-obligate GPCR Smoothened.  OP9 cells were transduced with RNAi pLKO.1-Puro lentiviral particles expressing a scrambled control shRNA (NT) or shRNA targeting Smoothened (Smo-kd).  RNA from stable NT and Smo-kd OP9 cells were isolated in triplicate and global changes in transcripts were analyzed using the Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST gene chip.
