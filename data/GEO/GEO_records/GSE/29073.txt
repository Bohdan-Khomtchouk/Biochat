TITLE
Cellular reprogramming by the conjoint action of ERalpha, FOXA1 and GATA3 to a ligand-inducible growth state

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite the role of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) pathway as a key growth driver for breast cells, the phenotypic consequence of exogenous introduction of ERalpha into ERalpha-negative cells paradoxically has been growth inhibition. We map the binding profiles of ERalpha and its interacting transcription factors (TFs), FOXA1 and GATA3, in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. We observe that these three TFs form a functional enhanceosome and cooperatively modulate the transcriptional networks previously ascribed to ERalpha alone. We demonstrate that these enhanceosome-occupied sites are associated with optimal enhancer characteristics with highest p300 coactivator recruitment, RNA Pol II occupancy, and chromatin opening. The enhancesome binding sites appear to regulate the genes driving core ERalpha function. Most importantly, we show that transfection of all three TFs was necessary to reprogram the ERalpha-negative MDA-MB-231 and BT-459 cells to restore the estrogen responsive growth and to transcriptionally resemble the estrogen-treated ERalpha-positive MCF-7 cells. Cumulatively, these results suggest that all of the enhanceosome components comprising ERalpha, FOXA1 and GATA3 are necessary for the full repertoire of the cancer-associated effects of the ERalpha.

DESIGN
The analysis of ERalpha, FOXA1, and GATA3 in MCF-7 cancer cells was done by ChIP-seq data obtained either with estradiol (E2) stimulation or without stimulation using vehicle as a control. Using the ERalpha bindings defined by ChIP-seq (GSE23893), FOXA1 bindings (GSE26831), and GATA3 bindings (this Series), we analyzed the enhanceosome effect of the overlapped binding sites from ERalpha, FOXA1 and GATA3.
