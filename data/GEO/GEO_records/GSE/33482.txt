TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of Cisplatin Resistance in Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the signaling networks that are dysregulated in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, gene expression data were obtained from, and compared between, the ovarian cancer cell line, A2780, and its cisplatin-resistant derivative, A2780cis.

DESIGN
Gene expression data from a cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer cell line (A2780) were collected and compared to gene expression data from a cisplatin-resistant cell line (A2780cis). 6 independent experiments were completed for both the sensitive and resistant cell lines.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
