TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Mtb H37Rv and MtbΔwhiB4 on treatment to 10X Augmentin (AG) i.e. combination of 100 µg/ml of Amoxicillin and 8 µg/ml of Clavulanate and lower Augmentin doses at 1X and 5X

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Amox-Clav combination downregulates the expression of WhiB4. Further, MtbΔwhiB4 survives better upon treatment with this combination. Therefore, to study the role of WhiB4 in regulating the response of Mtb to this combination, we carried out global transcriptome profiling of Wt Mtb and MtbΔwhiB4 strains after treatment.

DESIGN
Mtb H37Rv and MtbΔwhiB4 were grown till early log phase and treated with 10X Augmentin at 100 µg/ml of Amoxicillin and 8 µg/ml of Clavulanate for 6 h at 37 degree at 150rpm. Wildtype Mtb H37Rv were treated with  1X Augmentin (10 µg/ml of Amoxicillin and 8 µg/ml of Clavulanate), or 5X Augmentin (50 µg/ml of Amoxicillin and 8 µg/ml of Clavulanate) for 6 or 12 h at 37 degree at 150rpm. Experiments were done in duplicate, triplicate, tetraplicate or pentaplicate.
