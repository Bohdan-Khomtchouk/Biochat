TITLE
MicroRNA-497~195 cluster regulates angiogenesis during coupling with osteogenesis via maintaining endothelial Notch and HIF-1Î± activity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recently a specific vessel subtype in bone, strongly positive for CD31 and endomucin (CD31hiEmcnhi), is identified as coupling angiogenesis and osteogenesis. To figure out underlying mechanism of type H vessels generation, we isolated CD31hiEmcnhi and CD31loEmcnlo endothelial cells from one months old mice and perfermed microarrays to detail the microRNA expression. we identified that the miR-497~195 cluster was strongly expressed in CD31hiEmcnhi endothelial cells.

DESIGN
CD31hiEmcnhi and CD31loEmcnlo endothelial cells (type H and type L ECs) isolated from one months old mice were cultured with endothelial cell growth medium for RNA extraction and hybridization on Agilent Mouse miRNA Microarray.
