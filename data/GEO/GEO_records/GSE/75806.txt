TITLE
miRNA expression data from neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) silenced for KChIP2

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Loss of KChIP2 during cardiac stress has been suggested to have a transcriptional impact on cardiac ion channels through altered miRNA activity, contributing to maladaptive electrical remodeling. Therefore, we tested the consequence of KChIP2 loss, in the absence of cardiac stress, by treating cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with siRNA for KChIP2 and subsequently performed miRNA microarray analysis to identify up-regulation of potential miRNA targets.

DESIGN
NRVMs were isolated from the hearts of neonatal (day 1-2) Sprague Dawley rats. They were subsequently plated and cultured for 24-36 hrs then treated with either a control or KChIP2 siRNA. Cells were left in culture for an additional 72 hrs following siRNA delivery, after which they were collected for total RNA.
