TITLE
Genome-wide maps of AGO1-bound small RNA in Arabidopsis leaves

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report flg22 regulate the accumulation of AGO1-bound small RNA in arabidopsis. We find that a number of miRNAs are up- or down-regulated by flg22, a well-studied PAMP.

DESIGN
Examination of AGO1-bound small RNAs with or without flg22 treatment.
