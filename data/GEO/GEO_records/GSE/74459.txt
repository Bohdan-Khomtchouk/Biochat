TITLE
Translation State Array Assay for C elegans IFE-1-dependent mRNAs

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Relative polysomal loading changes for wild type (N2) versus ife-1(bn127) C. elegans strains Strain ife-1(bn127) is null for the gene encoding one of five eIF4E isoforms in the worm, IFE-1.  Only this isoform associates with P granules.

DESIGN
Resolution of translating and non-translating mRNAs from WT and mutant worms on 10-45% sucrose gradients. Comparision was by ratios of polysomal content. Please note that each sample data table contains raw signal directly imported from the Affymetrix files and  the ratio of signals, P/(NP+P), and fold-changes were further calculated. The TSAA_overview.xls contains more datails about the TSAA procedure and 'complete_data.xlsx' contains complete TSAA data output.
