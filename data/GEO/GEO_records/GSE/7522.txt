TITLE
Characterization of the transcriptome of the low oil 1 (loo1) mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles in 15 day old low oil 1 (loo1) mutant and the wild type A15 seedlings were compared. Keywords: Comparison and loo1 and wild type seedling transcriptomes

DESIGN
The loo1 mutant and the wild type seedlings transcriptomes were compared using 70-mer oligoarrays. Two experimental repeats were conducted, each with two dye-swap hybridizations.
