TITLE
Expression data from MCF10A cells subject to EGF stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF10A cells derived from spontaneously immortalized normal human mammary epithel were subjected to EGF/SERUM stimulation for 0,20,40,60,120,240 and 480 minutes. We used microarrays to understand the temporal regulation of the cellular EGFR cascade. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
MCF10A cells were grown in DME:F12 medium supplemented with antibiotics, [10 mg/ml insulin, 0.1 mg/ml cholera toxin, 0.5 mg/ml hydrocortisone, heat-inactivated horse serum (5%); defined as 'serum' in the text] and 10ng/ml EGF. Cells were serum deprived for 24 hours. Following stimulation with EGF/SERUM for 0,20,40,60,120,240 and 480 minutes.
