TITLE
Expression changes during Candida albicans biofilm formation

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
The planktonic versus biofilm gene expression arrays were performed in a/alpha cell types. Gene expression arrays were performed on planktonic vs biofilm cells grown in Spider medium at 37C. Normalized data is reported in matrix.

DESIGN
Biofilm strains (48 hour biofilms) were compared to planktonic strains (log phase planktonic cells) in Spider medium at 37C.
