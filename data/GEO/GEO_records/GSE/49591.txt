TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of dexamethasone treated substrates in HeLa cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of dexamethasone treated substrates during 3 hr in HeLa cell.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HeLa cells with treatement of dexamethasone during 3hr. The up- or down-regulated transcripts were compare to control (DMSO) treated HeLa cell RNA extract. Significant transcripts were confirmed by replication
