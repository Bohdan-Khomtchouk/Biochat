TITLE
Whole blood response of Pigs to infection with Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Porcine reproductive and respiratory disease (PRRS) is the most important disease in swine industry worldwide. However, strategies such as vaccination and good biosecurity are not consistently successful to eliminate PRRSV. Although some gene expression pathways have been explored recently, host molecular pathways blocked by PRRSV and the protective immune response expressed in pigs resistant to PRRSV are largely unknown. In order to answer these questions, we herein characterize changes in blood gene expression in pigs responding differentially to infection  with a well characterized type 2 (North American) PRRSV isolate. Samples are those collected through the PRRS Host Genetics Consortium (PHGC). Samples were those from Tempus tube collected blood of PHGC pigs selected from four response groups according to their serum viral load (0-21 days post infection) and weight gain (0-42 dpi) and characterized as low vs. high viral load and low vs high weight gain .

DESIGN
block reference design was used to accommodate samples from 4 treatment groups.
