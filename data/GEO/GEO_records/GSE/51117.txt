TITLE
Genome wide ChIP-Seq profiles of p300 and CBP in control and cells expressing HSP70K71E

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There were more enriched p300 and CBP bindings at the promoter regions in the cells expresing HSP70K71E compared to the control

DESIGN
HEK293 cells were overexpressed with pCI1-EGFP (control) and with HSP70K71E-EGFP (mutant) and appied for ChIP-Seq.

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
