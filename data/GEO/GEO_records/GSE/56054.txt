TITLE
CGH of stages 10B and 13 amplifying follicle cells to determine the effect SuUR has on replication fork progression

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Comparative genomic hybridization was performed to compare amplificaiton gradients in genomic DNA derived from stage 13 egg chambers of wild-type, suppressor of under-replication (SuUR) mutant and SuUR overexpression, compared with 0-2hr diploid embryo gDNA. Comparative genomic hybridization was performed to compare amplificaiton gradients in genomic DNA derived from stage 10B egg chambers of wild-type, compared with 0-2hr diploid embryo gDNA.

DESIGN
CGH of stage 13 egg chambers relative to diploid early embryonic samples for four different Drosophila strains CGH of stage 10B egg chambers relative to diploid early embryonic samples for the wild type Oregon R Drosophila strain
