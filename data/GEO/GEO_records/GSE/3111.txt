TITLE
Comprehensive description of the transcriptome of PVN in euhydrated and dehydrated rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei  are important integrative structures that regulate co-ordinated  responses to perturbations in cardiovascular homeostasis. Through  descending projections from parvocellular neurons to the brainstem,  the PVN acts as an autonomic 'premotor nucleus', regulating reflex  changes in sympathetic nerve activity that are involved in blood  pressure and blood volume regulation. Endocrine responses are  mediated through axonal projections from SON and PVN magnocellular  neurons (MCNs) to the capillaries of the posterior pituitary neural  lobe. In response to dehydration, a massive release of the  antidiuretic peptide hormone vasopressin (VP) into the circulation is  accompanied by a dramatic functional remodelling of the HNS. We have  used microarrays to comprehensively catalogue the genes expressed in  the PVN, the SON and the neurointermediate lobe (NIL) of the  pituitary gland. Further, we have identified transcripts that are  regulated as a consequence of dehydration, as well as RNAs that are  enriched in either the PVN or the SON. We suggest that these  differentially expressed genes represent candidate regulators and  effectors of HNS activity and remodelling. Keywords: DEHYDRATION, PVN

DESIGN
In total, 10 Affymetrix Genechip Rat Genome 230 2.0 were used. The experiment compared hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus from 3 day dehydrated and control male Sprague Dawley rats (10-12 weeks). For each chip, tissue from 5 animals was pooled prior to extraction of total RNA and in total 5 chips were used for each condition using  independently prepared RNA samples from separate groups of animals.
