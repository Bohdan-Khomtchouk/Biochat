TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state of Smyd2 binding in renal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify potential transcriptional targets of Smyd2, we performed ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis in renal epithelial cells with an anti-Smyd2 antibody. We identified 91 potential Smyd2 target genes in Pkd1 wild type MEK cells and 116 potential Smyd2 target genes in Pkd1 null MEK cells. There were 14 genes identified in both Pkd1 wild type and null MEK cells. Thus, the number of potential Smyd2 target genes in Pkd1 null MEK cells are 116 - 14 = 102 genes

DESIGN
Examination of  Smyd2 transcriptional target genes in 2 cell types.
