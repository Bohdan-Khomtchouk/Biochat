TITLE
Allergic response to ragweed in lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An important feature of human asthma and animal models of asthma is airway hyperresponsiveness. The symptoms of asthma are a narrowing of the airways caused by edema and the influx of inflammatory cells. The aim of this project is to determine the temporal relationship between gene expression and airway allergen challenge. 4 weeks old BALB/CJ mice were challenged on days 0,3,10 and 17 with PBS and ragweed pollen protein plus Alum. Keywords: time series, allergen
