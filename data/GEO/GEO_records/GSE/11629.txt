TITLE
Gene expression profiles of four murine tumors after carbon-ion (C-ion) or gamma irradiation.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study uses microarray analysis to examine the fate of multiple C-ion-irradiated tumors in vivo to gain a comprehensive overview of the changes in gene expression induced by C-ion irradiation. Four murine tumors were irradiated in vivo with C-ions at a single dose, and gamma-rays were used as a reference beam. Keywords: mouse squamous cell carcinoma and fibrosarcoma,  carbon ion-irradiation, gamma-irradiation, resected sample, transplanted tissues

DESIGN
We examined gene expression changes after carbon-ion (C-ion) irradiation (290 MeV/m, SOBP 6 cm middle, 50 kev/mm) with a single dose of 30 Gy in four mouse tumors (NR-S1, SCCVII, NFSa and #8520) transplanted into the hind legs of C3H/HeNrs mice, using 44K single-color oligomicroarrays at 6 hours, 1 day and 3 days after irradiation. Gamma rays of 30 Gy and 50 Gy were used as a reference beam.
