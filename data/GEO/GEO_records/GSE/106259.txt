TITLE
The HIV co-receptor CCR5, regulates the cellular architecture of osteoclast

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is a co-receptor of HIV. Its ligand, CCL5 significantly augmented the number of wild-type osteoclasts but not Ccr5-deficient cells, indicating that CCL5 enhanced RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis through CCR5. To investigate the changes in the transcriptional signatures induced by CCL5 in osteoclastogenesis, cultured osteoclasts at pOC stages were incubated with or without rmCCL5 for 2 days, and then subjected for RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of primary bone marrow macrophages obtained from 7 weeks old C57BL6 mice were treated with recombinant CCL5, in triplicate, using Illumina Miseq.

PLATFORM
