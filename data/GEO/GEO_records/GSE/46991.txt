TITLE
Genome-wide map of p53 binding sites by ChIP-seq in  human lymphoblastoid cell lines  treated with doxorubicin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used chromatin immune-precipitation with parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) technology to identify genome-wide p53 binding in human lymphoblastoid cell lines treated with a DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic reagent doxorubicin.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq analysis of p53 binding sites in human lymphoblastoid cells treated with Doxorubicin or vehicle
