TITLE
Transcriptome profile of human dermal macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DC, monocyte and macrophage networks are evolutionarily conserved but the distinct subsets have been difficult to distinguish due to shared overlapping phenotypic markers between the cells. Using transcriptome microarray profiling of human and mouse mononuclear phagocyte subsets, we have distinguished human dermal DCs from monocyte-derived cells and macrophages.

DESIGN
Gene Expression from total RNA from human dermal macrophages, epidermal LCs and CD14+ cells subsets purified by FACS
