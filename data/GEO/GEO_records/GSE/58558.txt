TITLE
Cyclosporine in patients with atopic dermatitis modulates activated inflammatory pathways and reverses epidermal pathology

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
After 2 and 12 weeks of treatment, we observed significant reductions of 51% and 72%, respectively, in SCORAD scores. Clinical improvements were associated with significant gene expression changes in lesional but also nonlesional skin, particularly reductions in levels of TH2-, TH22-, and some TH17-related molecules (ie, IL-13, IL-22, CCL17, S100As, and elafin/peptidase inhibitor 3), and modulation of epidermal hyperplasia and differentiation measures.

DESIGN
CsA's effects on AD skin pathology were evaluated by using gene expression and immunohistochemistry studies in baseline, week 2, and week 12 lesional and nonlesional biopsy specimens from 19 patients treated with 5 mg/kg/d CsA for 12 weeks.
