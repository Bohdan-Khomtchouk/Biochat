TITLE
Gene expression profiles of adult renal medullary endothelial cells isolated from TIE2-GFP transgenic mice using FACS. (GUDMAP Series ID: 35)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing kidney.  The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in FACS isolated components of the developing kidney. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone.

DESIGN
Tie2  transgenic mice were utilized to isolate the endothelial cells from the adult  kidneys.  Endothelial cells were isolated from the kidney using collagenase treatment and FACS.   RNA was isolated and the gene expression profiles were determined by microarrays.
