TITLE
Single embryo analysis of monozygotic twin blastocysts of the mouse respecting pair associations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Upon 2-cell embryo splitting, individual blastomeres were cultured in KSOM(aa) medium and developed into blastocysts, which were compared and contrasted with each other respecting pair associations (e.g. twin vs cotwin) Transcriptome analysis revelaled minimal differences between twins and unmanipulated controls, in contrast to larger differences between twins and cotwins; these differences are mainly related to the epiblast lineage

DESIGN
Pair association (e.g. twin and cotwin from the same 2-cell embryo) was rigorously observed
