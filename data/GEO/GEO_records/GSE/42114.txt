TITLE
Creation of differentiation-specific genomic maps of human epidermis through laser capture microdissection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to understand the differences between the basal and suprabasal layers of normal human skin epidermis.

DESIGN
Comparison of transcriptomes among basal epidermis, suprabasal epidermis, whole epidermis, and reticular dermis
