TITLE
miRNA profiling of infiltrating glioma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Diffusely infiltrative growth of human astrocytic gliomas is one of the major obstacles to successful tumor therapy. Thorough insights into the miRNAs inolved in regulating glioma cell invasion thus appear of major relevance for the development of novel and advanced therapies. miRNA expression profiling on microdissected human tumor biopsy specimens was performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in invading glioblastoma cells in vivo.

DESIGN
miRNA was extracted from the infiltrative rim (INF) as well as from the central tumor areas (CEN) of 7 patients with malignant glioma. The Micro Fluidic Card System (Applied Biosystems) was used according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol for miRNA expression profiling.
