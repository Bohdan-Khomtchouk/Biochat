TITLE
Moderate hypoxia influence at intermediate altitude in Argentinean Andes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study evaluates genetic and phenotypic variation in the intermediate altitude Calchaquí population living in the Calchaquí Valleys of the Argentinean Andes in the town of Cachi at 2300 m. This study attempts to pinpoint evolutionary mechanisms underlying adaptation to moderate hypoxia at a intermediate altitude.
