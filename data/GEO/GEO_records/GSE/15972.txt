TITLE
Functional analysis of lipid acyl hydrolases in Arabidopsis antimicrobial defense: plp2 Botrytis cinerea

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
af13_plp2 - plp2 botrytis cinerea 2 - Effects of deregulation of a lipid acyl hydrolase gene (PLP2, At2g26560) on global transcriptome upon infection by Botrytis cinerea. This deregulation affects resistance levels against fungal and bacterial pathogens, likely by perturbing the biosynthesis of oxylipins. Oxylipins are fatty acid-derived compounds (example:jasmonic acid) with diverse signaling or antimicrobial properties. - 5000 spores of Botrytis were pipetted on 4 infection sites per ault leaf. Leaf material was harvested at 0 and 2 days later. 3 plant genotypes were used (Col-0 ecotype): siPLP2 (RNAi-silenced),pBIN (empty pBIN-transformed),PLP2OE (PLP2-overexpressors).

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL4346 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.2
