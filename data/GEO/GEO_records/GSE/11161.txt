TITLE
Gene expression profiles of neonatal bladder samples. (GUDMAP Series ID: 19)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing bladder. The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of microdissected tissues and FACS sorted cells plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing urogenital system. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. The data submitted here represents the gene expression profiles of FACS sorted newborn bladder cells and compares two distinct cell populations of smooth muscle cells since both of these populations contain EGFP from a SMGA (Actg2) promoter shown to be expressed only in smooth muscle cells. Gene expression comparison from developing regions of the mouse postnatal day 2 urogenital system.

DESIGN
Bladder cells were FACS sorted from newborn double transgenic mice expressing EGFP under the control of a SMGA promoter and EYFP under the control of a SMAA promoter. Total RNA was isolated and underwent 2-round amplification (EpicentreÂ® Biotechnologies) for gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix MOE430 microarray chip.
