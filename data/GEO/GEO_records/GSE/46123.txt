TITLE
ER and GR crosstalk at the Genomic Level in mouse mammary cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report changes in ER and GR binding profiles genome-wide upon co-treatment with Dex and E2 when compared to Dex or E2 treatments alone.

DESIGN
We examine ER and GR binding under four different treatments (unt, Dex, E2, and Dex + E2).
