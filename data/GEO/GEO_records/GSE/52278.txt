TITLE
MicroRNAs in an Experimental Model of Physiologic Left Ventricular Hypertrophy: a Microarray-based Analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BACKGROUND - MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Transgenic models have proved that a single miR can induce pathological cardiac hypertrophy and failure. The roles of miRs in the genesis of physiologic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), however, are not well elucidated.  OBJECTIVE - To evaluate miRs expression in an experimental model of exercise-induced LVH. METHODS - Male Balb/c mice were divided into sedentary (SED) and exercise (EXE) groups. Voluntary exercise was performed in odometer-monitored metal wheels during 35 days. Analyses were performed after 7 and 35 days of training, and consisted of transthoracic echocardiography, maximal exercise test, miRs microarray (miRBase v.16) and real-time qRT-PCR analysis. RESULTS - Left ventricular weight/body weight ratio increased by 7% in the EXE group at day 7 (p < 0.01) and by 11% at 35 days of training (p < 0.001) After 7 days of training, microarray identified 35 deregulated miRs: 20 had an increase in their expression and 15 were down-regulated (p=0.01). At day 35 of training, 25 miRs were deregulated: 15 were up-regulated and 10 had decreased their expression compared to the SED group (p < 0.01). qRT-PCR confirmed an increase in miR-150 levels at both time points and a decrease in miR-26b, miR-27a and miR-143 after 7 days of voluntary exercise.  CONCLUSIONS â€“ We unraveled new miRs that can modulate physiological cardiac hypertrophy, particularly miR-26b, -150, 27a and -143. Our data also indicate that previously established regulatory gene pathways involved in pathological LVH are not deregulated in physiologic LVH.
