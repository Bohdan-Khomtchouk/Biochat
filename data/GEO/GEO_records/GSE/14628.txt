TITLE
Bifidobacterium longum mutants and resistance to Heat-Shock

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium longum

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Bifidobacterium longum mutants versus wt strain in exponentional phase, with or without heat-shock treatment, and in stationary phase Keywords: Characterization of natural mutants

DESIGN
Two B. longum mutants (NCC2912 and NCC2913) were analysed versus the wt strain NCC2705 in three conditions : exponential phase 37°, exponential phase with 7 min 50° heat shock, stationary phase. Two biologic replicates and 2 technical replicates
