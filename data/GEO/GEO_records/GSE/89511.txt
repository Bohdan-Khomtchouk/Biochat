TITLE
CD86 regulates a pro-survival signal in myeloma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
While multiple myeloma patient prognosis has improved over the past decade, research towards discovery of new therapeutic avenues is important, and could lead to a cure for this chronic plasma cell malignancy. Data analysis from a myeloma patient database shows that the CD28-CD86 signaling module may provide a survival advantage in myeloma cells that negatively impacts patient outcome. Here we show that blocking the CD28-CD86 pathway, by silencing or with CTLA-4-Ig, leads to myeloma cell death. Blockade of this pathway leads to downregulation of nutrient transporters, integrins, and IRF4, a known myeloma survival factor. Our data also indicate that CD86, the canonical " ligand " in this pathway, is mediating a pro-survival signal via the cytosolic domain that has not been previously described. These findings indicate that blockade of this pathway is a promising therapeutic avenue for myeloma, as it leads to modulation of different processes important in cell viability.

DESIGN
The myeloma cell lines MM.1s, RPMI8226, KMS18, and RPMI8226 that overexpresses the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl1 were transfected with short hairpin RNAs targeting CD28, CD86, Gapdh (control), or empty vector (pLK0.1) control and gene expression analysis was performed by RNA-seq.
