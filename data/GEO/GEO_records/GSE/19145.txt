TITLE
Transciptional profile of a M. smegmatis mc2155 ΔsigF strain under standard growth conditions

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis

SUMMARY
Comparing transciptional profile of a M. smegmatis mc2155 ΔsigF strain and wild type (control) in in vitro culture at two time points (exponential phase and stationary phase) for identification of SigF-dependent genes.

DESIGN
Analysis of 2 time points: exponential and stationary phase. 4 biological replicates comparing expression of wild type (control) and ΔsigF strain incl. dye swaps for each time point. 3 technical replicates per array

PLATFORM
GPL5862 JCVI PFGRC Mycobacterium smegmatis 25K v4 array designed primarily based on strain MC2 155
