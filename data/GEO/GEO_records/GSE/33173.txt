TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of the Sox chondrogenic trio at E13.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic mice tagged with EGFP under the control of the endogenous Sox5, Sox6 and Sox9 promoter were used. E13.5 transgenic embryos were enriched for the skeletal elements and FACS was used to isolate the Sox5/6/9-expressing cells which were used for comparative expression profiling between wildtype and knockout.

DESIGN
Total RNA from sorted cells from Sox9 wildtype (3 biological replicates) and Sox9 chimeric knockout (2 biological replicates) embryos were used for comparative analysis. Each genotype had two technical replicates. Sox6 heterozygotes (4 biological replicates) and Sox5-Sox6 double null (2 biological replicates with 2 technical replicates) embryos at E13.5 were used for comparative analysis.
