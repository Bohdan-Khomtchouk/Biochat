TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of histone H3 lysine 27 and lysine 4 trimethylation in multiple myeloma reveals the importance of Polycomb gene targeting and highlights EZH2 as a potential therapeutic target [Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematopoietic malignancy characterised by the accumulation of neoplastic post-germinal centre, isotype-switched, long-lived plasma cell within the bone marrow. In genetic and clinical terms MM is highly heterogeneous and remains fatal. Here we present the first epigenomic map of MM derived from freshly isolated bone marrow plasma cells from four patients. Using ChIP- and RNA-sequencing we define a set of silent H3K27me3 targets, active genes bearing H3K4me3, and bivalent genes.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different histone modifications in four Multiple myeloma patients and two normal plasma cells samples.  A single patient RNA-seq sample was also examined.
