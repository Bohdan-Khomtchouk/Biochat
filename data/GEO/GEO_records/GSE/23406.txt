TITLE
Prdm16 newborn mouse (ventricular zone) VZ cells microarray

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
As Prdm16 deficiency reduces self-renewal potential and depletes neural stem cells in culture we decided to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of the neural stem cells depletion in the Prdm16 deficient animals. For the experiment we used Prdm16Gt(OST67423)Lex (Prdm16LacZ) genetrap mice obtained from the NIH Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center ( ). We compared the gene expression profiles of uncultured ventricular zone cells from newborn Prdm16LacZ/LacZ (KO), Prdm16LacZ/+(HET), and Prdm16+/+ (WT) mice.
