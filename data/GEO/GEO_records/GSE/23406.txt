TITLE
Prdm16 newborn mouse (ventricular zone) VZ cells microarray

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
As Prdm16 deficiency reduces self-renewal potential and depletes neural stem cells in culture we decided to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of the neural stem cells depletion in the Prdm16 deficient animals. For the experiment we used Prdm16Gt(OST67423)Lex (Prdm16LacZ) genetrap mice obtained from the NIH Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center ( http://www.mmrrc.org/ ). We compared the gene expression profiles of uncultured ventricular zone cells from newborn Prdm16LacZ/LacZ (KO), Prdm16LacZ/+(HET), and Prdm16+/+ (WT) mice.

DESIGN
The uncultured ventricular zone cells from newborn Prdm16LacZ/LacZ, Prdm16LacZ/+, and Prdm16+/+ mice were dissected from the brains and placed into the Trizol reagent. Purified RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using the WT-Ovation™ Applause WT/Amp RNA amplification system (NuGEN Technologies,) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Sense strand cDNA was fragmented and labeled using the FL-Ovation™ cDNA Biotin Module V2 (NuGEN). 2.5µg of labeled cDNA were hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 1.0 microarrays.
