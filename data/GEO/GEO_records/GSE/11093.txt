TITLE
EBER2 RNA-induced transcriptome changes identify cellular processes likely targeted during Epstein Barr Virus infection.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about the physiological role of the EBER1 and 2 nuclear RNAs during Epstein Barr viral infection. The cellular transcription response to EBER2 expression using the wild-type and an internal deletion mutant was determined. Significant changes in gene expression patterns were observed. A functional meta-analysis of the regulated genes points to inhibition of stress and immune responses, as well as activation of cellular growth and cytoskeletal reorganization as potential targets for EBER2 RNA. Different functions can be assigned to different parts of the RNA. These results provide new avenues to the understanding of EBER2 and EBV biology. Keywords: Overexpression of non-translated RNA

DESIGN
Biological relicates, 3 conditions: empty expression vector (pUC-18),  pUC-18-EBER2, pUC-18-EBER2-L2
