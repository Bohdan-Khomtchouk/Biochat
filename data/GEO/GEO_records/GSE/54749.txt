TITLE
Inhibition of Hedgehog signaling in human osteoarthritic cartilage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative disease of the joint. Data from our lab indicates that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is activated in human OA and murine models of OA (Lin et al., 2009, Nature Medicine). To identify Hh target genes, microarray analyses were performed to detect changes in gene expression when the Hh pathway was inhibited in human OA cartilage samples. Identifying Hh target genes in chondrocytes will elucidate key regulatory networks that govern chondrocyte homeostasis and provide novel therapeutic strategies for OA.

DESIGN
Articular cartilage from each sample was divided into two groups, one kept as control, one treated with a chemical Hh antagonist. Three biological replicates were used.
