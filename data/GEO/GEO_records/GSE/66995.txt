TITLE
Expression profiling of E. coli expressing the heterologous sigma70 factor (rpoD) of Lactobacillus plantarum

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Time course experiment to analyze transcriptional changes to the E. coli transcriptome due to overexpressing the heterologous sigma70 factor (RpoD) of Lactobacillus plantarum. A plasmid control strain (pControl) and the sigma70 overexpression strain (pLPLσ) were cultivated in parallel and after induction of RpoD expression samples for transcriptional profiling were taken in exponential, transition and stationary phase.

DESIGN
Samples of the control strain (pControl) and the sigma70 factor overexpression (pLPLσ) of L. plantarum were taken over a time course experiment in exponential (t=4.5 hours after induction), transition (t=6 hours) and stationary (t=9 hours) growth phase.  Two slides per time point were hybridized on a dye swap configuration for each of the two biological replicates.
