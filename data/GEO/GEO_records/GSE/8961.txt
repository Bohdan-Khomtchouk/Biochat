TITLE
Identification of human metapneumovirus-induced gene networks in airway epithelial cells by microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment is designed to study the effects to HMPV on A549 over time Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Confluent monolayers of A549 cells were infected with hMPV at MOI of 1 in serum-free media and harvested at 6, 12, 24, 48, or 72 hours post-infection to extract total RNA using RNAqueous®-Midi Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), according to manufacturer’s instruction;3 Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 were used for hybridization.
