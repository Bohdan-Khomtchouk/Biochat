TITLE
Differential gene expression in the proximal neck of human abdominal aortic aneurysm

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to assess the gene expression profile of biopsies obtained from the neck of human AAAs.

DESIGN
Genome-wide expression analysis of AAA neck specimen obtained from 14 patients with AAA (mean maximum aortic diameter=62.6Â±18.0 mm). Relative aortic gene expression was compared with that of 8 control aortic specimen of organ donors.
