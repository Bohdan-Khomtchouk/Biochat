TITLE
Gene expression profiling in psoriatic lesional and non-lesional skin [Set 2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the psoriasis phenotype and pathways involved in psoriasis, we characterized gene expression in lesional and non-lesional skin from psoriasis patients.

DESIGN
From each of the 24 psoriasis patients, we obtained two biopsies, one from a lesion and the other from non-lesional skin in the same general body geography. Total RNA was extracted from 6mm punch biopsies that were split in half. A total of 48 samples were run on Affymetrix HU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays.
