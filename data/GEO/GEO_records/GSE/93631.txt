TITLE
Whole blood transcriptome during acute phase of infecion in avirulent and virulent Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of blood samples taken throughout the acute phase of infection from mice infected with avirulent P. chabaudi AS strain or virulent CB strain The influence of parasite genetic factors on immune responses and development of severe pathology of malaria is largely unknown. In this study, we performed genome-wide transcriptomic profiling of whole blood during blood-stage infections of two strains of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi that differ in virulence. We identified several transcriptomic signatures associated with the virulent infection, including signatures for lung inflammation, stronger and prolonged anemia and platelet aggregation. The latter two signatures were detected prior to pathology. The anemia signature indicated deregulation of host erythropoiesis, and the lung inflammation signature was linked to increased neutrophil infiltration, more cell death and greater parasite sequestration in the lungs. This comparative whole-blood transcriptomics profiling of virulent and avirulent malaria infections shows the validity of this approach to inform severity of malarial infection and provide insight into pathogenic mechanisms.

DESIGN
Blood samples collected from infected C57BL/6 mice via cardiac puncture into Tempus solution at 2, 4, 6, 8, (9), 10, 12 days post infection. Na√Øve samples were collected from age matched mice at the beginning (day 0) and the end (day 12) of the experiment. 3-4 replicates per conditon
