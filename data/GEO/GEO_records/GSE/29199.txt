TITLE
Implication of Nos2 inactivation on genomic changes in Ptch1+/- medulloblastomas (array-CGH)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Ptch1+/-  strain constitues an established mouse model for the Shh-driven type of medulloblastoma. Combined Ptch1+/- Nos2-/- mice show a two-fold increased incidence for this tumor. Here, the impact of Nos2 inactivation on copy number alterations during medulloblastoma development was investigated by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (arrayCGH) of tumor samples from both genotypes.

DESIGN
Medulloblastoma samples from five Ptch1+/- and seven compound Ptch1+/- Nos2-/- mice were analyzed. Cy5-labeled tumor DNA was combined with corresponding Cy3-labeled reference healthy wildtype genomic DNA to receive either sex-matched sample pairs or pairs of different gender for internal negative or positive control.
