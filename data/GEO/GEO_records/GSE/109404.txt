TITLE
Reduced Abd-B Hox function during kidney development results in lineage infidelity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, in order to better understand shared core Hox functions, we examined kidney development in mice with frameshift mutations of multiple Abd-B type Hox genes. The resulting phenotypes included  dramatically reduced branching morphogenesis of the uretreric bud, premature depletion of nephron progenitors and abnormal development of the stromal compartment. Most unexpected, however, we also observed a cellular level lineage infidelity in nephron segments.

DESIGN
E14.5 mouse kidney cells were analyzed using Drop-seq

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
