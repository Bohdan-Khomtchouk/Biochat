TITLE
Factors regulated by interferon gamma and hypoxia-inducible factor 1A contribute to responses that protect mice from Coccidioides immitis infection.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse strains have been identified that are resistant (i.e. DBA/2) or susceptible (i.e. C57BL/6) to infection from pathogenic fungus Coccidioides immitis.  However, the genetic and immunological basis for this difference has not been fully characterized. Microarray technology was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed in lung tissue between resistant DBA/2 and sensitive C57BL/6 mice after infection with C. immitis.

DESIGN
C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice were infected with arthoconidia of C. immitis and RNA was extracted at different days post-infection and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays (MGU74Av2), in order to identify differentially expressed genes between the two strains.
