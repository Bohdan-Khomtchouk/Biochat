TITLE
Low H3K27me3 and DNA hypomethylation define poorly prognostic pediatric posterior fossa ependymomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A subgroup of  Posterior fossa ependymomas show reduced H3K27me3, global DNA hypomethylation, are more invasive, exhibit poor prognosis and epigenetically deregulated genes converge on radial glial factors, suggesting developing cerebellar radial glia as candidate cells-of-origin.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencingwas performed  in 15 posterior fossa (PF) ependymoma samples. 11 samples show low H3K27me3 and designated PF_H3K27me3-ve; 4 samples show high H3K27me3 and designated PF_H3K27me3+ve

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
