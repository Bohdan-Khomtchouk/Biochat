TITLE
Characteristic Transcriptional Profiling of Rhythmic mRNA Expression in the Murine Distal Colon

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify a cohort of rhythmically expressed genes in the murine Distal Colon,microarrays were used to measure gene expression over a 24-hour light/dark cycle.The rhythmic transcripts were classified according to expression patterns, functions and association with physiological and pathophysiological processes of the colon including motility, colorectal cancer formation and inflammatory bowel disease. Keywords: time series
