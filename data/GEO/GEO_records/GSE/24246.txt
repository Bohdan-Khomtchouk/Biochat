TITLE
Transcriptome comparison of M1T1 WT, AP and delta CovS strains

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
Group A streptococci (GAS) may engage different sets of virulence strategies, depending on the site of infection and host context. We previously isolated 2 phenotypic variants of a globally disseminated M1T1 GAS clone: a virulent wild-type (WT) strain, characterized by a SpeB(+)/SpeA(-)/Sda1(low) phenotype, and a hypervirulent animal-passaged (AP) strain, better adapted to survive in vivo, with a SpeB(-)/SpeA(+)/Sda1(high) phenotype. This AP strain arises in vivo due to the selection of bacteria with mutations in covS, the sensor part of a key 2-component regulatory system, CovR/S. To determine whether covS mutations explain the hypervirulence of the AP strain, we deleted covS from WT bacteria (DeltaCovS) and were able to simulate the hypervirulence and gene expression phenotype of naturally selected AP bacteria. Correction of the covS mutation in AP bacteria reverted them back to the WT phenotype. Our data confirm that covS plays a direct role in regulating GAS virulence.

DESIGN
A dye-swapped cyclic design was used in this study in order that each strain could be compared across all samples in silico. For each strain treated, 2 biological replicates were each analysed in dye-swapped technical replicates, giving a total of n=10 peplicates for each strain.
