TITLE
A general transcription co-factor, Smad3, potentiates master transcription factor mediated cell identity conversions [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have identified that expression of constitutive active Smad3 (Smad3CA) significantly enhanced reprogramming by Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc. Smad3 is known to interact with several master transcription factors and boost their activity during development. Therefore, we hypothesized that Smad3CA is recruited to Oct4 binding sites during reprogramming. To test this hypothesis, we investigated genome-wide Smad3 binding sites in the presence and absence of reprogramming factor expression.

DESIGN
Oct4, Smad3 ChIP-seq on day 3 of reprogramming in the presence of Smad3CA expression, Smad3 ChIP-seq in MEFs with Smad3CA expression for 3 days.

PLATFORM
