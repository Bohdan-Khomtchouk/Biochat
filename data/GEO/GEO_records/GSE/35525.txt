TITLE
Pivotal role of HMGA1 gene signature in highly metastatic breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells depleted for High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1) using siRNA. HMGA1 is involved in invasion and metastasis in breast cancer cells. Results identify the specific transcriptional program induced by HMGA1 in highly metastatic breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with HMGA1-specific siRNA or a control siRNA. Transfections were performed by using Lipofectamin RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's procedure. Seventy-two hours after transfection, samples were processed for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Four biological replicas (A, B, C, D) were used for each of the two conditions, for a total of 8 samples.
