TITLE
Expression data from Drosophila S2 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
An Affimetrix GeneChip Drosophila genome 2.0 array was used to study the effect of protocatechuic aldehyde on gene expression. The addition of 0.1 mM protocatechuic aldehyde to Drosophila S2 cells significantly affected the expression of 52 genes, with 29 being up-regulated and 23 being down-regulated.

DESIGN
Drosophila S2 cells were incubated with protocatechuic aldehyde (0.1 mM). After 2 hr, the gene expression in Drosophila S2 cells was analyzed using  Affymetrix microarrays.
