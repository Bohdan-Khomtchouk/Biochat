TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Zea mays 10 DAP(days after pollination) kernels :  water stress vs well-watered control

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
A customized targeted oligoarray was used to monitor the expression levels of 1000 genes, representative of the immature kernel transcriptome. Using this oligoarray we compared transcripts from 10 DAP kernels of two susceptible and two drought tolerant genotypes. These four genotypes were extracted from our RIL population (B73xH99) and grown under water stress and well watered field conditions. Keywords: Stress response

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: water stress field condition vs. well watered field condition. Transcriptional profiling of 10 DAP kernel (two susceptible and two drought tolerant genotypes) in the first condition vs 10 DAP kernel (two susceptible and two drought tolerant genotypes) in the second condition. Hybridization replicates: 4 in dye swap mode. Two probes per gene per array.
