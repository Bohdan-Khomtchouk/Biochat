TITLE
Arabidopsis Col and nore1-1 at DAE 12, 16, 20, and 24

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the role of NORE1, a negative regulator of senescence during senescence, we have employed transcriptional profiling of Col and nore1-1 along aging (DAE 12,16,20 and 24). Aligent’s Whole Arabidopsis Gene Expression Microarray (G2519F-021169, V4, 4x44K) was used.

DESIGN
Age (4 time points; DAE12, 16, 20, and 24)-associated transcription profile in Col vs nore1-1. 2 independent biological samples

PLATFORM
GPL9020 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Feature Number version)
