TITLE
Expression data from MMP-8 wild type and KO mice with or without arthritis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which joint inflammation lead to progressive cartilage and bone destruction. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) implicated in homeostasis of extracellular matrix (ECM) play a central role in cartilage degradation. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of MMP-8 (collagenase-2) suppression in the K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis model.

DESIGN
Three male mice of each following groups: MMP-8 wild type and arthritic mice, MMP-8 wild type without arthritis (wild type control), MMP-8 KO and arthritic mice and MMP-8 KO without arthritis (KO control) were selected for RNA extraction, from ankle joints, and hybridation on Affymetrix microarrays. Male mice were used because they showed a trend to higher arthritis severity compared to female mice. In arthritic mice, ankle joints were taken 7 days after arthritis induction.
