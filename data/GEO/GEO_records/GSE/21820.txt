TITLE
Genome-wide characterization of PhoB binding profile in Escherichia coli (gene expression data)

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation was combined with high-density tiling array (ChIP-chip) and gene expression microarray to reveal the adaptive responses of Escherichia coli to phosphate starvation. The first sketch of the genome-wide distribution of PhoB binding profile was unveiled and 43 regions were identified as the PhoB binding regions. The presence of a significant common motif in these binding regions allowed us to reconstruct the PhoB binding pattern. By comparing the ChIP-chip and microarray datasets, we were also able to identify genes directly or indirectly affected through PhoB regulation. Nineteen out of the 287 differentially expressed genes in the presence and absence of PhoB activity were considered as the genes directly regulated by PhoB. The adaptive responses affected through PhoB regulation are discussed and these responses involve in several important biological functions including transcriptional regulation, transportation, membrane component arrangement, sigma factor modulation and DNA replication inhibition.

DESIGN
Under phosphate starvation condition, the gene expression profiles from MG1655 and its PhoB knock-out isogenetic strain are compared to identify the PhoB affected genes.
