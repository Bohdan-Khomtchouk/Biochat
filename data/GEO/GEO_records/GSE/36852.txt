TITLE
Epigenome analysis of newborn placenta and cord blood samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation profiling of placenta and cord blood samples. The Illumina GoldenGate methylation assay was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 1,536 CpGs in 23 placenta and 23 cord blood samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 46 samples were hybridised to the Illumina GoldenGate Methylation assay

PLATFORM
GPL15380 Illumina Sentrix Array Matrix (SAM) - GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I
