SUMMARY
Stress is a major risk factor for many cardiovascular and neuropsyhological disorders, and involved changes in gene expression Determine target genes affected by single or repeated immboilization stress. Stress triggers alterations in gene expresssion of many proteins, especially transcription factors. The target genes of repeated stress partially overlap, but differ from those altered by single stress. Sprague Dawley male rats were exposed to single 2 hr immobilization stress or 2 hrs immbolization stress each for six consecultive days. Controls for single stress were untreated, and controls for repeated stress were handled for six days. Keywords: dose response
