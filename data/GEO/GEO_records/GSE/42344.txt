TITLE
Nitric Oxide-releasing prodrug triggers cancer cell death through deregulation of cellular redox balance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
JS-K, a NO donor which capable to induce cancer apopotosis, it's killing mechanism was investigated in this study. We found out that JS-K induce apopotosis via deregulating the GSH/GSSG redox couple.

DESIGN
Leukemia cells were treated with JS-K and then assayed for metabolic changes by LC/MS and gene expression alterations by microarray.
