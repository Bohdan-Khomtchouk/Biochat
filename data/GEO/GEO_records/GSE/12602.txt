TITLE
Adaptation to hydrogen peroxide

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Adaptation to hydrogen peroxide in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is profiled with expression arrays. Adaptation describes the process in which a mild dose of toxin (in this case, hydrogen peroxide) is able to protect against a later acute dose. Here, we study two adaptive protocols (0.1 mM H2O2 and 0.1 + 0.4 mM H2O2) and one acute protocol (0.4 mM H2O2) to identify processes uniquely involved in adaptation. Predictions from these studies are validated in expression profiling of deletion mutants of the transcription factors Yap1, Mga2, and Rox1.
