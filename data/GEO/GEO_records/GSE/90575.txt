TITLE
Whole transcriptome microarray analysis of human cells treated with the endosomolytic D-amino acid CPP, D-dfTAT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the impact of D-dTAT treatment on primary human dermal flibroblast (HDF) and immortalized fibroblast cells (MCH58) at the transcriptome level. Results show that D-dTAT cytosolic penetration dysregulation of mRNA expression compared to dfTAT treated and untreated cells.

DESIGN
HDF and MCH58 cells were treated with dfTAT or D-dTAT (5ÂµM) for 1h. Total RNA was harvested from cells 24hrs after treatment.
