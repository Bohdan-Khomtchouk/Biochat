TITLE
Expression data of T87 Arabidopsis cultured cells in the presence of ABA, SA, JA, ABA+SA, or ABA+JA for 3hr or 24hr

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant hormones involved in environmental stresses, namely abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), and jasmonic acid (JA), have been shown to interact with each other in a complex manner. To address the network of the hormone interactions, we have investigated the changes in expression under multiple hormone treatments, ABA+SA and ABA+JA. We chose cultured cells to remove the difference in the response to hormones among developmental cells or tissues. The cells were treated for 3hr and 24hr to see the rapid or transient response and steady-state response. The obtained data indicate that ABA and SA affect antagonistically, but these hormones affected many genes collaboratively. Indeed, according to the microarray data, there are many genes that responded only to ABA+SA. In addition, the ABA+SA responsive genes also responded to ABA+JA. These data suggest that hormone crosstalk is more complicated than expected and that more systematic analysis is required to untangle the hormone crosstalk network.

DESIGN
To investigate the hormonal interactions, Arabidopsis T87 cultured cells were exposed to ABA, SA, or JA alone, or two hormones simultaneously, ABA+SA or ABA+JA, for 3hr and 24 hr. Comparing the data among those treatments, the relationships among these hormones were deduced.
