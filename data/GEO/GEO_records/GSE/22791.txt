TITLE
Microarray analysis of expression of cell death-associated genes in rat spinal cord cells exposed to cyclic tensile stresses in vitro

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The application of mechanical insults to the spinal cord results in profound cellular and molecular changes, including the induction of neuronal cell death and altered gene expression profiles. We demonstrated that spinal cord cells undergo cell death in response to cyclic tensile stresses, which were dose- and time- dependent. In addition, we have identified the up regulation of various genes, in particular of the MAPK pathway, which may be involved in this cellular response. We investigated the effect of cyclic tensile stresses on cultured spinal cord cells from E15 Sprague-Dawley rats, using the FX3000® Flexercell Strain Unit. We examined cell morphology and viability over a 72 hour time course. Microarray analysis of gene expression was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip System®, where categorization of identified genes was performed using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) systems.
