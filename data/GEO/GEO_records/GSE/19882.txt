TITLE
Expression data from human lymphoma endothelium and reactive lymph node-derived endothelium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Angiogenesis plays a key role in tumor metastasis. Many genes may act in this process including formation of vessels, immune evasion,etc. Different gene expression profiles between lymphoma endothelium cells and reactive lymph node-derived endothelium cells may uncover these genes. And intensive mechanism researches on such key genes may explain the mechanisim of tumor-specific angiogenesis and help to explore effective treatment strategies to prevent/reverse tumor metastasis. We use microarrays to detail gene expression profiles of human lymphoma endothelium and reactive lymph node-derived endothelium.

DESIGN
Lymph nodes were taken from surgery samples of cases pathologically diagnosed DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), PTL (peripheral T cell lymphoma) and reactive lymph nodes. The pure endothelium cells were isolated by LCM after immunohistochemical staining of CD34. We found Tim-3 was preferentially expressed on lymphoma-derived ECs via different expression profiles between lymphoma ECs and reactive lymph node-derived ECs. Intensive researches were carried out on Tim-3-expressing -ECs and we found that Tim-3 -expressing-Ecs may play important role on EC-mediated tumor evasion.
