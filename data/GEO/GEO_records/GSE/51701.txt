TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression in hepatoblastoma tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a genome-wide analysis of lncRNA expression in hepatoblastoma tissues to identify novel targets for further study of hepatoblastoma.We found that 2736 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in hepatoblastoma tissues.

DESIGN
The genome-wide analysis of lncRNA expression in these tissues was performed using a 4 Ã— 180K lncRNA microarray and Sureprint G3 Human lncRNA Chips.Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to confirm these results.

PLATFORM
