TITLE
Gene expression changes in Amanita muscaria- Populus tremula x tremuloides ectomycorrhizal root tips compared to Amanita muscaria free-living mycelium

ORGANISM
Amanita muscaria

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from Amanita muscaria ectomycorrhizal root tips compared to free-living mycelium . Ectomycorrhizal root tips and control mycelium were harvested after 6 weeks and used for RNA extraction. Reads of 150 bp were generated and aligned to Amanita muscaria transcripts ( http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Amamu1 ) using CLC Genomics Workbench 7.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Amanita muscaria ectomycorrhizal root tips and free-living mycelium were generated by Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing (150bp). Two biological replicates were sequenced for mycorrhizal and mycelium samples.
