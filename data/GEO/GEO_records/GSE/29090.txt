TITLE
Comparison between Gene expression in stroma and glands of the transitional and peripheral zone of the prostate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the gene expression differences between the stroma and glands in the transitional and peripheral zones of the prostate

DESIGN
Laser microdissection of prostate cancer tissues to separate glands from stroma followed by RNA extraction from the glands and whole Genome Microarray. We have pooled normal glands and stroma out of the transitional and peripheral zones from 10 patients after radical prostatectomy

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
