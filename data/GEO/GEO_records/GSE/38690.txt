TITLE
The ERRalpha metabolic nuclear receptor controls growth of colon cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Estrogen-Related Receptor alpha (ERRα) is a nuclear receptor that acts principally as a regulator of metabolism processes particularly in tissues subjected to high-energy demand. Besides its implication in energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis, ERRα was recently associated with tumorigenesis. Notably, increased expression of ERRα was noted in different cancerous tissues as breast, ovary and colon.  However, supplemental studies are required to better understand the role of ERRα in colon carcinoma. We used microarrays to detail  gene expression during ERRalpha knockdown in HCT116 cells and identified distinct classes of up and down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
Triplicate of HCT116 cell line was infected witn shscrambled(shCTL) and shERRalpha lentivirus and used  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
