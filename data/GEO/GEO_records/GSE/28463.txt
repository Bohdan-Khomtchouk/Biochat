TITLE
RNA isolation from mouse skin biopies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Study to optimize our protocol for isolating RNA from skin biopsies from (hairless) SKH mice using different-diameter biopsy punches. Some mice were also treated with UVB radiation to check its effect on RNA yield.

DESIGN
4 mice total:  2 were irradiated with 300J/m2 UVB and 2 were non-irradiated. Post-mortem skin biopsies with 1.5mm, 2.0mm, and 2.5mm diameter punches were taken from the dorsal region.
