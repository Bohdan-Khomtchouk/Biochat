TITLE
High-throughput sequencing for microRNAs in uninjured and regenerating newt hearts

ORGANISM
Notophthalmus viridescens

SUMMARY
We have developed a standardized and reproducible heart resection/regeneration model system in the red-spotted newt. In order to ascertain the involvement of microRNAs in this amazing process, we made and sequenced cDNA libraries for microRNAs in order to provide sequence data that we could use in further quantitative and qualitative studies.

DESIGN
We constructed small RNA cDNA libraries for uninjured (Uninj), 7dpi and 21dpi heart samples, which were sequenced using Illumina-Solexa technology at SciLifeLabs (Stockholm, Sweden).
