TITLE
Expression data from dietary restricted budding yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Dietary restriction (also known as caloric/calorie restriction; CR) extends the lifespan of species from all three eukaryotic kingdoms. The restriction of the diet interferes directly with the aging process by triggering a tightly controlled genetic program where specific sets of genes are either upregulated downreguled. We used microarray-technology to detail the global program of gene expression underlying the anti-aging effect of dietary restriction and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
In order to apply dietary restriction in budding yeast we cultured cells on a reduced glucose medium (0.5% vs. 2.0%), which is known as moderate DR regimen. We then compared mRNA expression of yeast cells cultured under dietary restricted (0.5% glucose) and ad libitum (2.0% glucose) conditions.
