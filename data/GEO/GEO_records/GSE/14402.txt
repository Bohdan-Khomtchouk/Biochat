TITLE
TNF-a-induced MEK/ERK-dependent regulation of Cartilage Matrix Genes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
TNF-a is increased in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.  TNF-a activates MEK/ERK in chondrocytes; however the overall functional relevance of MEK/ERK to TNF-a-regulated gene expression in chondrocytes is unknown. Chondrocytes were treated with TNF-a with or without the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 for 24 h. Microarray analysis was used to identify genes regulated by TNF-a in a MEK1/2-dependent fashion. Keywords: compound, signalling response

DESIGN
Primary chondrocytes from the femoral condyles of neonatal rats were treated with DMSO (control sample), TNF-a, U0126 (selective MEK1/2 inhibitor) or TNF-a and U0126.  Two biological replicates were collected for each treatment.  Total RNA was collected and analyzed by Affymetrix Microarray.
