TITLE
Proliferative genes dominate malignancy-risk gene signature in histologically-normal breast tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of 143 completely histologically-normal breast tissues resulted in the identification of a “malignancy risk” gene signature that may serve as a marker of subsequent risk of breast cancer development. Keywords: Tissue from breast cancer and adjacent regions

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from microdissected frozen breast tissues for gene array analysis

PLATFORM
