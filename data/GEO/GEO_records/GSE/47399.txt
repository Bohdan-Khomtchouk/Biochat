TITLE
mRNA sequencing identifies differential gene expresssion profiles between ASCC3 knock-down cells and control cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNAs from HeLa cells transduced with either scrambled shRNA or shRNA targeting ASCC3. The results have shown differential gene expression in ASCC3 knockdown cells, suggesting a regulatory role for ASCC3 in certain cellular pathway.

DESIGN
mRNA from HeLa cells transduced with either scrambled shRNA (ni) or shRNA targeting ASCC3 (ai) were harvested and used for deep sequencing by Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing instruments.
