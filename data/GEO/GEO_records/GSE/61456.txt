TITLE
Identification of genes regulated by HSF1 and SSBP1 in control and heat-shocked MEF cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine the expressions of HSF1 and SSBP1-mediated gene in control and heat shock conditions, we performed DNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
mRNA levels in control and heat-shocked MEF cells, which were infected with adenovirus expressing scramble RNA, or shRNA against HSF1 and SSBP1, were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis using GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix).
