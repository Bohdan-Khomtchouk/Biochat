TITLE
Sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase 1 regulates keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal homeostasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid whose levels are tightly regulated by its synthesis and degradation. Intracellularly, S1P is dephosphoryled by the actions of two S1P-specific phosphatases, sphingosine 1-phosphate phosphatase 1 and 2.  To identify the physiologic functions of S1P phosphatase 1, we have studied mice with its gene, Sgpp1, deleted. Sgpp1-/- mice appeared normal at birth but during the first week of life, they exhibited stunted growth, suffered desquamation, and most died before weaning. Interestingly, the epidermal permeability barrier developed normally during embryogenesis.  Sgpp1 -/- pups and surviving adults exhibited epidermal hyperplasia and abnormal expression of keratinocyte differentiation markers. Keratinocytes isolated from Sgpp1 -/- skin had increased intracellular S1P levels, and expressed a gene expression profile that indicated enhanced differentiation. The results reveal S1P metabolism as a regulator of keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal homeostasis.
