TITLE
MicroRNA signatures in human cervical cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our study investigates miRNAs might play a role in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer and identify altered miRNA gene methylation as a possible epigenetic mechanism involved in their aberrant expression.

DESIGN
Cervical cancer cells were seeded at low density and cultured for 48 h. Experimental groups were treatment with 10 Amol/L 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA;Sigma). After 24 hours, cells were collected and total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent. The miRNA expression was then evaluated by microarray profiling and differentially expressed miRNAs were identified by univariate two-class t test with random variance mode.
