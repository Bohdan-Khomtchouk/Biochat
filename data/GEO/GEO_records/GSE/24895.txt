TITLE
ENF1 (enlarged fil expression domain1) vs wild-type Col.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ENF1 gene (AT1G79440) encodes succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. Loss-of-function mutant of ENF1 shows pleiotropic phenotypes, including abnormal gene expression along the adaxial-abaxial axis in leaf development. enf1-1 allele has a point mutation in the splicing accepter site of 11th intron of ENF1. enf1-6 allele has T-DNA insertion in 5th exon of ENF1.

DESIGN
Differential gene expression between in enf1 and in wild type was measured at shoot apex of six-day-after-sowing seedlings. Independent experiments for wild type, enf1-1, and enf1-6 were performed four, three, and three times, respectively.
