TITLE
Genome wide rhythmic transcription under light/dark cycles in Ostreococcus tauri

ORGANISM
Ostreococcus tauri

SUMMARY
Genome wide rhythmic transcription under light/dark cycles is associated with sequential transcription of specific biological processes genes in Ostreococcus tauri. Transcriptional profiling of Ostreococcus tauri under light/dark cycles. In order to identify genes with a diurnal rhythm, cells entrained under 12:12  light/dark  cycles were sampled every 3 hours for 27 hours with two overlapping time points at Time 9 (Light ON at Time 9; Light OFF at Time 21)   in 3 independent experiments.

DESIGN
Two-conditions experiment, test situation (kinetic point) vs. Pool of each samples. Biological triplicates: 3 independant kinetics, 9 points per kinetics, Technical triplicates per array.

PLATFORM
GPL8644 Pangenomic Ostreococcus microarray (8K)
