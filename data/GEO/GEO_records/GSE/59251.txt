TITLE
RNA-sequencing experiment: Treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with the novel small molecule ZNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF-7 cells were treated with either ZNA (30 uM) or a vehice control for 3 or 12 hours.  Following RNA sequencing, the control-normalized data was used to analyze genes altered by ZNA treatment. Following RNA sequencing, the control-normalized data was used to analyze genes altered by ZNA treatment.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were treated with either ZNA (30 uM) or a vehice control for 3 or 12 hours.
