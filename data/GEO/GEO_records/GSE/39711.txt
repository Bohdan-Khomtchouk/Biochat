TITLE
RpoHI and RpoHII regulons in Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 from chromatin immuno-precipitation

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1

SUMMARY
In this study, we performed a ChIP-chip experiment to determine the respective regulons of RpoHI and RpoHII in Rhodobacter sphaeroides. We grew R. sphaeroides in aerobic conditions and induced either proteins ectopically and immuno-precipitated the regions of the genomic DNA interacting with the sigma factors.

DESIGN
DNA immunoprecipitated with antibodies against RpoHI or RpoHII was labelled with Cy5 and hybridized on two-color tilling arrays (triplicates for each) with genomic DNA as an input control labelled with Cy3.
