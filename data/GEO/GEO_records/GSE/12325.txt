TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of Arabidopsis ppi2-1 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study aims at investigating the gene expression profile of Arabidopsis ppi2-1 mutant.  Using Super-SAGE, we compared the gene expression profile of ppi2-1 mutant with that of wild-type Arabidopsis.

DESIGN
To obtain the SuperSAGE libraries, we followed the original SuperSAGE protocol described by Matsumura and colleagues (Matsumura et al., 2003) with some modification.  Total RNA was isolated from the 3rd to 6th leaves of Ws and the ppi2-1 mutant using RNAiso reagent.  The SuperSAGE library was directly sequenced with a large-scale pyrosequencing method.
