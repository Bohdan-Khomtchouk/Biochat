TITLE
Bile acids promote adenocarcinoma in a novel transgenic mouse model of Barrett’s esophagus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has the fastest increase of any cancer in the US and Europe, and arises in the setting of Barrett’s esophagus (BE),  defined by replacement of normal squamous epithelium with columnar intestinal-like epithelium. BE is thought to result from chronic esophageal inflammation but has been elusive to model in animals. Herein, we have generated the first transgenic mouse model of Barrett’s esophagus through overexpression of interleukin-1ß (IL-1β).  IL-1β overexpression in the mouse esophageal mucosa induces chronic inflammation that progresses to intestinal metaplasia, with characteristic expression of TFF2, Bmp4 and Cdx2. With aging, IL-1b transgenic mice progress to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) but the process is markedly accelerated by exposure to bile acids and/or nitrosamines, resembling the human counterpart. Moreover, progenitor cells present in the gastric cardia, but absent from the esophagus in humans and mice, are increased in BE, suggesting the cell of origin in the gastric cardia

DESIGN
Comparison of BE and EAC tissue from the mouse with normal squamous epithelium from the mouse.
