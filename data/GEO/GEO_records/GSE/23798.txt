TITLE
An integrated model of stress-dependent gene expression in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Microarray timecourses followed the gene expression response of Saccharomyces cereviciae to osmotic shock, over 4 hours. Data was compared to timecourses of quantitative proteomic data to understand the dynamic relationship between RNA and protein

DESIGN
The dynamic genomic expression response to osmotic shock (0.7M NaCl) was measured in Saccharomyces cereviciae, over the course of 4 hours in biological triplicate. Six timepoints were taken for each time course, for a total of 18 tiled-genomic Nimblegen arrays against the S288c yeast genome.
