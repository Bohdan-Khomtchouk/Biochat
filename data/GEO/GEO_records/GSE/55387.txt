TITLE
Natriuretic Peptide Receptor 3 (NPR3) is regulated by microRNA-100

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cardiac natriuretic peptide (NPs) plays an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal function. We examined the miRNAs that could be regulating NPs by subjecting the cardiomyocytes, HCMa cells, to hypoxia.

DESIGN
In the study presented, 839 miRNAs were profiled in two samples- control normoxia and hypoxia. Each samples were pooled from 3 independent experiments.
