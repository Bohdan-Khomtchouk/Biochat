TITLE
Transcript structures in Shewanella putrefaciens CN-32

ORGANISM
Shewanella putrefaciens CN-32

SUMMARY
5' RNASeq of mRNA from Shewanella putrefaciens CN-32 grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) and defined lactate minimal medium

DESIGN
5'-end mRNA profiles of mid-log phase bacterial cells growing in LB or lactate medium were generated by next-generation sequencing.
