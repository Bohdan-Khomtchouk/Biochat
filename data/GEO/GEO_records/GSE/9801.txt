TITLE
Human Monocytes to M-CSF differentiated Macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset was created to study M-CSF dependent in vitro differentiation of human monocytes to macrophages as a model process to demonstrate that independent component analysis (ICA) is a useful tool to support and extend knowledge-based strategies and to identify complex regulatory networks or novel regulatory candidate genes. Keywords: M-CSF, Monocytes, Macrophages

DESIGN
Samples for microarray analysis were isolated from healthy donors and from donors with Niemann-Pick type C disease. Monocytes were differentiated to macrophages for 4 days in the presence of M-CSF (50 ng/ml,R\ & D Systems). Differentiation was confirmed by phase contrast microscopy. Total RNA was extracted from the tissue biopsies according to the manufacturer´s instructions using the RNeasy Protect Midi Kit (Qiagen). Purity and integrity of the RNA was assessed on the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer with the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip reagent set (Agilent Technologies, Böblingen, Germany). The RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically and then stored at −80°C. Gene expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix HG-U133A and HG-U133plus2.0. Array scanning and expression analysis was performed using Microarray Analysis Suite 5.0 software. Each array was scaled to a target intensity of 100 (scaling to all probesets). *** CEL files not provided for GSM247170 and GSM247407
