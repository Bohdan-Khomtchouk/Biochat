TITLE
Expression data from persister and normal cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 persister and normal cells were treated with and without Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) to understand the effect of GM-CSF on gene expression of PAO1. We used DNA microarrays to identify the down-regulated and up-regulated genes after GM-CSF treatment.

DESIGN
Pseudonmonas aeruginosa PAO1 normal cells were obtained from stationary phase culture and persister cells were isolated by lysing normal cells with ciprofloxacin. The normal cells and isolated persister cells were treated with GM-CSF and selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The experiment was performed in two biological replicates. The samples for the biological replciates were: Control C1, Treatment T1, Control C2, and Treatment T2.
