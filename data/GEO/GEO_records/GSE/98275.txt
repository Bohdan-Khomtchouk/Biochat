TITLE
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) treatment attenuates breast cancer growth, invasion, metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study examines the therapeutic plausibility of using universal methyl group donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to block breast cancer development, growth, and metastasis. cancer. Anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activity of SAM was evaluated through a series of studies in vitro using two different human breast cancer cell lines and in vivo using a MDA-MB-231 xenograft model of breast cancer. The data shown in this array is obtained from control and SAM-treated MDA-MB-231 cell lines.

DESIGN
RNA from three different biological repeats from control and SAM-treated MDA-MB-231 cells were subjected to Human Gene 2.0 ST array.

PLATFORM
