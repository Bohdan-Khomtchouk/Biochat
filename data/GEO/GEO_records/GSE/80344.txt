TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Erlotinib sensitive and resistant human non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We characterized the gene expression profile of Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor  (EGFR) inhibitor (Erlotinib)-sensitive and resistant human NSCLC cell lines. Total RNA was extracted from the cell lines and expression profiles were studied by Agilent microarray analysis. Wide changes in gene expression profiles occur in the Erlotinib-resistant cell lines when compared with their parental cell lines (HCC827 and HCC4006).

DESIGN
Erlotinib-resistant HCC827-  (RA1, RA2, RB1, RB1.1, RB2) and  HCC4006-derived NSCLC were compared to their parental sensitive cell lines. A total of 16 samples were analyzed, two replicates for each cell line.
