TITLE
CHD1 regulates cell fate determination by activation of  differentiation-induced genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We describe here a novel role for CHD1 in regulating the osteoblast cell fate by studying the effect of CHD1 depletion on the epigenetic landscape and on mRNA expression in mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) (Simonsen et al. 2012) and fetal Osteoblast (hFOB 1.19) (Harris et al. 1995) during osteoblast differentiation.

DESIGN
In this study we performed ChIP-seq and RNA-seq experiments in two different cell lines namely MSC and FOB in undifferentiated (Und), osteoblast (Ob) or adipocyte differentiated (Ad) condition. ChIP-seq was done for H2A.Z, H2Bub1, H3.3, RNAPII and CHD1 in osteoblast differentiated FOB with control or CHD1 siRNA treatment (siCON, siCHD1 respectively). In MSC ChIP-seq was performed for H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac and CHD1.
