TITLE
longitudinal expression profiling in whole blood of multiple sclerosis patients and controls [IFN_replication dataset]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multiple sclerosis is the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Studying whole blood RNA from a cohort of 195 MS patients and 66 healthy controls, we identified gene expression signatures for interferon treatment and disease status by microarray analysis. Blood was collected at multiple time points (up to 3 for patients, 2 for controls). Patients were either untreated or treated with Interferon. In total, 626 Affymetrix exon arrays were analyzed, split into discovery and replication data sets. This metadata file contains information on all samples processed in the replication data set (n=183) when we compared gene expression in untreated MS patients (n=27) to IFN treated patients (n=48).

DESIGN
The following comparisons were made: untreated MS vs Controls (discovery and replication), untreated vs Interferon treated MS (discovery and replication). For each comparison, respective arrays were processed (background corrected and normalized) together, but seperate from other comparisons. The two time points for controls were averaged. For the first comparison, we report differentially expressed genes at an FDR cutoff of 0.1 at any of the three tested time points in MS patients in the discovery data set. For the second comparison, the FDR cutoff was 0.001. The respective genes were validated in the replication data set when they passed a nominal p-value cutoff of 0.05 at any of the three tested time points.
