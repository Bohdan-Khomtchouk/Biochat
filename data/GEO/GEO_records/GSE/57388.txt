TITLE
Diagnosis and early detection of CNS-SLE in MRL/lpr mice using peptide microarrays (GPL14921)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated whether mouse serum autoantibody binding patterns on random-sequence peptide microarrays (immunosignaturing) can be used for diagnosing and predicting the onset of lupus and its central nervous system (CNS) manifestations. Submitter states " We have no processed data to submit.  We have no gpr files to submit. "

DESIGN
To identify possible predictive and diagnostic peptides of lupus and CNS-lupus, we carried out two studies and selected peptides in common across both studies.  In the first study we tested 3-6 MRL/lpr, MRL/mp and C3H/HeJ mice at four months of age.  For study two we tested 9-10 MRL/lpr and MRL/mp at 1.5 and 4 months of age.  In both studies the mice sera were diluted 1/500 and analyzed using microarray peptides from platform GPL14921.  We ran each sample in triplicate.  The MRL/lpr and MRL/mp are the autoimmune strains and the C3H/HeJ is the control strain.
