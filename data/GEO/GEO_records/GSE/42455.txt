TITLE
microRNA expression in Mestenteric lymph samples from rat models of acute pancreatitis

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs in body fluids are becoming interesting markers for disease state. Here we assessed their presence in Mesenteric Lymph to identify candidate biomarkers for pancreatitis using a rat model of the disease. We used Affymetrix microRNA arrays to assess the differences in mesenteric lymph fluid miRNAs in a taurocholate induced rat model of pancreatitis
