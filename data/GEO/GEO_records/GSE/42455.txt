TITLE
microRNA expression in Mestenteric lymph samples from rat models of acute pancreatitis

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs in body fluids are becoming interesting markers for disease state. Here we assessed their presence in Mesenteric Lymph to identify candidate biomarkers for pancreatitis using a rat model of the disease. We used Affymetrix microRNA arrays to assess the differences in mesenteric lymph fluid miRNAs in a taurocholate induced rat model of pancreatitis

DESIGN
Mesenteric lymph was collected from five biological replicates from control sham operated animals (SHAM), fluid resuscitated taurocholate induced acute pancreatitis (RAP) and non-resuscitated taurocholate induced pancreatitis animals (AP). The latter group represent a more severe form of the disease.
