TITLE
Zebrafish embryo: Control vs. Nrf2a overexpression

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We analyzed transcriptome profiles at 8 hours post fertilization of zebrafish embryo which were injected with/without nfr2a mRNA into a 1-cell stage embryo by using the Zebrafish gene expression microarray (MZH_Zebrafish_16k_v1.0).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, uninjected  (control) vs. injected with Nrf2a mRNA (Test). Biological replicates: Triplicate design (3 controls and 3 tests), independently grown and harvested. Analytical replicates: Triplicates array analysis in biological experimental group #1. Duplicates array analysis in biological experimental group #2 and #3.

PLATFORM
