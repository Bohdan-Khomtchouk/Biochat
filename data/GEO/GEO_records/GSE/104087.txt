TITLE
Nasal DNA methylation differentiates corticosteroid treatment response in pediatric asthma: A pilot study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of nasal DNA from asthmatics hospitlaized for exacerbation. Samples were taken before steroid treatment and 18-24hr after steroid treatment. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 beadchips were used to generate DNA methylation profiles.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 beadchips

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
