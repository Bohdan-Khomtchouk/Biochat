TITLE
Fetal programming of hepatic transcriptome in response to gestational low dietary protein levels in the pig

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
German landrace gilts were fed a low protein diet (LP, 6% CP) throughout their whole pregnancy. Subsequently hepatic transcriptome profiles of the offspring were analysed at prenatal (94 dpc) and postnatal stages (1, 28, 188 dpn)

DESIGN
per stage offspring of 8 gilts were collected for expression profiling
