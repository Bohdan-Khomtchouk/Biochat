TITLE
gemsupv2-PLASMAR - Biodiversity and functional genomics of endogenous small RNAs induced upon biotic and abiotic stresses in plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au09-04_geminisilsup2 - gemsupv2 - Determine the level of expression in transgenic plants expressing geminviral gene silencing suppressors. One transgenic line of Arabidopsis overexpressing the geminiviral silencing suppressor V2 was grown in addition to a control, and their total RNA was extracted in order to study their genetic expression profiles.

DESIGN
3 dye-swaps - gene knock-in (transgenic).

PLATFORM
GPL9553 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 34.6K CATMA_v5
