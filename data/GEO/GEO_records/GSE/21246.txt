TITLE
Differential gene expression in mouse retina related to regional differences in vulnerability to hyperoxia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: In the C57BL/6J mouse retina, hyperoxia-induced degeneration of photoreceptors shows strong regional variation, beginning at a locus ~0.5mm inferior to the optic disc. To identify gene expression differences that might underlie this variability in vulnerability, we have used microarray techniques to describe regional (superior-inferior) variations in gene expression in the retina.

DESIGN
Methods: Young adult C57BL/6J mice raised in dim cyclic illumination (12h 5lux, 12h darkness) were exposed to hyperoxia (75% oxygen for 2w). Retinas were collected from hyperoxia-exposed and control animals without fixation, and divided into superior and inferior halves. RNA was extracted from each sample, purified and hybridised to mouse 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix). The consistency of the microarray results was assessed with quantitative PCR for selected genes. Expression data were analysed to identify genes and ncRNAs whose differential expression between superior and inferior retina could be associated with relative vulnerability to hyperoxia.
