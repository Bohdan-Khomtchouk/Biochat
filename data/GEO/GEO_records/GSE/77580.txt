TITLE
Gene expression profile of the IL2RG gene depletion in pig thymus

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) occurs in various species, including humans, at a frequency as high as one per 50,000 live births. Generally, SCID can be classified according to the cause of the immunodeficiency, and it includes impaired cytokine-mediated signalling, defective V(D)J recombination, impaired pre-T-cell receptor signalling, and metabolic enzyme deficiencies. Although mice with disrupted SCID-causing genes have provided important insights into the human disease, not all the SCID mice have phenotypes that resemble those in human SCID patients. In humans, most SCID patients are reported to have impaired cytokine-mediated signalling in immune cells. IL2RG is a key component of the immune system, which is associated with the development of X-linked SCID in humans. Despite some phenotypic characterisations and functional studies being performed in SCID animals, little is known about the molecular basis of the different phenotypes of SCID in mouse and pig. In the present experiment, we generated monoallelic IL2RG (mIL2RG+/Δ69-368) KO pigs and investigated patterns of gene expression during their immune development in order to further explore our understanding of immune responses in X-linked SCID.

DESIGN
We generated monoallelic IL2RG (mIL2RG+/Δ69-368) KO pigs using TALEN. Two independent experiments were performed at wild thymus and Two experiment was performed at  IL2RG (mIL2RG+/Δ69-368) KO pigs.
