TITLE
Wildtype, Fah and Fah, p21 ON and OFF NTBC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah), the last enzyme of the tyrosine degradation pathway, is specifically expressed in hepatocytes in the liver. Loss of Fah leads to liver failure in mice within 6-8 weeks. This can be prevented by blocking tyrosine degradation upstream of Fah with 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC). Here, we investigate the impact of p21 on global gene expression in Fah deficiency. Keywords: treatment, genotype

DESIGN
Livers from adult wildtype, Fah or Fah, p21 knockout mice were analyzed either after continuous treatment (ON) with NTBC or after NTBC withdrawal for 14 days (OFF).
