TITLE
Expression of genes in hepatic progenitor-like cells derived from human iPS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze stem/progenitor cell function, we purified hepatic progenitor-like cells in human iPS cell culture stimulated with cytokines.

DESIGN
Gene expression in CD13+CD133+ cells derived from human iPS cell culture
