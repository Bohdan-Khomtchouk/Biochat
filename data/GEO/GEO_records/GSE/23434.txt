TITLE
Expression data from human Kidney cell line induced by PCB153

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exposure to Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) is known to cause serious health effects in human but the gene expression profiles leading to development of differnet diseases is not fully understood. The knowledge of global gene expression will help us to devlop early diagnostic biomarkers for PCB induced health effects. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression profile underlying the effects of PCB153 on human Kidney cells leading to identification of distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes and cellular processes. Keywords: time course
