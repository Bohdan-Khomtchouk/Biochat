TITLE
Characterization of human regulatory T cells (TReg)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we describe the development and application of a new oligonucleotide microarray to analyze human TReg cells. Using whole genome transcription data from human and mouse TReg cells we have compiled a unique microarray consisting of 350 TReg specific genes (Human TReg Chip). Highly purified CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25- T cells were isolated from peripheral blood of 11 healthy volunteers and used for expression profiling to highlight the impact of molecular changes. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
11 healthy volunteers; at least duplicates, mostly triplicates -- > overall: 59 samples

PLATFORM
GPL3110 Human TReg Chip
