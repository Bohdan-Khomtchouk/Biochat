TITLE
Gene expression signatures in GIST-T1 cells transfected with a miR-34a mimic molecule

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify the effect of miRNAs, we carried out a gene expression microarray analysis using GIST-T1 cells transfected with a miR-34a mimic or a negative control.  We found that 2,621 probe sets (1,933 unique genes) were downregulated ( > 1.5-fold) by ectopic miR-34a expression, including PDGFRA gene which was previously reported as a miR-34a target gene.

DESIGN
GIST-T1 cells were transfected with a mirVana miR-34a mimic  (Ambion) or mirVana miRNA mimic Negative Control #1 (Ambion). Forty-eight hours after transfection, total RNA extraction was carried out, and gene expression signatures were analyzed.
