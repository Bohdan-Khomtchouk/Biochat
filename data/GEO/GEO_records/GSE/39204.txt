TITLE
Gene-expression profiles of ascites-cytology-positive ovarian cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ovarian cancer often progresses by disseminating to the peritoneal cavity, but how the tumor cells evade host immunity during this process is poorly understood. Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) is known to suppress immune system and to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the function of PD-L1 in peritoneal dissemination. Positive cytology in ascites was a significant poor prognostic factor in ovarian cancer. Microarray profiles of cytology-positive cases showed significant correlations with Gene Ontology terms related to immune system process. Microarray and immunohistochemistry in human ovarian cancer revealed significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and positive cytology. PD-L1 expression on mouse ovarian cancer cells was induced upon encountering lymphocytes in the course of peritoneal spread in vivo and upon co-culturing with lymphocytes in vitro. Tumor cell lysis by CTLs was attenuated when PD-L1 was overexpressed and promoted when it was silenced. PD-L1 overexpression also inhibited gathering and degranulation of CTLs. In mouse ovarian cancer dissemination models, depleting PD-L1 expression on tumor cells resulted in inhibited tumor growth in the peritoneal cavity and prolonged survival. Restoring immune function by inhibiting immune-suppressive factors such as PD-L1 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for peritoneal dissemination.

DESIGN
