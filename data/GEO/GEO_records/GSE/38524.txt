TITLE
Effect of glyoxylate pathway deficiency on transcriptome profile of Acetobacter aceti

ORGANISM
Acetobacter aceti NBRC 14818

SUMMARY
Trascriptome profiles in the cells of A. aceti wild-type strain and its isogenic aceA glcB mutant during growth in medium contaning ethanol and glucose was determined by NimbleGen Eukaryotic Expression array (4x72K).

DESIGN
Acetobacter aceti NBRC14818 and its isogenic aceA glcB mutant were cultivated in medium containing ethanol and glucose in Erlenmeyer flask with rotary shaking. Total RNA was extracted when optical density at 600 nm was 0.3. The experiment was performed in duplicate independent cultures.
