TITLE
Expression profiling of Col-0 treated with Psm:AvrRpt2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Identification of AvrRpt2-mediated differential gene expression in Arabidopsis

DESIGN
Four-week-old leaves of Arabidopsis Col-0 plant were infiltrated with Pseudomonas syringae pv. Maculicola carring effector AvrRpt2 at OD0.01. Samples were collected at 0 or 6 hours after infiltration. Each time point contains three biological replicates.
