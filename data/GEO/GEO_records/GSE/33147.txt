TITLE
Expression data from laboratory evolution of Escherichia coli on lactate or glycerol

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Laboratory adaptive evolution experiments were conducted using serial passage of E. coli in M9 minimal medium supplemented with either 2 g/L of lactate for 60 days or 2 g/L of glycerol for 44 days.  7 parallel evolution strains were generated for growth on lactate and 7 parallel evolution strains were generated for growth on glycerol. Affymetrix arrays were used to study the time-course change in gene expression from unevolved E. coli (day 0) to a midpoint evolved strain (day 20) and evolutionary endpoints

DESIGN
Biological replicate arrays were conducted for each of the time points tested for the different evolution strains
