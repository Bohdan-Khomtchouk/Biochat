SUMMARY
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2-EZH2) methylates histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27). PRC2 is required to maintain gene repression during development and differentiation and misregulation of PRC2 is linked to a range of neoplastic malignancies, activities that are believed to involve H3K27 methylation. The full spectrum of non-histone substrates of PRC2, however, is not known, and it is not known which other substrates might also contribute to the biological functions of PRC2.  We characterized the target recognition specificity and substrate diversity of PRC2, and identified more than one hundred potential novel nuclear targets of PRC2. The RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription elongation factor, Elongin A (EloA), is an in vivo target of PRC2. Mutation of the EloA residue that is methylated by PRC2 decreases repression of numerous PRC2 target genes. We propose that this functional crosstalk between PRC2 and EloA tunes the level of repression of targeted genes and contributes to the biological functions of PRC2.

DESIGN
We examined the genome-wide distribution of PRC2 catalytic subunit, EZH2, in mES cell by ChIP-seq
