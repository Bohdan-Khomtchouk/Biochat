TITLE
Comparative transcriptomics of the virulence regulons of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli from diverse phylogenomic lineages

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Global transcriptional analysis of eleven EPEC strains, including the most frequently studied strains used in laboratory studies investigating EPEC virulence mechanisms.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing was performed on the four EPEC prototype strains during growth in laboratory media and conditions that have been previously demonstrated to induce expression of EPEC virulence factors.
