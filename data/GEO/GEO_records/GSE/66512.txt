TITLE
Transcription changes due to TET1 knockdown in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of HCT116 cells transfected with either control siRNA or TET1 siRNA was analyzed using whole human genome microarrays.

DESIGN
To identify genes regulated by TET1 in colorectal cancer, HCT116 cells were transfected with either control siRNA or TET1 siRNA, and total RNA was extracted from biologically duplicated samples.
