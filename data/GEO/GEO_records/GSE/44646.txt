TITLE
Repeat elements study in pluripotent stem cells [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We surveyed RNA-Seq data to identify those TEs that are transcriptionally active uniquely in human pluripotent cells. We identified one endogenous retrovirus (HERV-H) family, uniquely found in primates as being unusually abundant in the transcriptome.

DESIGN
Poly(A)+ RNA extraction and further sequencing library construction was done for two types of cells (iPS, HFF-1) and hiPSC-derived embryoid bodies following Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit protocol, which was further sequenced on Illumina HiSeq machine with single-end 101 cycles.

PLATFORM
