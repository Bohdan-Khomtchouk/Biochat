SUMMARY
POU4F1 is associated with t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and contributes directly to its unique transcriptional signature

DESIGN
To identify targets of POU4F1, we performed gene expression profiling, comparing Pou4f1+/+ or Pou4f1-/- fetal liver cells to cells overexpressing POU4F1 and identified 140 differentially expressed genes.
