TITLE
Estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1)-dependent regulation of the mouse oviduct

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Estrogen receptor-Î± (ESR1) is an important transcriptional regulator in the mammalian oviduct, however ESR1-dependent regulation of this organ is not well defined, especially at the genomic level.  The objective of this study was therefore to investigate estradiol- and ESR1-dependent regulation of the transcriptome of the oviduct using transgenic mice, both with (ESR1KO) and without (wild-type, WT) a global deletion of this transcription factor using the Affymetrix Genechip Mouse Genome 430-2.0 arrays.

DESIGN
Oviducts were collected from ESR1KO and WT littermates at 23 days of age, or ESR1KO and WT mice were treated with 5 IU PMSG to stimulate follicular development and the production of ovarian estradiol, and the oviducts collected 48 h later.  RNA extracted from whole oviducts was hybridized to Affymetrix Genechip Mouse Genome 430-2.0 arrays (n = 3 arrays per genotype and treatment).
