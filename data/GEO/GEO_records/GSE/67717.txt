TITLE
Characterization of chemokine and chemokine receptor expression during Pneumocystis infection in healthy and immunodeficient mice (part 4)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
For both CD4 and micropajfe cell types, upregulated genes were primarily related to immune activation and proliferation, while down-regulated genes represented more diverse processes, including cell membranes, vasculature development, cell adhesion, and lipid-related metabolic processes.

DESIGN
Gene expression microarrays were from 4 exposured samples compared with 4 unexposured samples
