TITLE
Identification of genes involved in SHH subgroup medulloblastoma using murine whole-body Sleeping Beauty insertional mutagenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ptch+/- mice, which are predisposed to SHH subgroup medulloblastoma, were mutagenised using the Sleeping Beauty transposon to identify genes which increase the frequency of medulloblastoma formation. Gene expression in tumours was assessed both to investigate their relationship to human subgroup tumours, and to identify genes where expression was altered by mutagenesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from tumours induced by SB mutagenesis were compared to normal cerebellum, tumours induced witout SB mutagenesis, and tumours from a distinct model of disease (GTML).
