TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis facilitates quantitative analysis to identify DEGs in lung cancer cell lines regulated by S100A7A introduction in comparison with Cl1-0 control and S100A7A knockdown in comparison with CL1-5 control.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methods: The cDNA libraries from 3 pooled samples of cultured cells for each group were sequenced to generate RNA profiles using Illumina Miseq platform Results: The sequencing runs yielded a total of 95.01 M reads with an average length of 73-74 bp. The high-throughput sequencing performed for liver samples with different treatments showed similar numbers of yielded reads ranged from 5.57 to 5.74 M and the same average length. The Strand NGS software (version 2.1) was used using default parameters for pre-alignment and post-alignment quality control analysis and 100% of the raw reads remained in the dataset. Of these, 19.02 M reads (84%) were mapped into contigs of the rat genome (rn5) and identified 31457 transcripts in liver samples.

DESIGN
The mRNA profiles of CL1-0 lung adenocarcinoma cells with S100A7A overexpression and CL1-5 cells with S100A7A knockdown were generated with the respective controls by sequencing, using Illumina Miseq platform

PLATFORM
GPL15520 Illumina MiSeq (Homo sapiens)
