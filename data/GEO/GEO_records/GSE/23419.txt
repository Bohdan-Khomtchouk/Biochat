TITLE
B. thailandensis genes induced by subinhibitory concentration of glyphosate

ORGANISM
Burkholderia thailandensis

SUMMARY
Total transcript amplification (TTA) from single eukaryotic cells for transcriptome analysis is established, but TTA from a single prokaryotic cell presents additional challenges with much less starting material and lack of poly(A)-tails. We described, here, a novel method for single bacterium TTA, using a Burkholderia thailandensis model exposed to subinhibitory concentration of the antibacterial agent, glyphosate. Utilizing B. thialandensis microarray to assess the TTA method showed little gene bias ( < 2 fold-change) and absence (~5-6%) when compared to the larger scale non-amplified RNA samples. B. thailandensis genes important to possibly recuperate and balance the intracellular amino acid pool were induced (or repressed) by the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis inhibitor, glyphosate. We validated our single-cell microarray data at the multi-cells and single-cell levels with lacZ and gfp reporter-gene fusions, respectively. This novel method will rejuvenate and expand the prokaryotic transcriptomic field.

DESIGN
Two identical cultures of B. thailandensis wildtype strain E264 were grown in 1x M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1% Brij-58 and 20 mM glucose (MG) to mid-log phase. One culture was induced by final concentration of 0.01% (w/v) glyphosate for 30 minutes. Total RNA was then purified from B. thailandensis uninduced and induced samples, converted to cDNA and hybridized onto B. thailandensis 70mer triplicate array
