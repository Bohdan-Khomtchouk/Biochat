TITLE
SCLC cell line profiling on HG-U133A arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA expression analysis was performed to compare patterns to DNA copy number changes and sensitivity to BCL2 inhibitors. Keywords: cell line comparison

DESIGN
Naive cell lines were isolated in duplicate or triplicate (only a single for H69AR) to determine RNA expression pattern.
