TITLE
Intramuscular fat variability in pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Intramuscular (i.m.) fat content influencing consumerâ€™s acceptability of pork is considered as a limiting factor for meat quality. To gain insight into the biological basis of individual variability in i.m. fat content, both gene expression profiling and proteomic investigation were associated in pig longissimus muscle (LM). Keywords: intramuscular fat, gene expression, pigs, proteomics, microarray, pork meat

DESIGN
Animals were sampled from a population of 1,000 pigs generated as an F2 intercross between two production sire lines: FH016 (Pietrain type, France Hybrides SA, St Jean de Braye, France) and FH019 (Synthetic line, from Duroc, Hampshire and Large White founders, France Hybrides SA, St Jean de Braye, France).
