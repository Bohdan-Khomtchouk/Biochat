TITLE
Induction of alternative proinflammatory cytokines accounts for sustained psoriasiform skin inflammation in IL-17C+IL-6KO mice [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IL-6 inhibition has been unsuccessful in treating psoriasis, despite high levels of tissue and serum IL-6 in patients. Additionally, de novo psoriasis onset has been reported following IL-6 blockade in rheumatoid arthritis patients. To explore mechanisms underlying these clinical observations, we backcrossed an established psoriasiform mouse model (IL-17C+ mice) with IL-6 deficient mice (IL-17C+KO) and examined the cutaneous phenotype.  IL-17C+KO mice initially exhibited decreased skin inflammation, however this decrease was transient and reversed rapidly, concomitant with increases in skin Tnf, Il36α/β/γ, Il24, epigen and S100a8/a9 to levels higher than those found in IL-17C+ mice. Comparison of IL-17C+ and IL-17C+KO mouse skin transcriptomes with that of human psoriasis skin, revealed significant correlation among transcripts of psoriasis patient skin and IL-17C+KO mouse skin, and confirmed an exacerbation of the inflammatory signature in IL-17C+KO mice that aligns closely with human psoriasis. Transcriptional analyses of IL-17C+ and IL-17C+KO primary keratinocytes confirmed increased expression of proinflammatory molecules, suggesting that in the absence of IL-6, keratinocytes increase production of numerous additional proinflammatory cytokines. These preclinical findings may provide insight into why arthritis patients being treated with IL-6 inhibitors develop new onset psoriasis and why IL-6 blockade for the treatment of psoriasis has not been clinically effective.
