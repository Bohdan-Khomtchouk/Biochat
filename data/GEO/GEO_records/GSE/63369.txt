TITLE
A comprehensive epigenome map of Plasmodium falciparum reveals unique mechanisms of transcriptional regulation

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Epigenetic mechanisms have been poorly understood in Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. To elucidate stage specific epigenetic regulations in P. falciparum, we performed genome-wide mapping of various histone modifications, nucleosomes and RNA Polymerase II. Our comprehensive analysis suggest that transcription initiation and elongation are distinct in Plasmodium. In this study, by analyzing histone modifications, nucleosome occupancy and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) at three different IEC developmental stages of Plasmodium; ring, trophozoite and schizont, we tried to unravel the epigenetic mechanism associated with gene regulation.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K27me3, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K14ac, H3K4me1, H3K79me3, H3K27ac, H3K4me2, H3K9ac, H4ac, RNA Pol II and Histone H3 at three different stages of Plasmodium falciparum
