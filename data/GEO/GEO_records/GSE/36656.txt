TITLE
sg1-sg3-Studying the transcriptional consequences of a QTL for shoot growth (SG3, SG1). Studying the transcriptional consequences of a QTL for shoot growth under mannitol condition (EGO3).

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra09-01_qtlleafgrowth - sg1-sg3 - What are the transcriptional consequences of the allelic contrast at SG3, SG1 and EGO3 loci mapped for its effect on shoot growth and identified at the gene level - Plants were grown in the in vitro conditions where we have mapped and cloned the concerned QTL and which allows us to see the phenotype linked to the segregation of the natural alleles. We are comparing 2 genotypes descending from a RIL from the Bur x Col RIL set, homozygous and identical everywhere in the genome except for the 23.4 kb at SG1 loci where one genotype is Bur (97.4 and 175.4) and the other is Col (97.1 and 175.1).

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - genotype comparison

PLATFORM
