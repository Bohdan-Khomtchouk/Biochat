TITLE
Constitutive over-expression of LjMyb14 in Lotus japonicus.

ORGANISM
Lotus japonicus

SUMMARY
To identify the regulatory targets of the R2R3-Myb transcription factor, LjMyb14, the gene was constitutively over-expressed in Lotus japonicus under the Lotus ubiquitin promoter.

DESIGN
The gene expression levels of three biological replicates of the Lotus japonicus (MG20) were averaged and compared to the the gene expression levels of three independent lines of Lotus japonicus japonicus constituitively over expressing LjMyb14 using the Lotus ubiquitin promoter.
