TITLE
5-methylcytosine ChIP-on-Chip (MeDIP) of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and control human brains

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment series sought to detect genome-wide methylation in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis brains and compare it to normal control brains. Methylation across the whole genome was measured in brain DNA of 10 SALS patients and 10 neurologically-normal controls. Methylated DNA was immunoprecipitated and interrogated by Affymetrix GeneChip Human Tiling 2.0R Array Sets. Methylation calls were compared between SALS patients and controls at each methylated site. Keywords: ChIP-Chip

DESIGN
10 sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis brain (lateral frontal cortex, Brodmann area 46) and 10 normal control brain (lateral frontal cortex, Brodmann area 46). 1 replicate sample repeated at different time (19a).
