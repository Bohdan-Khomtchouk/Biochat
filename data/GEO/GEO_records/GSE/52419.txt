TITLE
ZFHX4 and CHD4 ChIP sequencing in glioblastoma tumor initiating cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastomas (GBM) harbor subpopulations of therapy-resistant tumor initiating cells (TICs) that are self-renewing and multipotent. To understand the regulation of the TIC state, we performed an image-based screen for genes regulating GBM TIC maintenance and identified ZFHX4, a 397-kDa transcription factor. ZFHX4 is required to maintain TIC-associated phenotypes in vitro, suggesting that ZFHX4 regulates TIC differentiation, and its suppression increases glioma-free survival in intracranial xenografts. ZFHX4 interacts with CHD4, a core member of the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) complex. ZFHX4 and CHD4 bind to overlapping sets of genomic loci and control similar gene expression programs. Using expression data derived from GBM patients, we demonstrate ZFHX4 is a master regulator of CHD4-mediated gene expression. These observations define ZFHX4 as a regulatory factor that links the chromatin remodeling NuRD complex and the GBM TIC state.

DESIGN
Examination of binding of ZFHX4 and CHD4 across the human genome, using the 0308 tumor initiating cell line. Two replicates for each protein, compared to whole cell extract inputs.
