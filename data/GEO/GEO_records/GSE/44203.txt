TITLE
Transcription factor activator protein 2C (TFAP2C) regulates luminal differentiation in mammary development and carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Molecular subtypes of breast cancer are characterized by patterns of gene expression, which can be used to predict response to therapy and overall clinical outcome. The luminal breast cancer subtypes are defined by the expression of ER-alpha (ERa) and a set of ERa-associated genes. The transcription factor activator protein 2C (TFAP2C, AP-2C, AP-2g) transcription factor plays a critical role in regulating cell growth and differentiation during ectodermal development and has been implicated in the regulation of ERa and other luminal-associated genes in breast cancer. While TFAP2C has been established as a prognostic factor in human breast cancer, the role of TFAP2C in development of the luminal epithelial cells in the normal mammary gland and in breast cancer have remained elusive. Herein, we demonstrate a critical role of TFAP2C in maintaining the luminal differentiation phenotype during normal mammary development and in luminal breast carcinoma cell lines.

DESIGN
Total RNA from MCF7 cells with and without knockdown of TFAP2c. 3 biological replicates, with 2 technical replicates each, were performed for each sample type.
