TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing for Quantitative Expression Analysis of Wild Type and Nrf1 deficient Liver Transcriptomes from Regular Diet (RD) or High Cholesterol Diet (CholD) fed mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) for systematic analysis to discover Nrf1-dependent cellular pathways involved in defending liver against the stress of cholesterol excess. Methods: Liver mRNA profiles of 9-12-old wild-type (WT in fastq files; flox in paper) and liver Nrf1 deficient (KO in fastq files; L-KO in paper) mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate or quadruplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2500. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRTâ€“PCR validation of selected target genes was performed using SYBR Green assays. Results: We mapped sequence reads to the mouse genome (build mm10) and identified greater than 10,000 transcripts in the liver of WT and KO mice. RNA-seq data revealed a role for Nrf1 in regulating inflammation, lipid metabolism, and sterol metabolism in response to a cholesterol challenge. Conclusion: Our study reveal Nrf1 as a guardian of cholesterol homeostasis and a core component of adaptive responses to excesses in cellular cholesterol.
