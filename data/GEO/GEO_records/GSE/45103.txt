SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_5614 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Gary Karpen. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: We aim to determine the locations of 125 chromosomal proteins across the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The proteins under study are involved in basic chromosomal functions such as DNA replication, gene expression, gene silencing, and inheritance. We will perform Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) using genomic tiling arrays. We will initially assay localizations using chromatin from three cell lines and two embryonic stages, and will then extend the analysis of a subset of proteins to four additional animal tissues/stages For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
EXPERIMENT TYPE: CHIP-chip. BIOLOGICAL SOURCE: Strain: G9a mutant (official name : G9a mutant genotype : G9a[RG5]/G9a[RG5] outcross : 3 transgene : n/a tags : homologous recombination tag : none description : Mutation generated by end-out homologous recombination at the G9a locus. The entire open reading frame of G9a has been removed. Developmental Stage: 3rd Instar Larvae; Genotype: G9a[RG5]/G9a[RG5]; Transgene: n/a;  NUMBER OF REPLICATES: 4;  EXPERIMENTAL FACTORS: Strain G9a mutant (official name : G9a mutant genotype : G9a[RG5]/G9a[RG5] outcross : 3 transgene : n/a tags : homologous recombination tag : none description : Mutation generated by end-out homologous recombination at the G9a locus. The entire open reading frame of G9a has been removed. Antibody RNA Pol II (abcam) (target is PolII); Developmental Stage 3rd Instar Larvae
