TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of banana in response to growth-promoting rhizobacteria

ORGANISM
Musa acuminata

SUMMARY
We report the banana transcriptome profile in response to two distinct growth-promoting rhizobacteria, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Pseudomonas fluorescens. The goal of our study is to identify plant genes differentially regulated by rhizobacteria-plant interaction along time. At the same time, we show that despite these two rhizobacteria regulate distinct sets of genes, the same functional categories has been over-represented, such as transcription factor activity, response to stress and metabolic processes.

DESIGN
Twenty-seven cDNA libraries were prepared from Musa acuminata Williams cultivar, including: root, pseudostems and leaves. Three biological replicates were collected for each treatment (control, inoculated with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens or Pseudomonas fluorescens) at three different times: 0, 48 and 96h post inoculation.
