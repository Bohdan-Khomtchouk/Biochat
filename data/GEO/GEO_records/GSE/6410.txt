TITLE
Cisplatin-induced gene expression changes in A549 NSCLC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed to analyse cisplatin-induced gene expression changes in A549 NSCLC cells. Cells were treated with 50 µM of cisplatin for 1 hour and incubated for a further 10 hours in drug-free media before the gene expression changes were investigated. Results show that cisplatin induced changes in the expression of genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle control, DNA repair and transcription. Keywords: drug response

DESIGN
Gene expression changes in response to cisplatin were analysed by Microarray technology in A549 NSCLC cells. Cells were treated with 50 µM of cisplatin (or drug-free media) for 1 hour and incubated for a further 10 hours in drug-free media before the cisplatin-induced gene expression changes were investigated. Control and cisplatin-treated samples were collected from three independent experiments.
