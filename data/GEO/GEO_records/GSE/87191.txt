TITLE
Browning of White Adipose Tissue with Roscovitine Induces a Distinct Population of UCP1+ Adipocytes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of FACS sorted UCP1+ adipocytes shows that the mRNA signature of brite adipocytes is distinct from beige adipocytes, which arise through catecholamine signaling.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples of FACS-sorted adipocytes (3-4 each group) from UCP1/Tomato mice (8 to 10-week old) were analyzed by microarray at Boston University Microarray Resource Facility.
