TITLE
Genome-wide map of DNA methylation to unravel the function of EBF1 C-terminus domain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the function of the C-terminus domain, DNA methylation status was profiled in Empty, Ebf1wt and Ebf1DC transduced Ebf1-/- progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Freshly prepared Ebf1−/− c-Kit+ fetal liver cells were transduced with  pmys-Empty-IRES-GFP, pmys-EBF1wt-IRES-GFP or pmys-EBF1ΔC-IRES-GFP. EBF1wt- or EBF1ΔC-transduced cells were sorted as early pro-B cells (GFP+CD19+BP1-). Vector-transduced cells were sorted as only GFP+.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
