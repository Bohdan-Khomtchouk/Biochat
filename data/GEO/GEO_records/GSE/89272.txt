TITLE
Diverse interventions that extend mouse lifespan suppress shared age-associated epigenetic changes at critical gene regulatory regions (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation into changes in the methylome in young (2 months) and aged (22 months) Ames dwarf (Prop1 Hom) and WT (Prop1 Het) mice

DESIGN
We quantify transcription via high throughput RNA sequencing in young (2 months) and old (22 months) mice that show increased longevity through a variety of interventions

PLATFORM
