TITLE
Female Rhesus Monkey hypothalamic gene expression profiling during puberty

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profilling of the female primate hypothalamus during normal puberty. Total RNA samples from hypothalami from juvenile (JUV), early pubertal (EP) and mid pubertal (MP) female monkeys were used to compare pairwise against the JUV group. Keywords: Normal gene expression profiling

DESIGN
Tree-condition experiment, EP vs. JUV and MP vs. JUV. Biological replicates: 4 JUV, 4 EP and 4MP. Four replicates per array.

PLATFORM
