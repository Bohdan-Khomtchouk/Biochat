TITLE
EFFECT OF A NOVEL PROBIOTIC PREPARATION ON INDUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF REMISSION IN ULCERATIVE COLITIS PATIENTS: A DOUBLE-BLIND PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study investigated the effect of a novel probiotic preparation on the colonic mucosal gene expression in UC patients, using whole genome gene expression microarrays.

DESIGN
Total RNA, extracted from endoscopically-derived colonic mucosal biopsies from (in-)active UC patients before and after probiotics/placebo intake, was used to analyze the mRNA expression via Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
