TITLE
Epigenome analysis of human brain gliomas (part 1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of 112 human glioma samples. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in glioma samples, including 55 WHO grade 2 glioma samples, 33 WHO grade 3 glioma samples and 24 WHO grade 4 glioma samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 112 glioma samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
