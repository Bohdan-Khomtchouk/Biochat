SUMMARY
CD4+ T cells with high PD-1 expression are expanded in rheumatoid arthritis patients. The purpose of this study is to compare subpopulations of PD-1hi CXCR5- CD4+ T cells to PD-1hi CXCR5+  follicular helper T cells and PD-1-negative CD4+ T cells

DESIGN
Examination of 8 T cell populations from 4 seropositive rheumatoid arthritis patients

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
