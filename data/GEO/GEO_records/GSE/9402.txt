TITLE
FNR1 mutation against ecotype variation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The mechanism by which plants regulate channeling of photosynthetically derived electrons into different areas of chloroplast metabolism remains obscure. In higher plants, these electrons are made accessible to stromal enzymes, or cyclic electron flow, as reduced ferredoxin (Fd), or NADPH. We investigated how the specific loss of an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ferredoxin:NADPH reductase (FNR) isoprotein affected channeling of photosynthetic electrons into NADPH and Fd dependent metabolism. Affymetrix gene chip comparison of transcript changes in these mutants against two different ecotype backgrounds indicates that stress signaling is perturbed, and experiments revealed that the mutants are more susceptible to oxidative stress. Keywords: mutant wild type transcript profile comparison

DESIGN
We isolated arabidopsis mutants of the FNR1 gene in different ecotypes, extracted RNA from these and respective wild type plants and hybridised it to Affymetrix microarrays
