TITLE
Identification of regulatory activities for σ54 (RpoN) in Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC14028 [expression]

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. ATCC 14028

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles of mid-exponentially growing Salmonella enterica sv Typhimurium ATCC14028 wild type and ΔrpoN mutant cultures containing plasmid pPBHP192 expressing protein DctD250

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from three biological replicates of mid-exponentially growing Salmonella enterica sv Typhimurium ATCC14028 wild type and ΔrpoN mutant cultures that contain plasmid pPBHP192 (expressing protein DctD250).
