TITLE
Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Mouse Neurogenesis by Pumilio Proteins [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We employ mRNA-seq to investigate transcriptome of  Pum1-Knockout, Pum2-Knockout and WT conditons

DESIGN
In order to investigate whether Pum1 and Pum2 regulate their targets at their RNA levels, we used 1/10 of the samples from the Pum1 and Pum2 iCLIP experiments (four biological repeats of WT, P1KO, and P2KO neonatal brains) to extract total RNAs for RNA deep sequencing. And we also collected three Ndcko neonatal brains for RNA deep sequencing.
