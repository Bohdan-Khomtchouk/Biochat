TITLE
Discovering differentially expressed genes in early floral buds of SlREVRis overexpression line and wild type in tomato

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Versatile roles of REVOLUTA (REV), a Class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III) transcription factor, have been mainly depicted in Arabidopsis and Populus. In this study, we investigated the functions of its tomato homolog, namely SlREV. Over-expression of a microRNA166-resistant version of SlREV (35S::REVRis) not only resulted in vegetative abnormities such as curly leaves and fasciated stems, but also caused dramatic reproductive alterations including continuous production of flowers at pedicel abscission zone (AZ) and ectopic fruit formation on receptacles. Microscopic analysis showed that meristem-like structures continuously emerged out from the exodermises of pedicel AZs and ectopic carpels formed between the first and the second whorl of floral buds in 35S::REVRis plants. Therefore, we performed Illumina’s digital gene expression (DGE) system, a tag-based transcriptome sequencing methodTranscriptional data to dicover differential expressed genes in early buds (1-2 mm floral buds at stage 6-8) of overexpression line SlREVRis-1. The result suggests that SlREV may regulate genes related to meristem maintenance and cell differentiation in the development of flower pedicel abscission zone, and modulate genes in homodomain and MADS-box families and hormone pathways during fruit formation. These results reveal important roles of SlREV in tomato.

DESIGN
1-2 mm floral buds at stage 6-8 were sampled from three individual plants of 35S::REVRis-1 and corresponding WT control. Three aliquots of RNA from transgenic or WT plants were pooled. Then, the digital expression profile were generated by Illumina Cluster Station and Illumina HiSeq™ 2000 System (BGI Inc.).
