TITLE
The Pitx2:miR-200c/141:noggin pathway regulates BMP signaling and ameloblast differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mouse incisor is a remarkable tooth that grows throughout the animal’s lifetime. This continuous renewal is fueled by epithelial stem cells that give rise to ameloblasts, which generate enamel, and little is known about the function of specific miRNAs in this process. Here we describe the role of a novel Pitx2:miR-200c/141:Noggin regulatory pathway in dental epithelial cell differentiation. miR-200c repressed noggin, an antagonist of Bmp signaling. Pitx2 expression caused an up-regulation of miR-200c and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed endogenous Pitx2 binding to the miR-200c/141 promoter. A positive feedback loop was discovered between miR-200c and Bmp signaling. miR-200c/141 induced expression of E-cadherin and the dental epithelial cell differentiation marker, amelogenin. In addition, miR-203 expression was activated by endogenous Pitx2 and targeted the Bmp antagonist Bmper to further regulate Bmp signaling. miR-200c/141 knockout mice showed defects in enamel formation with decreased E-cadherin and amelogenin expression and increased noggin expression. Our in vivo and in vitro studies reveal a multistep transcriptional program involving the Pitx2:miR-200c/141:Noggin regulatory pathway that is important in epithelial cell differentiation and tooth development.

DESIGN
Lower incisors of 3-5 P0 WT and Pitx2-Cre;Dicer1 cKO mices from same litter were dissected and combined for RNA extraction. Two different litters were analyzed. For mRNA microarray, CodeLink Mouse Whole Genome chips (Applied Microarrays) were used according to manufacturer’s instruction (done at Genomics Core of TAMU). miRNA from P0 Lower Incisor ameloblast and cervical loops.
