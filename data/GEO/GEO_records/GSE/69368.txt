TITLE
Expression data from pre-B ALL tumors isolated from ingeneered mice from the indicated genotypes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Ink4a/Arf tumor supressors play crucial roles in inhibiting cell cycle progression at the G1/S checkpoint.  Activating mutations in the KrasG12D oncogene is one of the most frequent changes in human cancer, with resultant constitutive mitogenic signaling within the cell. We generated cohorts of  CD19Cre; KrasG12D/+; Ink4a/ArfL/+ mice to evaluate the  combined contributions of Ink/Arf loss and KrasG12D activation in pre-B ALL lymphomas. In this data set we include the expression data obtained from pre-B ALL lymphomas isolated from  mice with simultaneous deletion of the Ink/Arf locus and activation of KrasG12D oncogene (and CD19Cre; KrasG12D/+; Ink4a/ArfL/+ mice).

DESIGN
A total 10 mRNA samples were isolated from pre-B ALL arising in CD19Cre; KrasG12D/+; Ink4a/ArfL/+ mice.
