TITLE
Relative tRNA abundance in Lactococcus lactis as a function of growth rate and overexpression stress

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis

SUMMARY
Comparison of overall tRNA level in Lactococcus lactis affected by the growth rate and as a response to the overexpression of the membrane protein OpuA.

DESIGN
Lactococcus lactis with growth rate 0.15 h was compared to Lactococcus lactis with growth rates 0.3 h, 0.5 h and 0.6 h. Lactococcus lactis just prior to the induction of the expression of OpuA was compared to Lactococcus lactis after induction of expression of OpuA and to Lactococcus lactis in stationary phase. 2 biological replica.

PLATFORM
GPL18332 Lactococcus lactis transfer RNA array
