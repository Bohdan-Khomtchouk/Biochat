TITLE
M. sedula transcriptional response under heterotrophic, autotrophic, and mixotrophic growth conditions

ORGANISM
Metallosphaera sedula

SUMMARY
To study mixotrophy, it is desirable to have an organism capable of growth in the presence and absence of both organic and inorganic carbon sources, as well as organic and inorganic energy sources. Metallosphaera sedula is an extremely thermoacidophilic archaeon which has been shown to grow in the presence of inorganic carbon and energy source supplements (autotrophy), organic carbon and energy source supplements (heterotrophy), and in the presence of organic carbon and inorganic energy source supplements. The recent elucidation of M. sedula’s inorganic carbon fixation cycle and its genome sequence further facilitate its use in mixotrophic studies. In this study, we grow M. sedula heterotrophically in the presence of organic carbon and energy sources (0.1% tryptone), autotrophically in the presence of inorganic carbon and energy sources (H2 + CO2), and “mixotrophically” in the presence of both organic and inorganic carbon and energy sources (0.1% tryptone + H2 + CO2 ) to characterize the nature of mixotrophy exhibited.

DESIGN
Two 3 slide loops joined at equivalent conditions (8 slides total) for Mse cells includes 3 conditions tested in duplicate (biological repeats): heterotrophy (H1 and H2), autotrophy (A1 and A2),  and mixotrophy (M1 and M2). Half of an RNA sample for one condition was labeled with Cy3 while the other half was labeled with Cy5. The two differently labeled samples were run on different slides. Each probe is spotted on each slide 5 times (5 replicates; spot intensities for all replicates on slide provided in associated raw data file).
