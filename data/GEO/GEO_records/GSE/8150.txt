TITLE
Age-related transcriptional changes and the effect of dietary supplementation of vitamin E in the mouse brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We established the transcriptional profile of brain aging and examine the global effects of vitamin E supplementation on age-related alterations in expression in the aged mouse brain. Keywords: expression profiling

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were obtained from the neocortex tissues of 5-month-old controls, 30-month-old controls and 30-month old B6C3F1 mice with middle age-onset supplementation of α-tocopherol or a mixture of α- and γ-tocopherol (500mg/kg of each tocopherol).
