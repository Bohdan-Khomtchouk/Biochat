TITLE
Fe-FIT-Diff

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au13-06_fit - Fe-FIT-Diff - FIT (FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR) is a regulator of Fe deficiency responses in the root. FIT is a basic helix-loop-helix protein. Here, we investigated the transcriptome changes in response to Fe deficiency (- Fe) versus the control condition (+ Fe) in wild type, the fit-3 loss of function mutant and in FIT overexpression plants.

DESIGN
21 dye-swap - normal vs transgenic comparaison
