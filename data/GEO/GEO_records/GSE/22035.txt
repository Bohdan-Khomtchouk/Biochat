TITLE
Gene expression data in estrogen receptor alpha positive breast tumors with and without PIK3CA mutations.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PI3K/AKT pathway plays one of pivotal roles in breast cancer development and maintenance. PIK3CA, coding PIK3 catalytic subunit, is the oncogene which shows the high frequency of gain-of-function mutations leading to the PI3K/AKT pathway activation in breast cancer. In particular in the ERα-positive breast tumors PIK3CA mutations have been observed in 30% to 40%. However, genes expressed in connection to the pathway activation in breast tumorigenesis remain largely unknown. To identify downstream relevant target genes (and signaling pathways) turned on by the aberrant PI3K/AKT signal in breast tumors, we analyzed gene expression by pangenomic oligonucleotide microarray in a series of 43 ERα-positive tumors with and without PIK3CA mutations.

DESIGN
43 ERα-positive breast tumors including 14 tumors with PIK3CA mutations and 29 tumors without PIK3CA mutattions were used as screening set for microarray.
