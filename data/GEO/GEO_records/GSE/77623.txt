TITLE
Gene expression profile of Foxf1 induced tumor progression in a mouse model of prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the gene expression profile of Foxf1 induced tumor progression in a mouse model of prostate cancer.  Foxf1 was over expressed using lentivirus and confirmed with both qPCR and western blot.  Gene Ontology analysis showed significant elevation of components of Erk5 MAPK signaling.

DESIGN
RNA was pooled from three separate control and Foxf1 over expressing TRAMP tumors after three weeks post-implantation into the subcutaneous compartment of syngenic mice
