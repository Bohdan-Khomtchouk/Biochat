TITLE
Genome-wide map of MCM3 and GFP-tagged ESCO2 mutants' binding in human fibroblast cell line vu1199-F SV40

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential co-localization of ESCO2 mutants with MCM3 in the human genome.

DESIGN
MCM3-ChIP and GFP-ChIP was performed on vu1199-F cells arrested in G1/S with aphidicolin.
