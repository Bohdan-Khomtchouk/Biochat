TITLE
Global gene expression profile of small intestine from wild-type and NHE3/CFTR double knockout mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify changes in gene expression levels between wild-type and NHE3/CFTR double knockout small intestine. Keywords: gene expression comparison

DESIGN
Six wild-type and six NHE3/CFTR double knockout small intestinal RNA samples were compared.  To facilitate statistical analysis and reduce affects of Cy3 and Cy5 labeling, reciprocal dye flips were used for half of the WT and double knockouts.

PLATFORM
