TITLE
CELF1, and RNA binding protein, regulates transcript networks in cultured embryonic cardiomyocytes.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We report on the regulation of transcripts following siRNA-mediated depletion of an RNA binding protein, CELF1, in primary chicken embryonic cardiomyocytes in culture.

DESIGN
Cultured chicken primary embryonic cardiomyocytes (isolated from embryonic day 8 hearts) were transfected with siRNA against CELF1 (n=3) or mock transfected (n=3) at 24 hours in culture.

PLATFORM
GPL16133 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Gallus gallus)
