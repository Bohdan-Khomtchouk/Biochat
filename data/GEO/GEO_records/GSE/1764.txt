TITLE
Effect of Oxandrolone on Muscle in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three subjects with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (8.3, 10.4, and 16.7 years old) were studied. Baseline studies included stable isotope infusion followed by gastrocnemius muscle biopsy to determine myosin heavy chain synthesis rates. RNA was isolated from the muscle biopsy as well. The subjects were then treated for 3 months with oxandrolone (a synthetic anabolic steroid, 0.1 mg/kg/day) and the studies repeated. Keywords = muscle Keywords = Duschenne muscular dystrophy Keywords = oxandrolone Keywords = androgen Keywords: parallel sample
