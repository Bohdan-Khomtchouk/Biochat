TITLE
Molecular characterization of a series of 22 NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
22 plexiform neurofibromas from 18 unrelated neurofibromatosis-type 1 patients were screened with a high resolution array-CGH. Each PNF DNA (somatic tumor DNA) was individually hybridized on Agilent whole human genome 244K microarrays (Platform GPL4091) using the matched genomic constitutional DNA (lymphocytes DNA) from the corresponding patient as reference, in order to detect tumor-specific aberrations.

DESIGN
NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas DNA vs. constitutional DNA
