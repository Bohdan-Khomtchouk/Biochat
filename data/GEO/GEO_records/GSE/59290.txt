TITLE
MiRNA23B REGULATES SELF-RENEWAL AND CHEMORESISTANCE PROPERTIES OF COLON CANCER STEM CELLS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MiRNAs have been identfied to play an important role in cancer stem cells. MiR23b is differentially expressed in various forms of cancer including colorectal cancer as compared to their normal counterparts. MiR23b regulates various aspects of cell behaviour such as differentiation, apoptosis and motility. The goal of the study was to identify the novel role of miR23b in self-renewal property of colon cancer stem cells via regulation of its candidate target mRNAs. To address this aim, HT29 colon cancer cells were transfected with miR23b Precursor, Antimir and their respective controls. RNA SEQ analysis of the cells with altered levels of miR23b assisted in the identification of interesting mRNA targets influenced by miR23b expression and involved self-renewal pathways.

DESIGN
HT29 cells with altered levels of miR23b was subjected to RNA SEQ analysis to identify differential expresssion of mRNA targets of mIR23b

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
