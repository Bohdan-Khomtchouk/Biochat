TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of host mRNA translation during hepatitis C virus infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation followed by microarray analysis was used to identify translationally-regulated mRNAs (mRNAs associated with ribosomes) from JFH1-infected and uninfected Huh-7.5.1 cells.

DESIGN
Huh7 cells were infected with HCV JFH-1 strain. Controls consisted in non-infected cells and infected cells treated with an anti-protease. 3 days after infection, cell lysates were subjected to sucrose-gradient centrifugation in order to isolate polysome-free RNAs from polysome-bound (translated) RNAs. The non-polysomal, polysomal as well as cytosolic (non fractionned) RNAs, from infected, non-infected, and infected-treated cells were subject sur microarray analysis.
