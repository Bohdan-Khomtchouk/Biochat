TITLE
RNA-seq of Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas under different developmental stages and stress treatments

ORGANISM
Crassostrea gigas

SUMMARY
Deep sequencing of samples from different development stages, different adult organs and different stress treatments of Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas

DESIGN
Samples of 38 developmental stages from egg to juvenile were analyzed using single-end 49 bp RNA-seq. Two libraries mixed by RNAs from different developmental stages were analyzed using paired-end 90 bp RNA-seq. A total of 11 samples mainly from 8 organs (mantle, gill,adductor muscle, digestive gland, hemocyte, labial palp, female gonad and male gonad) were analyzed using paired-end 90 bp RNA-seq. At the same time, single-end 49 bp RNA-seq was conducted on 61 samples collected from adult oysters subjected to 9 types of environmental stressors (exposure to air, salinity, temperature, and exposure to metals).
