TITLE
Nimblegen microarrays gene expression analysis of porcine transformed MSCs and sarcomas

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Osteosarcoma is a relatively rare solid tumour, but the most common primary bone cancer. It predominantly affects young people and is highly malignant, requiring aggressive surgical resection and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Five-year survival for patients with metastatic osteosarcoma is only around 30% 14. We report that pigs with heterozygous and homozygous inactivation of TP53 consistently develop osteosarcomas, providing a new model of osteosarcoma at human scale to understand and treat this devastating disease. Gene expression profiling and data analysis was further described in 'A porcine model of osteosarcoma' by Anja Saalfrank et al. (2016).

DESIGN
Differential gene expression profiles of MSCs and sarcomas relative to wild type in order to identify transcriptional changes associated with the stages of porcine MSC transformation
