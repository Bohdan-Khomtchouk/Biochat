TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana mutant leaves treated with Pseudomonas syringae ES4326

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In order to better understand the transcriptional networks triggered by pathogen inoculation, we monitored gene expression in leaves of mutant Arabidopsis plants, inoculated with Pseudomonas syringae ES4326 and wild type Col-0 plants grown in parallel.  Individual leaves were injected in the morning using a needle-less syringe with 10E5 cfu cm-2 PsmES4326 (suspended in 5 mM MgSO4).  For the wild type, leaves were also mock treated with 5 mM MgSO4.  Leaves were harvested 24 hours later.  Plants were grown in pots with BM-2 soil (Berger Peat Moss Ltd, Quebec, Canada) at a density of 9 plants per pot and kept at 22 degrees Celsius with 75% humidity and a 12 hour day length.
