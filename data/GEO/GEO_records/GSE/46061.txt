TITLE
Mouse Hepa1c1c7 cells: TCDD vs. TCDD plus blebbistatin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse Hepa1c1c7 cells comparing control TCDD-treated cells with Hepa1c1c7 cells treated with TCDD plus blebbistatin. The latter causes dysfunction of MYH9. Goal was to determine the effects of blebbistatin on global Hepa1c1c7 gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, TCDD treated Hepa1c1c7 vs. TCDD plus blebbistatin. Biological replicates: 1 TCDD sample, 1 TCDD plus blebbistatin sample.

PLATFORM
GPL10333 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Feature Number version)
