TITLE
Dilemma of quiescent HSCs with shorten telomere

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
quiescent HSCs have an elevated tolerance to accumulate genomic alterations in response to telomere shortening but the transmission of these aberrations to the progenitor cell level is prevented by senescence and apoptosis

DESIGN
HSC: g3 vs Wt, MPP: g3 vs Wt, Myeloid cell: g3 vs Wt.
