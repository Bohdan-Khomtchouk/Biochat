TITLE
FAIRE-chip in CHRF-288-11 and K562 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Maps of open chromatin in a megakaryocytic (CHRF-288-11) and an erythroblastoid (K562) cell line using the formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) method. We profiled chromatin structure at 62 non-redundant genetic loci representing all known associations (as of November 2009, CEU population) with 11 cardiovascular traits: coronary artery disease (CAD), (early-onset) myocardial infarction (MI), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet counts (PLT), platelet signaling (PLS), white blood cell counts (WBC), red blood cell counts (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), hypertension (HYP).

DESIGN
A total of 4 experiments: FAIRE using two different cross-linking times (8 and 12 min) in two cell types (CHRF-288-11 and K562 cells).
