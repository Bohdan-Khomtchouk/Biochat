TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings under shade avoidance condition at two different temperatures

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We carried out microarray analysis to investigate the global gene expression pattern in response to supplemental far-red light under different temperature contexts.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of four different conditions were used, in which two different signals (light quality and temperature), were indipendently varied.

PLATFORM
GPL198 [ATH1-121501] Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array
