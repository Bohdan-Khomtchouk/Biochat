TITLE
Subcellular RNA Sequencing Reveals Broad Presence of Cytoplasmic Intron-sequence Retaining Transcripts in Mouse and Rat Neurons.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent findings have revealed the complexity of the transcriptional landscape in mammalian cells. One recently described class of novel transcripts are the Cytoplasmic Intron-sequence Retaining Transcripts (CIRTs), hypothesized to confer post-transcriptional regulatory function. For instance, the neuronal CIRT KCNMA1i16 contributes to the firing properties of hippocampal neurons. We hypothesized that CIRTs may be present in a broad set of transcripts and comprise novel signals for post-transcriptional regulation. We carried out a transcriptome-wide survey of CIRTs by sequencing micro-dissected subcellular RNA fractions. Two batches of 150-300 individually dissected dendrites from primary cultures of hippocampal neurons in rat and three batches from mouse hippocampal neurons were sequenced. After statistical processing to minimize artifacts, we found a broad prevalence of CIRTs in the neurons in both species  (44-60% of the expressed transcripts). The analysis for CIRTs was also carried out by sequencing single cells from mouse brown adipose tissue and mouse cardiomyocytes. There was widespread prevalence of CIRTs in all of the cell types.

DESIGN
Single cell samples were aRNA amplified and sequenced using Illumina GA Analyzer II and Illumina Hiseq 2000
