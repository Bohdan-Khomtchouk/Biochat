TITLE
Time course IAA treatment Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
7-days-old Arabidopsis seedlings of wildtype (Col-0) were treated with 1 μM IAA for 15 minutes or 3 hours and gene expression of whole plant was analyzed using Affymetrix Gene 1.1 ST Array strips.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis seedling (Col-0) 25 plants were grown in each plate (1/2 MS medium) under continuous light at 22 °C for 6 or 7 days. Ten seedlings were cultured in 50 ml plastic tube containing liquid medium (1/2 MS medium), and incubated with shaking. After 24 hours, samples were treated with 0.1% DMSO for 15 minutes or 3 hours (Mock treatments) and with 1 μM indole-3-acetic acid dissolved in DMSO for 15 minutes or 3 hours (IAA tretments). The plants were wiped on papertowels and sampled. Immediately after sampling of the plants, these plants were soaked in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. The experiment was repeated 3 times in 3 different days. Total RNA was extracted from the frozen samples using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the protocol supplied by manufacturer. The quality of RNA was checked by 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent) and 100 ng RNA of each experiment was applied to microarray analysis. The microarray analysis was carried out using Affymetrix gene 1.1 ST array strips and GeneAtlas (Affymetrix) following the protocol supplied manufacturer.
