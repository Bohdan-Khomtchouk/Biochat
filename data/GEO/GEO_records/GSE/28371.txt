TITLE
WT vs KO mecA  comparison

ORGANISM
Streptococcus thermophilus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of S. thermophilus LMD-9 wild-type compared to the isogenic mutant strain CB052 (deletion of mecA, STER_0216) for the identification of the MecA regulon. Cells were grown in THB medium supplemented with glucose 1% (THBG) and sampled at OD600 = 0.4 for mRNA extraction

DESIGN
wild-type vs  knockout, 2 WT biological replicates (one used as technical replicate for a dye swap), 2 KO biological replicates (one used as technical replicate for a dye swap)

PLATFORM
GPL13365 UCL Streptococcus thermophilus 15K 60-mer array, Version 1, our ID Agilent-023342 LMD-9v2
