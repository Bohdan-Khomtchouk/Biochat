SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of S. thermophilus LMD-9 wild-type compared to the isogenic mutant strain CB052 (deletion of mecA, STER_0216) for the identification of the MecA regulon. Cells were grown in THB medium supplemented with glucose 1% (THBG) and sampled at OD600 = 0.4 for mRNA extraction
