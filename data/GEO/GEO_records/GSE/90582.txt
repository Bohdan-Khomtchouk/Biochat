TITLE
Gene expression profiling of LRRC26-depleted HCC70 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To serach gene expression change under knockdown of LRRC26, Leucin Rich Repeat Containing 26 in human triple negative breast cancer cells HCC70, we performed genome-wide DNA microarray analysis and compared the expression levels of control-siRNA treated cells and LRRC26-siRNA treates cells at 48 to 72 h after siRNA transfection

DESIGN
HCC70 cells were transfected with 10 nM of siRNA for EGFP(control) and LRRC26. After 48 hr and 72 h, cells were harvested and RNA was purified for microarray analysis.
