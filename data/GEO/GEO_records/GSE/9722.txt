TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Schistosoma mansoni larval development using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE)

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
Biomphalaria glabrata infection by the Schistosoma mansoni free-swimming miracidium and its subsequent development to the parasitic sporocyst stage is critical to establishment of viable infections and triggers a variety of physiological, biochemical and molecular changes.  Here, we describe a genome-wide analysis of the S. mansoni miracidium and developing sporocyst. Keywords: life-cycle, development, host-interaction
