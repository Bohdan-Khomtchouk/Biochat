TITLE
Temporal DNA methylation analysis (RRBS) for differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells deficient for Zeb2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we performed temporal profiling of DNA methylation by RRBseq of differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells using an embryoid body protocol. Analysis at d0, d4 and d6 revealed that Zeb2 deficient mESC lose their initially acquired DNA methylation at d6.

DESIGN
DNA methylation analysis using RRBseq was performed on Zeb2 KO and Ctrl (fl/fl) samples at 3 consecutive time-points - corresponding to ground-state mESC (d0), multi-potent progenitor (d4) and neural progenitor (d6) - in 2 independent experiments.
