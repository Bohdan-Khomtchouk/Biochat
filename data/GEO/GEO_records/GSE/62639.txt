TITLE
Gene expression profile on wt and mdx mice treated or untreated with Tadalafil

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray-based genomic analysis to assess the pattern of gene expression in muscle samples obtained from animals treated with tadalafil. This scrutiny allowed us to identify several classes of modulated genes that may provide hints for the identification of common factors underlying the improvement of muscle performance.

DESIGN
The pharmacological treatments were started before birth by oral administration  and continued after birth until 16 weeks of age.
