TITLE
Expression data from tissues during somatic embryogenesis in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We collected tissues from bent cotyledon stage zygotic embryos, proliferating tissue at day 7 and day 14 induction of somatic embryogenesis and mature somatic emrbyos in a wild type (Col-0) and vtc2 (SALK_146824) insertion. We used microarrays to identify global patterns of gene activity during somatic embryogenesis in a wild type (Col-0) and vitamin C deficient mutant (vtc2)

DESIGN
RNA was extracted and amplified from four stages of somatic embryogenesis (bent cotyledon, day 7 induction, day 14 induction, and mature somatic embryos) in a wild type (Col-0) and vitamin C deficient mutant (vtc2) before being hybridized to the Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip in duplicate (two biological replicates).
