TITLE
CHD7 targets active gene enhancer elements to modulate ES cell-specific gene expression.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes were measured between mouse ES cells of three genotypes: WT Chd7, Heterzygous Chd7 Null, Homozygous Chd7 Null.  The hypothesis being tested was that CHD7, a chromatin remodeling protein, functions as a transcriptional regulator.  This experiment was performed to detect gene targets of CHD7-mediated regulation. We report the genome-wide binding profile of CHD7, the protein implicated in CHARGE syndrome, in mouse ES cells using ChIP-Seq technology. Combining these data with other genomic datasets, we discover CHD7 to colocalize with other transcription factors including Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and p300 at gene enhancer elements to regulate ES cell specific gene expression.

DESIGN
Chd7 wildtype, heterozygous, and homozygous ES cells derived from preimplantation embryos were grown on feeder cells and total RNA was isolated using Trizol. The ratio of ES to feeder cells was estimated at 5:1. ChIP sequencing of CHD7 and p300 in mouse ES cells
