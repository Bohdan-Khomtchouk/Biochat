TITLE
HDAC3 modulates enhancer activity to regulate terminal B cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
B220+GL7+ (GC) and B220+GL7- (non-GC) B cells were sorted from SRBC-immunized mice deficient for Hdac3 and wild type controls. RNA-sequencing revealed an upregulation of critical regulators of B cell differentiation in Hdac3-deleted animals.

DESIGN
10 days post-immunization with SRBCs, GC and non-GC B cells were sorted and RNA isolated by Trizol extraction for RNA-sequencing. 2 replicates were sequenced for each condition.
