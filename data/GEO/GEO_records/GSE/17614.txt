TITLE
Microarray analysis on tumours of mice supplemented with oil palm phenolics (OPP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
OPP (1500 ppm gallic acid equivalent (GAE)) was supplemented to BALB/c mice inoculated subcutaneously with J558 myeloma cells at the dorsum of the neck in order to observe possible anti-cancer effects. Tumours which developed were harvested four weeks after inoculation of the cells for gene expression studies. Results show that genes involved in the cell cycle were differentially expressed, and that OPP may have anti-cancer properties in vivo.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from J558 tumours which developed in BALB/c mice given OPP (four weeks after subcutaneous inoculation of J558 myeloma cells) were compared to controls given distilled water (three replicates in the treatment group versus four replicates in the control group)
