TITLE
Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730: Before vs after exposure to 0.5% bile.

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus reuteri

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730 mid-log cultures before vs after exposure to 0.5% bovine bile (oxgall). Two sets of array experiments were performed.  One set compared the expression profiles of L. reuteri ATCC 55730 cells before bile exposure vs cells that had been exposed to 0.5% bile for 15 minutes (bile shock).  The other set compared the expression profiles of L. reuteri ATCC 55730 cells before bile exposure vs cells that had begun growing again in the presence of 0.5% bile (bile adaptation). Keywords: Stress response
