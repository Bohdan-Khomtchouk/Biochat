TITLE
Gene expression data from the tumor cell supernatant-induced MDSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) markedly expand and participate in the suppression of immune responses in inflammation and tumor microenvironment. It was confirmed that MDSCs could be generated in vitro from bone marrow cells (BMCs) after 4 days GM-CSF only or GM-CSF plus IL-6 treatment. To identify the regulation of MDSCs in tumor microenvironment, we analyzed the gene expression from tumor cell ID8 supernant-induced MDSCs compared to BMCs.

DESIGN
BMCs were obtained from the femurs of C57BL/6 mice and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS. To prepare the tumor cell supernatant-induced CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs in vitro, 5×10^4 1D8 tumor cells (upper chamber) were co-cultured with 2×10^6 BMCs (lower chamber) in a 24-transwell plate for 4 days. Then, total RNA was extracted by using Trizol reagent to perform microarray to analyze the differentially gene expression in ID8 supernatant-induced MDSCs or BMCs.
