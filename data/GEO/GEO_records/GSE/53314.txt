TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from human high-density lipoproteins.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We quantified differential microRNA (miRNA) expression on human HDL before and after incubation with human coronary artery endothelial cells. These data were used to determine which miRNAs are altered on HDL (taken up or effluxed to) by human coronary artery endothelial cells.

DESIGN
Each group had a n=4 and HDL-miRNA levels post incubations were compared to pre incubations with cells.
