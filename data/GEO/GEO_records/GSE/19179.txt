TITLE
Gene expression profile of Serially Mixed samples of MDA-MB231 and Mouse Astrocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To test specificity of human microarray probes against mouse mRNA serially mixed human MDA-MB231 cancer cells' mRNAs with mouse Astrocytes were hybridized against human microarray and vice versa by changing the ratios of human and mouse samples from 100% to 0%.

DESIGN
Mixed human: 1 MDA-MB231, 1 MDA231_Astro(91), 2 MDA231_Astro(73), 2 MDA231_Astro(55),2 MDA231_Astro(37),1 MDA231_Astro(19), 1 Astrocytes Mixed mouse: 1 MDA-MB231, 1 MDA231_Astro(91), 2 MDA231_Astro(73), 2 MDA231_Astro(55),2 MDA231_Astro(37),1 MDA231_Astro(19), 1 Astrocytes
