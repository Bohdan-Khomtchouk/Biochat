TITLE
CXCL12 Mediated T-Cell Migration Via Activation of Wnt5A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 play important roles in signaling and migration of T-cells, but little is known about the transcriptional events involved in CXCL12-mediated T-cell migration. In this study we performed microarray analysis on CXCL12- treated T-cells, and found that the Wnt family of proteins was significantly upregulated during CXCL12 treatment. Confirmation of these results by real-time PCR and Western analysis indicated that the non-canonical Wnt pathway was specifically upregulated during CXCL12 treatment. In vitro and in vivo knockdown studies confirm that b-catenin (the key mediator of canonical Wnt signaling) is not involved in the CXCL12-mediated migration of T-cells. However, Wnt5A, a non-canonical Wnt protein, increases signaling through the CXCL12/ CXCR4 axis via Protein Kinase C (PKC). Our results demonstrated that CXCL12 required Wnt5A to mediate T-cell migration, and the treatment of T-cells with recombinant Wnt5A sensitized T-cells to CXCL12 induced migration. Additionally, Wnt5A expression was required for the sustained expression of CXCR4, both transcriptionally and translationally. These results could be translated in vivo, using EL4 thymoma metastasis as a model of T-cell migration. Taken together our data indicate, for the first time, that Wnt5A is a critical mediator of the CXCL12/ CXCR4 signaling axis. Keywords: Wnt5A, CXCL12, CXCL12, CXCR4, T-cell Migration
