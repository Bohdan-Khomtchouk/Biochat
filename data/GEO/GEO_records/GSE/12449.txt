TITLE
CXCL12 Mediated T-Cell Migration Via Activation of Wnt5A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 play important roles in signaling and migration of T-cells, but little is known about the transcriptional events involved in CXCL12-mediated T-cell migration. In this study we performed microarray analysis on CXCL12- treated T-cells, and found that the Wnt family of proteins was significantly upregulated during CXCL12 treatment. Confirmation of these results by real-time PCR and Western analysis indicated that the non-canonical Wnt pathway was specifically upregulated during CXCL12 treatment. In vitro and in vivo knockdown studies confirm that b-catenin (the key mediator of canonical Wnt signaling) is not involved in the CXCL12-mediated migration of T-cells. However, Wnt5A, a non-canonical Wnt protein, increases signaling through the CXCL12/ CXCR4 axis via Protein Kinase C (PKC). Our results demonstrated that CXCL12 required Wnt5A to mediate T-cell migration, and the treatment of T-cells with recombinant Wnt5A sensitized T-cells to CXCL12 induced migration. Additionally, Wnt5A expression was required for the sustained expression of CXCR4, both transcriptionally and translationally. These results could be translated in vivo, using EL4 thymoma metastasis as a model of T-cell migration. Taken together our data indicate, for the first time, that Wnt5A is a critical mediator of the CXCL12/ CXCR4 signaling axis. Keywords: Wnt5A, CXCL12, CXCL12, CXCR4, T-cell Migration

DESIGN
Primary T cells were treated with human CXCL12 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) at 100 ng/ml  per 10 million cells overnight in a humidified incubator at 37ºC with 5% CO2. Control cells were incubated in media only. Cells were harvested and washed with ice cold PBS for 2 times followed by the addition of ice cold TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and frozen at -80ºC overnight. Total RNA was isolated using the RNA isolation kit manufactured by Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The cDNA was prepared from equal amount of RNA using a cDNA preparation kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) followed by preparation of cRNA according to manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).  The cRNA was amplified and labeled with either Cy-3 or Cy-5, using the Agilent low-input linear amplification kit, according to manufacturer’s protocols. Labeled cRNA were applied to the Human 44K whole genome oligo array slides (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).  Slides were hybridized in a rotating chamber overnight at 60ºC in 6X SSC. Next day, slides were washed with 0.005% Triton X-102 for 10 minutes, and then in 0.1X SSC, 0.005% Triton X-102 for 5 minutes on ice. Slides were dried using a nitrogen-filled air gun, and scanned using an Agilent scanner. Images were analyzed using the Agilent Feature Extractor Software, Version A.7.5.1 and ratios for each spot were calculated.
