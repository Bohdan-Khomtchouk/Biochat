TITLE
Gene expression profiling of 51 human breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Basal gene expression levels were determined by global gene expression profiling of breast cancer cell lines. Molecular subtype was determined using gene expression and HER2 status assesses by HER2 FISH analysis. Keywords: Basal gene expression (no stimulation or timecourse)

DESIGN
RNA was prepared from cell lines cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum
