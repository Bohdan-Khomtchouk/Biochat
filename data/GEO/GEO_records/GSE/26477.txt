TITLE
Nuclear Scaffold Attachment Sites in HeLa Cells Across 1% of the Human Genome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The nuclear scaffold, consisting of structural and functional nuclear proteins, remains after extraction of nuclei and anchors loops of DNA.  In the search for cis-elements functioning as chromatin domain boundaries, we mapped 453 nuclear scaffold attachment sites purified by lithium-3,5-iodosalicylate from HeLa cells across 30 Mb of the human genome studied by the ENCODE pilot project.  The scaffold attachment sites recovered mapped predominately near expressed genes and localized near transcription start sites and the ends of genes.
