TITLE
Microarray of pancreatic cancer and healthy tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analyses of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and adjacent ductal epithelia from the same patient using bulk vs LCM dissected samples. Our results indicate that laser capture microdissection (LCM) is necessary to identify differentially expressed genes that discriminate between PDAC and healthy pancreatic ductal tissue.

DESIGN
Pancreatic tissues were collected at time of surgery and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction and Affymetrix GeneChip Expression analyses.
