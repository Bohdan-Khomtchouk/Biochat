TITLE
Human Fibroblast cells immortalised cells: Control vs DNA damage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human fibroblast cells after DNA damage with Camptothecin or Etoposide or Neocarzinostatin Upon DNA damage, the DNA damage response (DDR) elicits a complex signaling cascade, which includes the induction of multiple non-coding RNA species. Recently long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to contribute to DDR by regulating gene expression. However, very little is known about the role that lncRNAs play in regulating DNA Repair. Using a genome-wide microarray screen we identified a novel ubiquitously expressed lncRNA, DDSR1 (DNA damage-sensitive RNA 1), which is induced upon DNA damage by several DNA double-strand break (DSB) agents.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Control vs. DNA damage human fibroblast cells. No Replicates, DNA damage was induced with either Camptothecin or Etoposide or Neocarzinostatin, Total RNA or Nuclear RNA was profiled.
