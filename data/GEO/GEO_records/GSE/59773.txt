TITLE
Insights into the epigenomic landscape of the human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae

ORGANISM
Anopheles gambiae

SUMMARY
We characterize the epigenome of the human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae in midgut cells by mapping the distribution and levels of two post-translational histone modifications, H3K27ac and H3K27me3. These histone profiles were then correlated with levels of gene expression obtained by RNA-seq.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq and RNA-seq were performed on adult female A. gambiae midguts. RNA-seq was performed on adult female A. gambiae salivary glands.
