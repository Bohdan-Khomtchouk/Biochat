TITLE
Brain BRCA1 conditional knockout

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BRCA1 nestin CRE conditional knockout cortrices of P7 animals were compared to wildtype littermates to characterize the mutant phenotype. Keywords: expression

DESIGN
BRCA1 conditional knockouts using nestin CRE and a null allele with an inverted  neo cassette at the 5' end of the exon 11 of BRCA1 on one floxed allele  flanking exons 5-13. Cortices of 3 wildtype animals were compred to 3 BRCA cKO at postnatal day 7.
