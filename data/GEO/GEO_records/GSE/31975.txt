TITLE
cell wall mutants -Differentially expressed genes in stems of Arabidopsis deficient in monolignol export and in stems of Arabidopsis plants expressing a hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase/lyase

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au10-13_cellwall - cell wall mutants  - What is the impact of the loss of function of monolignol exporters? How does the plant cope with these transporters? Is there any compensation mechanism induced? What is the impact on lignin and cell wall biosynthesis? Does expression of a hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase/lyase in Arabidopsis stems generate a stress and affect genes involoved in cell wall biosynthesis? - Determine differentially expressed genes in stems of Arabidopsis plants lacking 2 monolignol exporter proteins. mRNA from stems of wild-type and transgenic 7-week-old plants grown in the same conditions were extracted and used for transcriptomic analysis. Three independant cultures were conducted for biological replicates. Determine differentially expressed genes in stems of Arabidopsis plants that express a hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase/lyase. mRNA from stems of wild-type and transgenic seven-week-old plants grown in the same conditions were extracted and used for transcriptomic analysis.
