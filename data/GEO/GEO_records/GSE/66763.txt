TITLE
Functional Inflammatory Profiles Distinguish Myelin-Reactive T Cells from Patients with Multiple Sclerosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Myelin-reactive T cells have been identified in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy subjects with comparable frequencies, but the contribution of these autoreactive T cells to disease pathology remains unknown. A total of 13,324 T cell libraries generated from blood of 23 patients and 22 healthy controls were interrogated for reactivity to myelin antigens. Libraries derived from CCR6+ myelin-reactive T cells from patients with MS exhibited significantly enhanced production of IFN-Î³, IL-17, and GM-CSF compared to healthy controls. Single-cell clones isolated by MHC/peptide tetramers from CCR6+ T cell libraries also secreted more pro-inflammatory cytokines while clones isolated from controls secreted more IL-10. The transcriptomes of myelin-specific CCR6+ T cells from patients with MS were distinct from those derived from healthy controls, and of note, were enriched in Th17-induced experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) gene signatures and gene signatures derived from Th17 cells isolated other human autoimmune diseases. These data, although not casual, imply that functional differences between antigen specific T cells from MS and healthy controls is fundamental to disease development and support the notion that IL-10 production from myelin-reactive T cells may act to limit disease progression, or even pathogenesis.
