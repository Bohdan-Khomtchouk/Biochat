TITLE
Study of mating type genes and their roles in mating interactions of the basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune

ORGANISM
Schizophyllum commune

SUMMARY
Transcriptome changes associated with mating interactions were performed in order to identify signaling components and targets of pheromone response. Two monokaryons  (S. commune 12-43 and  4-39), a dikaryon (W22 x 12-43), both semi-compatible mating interactions (Aon: W22 x 4-39; Bon, flat: W21 x 4-39), and different S. commune pheromone receptor recipient strains (Vbar2f, Vbar2t) were analyzed for that purpose. In addition, a S. commune strain showing the thin-phenotype (W22-thin) was investigated to figure out the role of Thn1 in mating.

DESIGN
With microarray analysis mRNA expression in different mating interactions of the basidiomycete S. commune was analyzed. Genes which show regulation in the comparison of the two monokaryons 12-43 and 4-39 has been eliminated from other comparisons as strain specific differences. Two biological or technical replicate samples were analyzed for each condition.
