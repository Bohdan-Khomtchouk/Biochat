TITLE
Expression data from adult Rattus liver

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Activation of the pregnane X receptor (NR1I2) by drugs and other xenobiotics stimulates (or suppresses) expression of numerous genes involved in the metabolic elimination of foreign compounds and some toxic endogenous substrates. We used microarray analysis to identify genes whose expression in rat liver was significantly altered by pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile (PCN) treatment. Keywords: a single ip injection of PCN (100 mg/kg), 8 h treatment

DESIGN
We chose to profile the gene expression pattern in the livers of adult rats to test the idea that PCN counteracts a wide variety of stresses by activating genes apart from drug metabolism.
