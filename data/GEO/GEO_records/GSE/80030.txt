TITLE
mRNA profile between 1/3 partial hepatectomy (PH) and 2/3 PH at 24 hours

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Six rats underwent partial hepatectomy (PH) (3, 1/3PH; 3, 2/3PH). The total mRNA of three rats each group were pooled and compared by microarray to selected the mRNA which differs between between 2/3PH with robust DNA replication and 1/3PH with a minimal replicative response.
