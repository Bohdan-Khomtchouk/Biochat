TITLE
Profiling long non-coding RNA expression in oral premalignant lesions.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oral epithelial dysplasias are believed to progress through a series of histopathological stages; from mild to severe dysplasia, to carcinoma in situ, and finally to invasive OSCC. Underlying this change in histopathological grade are gross chromosome alterations and changes in gene expression of both protein-coding genes and non-coding RNAs. Recent papers have described associations of aberrant expression of microRNAs, one class of non-coding RNAs, with oral cancer. However, expression profiling of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has not been reported. Long non-coding RNAs are a novel class of mRNA-like transcripts with no protein coding capacity, but with a variety of functions including roles in epigenetics and gene regulation. In recent reports, the aberrant expression of lncRNAs has been associated with human cancers, suggesting a critical role in tumorigenesis. Here, we present the first long non-coding RNA expression map for the human oral mucosa. We describe the expression of 325 long non-coding RNAs, suggesting lncRNA expression contributes significantly to the oral transcriptome. Intriguingly, 60% of the detected lncRNAs show aberrant expression in oral premalignant lesions. A number of these lncRNAs have been previously associated with other human cancers.

DESIGN
A total of six normal oral samples and ten oral premalignant lesions were used to construct SAGE libraries which were then queried for long non-coding RNA expression profiles. The six normal oral samples were previously deposited as GSE8127.
