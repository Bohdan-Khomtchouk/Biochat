TITLE
Gene expression profile of HCCs developed in miR-122 knockout mice compared to age-matched wild type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of HCCs developed in miR-122 knockout mice compared to age-matched wild type mice. The significance of our study is that miR-122 knockout mice spontaneously develop liver tumors and the gene expression profile demonstrated dysregulation of several pathways involved in liver disease and HCC.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, liver tumor vs. normal liver. 8 biological replicates.

PLATFORM
