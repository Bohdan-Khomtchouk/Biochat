TITLE
AGO1-dependent Small RNA in Arabidopsis Identified by High-Throughput Sequencing

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify AGO1-dependent miRNA and tasiRNA in Arabidopsis by sequencing small RNA from wild type (Col-0) and ago1-25 plants. Keywords: Small RNA

DESIGN
Sequencing-by-synthesis technology was used to sequence small RNA from flower tissue (stages 1-12) from wild-type (Col-0) and ago1-25 Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Three biological replicates were sequenced for both Col-0 and ago1-25.
