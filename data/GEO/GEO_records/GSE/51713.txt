TITLE
Genome-wide map of H3K4me3 binding sites by ChIP-seq in human lymphoblastoid cell lines treated with doxorubicin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used chromatin immune-precipitation with parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) technology to identify genome-wide H3K4me3 binding in human lymphoblastoid cell lines treated with a DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic reagent doxorubicin.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq analysis of H3K4me3 binding sites in human lymphoblastoid cells treated with Doxorubicin or vehicle

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
