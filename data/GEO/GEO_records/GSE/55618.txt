TITLE
Toxicogenomic profiling in the whole zebrafish embryo after exposure to reference hepatotoxicants.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zebrafish embryos have been proposed as an attractive alternative model system for hepatotoxicity testing. In this study we determined gene expression responses after exposure to reference hepatotoxicants and controls to identify biomarkers for hepatotoxicity.

DESIGN
188 samples; hepatotoxic compounds at 3 concentrations and with multiple replicates; negative controls at single concentration and with multiple replicates; water (DSW) and 0.2% DMSO vehicle control.

PLATFORM
GPL18378 [ZebGene-1_1-st] Affymetrix Genechip Zebrafish ST Genome Array 1.1, brainarray version 15 [zebgene11st_Dr_ENTREZG]
