TITLE
Quantification of RNA editing in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report the application of mmPCR-seq to male whole body samples from 131 strains of the DGRP. We quantified RNA editing at 605 different loci using a microfluidic multiplex PCR method coupled with deep sequencing.

DESIGN
RT-PCR amplification of 605 loci from 131 fly strains to quantify RNA editing levels.
