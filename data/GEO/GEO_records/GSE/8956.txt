TITLE
Batch wt vs hyper +_- pABA Normal int_Filtered fg-bg2

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis upon the overexpression of the folate gene cluster on a high copy plasmid when compared to an empty vector in the lactic acid bacterium L. plantarum. The transcriptional response was determined for both strains in the presence and absence of pABA thereby using the hybridisation sceme as described in the data processing section. Keywords: response to folate gene cluster overexpression and pABA treatment
