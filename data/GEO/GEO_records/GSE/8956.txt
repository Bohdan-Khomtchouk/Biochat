TITLE
Batch wt vs hyper +_- pABA Normal int_Filtered fg-bg2

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis upon the overexpression of the folate gene cluster on a high copy plasmid when compared to an empty vector in the lactic acid bacterium L. plantarum. The transcriptional response was determined for both strains in the presence and absence of pABA thereby using the hybridisation sceme as described in the data processing section. Keywords: response to folate gene cluster overexpression and pABA treatment

DESIGN
The batch experiment with and without pABA scheme consisted of a loop design with 21 microarrays with the following samples hybridized on one array and labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively: C1+P and F1+P, F1+P and C2+P, C2+P and F3+P, F3+P and C3+P, C3+P and F2+P, F2+P and C1+P, C1+P and C2+P, F2+P and F3+P, C1-P and F1-P, F1-P and C2-P, C2-P and F3-P, F3-P and C3-P, C3-P and F2-P, F2-P and C1-P, C1-P and C2-P, F2-P and F3-P, C3-P and F1+P, F2+P and C1-P, C2+P and F3-P, F1-P and C3+P, and F2+P and F1-P. Here, C1+P, C2+P, C3+P, F1+P, F2+P, and F3+P represent biological triplicates of the L. plantarum harboring pNZ7021 and pNZ7026, respectively, when grown in batch in the presence of pABA. The C1-P, C2-P, C3-P, F1-P, F2-P, and F3-P, represents the L. plantarum harboring pNZ7021 and pNZ7026, respectively, when grown in batch in the absence of pABA.
