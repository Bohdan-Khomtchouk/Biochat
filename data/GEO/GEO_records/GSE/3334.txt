TITLE
Genomic Profiling of Mixer and Sox17beta Targets During Xenopus Endoderm Development

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
The transcription factors Mixer and Sox17beta have well characterized roles in endoderm specification during Xenopus embryogenesis.  In order to more thoroughly understand the mechanisms by which these endodermal regulators act, we expressed Mixer and Sox17beta in na√Øve ectodermal tissue and, using oligonucleotide-based microarrays, compared their genomic transcriptional profile to that of unaffected tissue.  Using this novel approach, we identified 71 transcripts that are upregulated by Mixer or Sox17beta, 63 of which have previously uncharacterized roles in endoderm development.   Furthermore, an in situ hybridization screen using antisense probes for several of these clones identified six targets of Mixer and/or Sox17beta that are expressed in the endoderm during gastrula stages, providing new and regional markers of the endoderm.  Our results contribute further insight into the functions of Mixer and Sox17beta and bring us closer to understanding at the molecular level the pathways that regulate endoderm development. Keywords: comparative genomic response to cell type specification
