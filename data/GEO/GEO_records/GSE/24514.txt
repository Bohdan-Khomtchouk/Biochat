TITLE
Expression data from human MSI colorectal cancer and normal colonic mucosa

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microsatellite instability (MSI), caused by defective mismatch repair, is observed in a subset of colorectal cancers (CRCs). We evaluated somatic mutations in microsatellite repeats of genes chosen based on reduced expression in MSI CRC and existence of a coding mononucleotide repeat.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of  34 MSI colorectal cancers and 15 normal colonic mucosas was performed in 2002. Comparison of malignant and healthy tissue.
