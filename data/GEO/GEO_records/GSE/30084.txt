TITLE
Expression levels of xenobiotic transporters in kideny of Abcb4-null mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The renal clearance of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) increased in Abcb4 null mice compared with wild type mice, especially in male Abcb4 null mice. We evaluated the expression changes of transporters in kidney of male Abcb4 null mice by using microarray to reveal the candidate transporters of PFOA.

DESIGN
Male of Abcb4-null mice and wild-type mice (3 mice of 8 weeks old in each group) were sacrificed, collected their kidneys. Six independent experiments were performed.
