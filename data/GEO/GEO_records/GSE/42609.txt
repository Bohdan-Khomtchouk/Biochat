TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of exogenously supplied and transgenic of senescence-induced cytokinin for broccoli postharvest yellowing improvement

ORGANISM
Brassica oleracea var. italica

SUMMARY
Both exogenously supplied and transgenic induced cytokinin production can effectively delay senescence of broccoli florets during postharvest storage. However, a substantial comparison between the mechanisms of these two treatments on delaying broccoli florets senescence was absent. Here, we conduct microarray analysis on broccoli florets of N6-benzylaminopurine treated and ipt-transgenic broccoli that harbor a senescence-associated-gene promoter triggering isopentenyltransferase gene expression during postharvest storage.

DESIGN
Analysis used RNA of Green King inbred line 104 as control sample for comparison to the experimental samples of ipt-transgenic line 102, 103 and parental line Green King as well as 10 ppm BA treated Green King at harvest and after postharvest storage at 25 centigrade in the dark for 4 days.
