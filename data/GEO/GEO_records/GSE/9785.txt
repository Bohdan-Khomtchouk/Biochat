TITLE
Expression data from Newborn mice infected with Shigella flexneri

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the developmental changes controlling the switch from disease susceptibility to resistance, we performed global gene expression analysis on non-infected and infected intestinal tissues taken from 4-day- and 7-day-old animals. Keywords: time course of infection

DESIGN
RNA from intestinal tissues of 4-day- or 7-day-old mice infected or not with invasive (INV+) or non-invasive (INV-) Shigella strains during 2 or 4 hours were hybridized on Murine MOE430A Affymetrix Genechip.
