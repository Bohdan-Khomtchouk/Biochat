TITLE
ZNF750 Interacts with KLF4 and Specific Chromatin Regulators to Control Epidermal Differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we find that ZNF750 activates epidermal differentiation genes and represses progenitor genes as part of two distinct protein complexes

DESIGN
Identified genomic binding sites of ZNF750 and its interacting proteins

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
