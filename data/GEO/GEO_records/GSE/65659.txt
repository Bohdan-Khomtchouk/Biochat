TITLE
Parallel Epigenomic and Transcriptomic Responses to Viral Infection in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera)

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
Here, we examined the transcriptional and epigenetic (DNA methylation) responses to viral infection in honey bee workers.  One-day old worker honey bees were fed solutions containing Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV), a virus which causes muscle paralysis and death and has previously been associated with colony loss.  Uninfected control and infected, symptomatic bees were collected within 20-24 hours after infection.  Worker fat bodies, the primary tissue involved in metabolism, detoxification and immune responses, were collected for analysis. We performed transcriptome- and bisulfite-sequencing of the worker fat bodies to identify genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation patterns associated with viral infection.  There were 753 differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.05) in infected versus control bees, including several genes involved in epigenetic and antiviral pathways. DNA methylation status of 156 genes (FDR < 0.1) changed significantly as a result of the infection, including those involved in antiviral responses in humans.  There was no significant overlap between the significantly differentially expressed and significantly differentially methylated genes, and indeed, the genomic characteristics of these sets of genes were quite distinct. Our results indicate that honey bees have two distinct molecular pathways, mediated by transcription and methylation, that modulate protein levels and/or function in response to viral infections.
