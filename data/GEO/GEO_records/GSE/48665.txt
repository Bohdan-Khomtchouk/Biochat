TITLE
Genome wide analysis of human iPS cell lines generated with non-integrative plasmids and knock-down of P53 gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of transient knock down of P53 as a tool to increase the efficiency of a non-integrative methodology for reprogramming adult human normal dermal fibroblasts. This study demonstrate that transient knockdown of P53 is an efficient way to produce iPSC containing minimal genomic alterations, which meets the increased demand for iPSC in personalized drug screening campaigns.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 3 iPS cell lines generated without P53 knockdown and 3 generated with P53 knockdown. In addition total RNA was isolated from the parental normal human dermal fibroblasts and from a reference human iPS cell line from Systembio (SBI).
