TITLE
Mapping and dynamics of regulatory DNA and transcription factor networks in A. thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We mapped DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) and applied genomic footprinting to define in vivo transcription factor (TF) occupancy at nucleotide resolution across the A. thaliana genome in whole seedlings during heat- and light-response states. We find that trait-associated variation localizes within DHSs, and that extensive TF occupancy within protein-coding exons has shaped A. thaliana codon usage. Analysis of > 700,000 TF footprints disclosed an extensive cis-regulatory lexicon, and enabled construction of large-scale TF cross-regulatory networks. Although the cis- and trans-regulatory repertoire is markedly distinct from mammals, the architecture of A. thaliana TF networks is strikingly similar to those of human. Analysis of the DHS landscape and TF network dynamics during heat shock and photomorphogenesis revealed thousands of conditionally-sensitive elements and enabled mapping of key regulatory circuits. Our results provide an extensive resource for understanding and enabling diverse aspects of A. thaliana biology.

DESIGN
Chromatin accessibility profiling (Dnase I-seq) and RNA-seq of 7-day-old dark-grown seedlings exposed to 0hr light, 30min light, 3hr light or 24hr LD conditions.  Chromatin accessibility profiling (Dnase I-seq) and RNA-seq of 7-day-old LD-grown seedlings treated with a brief sever heat shock or kept under control conditions. Replicates are included when available; controls and read-normalized samples (samples that were subsampled to the same read-depth) are also included here.

PLATFORM
