TITLE
APOL1 variant expression in mouse podocytes cause kidney disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become an important tool in molecular charactarization of animal models. APOL1 variants are associated with end stage renal disease in African Americans. We developed a mouse model with podocyte specific over expression of APOL1. Differential molecular signatures were identified between the groups by RNA-Sequencing on kidney.

DESIGN
Total RNA of transgenic and control mice kidneys was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed with the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and RIN scores above 7 were used for cDNA production. Library was prepared and one microgram total RNA was used to isolate poly(A) purified mRNA using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Preparation Kit. We sequence our sample for single-end 100bp, and the annotated RNA counts (fastq) were calculated by Illuminaâ€™s CASAVA 1.8.2.
