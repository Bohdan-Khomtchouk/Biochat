TITLE
Effect of ablation of Sfrp5 on gene expression in gonadal white adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified secreted frizzled-related protein-5 (Sfrp5) as a transcript that is upregulated during adipocyte differentiation and that is increased in white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese mice, compared to lean mice. To investigate the function of sFRP5 in adipose tissue biology, we studied sFRP5Q27stop mice, in which ENU mutagenesis was used to create a premature stop codon at Gln27, thereby creating a likely null allele.

DESIGN
Male wild-type or Sfrp5 KO (Q27Stop) mice were fed a high-fat diet from the ages of four weeks to twelve weeks. At twelve weeks of age, mice were euthanized. Total RNA was then isolated from gonadal WAT and RNA was analyzed by Affymetrix microarrays. Seven wild-type and eight Sfrp5 KO mice were used.
