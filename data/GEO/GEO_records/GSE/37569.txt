TITLE
CA04M001 - Virus Dose and Time Response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Determination of the host response (C57Bl6 mouse model) to A/CA04/2009 virus infection at 4 doses and 4 time points post infection.

DESIGN
Groups of 20 week old C57BL6 mice were infected with H1N1 A/CA/04/2009 at 4 doses:10^3, 10^4, 10^5 and 10^6 PFU and time-matched mock infection. Time points were 1, 2, 4 and 7 d.p.i.  There were 3-4 animals/dose/time point. Lung samples were collected for virus load, transcriptional and proteomics analysis. Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
