TITLE
Molecular Signature of MT1-MMP: Transactivation of the Downstream Universal Gene in Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression profiling of MT1-MMP–overexpressing versus MT1-MMP–silenced cancer cells and a further data mining analysis of the preexisting expression database of 190 human tumors of 14 cancer types led us to identify 11 genes, the expression of which correlated firmly and universally with that of MT1-MMP (P < 0.00001).
