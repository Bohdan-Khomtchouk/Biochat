TITLE
Transcript expression in circulating whole blood after saline injections

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
These experiments were designed to produce the appropriate controls so that their cohort's transcript (mRNA) changes in whole circulating blood could be determined.  The cohorts were exposed to D-amphetamine under a neurotoxic and non-neurotoxic condition or subjected to elevated environmental temperatures that produced a hyperthermia very similar to heat stroke.  The cohort data is in a separate, but linked, GEO file.

DESIGN
Animals were given four doses of 1 ml/ kg of normal saline with two hours in between each dose.  The animals body temperature was determined every 1 h and the rats were sacrificed 3 h after the last saline injection.  Animals were not given access to food or water during this period so that they were more suitable controls for the amphetamine treatment groups
