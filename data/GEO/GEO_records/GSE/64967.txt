TITLE
The effects of ibuprofen on the transcriptome of a euryhaline fish

ORGANISM
Menidia beryllina

SUMMARY
Ibuprofen is one of the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluent; however the effects of ibuprofen on aquatic organisms are poorly understood. This study presents the transcriptome-wide response of the inland silverside, Menidia beryllina, to chronic 14 d exposures to ibuprofen.

DESIGN
Twenty-four samples were run on twenty-four arrays, there were six replicates for each of three ibuprofen exposure concentrations and a control group.
