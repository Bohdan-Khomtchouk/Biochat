TITLE
Viral microRNA expression in two nasal NK T cell lymphoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used microarray profiling to examine the expression of viral microRNAs (miRNAs) in two independently derived nasal natural killer T cell lymphoma (NKTCL) cell lines, SNK6 and SNT16.  The goal of the study was to investigate the role of the viral miRNAs in the genesis and maintenance of NKTCLs.

DESIGN
This experiment includes a total of 2 samples, one from SNK6 cells and the other from SNT16 cells.
