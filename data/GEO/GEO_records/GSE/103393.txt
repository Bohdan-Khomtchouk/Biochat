TITLE
Small RNA-seq during acute maximal exercise reveal RNAs involved in vascular inflammation and cardiometabolic health

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Circulating ex-RNAs altered in plasma after acute exercise target pathways involved in inflammation, including miR-181b-5p.

DESIGN
Plasma circulating miRNAs were measured before and after exercise by the ABCAM FirePlex platform

PLATFORM
GPL23975 Abcam Human FirePlex miRNA assay
