TITLE
A faithful in vivo model of human MLL-AF4 proB acute lymphoblastic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis by RNAseq of leukemia model promoted by MLL-Af4 or MLL-AF9 fusion proteins. We find each fusion protein promotes a specific gene signature correlating to those identified in patients

DESIGN
Human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were transduced with retrovirus expressing MLL-Af4 or MLL-AF9. Transduced cells were transplanted into immunodeficient mice to induce lymphoid leukemia or placed in myeloid in vitro culture. CD19+ lymphoid leukemia cells (3 AF9, 6 Af4),  control health CD19+CD34+ proB cells (n=3) and 4 pairs of Af4 and AF9 CD33+CD19- myeloid culture cells were collected for RNA-seq
