TITLE
Expression data of QK mutant and wild type of Arabidopsis after heat shock

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In order to study the importance of HSFA1 in thermotolerance in Arabidopsis, we generated the HSFA1a, b, d and e quadruple mutant (QK). QK is very sensitive to heat. Therefore, we used microarray to study how many genes regulated by HSFA1 after heat shock.

DESIGN
Seven-day-old seedlings of Col-0, Ws and QK grown at 22oC on 0.5x MS plates containing 1% sucrose were incubated for 1 h at 37 Â°C. Subsequently, samples were collected for RNA extraction. The experiment was repeated, and two biological replicates were processed for analysis.
