TITLE
Molecular diversity of breast cancers at the time of endocrine resistance [microRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dataset containing micro-RNA expression profiles of breast cancers at the time of endocrine resistance. It has been used to correlate micro-RNA and mRNA expressions and to identify two distinctive phenotypes with different expression of micro-RNA gens. Please note that the tumor samples are clinically quite homogeneous: all are post-menopausal ER+ve breast cancers, endocrine treated and growing on treatment. The main purpose of collecting these data was not to compare transcriptional profiles with clinical parameters, but rather to use the micro-RNA expression profiles of these clinically homogeneous tumours for (i) identifying intrinsic subgroups within endocrine resistance and (ii) for relating micro-RNA and mRNA expressions. However, the relevant clinical data was also provided as Series supplementary file (ClinicalData_AL28Jan2014.xlsx).

DESIGN
micro-RNA extracted from 56 fresh-frozen clinical biopsies of breast cancer at the time of endocrine resistance has been profiled with Illumina Human v1 MicroRNA expression beadchip.

PLATFORM
