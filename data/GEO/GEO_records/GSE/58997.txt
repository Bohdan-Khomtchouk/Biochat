TITLE
Expression data from  livers from Sco1 liver-specific KO and WT adult mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sco1 is a gene required for cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis and the regulation of copper homeostasis.  We characterized the transcriptional changes that occur as a result of liver-specific deletion of Sco1 in mice at 27 days of age In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from dissected wild-type mouse livers and mouse livers in which Sco1 has been specifically deleted.

DESIGN
8 samples: 4 Sco1 liver knockouts (Alb-Cre Sco1fl/fl), 4 wild-type (Sco1fl/fl)

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
