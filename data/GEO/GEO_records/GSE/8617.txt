TITLE
Identification of Pou5f1, Sox2, and Nanog downstream target genes with statistical confidence by applying a novel algor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We present a microarray experiment with the same tet-inducible system but with multiple time points within 24 hr to capture early responses to Oct4 suppression. These data were analyzed together with published genome-wide ChIP data. We found that most tentative target genes (TTG) of Oct4 in ES cells were activated by Oct4 and only a few genes were suppressed. The same method was then applied to find target genes of Sox2 and Nanog based mostly on previously published data. Because the interaction between Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog is supported by immunoprecipitation, functional analysis, and co-localization of binding sites, we explored the relationships between their target genes. Keywords: time series design
