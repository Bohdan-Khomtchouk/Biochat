TITLE
RNA-seq in neutrophils from Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we explored transcriptional complexity in human neutrophils from juvenile idiopathis arthritis and healthy control. We obtained differentially expressed genes among 3 ADU (active disease, untreated), 3 ADT (active disease, treated) and 2 HC (healthy control) samples using Cuffdiff2 software.

DESIGN
3 ADU (active disease, untreated), 3 ADT (active disease, treated) and 2 HC (healthy control) samples were carried out RNA-Seq by next-generation sequencing strategy
