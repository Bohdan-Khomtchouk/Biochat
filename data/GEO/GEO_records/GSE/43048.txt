TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of H. polymorpha in response to hydrogen peroxide exposure

ORGANISM
Ogataea angusta

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the basic mechanism of Hydrogen peroxide detoxification in the methylotrophic yeast, H. polymorpha, we analyzed changes in transcriptional profiles in response to hydrogen peroxide exposure.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples were collected from H. polymorpha cells after 30 min incubation with 0.5mM hydrogen peroxide. Using the RNA sample obtained prior to hydrogen peroxide addition as a reference, the differential fluorescence intensities of each RNA sample prepared at the indicated time was measured after labeling with Cy3 or Cy5 fluorochromes. For all analyses, we performed dye swapping experiments to avoid dye bias.
