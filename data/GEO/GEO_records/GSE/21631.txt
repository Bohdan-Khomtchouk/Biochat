TITLE
Comparison of Arabidopsis callus

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis thaliana plant expressing 35S:WIND1 shows callus-like morphology without hormone treatment. Transcriptomes of the callus-like cell expressing 35S:WIND1, callus of T87 cultured cell, 2,4-D-induced callus and control seedling plant were compared by Agilent microarray.

DESIGN
Comparison of four kinds of Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Biological replicates: three for each.
