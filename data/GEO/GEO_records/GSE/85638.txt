TITLE
A commonly inactivated tumor suppressor silences endogenous retroelements in somatic cells [Affymetrix expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Upon G1-S transition, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) phosphorylate the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) to release E2F transcription factors, which activate transcriptional programs, required for S-phase entry. Beyond the G1-S transition, pRB activity remains poorly understood. Our lab has discovered that pRB retains exclusive binding to E2F1 through an alternate E2F1-‘specific’ binding site at the pRB c-terminus independent of CDK phosphorylation. We have developed a gene-targeted mouse model that is defective for the E2F1-‘specific’ interaction. We are exploring the function of this complex through genome-wide binding and expression profiling. Overall, this work suggests an alternate pRB-E2F1 complex persists independent of CDK phosphorylation to establish regions of constitutive heterochromatin

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from wild-type and mutant MEFs following 72h of serum deprivation. Expression levels were determined using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0ST Array followed by analysis using Partek genomics suite to generate RMA values.
