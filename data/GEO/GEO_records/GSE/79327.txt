TITLE
Transcriptome Profile of Near-isogenic Soybean Lines for α-Subunit Deficiency during Seed Maturation

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
To identify α-null-related transcriptional changes, the gene expressions of cgy-2-NIL and its recurrent parent DN47 were compared using Illumina high-throughput RNA-sequencing on samples at 25, 35, 50, and 55 days after flowering (DAF). Seeds at 18 DAF served as the control.

DESIGN
Compare gene quantity and expression between the cgy-2-NIL and DN47 in five stages of soybean seeds collected at 18, 25, 35, 50, and 55 day after flowering
