TITLE
Genotype changes in 8DAP leaf

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Genotype dependent gene expression changes in the leaves of Illinois protein lines at 8 days after pollination (DAP). Illinois protein lines (IPL) comprise lines known as Illinois high protein (IHP), Illinois low protein (ILP), Illinois reverse-low protein (IRLP) and Illinois reverse-high protein (IRHP) lines. These lines represent over a century old experiment containing lines that represent various levels of nitrogen metabolism potential as a function of their grain protein concentration. Microarray experiment was conducted using 8 DAP leaves from the above mentioned four IPLs. Keywords: Genotype response

DESIGN
Technical replicates, dye swaps, technical replicates of dye swaps, no biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL5439 Maize oligo array version 1.9 array A GPL5440 Maize oligo array version 1.9 array B
