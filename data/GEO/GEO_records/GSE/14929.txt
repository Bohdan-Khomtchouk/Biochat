TITLE
Myocardial expression data from gnotobiotic wild-type and Ppara-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Germ free (GF) and conventionalized (CONV-D) wild-type C57Bl/6 male mice in the CARB-fed, 24h fasted, and 30d trained states; plus GF and CONV-D CARB-fed Ppara-/- mice.  CARB-fed indicates a standard polysaccharide-rich mouse chow diet. CONV-D mice are those that received a microbiota transplant from conventionally raised mice 2-3 weeks before experiment was initiated Keywords: RNA Expression Array

DESIGN
Hearts from six to ten week-old GF and CONV-D mice, from the following eight treatment groups (GF, CONV-D) X (CARB-fed [wild-type], 24h fast [wild-type], 30d trained [wild-type], Ppara-/- [CARB-fed])
