TITLE
Genome-wide reprogramming of the chromatin landscape underlies endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) drives the growth of two-thirds of all breast cancers. Endocrine therapy impinges on estrogen-induced ERa activation to block tumor growth. However, half of ERa-positive breast cancers are tolerant or acquire endocrine therapy resistance. Here we demonstrate that breast cancer cells undergo genome-wide reprogramming of their chromatin landscape, defined by epigenomic maps and chromatin openness, as they acquire resistance to endocrine therapy. This reveals a role for the Notch pathway while excluding classical ERa signaling. In agreement, blocking Notch signaling, using gamma-secretase inhibitors, or targeting its downstream gene PBX1 abrogates growth of endocrine therapy-resistant breast cancer cells. Moreover Notch signaling through PBX1 directs a transcriptional program predictive of tumor outcome and endocrine therapy response.

DESIGN
Comparing histone modifications (H3K4me2 and H3K36me3), chromatin openness (FAIRE) and PBX1 binding between endocrine therapy sensitive MCF7 and resistant MCF7-LTED cells.
