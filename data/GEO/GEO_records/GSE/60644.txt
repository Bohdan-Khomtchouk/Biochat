TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of lung carcinoma : Gene expression data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the worldwide leading cause of death from cancer. DNA methylation in gene promoter regions is a major mechanism of gene expression regulation that may promote tumorigenesis.     Experimental Design  Whole-genome DNA methylation analysis using 450K Illumina BeadArrays was performed on 12 normal lung tissues and 124 tumors including 83 adenocarcinomas, 23 squamous cell carcinomas (SqCC), one adenosquamous cancer, five large cell carcinomas, nine large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNEC), and three small cell carcinomas (SCLC). Complimentary gene expression analyses was performed on 117 of the 124 tumors using Illumina HT12 V4 arrays (reported here).

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of 117 lung carcinomas using Illumina HT-12 V4 microarrays.
