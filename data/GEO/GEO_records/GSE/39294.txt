TITLE
miR-146a promotes the initiation and progression of melanoma  by activating Notch signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oncogenic mutations in BRAF and NRAS occur in 70% of melanomas. Here we identify a microRNA, miR-146a, that is highly upregulated by oncogenic BRAF and NRAS. Expression of miR-146a increases the ability of human melanoma cells to proliferate in culture and form tumors in mice, whereas knockdown of miR-146a has the opposite effects. We show these oncogenic activities are due to miR-146a targeting the NUMB mRNA, a repressor of Notch signaling. Previous studies have shown that pre-miR-146a contains a single nucleotide polymorphism (C > G rs2910164). We find that the ability of pre-miR-146a/G to activate Notch signaling and promote oncogenesis is substantially higher than that of pre-miR-146a/C. Analysis of melanoma cell lines and matched patient samples indicates that during melanoma progression pre-miR-146a/G is enriched relative to pre-miR-146a/C, resulting from a C-to-G somatic mutation in pre-miR-146a/C. Collectively, our results reveal a central role for miR-146a in the initiation and progression of melanoma.

DESIGN
SKMEL28 melanoma cell line stably expressing either an empty vector or  pre-miR146a with either C or G SNP (SKMEL28-FG12, SKMEL28-miR-146a/C and SKMEL28-miR-146a/G) were used to prepare total RNA.  Microarray analysis was performed by using biological replicates for each stable cell lines for a total of 6 samples.
