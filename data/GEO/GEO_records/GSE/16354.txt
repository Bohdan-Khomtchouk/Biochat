TITLE
Infection of Lymphatic and Blood Vessel Endothelial Cells (LEC and BEC) with KSHV

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kaposi sarcoma is the most common cancer in AIDS patients and is typified by red skin lesions. The disease is caused by the KSHV virus (HHV8) and is recognisable by its distinctive red skin lesions. The lesions are KSHV-infected spindle cells, most commonly the lymphatic endothelial and blood vessel endothelial cells (LEC and BEC), plus surrounding stroma. The effects of KSHV infection of both LEC and BEC were assayed using Affymetrix hgu133plus2 chips at 72 hours post infection.

DESIGN
There are n=6 of: 1. LEC control (LEC), 2. KSHV-infected LEC (KLEC), 3. BEC control (BEC), and 4. KSHV-infected BEC (KBEC).
