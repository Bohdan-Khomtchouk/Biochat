TITLE
Effects of PLEKHA7 depletion on miRNA expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global  miRNAs expression profilling of Caco2 cells after shRNA-mediated knockdown of PLEKHA7

DESIGN
Caco2 cells were infected and selected either with a non-target (NT) or with a PLEKHA7-targeting shRNA (shPLEKHA7). Total RNA was isolated from three independent sets of infections and was used to assess total miRNA expression using NanoString's nCounter Human v2 miRNA Expression Assay Kit

PLATFORM
GPL17537 nCounter Human miRNA Expression Assay, V2
