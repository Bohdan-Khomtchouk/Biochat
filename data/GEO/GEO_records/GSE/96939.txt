TITLE
Role of NRROS in microglia and perivascular macrophages in the brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice deficient in NRROS exhibit neurological phenotype similar to ALS. Our previous work showed that in phagocytes, NRROS regulates the degradation of Nox2, the enzymatic component of the NADPH oxidase that generates reactive oxygen species. NRROS is expressed in phagocytes, including macrophages, neutrophils and microglia but not neurons. Previous results on RNA-sequencing from WT and NRRO KO CD11b+ population (NGS601) identified perivascular macrophage (pvm)-like expression profile in NRROS KO cells. FACS data revealed a loss of microglia and concomitant gain of pvm-like cells in the brains of NRROS KO mice.

DESIGN
To further these findings, we would like to directly compare gene expression between WT microglia (n = 3), WT pvm (n = 3) and NRROS KO pvm (n = 3).
