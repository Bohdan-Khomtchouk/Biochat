TITLE
Estrogen Receptor Beta Impacts Hormone-Induced Alternative mRNA Splicing in Breast Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Estrogens play an important role in breast cancer (BC) development and progression, where the two isoforms of the estrogen receptor (ERα and ERβ) are generally co-expressed and mediate the effects of these hormones in cancer cells. ERβ has been suggested to exert an antagonist role toward the oncogenic activities of ERα, and for this reason it is considered an oncosuppressor. As clinical evidence regarding a prognostic role for this receptor subtype in hormone-responsive BC is still limited and conflicting, more knowledge is required on the biological functions of ERβ in cancer cells. We described previously the ERβ and ERα interactomes of BC cells, identifying specific and distinct patterns of protein interactions for the two receptors. In particular, we identified factors involved in mRNA splicing and maturation as important components of both ERα and ERβ pathways. Guided by these findings, we investigated here in depth the differences in the early transcriptional events and RNA splicing patterns induced in ERα vs ERα+ERβ cells, by expressing ERβ in ERα+ human BC MCF-7 cells. High-throughput mRNA sequencing was then performed in both cell lines after stimulation with 17b-estradiol, and the results obtained were compared.
