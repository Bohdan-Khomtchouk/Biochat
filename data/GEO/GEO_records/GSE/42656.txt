TITLE
Gene expression profiles for paediatric brain tumours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we screened a cohort of 57 paediatric brain tumours, with a wide range of pathologies to identify gene expression profiles

DESIGN
We analysed gene expression in paediatric brain tumours as compared to normal adult brain in order to understand the molecular profiles. Our cohort included 14 pilocytic astrocytomas, 3 diffuse astrocytomas, 2 anaplastic astrocytomas, 5 glioblastomas, 14 ependymomas, 9 medulloblastomas, 5 atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumours, 4 choroid plexus papillomas, 1 papillary glioneuronal, 8 adult brain and 8 foetal brain controls.
