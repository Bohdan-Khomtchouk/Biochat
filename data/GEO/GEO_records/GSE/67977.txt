TITLE
Fate specification of neural plate border by canonical Wnt signaling and Grhl3 is crucial for neural tube closure.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During primary neurulation, the separation of a single-layered ectodermal sheet into the surface ectoderm (SE) and neural tube specifies SE and neural ectoderm (NE) cell fates. The mechanisms underlying fate specification in conjunction with neural tube closure are poorly understood. Here, by comparing expression profiles between SE and NE lineages, we observed that uncommitted progenitor cells, expressing stem cell markers, are present in the neural plate border/neural fold prior to neural tube closure.

DESIGN
To identify what type of signaling pathways and transcriptional factors are involved in the fate specification between SE and NE cells during neurulation.
