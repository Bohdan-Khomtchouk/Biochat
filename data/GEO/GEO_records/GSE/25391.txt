SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_2762 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Steven Henikoff. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: poly A+ RNA was isolated and used to synthesize single-stranded cDNA probes.  Labeled cDNA and labeled genomic DNA were hybridized to NimbleGen microarrays (2-color hybridizations).  These experiments are used as controls for nucleosome salt fractionations. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf
