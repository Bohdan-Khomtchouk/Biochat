TITLE
Effect of Bicaudal C1 deletion on E13.5 mouse pancreatic mRNA profile

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bicaudal C1 KO embryonic pancreas develops cysts and has less endocrine progenitors after E14.5 (14.5 days after fertilization), while no defect is observed at E13.5. Bicaudal C1 is an RNA-binding protein. To understand the molecular mechanisms leading to both phenotypes, the mRNA expression profile of E13.5 WT vs. Bicaudal C1 dorsal pancreas was studied by high-throughput sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. This time point was selected as a time point where no phenotypic modification was detected. 3 replicates for each condition were sequenced and each replicate consisted of 3 E13.5 dorsal pancreas of the same genotype. There were only few differences between both transcriptomes. Pkd2 was 1.9-fold reduced in Bicaudal C1 KO. Pkd2 inactivation causes renal and pancreatic cyst. Some genes having immune/inflammatory functions were up or downregulated highlighting the early immune cell infiltration observed in Bicaudal C1 KO pancreas. No hit could explain the endocrine progenitor decrease. It may be due to the ability of Bicaudal C1 to regulate mRNA translation without affecting the mRNAs themselves.

DESIGN
Comparison of mRNA profiles of E13.5 WT vs. Bicaudal C1 KO dorsal pancreas using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (platform ID SN865), 3 replicates per condition.
