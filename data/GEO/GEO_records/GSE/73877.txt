TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Mtb H37Rrv and MtbΔwhiB4 upon treatment with 0.25 mM CHP

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
WhiB4 regulates expression of anti-oxidant genes and its own expression was shown to be down-regulated upon exposure to oxidatants like CHP. Further MtbΔwhiB4 was shown to survive better under oxidaitve stress. Thus, we did microarray upon exposure to 0.25 mM CHP to study comprehensively the WhiB4 regulon under oxidative stress.

DESIGN
Mtb H37Rv and MtbΔwhiB4 were grown till early log phase and exposed to 0.25 mM CHP for 2 hours at 37 degree at 150rpm. Four and two independent experiments were done for each of the strain, respectively.

PLATFORM
GPL21002 Agilent-034585 UDSC M. tuberculosis H37Rv Validated Array (PROBE ID version)
