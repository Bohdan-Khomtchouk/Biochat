TITLE
Expression analysis of rat testis at early development stage

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in rat testes on the postnatal day 6, 8 and 10 to compare the differentially expressed genes between them.

DESIGN
A three chip study using total RNA recovered from the testes of rat postnatal day 6, 8 and 10. There are 135,000 probes in a chip,each chip measures the expression level of 26419 genes of rat from Nimblegen. Fold-change screening between the two groups obtained from the experiment. The threshold used to screen up or down regulated genes is Fold change＞＝2.0
