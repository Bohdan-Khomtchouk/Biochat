TITLE
polyA mRNA RNA-seq from Ishikawa (ENCSR000BYC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq on ECC-1 greater than 200bp polyA+ treated with genistein at 100nM for 4 hours. Note- This experiment previously referred to its biosample as ECC-1, however it has been found that all currently available ECC-1 are actually Ishikawa cells.
