TITLE
DNA Methylation Profiles of Airway Epithelial Cells and PBMCs from Healthy, Atopic and Asthmatic Children.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation profiling of airway epithelial cells (AECs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from normal, atopic and asthmatic subjects. The Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 1505 CpGs in AECs and PBMCs. Samples included 7 healthy, 9 atopic, 4 atopic asthmatic and 5 non-atopic asthmatic subjects. Please note that only some of the samples are matched (i.e. AECs and PBMCs from the same individual) due to DNA quality or sample collection (i.e. only one sample (AEC or PBMC) was collected from the patient).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 41 samples were hybridised to the Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL9183 Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I
