TITLE
Effect of Dietary Grain on Rumen Papillae Gene Expression in Holstein Dairy Cows

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Four mature, non-lactating dairy cattle were transitioned from a high forage diet (HF; 0% grain) to a high grain diet (HG; 65% grain) that was fed for three weeks.  Rumen papillae biopsies were performed during the HF baseline (week 0) and after the first (week 1) and third week (week 3) of the grain challenge to create a transcript profile for the the short and long-term adaption of the rumen epithelium during ruminal acidosis.

DESIGN
Comparison between three weekly means  (n=4 for each week, 12 arrays in total)
