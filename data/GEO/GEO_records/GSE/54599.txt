TITLE
Histone dosage and gene expression changes in Halobacterium salinarum

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
We set out to determine a) if histone in Halobacterium salinarum regulates transcription and b) whether the magnitude and extent of these changes matches those observed in organisms which use histone protein as their primary DNA packaging agent.  To this end, gene expression data for a histone knock-out (Δura3ΔhpyA) strain versus parent (Δura3) were collected.

DESIGN
The histone deletion mutant and parent strain, at log and stationary phase, were compared to the common reference strain NRC-1 (log). There are three biological replicates each, plus dye-flips, for a total of 24 arrays
