TITLE
Gene expression analysis of kidney primary tubular epithelial cells (PTECs), SETD2-KD PTECs,  PBRM1-KD PTECs and ccRCC derived cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human WT-PTECs, SETD2-KD PTECs, PBRM1-KD PTECs, and 10 different ccRCC derived cell lines. ccRCC derived cell lines showed distict expression signatures as compared to PTECs, some of them also present in SETD2-KD PTECs, and/or PBRM1-KD PTECs.

DESIGN
Three PTECs of different origins were transduced with shRNA constructs against SETD2 (sh1 and sh2), or PBRM1 (sh-PB1 or sh-PB2), or with a non-targeting (NT) sequence. The PTECs were harvested when they were still proliferating, the immortalized ccRCC cell lines were mantained more than 10 passages after arrival.
