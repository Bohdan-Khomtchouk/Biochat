TITLE
Changes in transcription profile in pelvic organ fibroblasts in response to stretch

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Failure of ligamentous support of the genital tract to resist intra-abdominal pressure is a plausible underlying mechanism for the development of pelvic organ prolapse, but the nature of molecular response of pelvic tissue support remains unknown. We hypothesized that the expression of genes coding for proteins involved in maintaining the cellular and extracellular integrity would be altered in cases of pelvic organ prolapse. Therefore, cDNA microarrays were used to examine the difference in transcriptional profile in RNA of primary culture fibroblasts subjected to mechanical stretch and those that remained static.
