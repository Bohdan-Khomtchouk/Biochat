Expression data from diploid human pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) tend to acquire chromosomal aberrations in culture, which may increase their tumorigenicity. However, the cellular mechanism(s) underlying these aberrations are largely unknown. Here we show that the DNA replication in aneuploid hPSCs is perturbed, resulting in high prevalence of defects in chromosome condensation and segregation. Global gene expression analyses in aneuploid hPSCs revealed decreased levels of actin cytoskeleton genes and their common transcription factor SRF. Down-regulation of SRF or chemical perturbation of actin cytoskeleton organization in diploid hPSCs resulted in increased replication stress and perturbation of chromosome condensation, recapitulating the findings in aneuploid hPSCs. Altogether, our results revealed that in hPSCs DNA replication stress results in a distinctive defect in chromosome condensation, underlying their ongoing chromosomal instability. Our results shed a new light on the mechanisms leading to ongoing chromosomal instability in hPSCs, and may be relevant to tumor development as well.
