TITLE
Gene expression profiling in humna HCC, lung, and pancreas cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role for LSD1 in solid cancer cell growth, we depleted LSD1 with siRNA in 50 different cancer cell lines derived from various tissues. By the degree to the cell growth defect mediated by LSD1 knock down, we stratified the cell lines into three groups. Then, to determine differential gene expressions related to the LSD1-dependent cell growth, we performed gene expression microarray analyses of the most and the least LSD1-dependent cell lines.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of 21 cell lines under normal cell culture condition. Determined the gene expression profile of the most and the least LSD1-dependent group by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and decided to identify the biological pathways correlated with the LSD1 dependence of cell growth.
