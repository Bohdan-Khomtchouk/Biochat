TITLE
Global DNA methylation: Uncommon event in Oral Lichenoid Disease [Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose  Accumulating evidence indicates aberrant DNA methylation is closely related to oral carcinogenesis, and it has been shown that methylation changes might be used as prognostic biomarker in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Oral lichenoid disease (OLD) is the most common oral potentially malignant disorder in our region. In this study, we have performed a wide DNA methylation study of a series of oral lichenoid disease in order to assess the relevance of DNA methylation changes in this premalignant disorder.  Experimental Design  Discovery phase utilized HumanMethylation27 DNA Analysis BeadChip assay in 18 OLD and 5 control samples. The differently methylated loci and the global DNA methylation surrogate LINE-, were further validated in an independent sample set consisting in 158 OLD and 65 controls.  Results  DNA methylation profile of the OLD showed only minor significant differences when compared to controls. MGC40178, ADORA1 and LINE-1 were slightly hypomethylated in 23, 40 and 43 % of the OLD samples respectively, while only in 13, 18 and 15% of the controls.  Conclusions  In summary, our data indicates that the frequency of aberrant DNA alteration is very low in OLD, which support the low rate of malignization of this oral potentially malignant disorder.
