TITLE
Characterization of ST-4821 complex, a unique Neisseria meningitidis clone

ORGANISM
Neisseria meningitidis

SUMMARY
Neisseria meningitidis is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis and septicemia worldwide. The novel ST-4821 clonal complex caused several serogroup C meningococcal outbreaks unexpectedly during 2003–2005 in China. We fabricated a whole-genome microarray of Chinese N. meningitidis serogroup C representative isolate 053442 and characterized 27 ST-4821 complex isolates which were isolated from different serogroups using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis. This paper provides important clues which are helpful to understand the genome composition and genetic background of different serogroups isolates, and possess significant meaning to the study of the newly emerged hyperinvasive lineage. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
To further understand the genome diversity of ST-4821 complex isolates, CGH analysis was employed to compare the genomic content of 053442 with those of 27 ST-4821 complex isolates which were isolated from 14 provinces of China during 1977–2005.
