TITLE
FAIRE-chip in MCF7 and LNCaP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The compaction degree of chromatin is intimately related to its functionality and active cis-regulatory elements typically exist within open chromatin regions depleted in nucleosomes (Heintzman et al. 2007; Boyle et al. 2008). These domains can be identified using Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE) that allows for enrichment of nucleosome-depleted genomic regions when cross-linked chromatin is subjected to phenol-chloroform extraction (Nagy et al. 2003; Hogan et al. 2006) Here, chromatin structure was analyzed in MCF7 and LNCaP cells using Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE) (Nagy et al. 2003; Hogan et al. 2006) Keywords: FAIRE-chip

DESIGN
MCF7 and LNCaP cells were grown in full media, cross-linked and processed as in (Nagy et al. 2003; Hogan et al. 2006). DNA obtained by FAIRE was hybridized to Human Affymetrix tiled array F. Triplicates of FAIRE and input DNA are provided (4 inputs for MCF7 cells).
