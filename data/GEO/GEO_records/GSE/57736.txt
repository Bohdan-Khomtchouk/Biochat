TITLE
Gene expression comparison between Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected monocytes from tuberculous and healthy elders

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differences in the activity of monocytes/macrophages, important target cells of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, might influence tuberculosis progression. With the purpose of identifying candidate genes for tuberculosis susceptibility we infected with M. tuberculosis monocytes from both, healthy elders (a tuberculosis susceptibility group) and elderly tuberculosis patients, and performed a microarray experiment. We detected 78 differentially expressed transcripts and confirmed these results by quantitative PCR of selected genes. We found that monocytes from tuberculosis patients showed similar expression patterns of these genes regardless of whether they were obtained from younger or elder patients. Only one of the detected genes corresponded to a cytokine: IL-26, a member of the IL-10 cytokine family that we found downregulated in infected monocytes from tuberculosis patients.

DESIGN
We have analyzed total RNA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected monocytes. We have isolated CD14+ cells (monocytes) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by magnetic separation, and infected them for 4 days with 1 bacterium per monocyte. Blood donors were 7 elderly patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (average age: 83 years; sex: 3 men and 4 women) and 8 non-tuberculous volunteers (81 years, 6 men and 2 women).
