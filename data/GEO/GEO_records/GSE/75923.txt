TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of Alternaria stress-responsive transcriptome in tomato

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Gene expression cascade in a plant is altered in times of stress. Reprogramming of the expression profiles of genes is required for a robust and specific response. Until now, tomato  transcriptomic alteration in  response to Alternaria fungal stress were not known. This study presents the profile of genes that are differentially expressed during Alternaria stress in local tomato cultivar (Pusa Ruby). At least 2944 genes expression was varied and pathways that are altered during this compatible interaction have been identified.  Supported by DBT, Govt. of India.

DESIGN
RNA seq profile of Indian tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cultivar Pusa Ruby infected with Alternaria. One mock infected and One Alternaria fungus infected samples were analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL16345 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Solanum lycopersicum)
