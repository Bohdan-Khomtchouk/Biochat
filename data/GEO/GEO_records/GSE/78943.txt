TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Caco2 cells treated with Cudraflavone C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A total of 26 genes were up-regulated and 63 genes were down-regulated > 2-fold following Cudraflavone C treatment

DESIGN
Microarray experiments were performed in duplicate as follows: Caco2 cells were treated with 10 uM of Cudraflavone C or control vehicle (0.1% DMSO) for 48 h. Total RNA from cells was extracted using Qiagen RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers’ protocol. RNA purity was examined by spectrophotometric determination at 260/280 nm. The microarray hybridizations were carried out using the GeneChip® Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 arrays.
