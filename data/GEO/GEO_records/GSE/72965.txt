TITLE
The transcriptome of Serratia sp. ZM under different concentrations of (NH4)2SO4

ORGANISM
Serratia sp. ZM

SUMMARY
The RNA-seq technique aims to identify genes that are differently expressed in low nitrogen (2mM (NH4)2SO4) and high nitrogen (10mM (NH4)2SO4) conditions.

DESIGN
Two groups of Serratia sp. ZM were analysed by us, low nitrogen group and high nitrogen group.
