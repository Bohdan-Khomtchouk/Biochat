TITLE
Epigenome-Wide Scans Identify Differentially Methylated Regions for Age and Age-Related Phenotypes in a Healthy Ageing Population

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in whole blood samples from 172 normal female twins. See Bell, Tsai et al. Plos Genet. 2012;8(4):e1002629.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 172 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
