SUMMARY
RRP1B is a Metastasis Modifier that Regulates the Transcriptome through mRNA Splicing

DESIGN
To assess the role of RRP1B in alternative mRNA splicing, we knocked down the expression of Rrp1b in the highly metastatic mouse mammary tumor cell line Mvt-1 using shRNA. Two control and two knockdown stable cell lines were selected for RNA-sequencing.
