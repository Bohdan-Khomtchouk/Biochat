TITLE
Expression data from shoots of Arabidopsis grown under sulfur limitation.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Sulfate in one essential nutrient for plants and its limitation is known to have a significant impact on plant growth and yield. In this study we performed global transcriptome analyses to investigate the responses to long term sulfate deficiency at the shoot level. The shoot global transcriptomic responses to sulfur deprivation.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown hydroponically under short-day conditions (8h light / 16h dark cycles) under full nutrient supply or under the limitation of sulfur. Arabidopsis root material was harvested when the plants reached the age of 7 weeks (from sowing) and used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Four biological replicates from each condition were analyzed.
