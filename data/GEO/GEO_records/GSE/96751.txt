TITLE
Aubergine Controls Germline Stem Cell Self-Renewal and Progeny Differentiation via Distinct Mechanisms

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Purpose: Piwi family protein Aubergine (Aub) maintains genome integrity in late germ cells of the Drosophila ovary through piRNA-mediated repression of transposon activities. Although it is highly expressed in germline stem cells (GSCs) and early progeny, it remains unclear if it plays any roles in early GSC lineage development. Results: The study reveals a novel function of Aub in GSCs and their progeny, which promotes translation of self-renewal and differentiation factors by directly binding to its target mRNAs and interacting with translational initiation factors.

DESIGN
iCLIP experiments were conducted to obtain RNA binding profiles of Aub in cultured Drosophila bam mutant germline stem cells
