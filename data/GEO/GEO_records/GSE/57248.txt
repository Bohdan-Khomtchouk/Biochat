TITLE
Gfi1 proteins regulate the emergence of HSCs and blood precursors in the  AGM through recruitment of LSD1 [HTS]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gfi1:Dam and Gfi1b:Dam binding analysis of sorted hemogenic endothelial cells (TIE2/C-KIT)

DESIGN
The cDNAs encoding DAM-GFI1 and DAM-GFI1B fusion proteins or a DAM control were inserted in a Dox inducible HPRT docking site in ainv18 ES cells (Kyba et al, 2002). Following differentiation, HE cell populations were isolated, genomic DNA prepared and digested with DpnI. The methylated DNA fragments were amplified as previously described {Orian et al, 2009, Vogel et al, 2007) and sequenced on a Illumina HiSeq platform

PLATFORM
