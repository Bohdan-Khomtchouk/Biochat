TITLE
RNA-seq study of directed sclerotome, Lon non-coding RNA PEAT, and the embryonic Dll1 lineage form E9.0-9.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced RNA from embryonic mouse tissue directed to form sclerotome in culture.  Using Crispr/Cas9, we generated a mouse line bearing a complete deletion of the PEAT, a LncRNA adjacent tp Pax1 and highly enriched in sclerotome. We perform RNA-seq on samples from 4 stages of maturation of the Dll1 lineage.

DESIGN
Examination of sclerotome using RNA-seq
