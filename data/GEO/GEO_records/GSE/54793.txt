TITLE
gamma-catenin (junction plakoglobin, Jup) dependent signals mediate the progression of BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The BCR-ABL1 translocation product is the cause of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and of a significant fraction of adult-onset B-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) cases. Here we identify an essential role for gamma-catenin (junction plakoglobin) in B lineage restricted cells for the progression of B-ALL in a mouse model. The array analysis of preleukemic B cells aimed at identifying genes that explain the deficient B-ALL progression in the absence gamma-catenin. Total bone marrow cells from chimeric mice expressing or lacking gamma-catenin in the hematopoietic compartment were transduced with BCR-ABL1+ IRES GFP retrovirus before transplantation into lethally irradiated wild type recipients. Three weeks later, GFP+ (BCR-ABL1+) B220+ BP-1+ B cells were flow sorted from the bone marrow of preleukemic recipient mice.

DESIGN
The analysis includes 3 replicates for gamma-catenin WT and 3 replicates for gamma-catenin KO BCR-ABL1+ BP1+ B cells.
