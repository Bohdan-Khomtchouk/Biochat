TITLE
Expression analysis of murine bone marrow (BMDM) derived macrophages stimulated with C1q

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in BMDM adhered for 4 or 18hrs  to Lab Tek Chamber slides pre-coated with 4ug/ml of human serum albumin (HSA) (control protein) or purified human C1q and treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS: 20ng/ml) Mycobacterium avium 101 (M avium) or apoptotic Jurkat T cells. BMDM were obtained from C57Bl/6 and generated as previously described in Bohlson, SS, Strasser, JA, Bower JJ, Schorey J S 2001 Role of complement in Mycobacterium avium pathogenesis: in vivo and in vitro analyses of the host response to infection in the absence of complement component C3 Infec Immun 69: 7729-7735. Mybacterium avium 101 was obtained from Dr Jeff Schorey (University of Notre Dame). The human Jurkat T cell line was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and induced to undergo apoptosis with dexamethasone as described in Lillis, AP, Greenlee, M C, Mikhailenko I, Pizzo, S V, Tenner, A J, Strickland, D K, Bohlson, S S 2008 Murine Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 1 (LRP) Is Required for Phagocytosis of Targets Bearing LRP Ligands but Is Not Required for C1q-triggered Enhancement of Phagocytosis J Immunol 181: 364: 373.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA from 5 separate cultures of BMDM adhered to HSA  for 4 hrs, 5 separate cultures of BMDM adhered to C1q for 4 hrs, 5 separate cultures of BMDM adhered to HSA for 4 hrs and infected with M avium at a 1:500 ratio of BMDM to M avium, 5 separate cultures of BMDM adhered to C1q for 4hrs and infected with M avium at a 1:500 ratio ofBMDM to M avium, 5 separate cultures of BMDM adhered to HSA for 4 hrs and infected with M avium at a 1:1000 ratio of BMDM to M avium, 5 separate cultures of BMDM adhered to HSA  for 4 hrs and treated with 20ng/ml LPS, 5 separate cultures of BMDM adhered to C1q for 4 hrs and treated with 20ng/ml LPS, 5 separate cultures of BMDM adhered to HSA for 4 hrs and treated with 20ng/ml LPS and co-cultured with apoptotic Jurkat cells at a 1:3 ratio of BMDM to apoptotic cells, 5 separate cultures of BMDM adhered to C1q for 4 hrs and treated with 20ng/ml LPS and co-cultured with apoptotic Jurkat cells at a 1:3 ratio of BMDM to apoptotic cells, 5 separate cultures of BMDM adhered to HSA  for 18 hrs, 5 separate cultures of BMDM adhered to C1q for 18 hrs, 5 separate cultures of BMDM adhered to HSA for 18 hrs and infected with M avium at a 1:500 ratio of BMDM to M avium, 5 separate cultures of BMDM adhered to C1q for 18hrs and infected with M avium at a 1:500 ratio of BMDM to M avium, 5 separate cultures of BMDM adhered to HSA for 18 hrs and infected with M avium at a 1:1000 ratio of BMDM to M avium.  The chip utilized for these studies is a mouse whole-genome 12-plex expression microarray design by NimbleGen designed from the MM9 genome Candidate probe sequences were verified to have no cross-hybridization to human (HG19) or Mycobacterium avium (NC_008595) targets Note: Study sample BMDM_HSA & M avium (1:500)_18hr_rep2 was not included in this submission due to quality control concerns.
