TITLE
Regulated expression of polysaccharide utilization and capsular biosynthesis loci in biofilm and planktonic Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron during growth in chemostats

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix GeneChips to determine the physiological differences between biofilm and planktonic cells of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain VPI-5482 (ATCC 29148) by comparing gene expression. For this purpose, B. thetaiotaomicron cells were grown in sterile, continuous flow bioreactors fed with tryptone, yeast extract, glucose (TYG) medium. The bioreactors were controlled at a temperature of 37C using a water jacket and a recirculating water heater. After 8 hours post-inoculation, planktonic cells were harvested from the bulk solution in the bioreactor, and after 8 days post-inoculation, the biofilm was scraped from the carbon paper. RNA was harvested from both biofilm and planktonic populations. RNA was extracted by a phenol:chloroform method and purified with a Qiagen RNA Easy mini-kit.
