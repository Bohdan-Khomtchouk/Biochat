TITLE
Altered molecular expression of the TLR4/ NF-ÎºB signaling pathway in mammary tissue of Chinese Holstein cattle with mastitis

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In this study, the profile of mastitis-induced differential gene expression in the mammary tissue of Chinese Holstein cattle was investigated by Gene-Chip microarray and bioinformatics

DESIGN
Our experiments included RNA samples was isolated from the mammary tissue of adult Chinese Holstein cows during late lactation with (n=3) and without (n=3) mastitis
