TITLE
Small molecule transcriptional responses in Plasmodium falciparum

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Comparison of whole genome gene expression profiles for Plasmodium falciparum parasites perturbed with small molecules with diverse mechanisms of action. Perturbations were performed by treating each synchronized parasite culture with a given small molecule at 24 hrs post-eryhrocyte invasion and RNA collected 2 hrs post-exposure

DESIGN
Pertubations were performed on 2 laboratory clones of P. falciparum (HB3 and Dd2) and RNA collected from perturbed cultures and controls
