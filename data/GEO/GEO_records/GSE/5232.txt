TITLE
Expression data from Lbeta T2 cells upon activin treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The primary response of Lbeta T 2cells upon activin treatment at 1hr, 2hr, and 6hr is the significant up-regulation of FSHbeta subunit. Affymetrix genearray missed this important information due to cross-hybridization of its probes with other genes and chromosome segments. Activin modulates a network of genes and signaling pathways to exert a variety of functions. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Subconfluent Lbeta T2 cells were seeded in cell culture flasks for 16 hours in phenol-free, serum-free medium, and then treated with either vehicle or activin A (30ng/ml). At 1hr, 2hr, or 6hr after treatment, total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit. Integrity of RNA was evaluated with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and purity/concentration was determined using a GeneSpec III before target preparationi and hybridizations.
