TITLE
Diet-dependent cardiovascular lipid metabolism controlled by hepatic LXRÎ±

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of liver RNA from male Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor null mice on C57B6 background expressing human LXR alpha or GFP (control) via adeno-associated virus (AAV2.8) gene transfer, under control of the liver specific human thyroxine binding globulin promoter. Samples are from 8 month old mice, with AAV treatment at age of 10 weeks, on Western diet for 12 weeks prior experiment. The synthetic LXR ligand T0901317 (5mg/kg) or vehicle was administered for 3 days by i.p. injection to designated mice. Keywords = LXR alpha Keywords = SREBP1 Keywords = diet Keywords = lipid metabolism Keywords = atherosclerosis Keywords: repeat sample
