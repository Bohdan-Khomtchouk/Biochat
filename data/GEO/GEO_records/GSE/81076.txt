TITLE
A single-cell transcriptome atlas of the human pancreas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand organ (dys)function it is important to have a complete inventory of its cell types and the corresponding markers that unambiguously identify these cell types. This is a challenging task, in particular in human tissues, because unique cell-type markers are typically unavailable, necessitating the analysis of complex cell type mixtures. Transcriptome-wide studies on pancreatic tissue are typically done on pooled islet material. To overcome this challenge we sequenced the transcriptome of thousands of single pancreatic cells from deceased organ donors with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) allowing in silico purification of the different cell types. We identified the major pancreatic cell types resulting in the identification of many new cell-type specific and T2D-specific markers. Additionally we observed several subpopulations within the canonical pancreatic cell types, which we validated in situ. This resource will be useful for developing a deeper understanding of pancreatic biology and diabetes mellitus.

DESIGN
Human cadaveric pancreata were used to extract islets of Langerhans, which were kept in culture until single-cell dispersion and FACS sorting. Single-cell transcriptomics was performed on live cells from this mixture using CEL-seq or on cells stained for CD63, CD13, TGFBR3 or CD24 and CD44. The RaceID algorithm was used to identify clusters of cells corresponding to the major pancreatic cell types and to mine for novel cell type-specific genes as well as subpopulations within the known pancreatic cell types.
