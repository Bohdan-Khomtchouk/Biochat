TITLE
Notch reprograms mitochondrial metabolism for macrophage proinflammatory activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we demonstrate Notch1 pathway dictates M1 activation in mouse hepatic macrophages (HMacs) and Raw 264.7 cells by coupling its transcriptional upregulation of M1 genes with its metabolic upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and ROS (mtROS) to augment the M1 gene induction. We used a genome wide Chip-seq approach to study in detail the transcriptional mechanism associated with Notch1

DESIGN
Genome wide Identification of Notch1 binding partners in nuclear as well as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
