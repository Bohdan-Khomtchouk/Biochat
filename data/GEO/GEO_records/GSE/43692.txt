TITLE
Genome-wide microarray analysis of normal human fibroblasts in response to kaemferol, daidzein, kaemferol/genistein, and daidzein/genistein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Establishment of a transcriptomic profile of human cells treated with kaemferol, daidzein, kaemferol/genistein, or daidzein/genistein with particular emphasis on signature of genes coding for enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan synthesis stands for the present study. The hypothesis tested was that kaemferol, daidzein, kaemferol/genistein, and daidzein/genistein influence expression of some genes, among which are those coding for enzymes required for the synthesis of different GAGs being pathologically accumulated in mucopolysaccharidoses. Results provide important information concerning the extent of action of kaemferol, daidzein, kaemferol/genistein, and daidzein/genistein at the molecular level in terms of modulation of gene expression.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from human dermal fibroblasts (HDFa) subjected to 24 or 48 hours in vitro exposure to 30, 60 or 100 µM kaemferol; 60 or 100 µM daidzein; 30 µM + 30 µM kaemferol/genistein; 30 µM + 30 µM daidzein/genistein; or 0.05%DMSO. Three replicates each.
