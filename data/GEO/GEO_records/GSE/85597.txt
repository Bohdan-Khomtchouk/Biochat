TITLE
Extracellular Matrix Proteolysis by MT1-MMP is Associated with Influenza-Related Mortality

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The balance between protecting tissue integrity and efficient immune response is critical for host survival. Here we investigate the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteolysis in achieving this balance in the lung during influenza virus infection using a combined genomic and proteomic approach. We followed the transcriptional dynamics and ECM- related responses in a mouse model of influenza virus infection, integrated with whole tissue imaging and functional assays. Our study identifies MT1-MMP as a prominent host-ECM-remodeling collagenase in influenza virus infection. We show that selective inhibition of MT1-MMP-driven ECM proteolysis protects the tissue from infection-related structural and compositional damage. Inhibition of MT1-MMP did not significantly alter the immune response or cytokine expression, indicating its dominant role in ECM remodeling. We demonstrate that the available treatment for influenza virus (Tamiflu/ Oseltamivir) does not prevent lung ECM damage and is less effective than anti-MT1-MMP treatment in influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae coinfection paradigms. Importantly, combination therapy of Tamiflu with anti-MT1-MMP shows a strong synergistic effect and results in complete recovery in mice.Â This study highlights the importance of tissue tolerance agents for surviving infectious diseases, and the potential of such host-pathogen therapy combination for respiratory infections.

DESIGN
Overall 8 samples were included, in duplicates, both infected and non-infected control cells were includeda. Both MT1-MMP positive and MT1-MMP negative were tested were non-infectdd, MT1-MMP negative cells served as controls.
