TITLE
Copy number variation comparison between control and CC214-2 resistant GBM39 xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we present genome-wide copy number variation data on two vehicle treated and two CC214-2 (an mTOR kinase inhibitor) resistant GlioBlastoma Multiforme 39 (GBM39) xenografts, showing the absence of significant differences between the two groups, demonstrating that resistance to CC214-2 is due to adaptation rather than gene mutations.

DESIGN
The genomic DNA extracted from the 4 xenografts samples was analysed with genome-wide Affymetrix SNP6.0 array

PLATFORM
GPL6801 [GenomeWideSNP_6] Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array
