TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing analysis of Lhx6 heterozygote and null forebrain transcriptomes at post natal day 15

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we characterize the changes in the forebrain transcriptome resulting from the deletion of the transcription factor Lhx6, generated by RNA-seq technology with biologic replication. Lhx6 is an essential regulatory gene in the development of cortical interneurons generated in the medial ganglionic eminences of the embryonic brain. This data contains insights into gene networks important for the development of medial ganglionic eminence derived interneurons.

DESIGN
Forebrain total RNA profiles of 15-day old Lhx6 heterozygote (Het) and Lhx6 null mice were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina GAIIx. Mutant allele used was Lhx6tm2Vpa (MGI:3702518). Each individual sample was comprised of two animals. Four samples for Lhx6 Het and three samples for Lhx6 null mice were generated and analysed in parallel.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
