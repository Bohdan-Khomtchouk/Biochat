TITLE
microRNA levels in patients receiving CRT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is a discovery cohort of six patients who received CRT with significant improvement in ejection fraction (EF), and six who received CRT but did not experience improvement. All patients are male, with left bundle branch block and do not have coronary disease (non-ischemic myopathy). Patients are matched for age and ejection fraction (EF)

DESIGN
This is a prospective study. Patients receiving CRT had time zero serum samples drawn. miRNA levels were drawn and screened using low-density array. Responders and non-responders to CRT were compared with the goal of identifying miRNAs important in LV remodeling and response to CRT
