TITLE
Biomarkers of residual disease, disseminated tumor cells, and metastases in the MMTV-PyMT breast cancer model

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of disseminated tumor cells in lung, lung metastatses and residual tumor cells in the MMTV-PyMT breast cancer model.

DESIGN
Profiling gene expression change between disseminated tumor cells, lung metastases and residual tumor cells from the MMTV-PyMT breast cancer model.
