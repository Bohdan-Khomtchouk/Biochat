TITLE
Expression profiling of the plant cell wall mutants: pmr5, pmr6 and pmr5 pmr6 double mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The rosettes from genotype Col-0, pmr5, pmr6 and pmr5 pmr6 double mutant were collected for RNA expression profiling when the plants were 3 weeks old. Keywords: cell wall mutant

DESIGN
The rosettes were collected when the plants were 3 weeks old for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL198 [ATH1-121501] Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array
