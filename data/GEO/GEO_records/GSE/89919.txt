TITLE
Whole Genome Bisulfite sequencing for liver DNA methylation analysis of rat exposed to 0.05% Pb

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We generated 4 Gb of high-quality sequencing data (~1 Gb per sample). The NCD+0.05%Pb group had hypermethylation at the whole genome level, compared to NCD. Difference analysis in gene methylation aimed at TSS region indicated that a total of 2733 genes experienced DNA methylation changes, with 2320 hypermethylated genes and 413 hypomethylated genes of the NCD+0.05%Pb group compared with the NCD group.

DESIGN
8-week-old Wistar rats were divide into NCD and NCD+0.05%Pb groups. Rats of the NCD group were treated normal dringking water,rats of NCD+0.05%Pb group were exposed to 0.05% dosages of lead acetate through drinking water.two liver samples were taken out from each group for WGBS,and the DNA methylation level of livers were analyzed and compared between the two groups.
