TITLE
Expression data in Arabidopsis hda6 mutant axe1-5 and its parental line DR5 under cold and control conditions.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the role of Arabidopsis histone deacetylase HDA6 in plant cold acclimation, we have employed transcriptional profiling of the hda6 mutant and its parental line under cold and control conditions to identify genes differentially expressed in the hda6 mutant under cold and control conditions. Aligent’s Whole Arabidopsis Gene Expression Microarray (G2519F, V4, 4x44K) were used.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis hda6 mutant axe1-5 and its parental line DR5 were grown in MS agar plates for 2 weeks (16 hours light / 8 hours dark). For cold treated sample, the plants were subjected for cold treatment at 2˚C for 3 days (12 hours light / 12 hours dark). Then total RNA was prepared and used for the microarray hybridization. Three replicative hybridization experiments for each array were carried out using the independent biological samples.
