TITLE
Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514 in various carbon sources

ORGANISM
Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514

SUMMARY
The sugar metabolic mechanism on glucose, xylose, fructose and cellobiose as the sole or dual carbon source by Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514 was characterized by whole genome cDNA micorarrays.

DESIGN
In this study, X514 cell grew in difeined medium supplement with different carbohydrates. Each sample was prepared harvested at early-, mid- and late-log phases respectively. Samples were used to acquire expression profiles of total 2322 unique genes, leading to metabolic mechanism construction.

PLATFORM
GPL11001 Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514 2.3K oligo array version 1.0
