TITLE
Early-induced genes of human regulatory CD4+CD25hi Treg and CD4+CD25- Th cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Goals and objectives of this study: to identify genes preferentially induced in human CD4+CD25hi Treg cells following T-cell activation with potential role for stabililization & maintenance of the regulatory program. Keywords: T-cell receptor stimulation, gene-regulation, comparative gene expression profiling
