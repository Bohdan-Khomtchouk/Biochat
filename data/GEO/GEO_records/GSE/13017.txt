TITLE
Early-induced genes of human regulatory CD4+CD25hi Treg and CD4+CD25- Th cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Goals and objectives of this study: to identify genes preferentially induced in human CD4+CD25hi Treg cells following T-cell activation with potential role for stabililization & maintenance of the regulatory program. Keywords: T-cell receptor stimulation, gene-regulation, comparative gene expression profiling

DESIGN
Homo sapiens CD4+CD25- and CD4+CD25hi T cells were sorted from healthy individual donors and analyzed ex vivo (non-activated) or 1 day following T-cell receptor activation using anti-CD3/IL2 and anti-CD3/-CD28/IL2 (activated), respectively.
