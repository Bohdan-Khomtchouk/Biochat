TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in control, Hic1 KO and p53 KO mouse embrynoic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines II

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesised that genetic inactivation of the transcriptional repressor Hic1, would lead to changes in gene expression that may lead to transformation. We assessed changes in gene expression in immortal MEF cell lines in which Hic1 or p53 was inactivated.

DESIGN
Total RNA from was collected from immortal Hic1 KO and p53 KO MEF cell lines. A minimum number of 3 cell lines for all genotypes was collected.

PLATFORM
