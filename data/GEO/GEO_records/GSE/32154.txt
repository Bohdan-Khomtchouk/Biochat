TITLE
Gene expression profiling of N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU)-depleted HeLa cells versus non-depleted cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated a HeLa cell model of mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB (MPSIIIB) by depleting NAGLU. MPSIIIB-associated cell defects were prominent in NAGLU-depleted cells. We explored alterations of metabolic pathways in NAGLU-depleted cells versus non-depleted control cells by performing gene expression profiling. Exon array transcriptome analysis showed 96 transcripts with increased expression level and 38 transcripts with decreased expression level in NAGLU-depleted versus non-depleted cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from two independent cultures of non-depleted cells and NAGLU-depleted cells. We considered a minimal fold change of 1.5 fold and a corrected P value lower than 0.05.
