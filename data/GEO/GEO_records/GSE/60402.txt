TITLE
RNA-seq of laser-capture microdissected 50x50x50 um tissue cubes from the medial ganglionic eminence of wild-type and GFRa1 mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cortical interneurons originating from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) are among the most diverse cells within the CNS. Different pools of proliferating progenitor cells are thought to exist in the ventricular zone of the MGE, but whether the underlying subventricular and mantle regions of the MGE are spatially patterned has not yet been addressed. Here, we combined laser-capture microdissection and multiplex RNA-sequencing to map the transcriptome of MGE cells at a spatial resolution of 50 µm. Distinct groups of progenitor cells showing different stages of interneuron maturation were identified and topographically mapped based on their genome-wide transcriptional pattern.

DESIGN
One 50  µm coronal section from the MGE was taken from each of two wildtype and one GFRa1 mutant E12.5 C57bl6/J mouse. Each section was laser microdissected into approximately 100 cubes, covering the whole MGE, and each cube was further processed for RNA-seq analysis.
