TITLE
ETS2, ERG promote megakaryopoiesis, synergize with alterations in GATA1 to immortalize hematopoietic progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Serial replated GFP + lineage negative cells from Gata1deltaneodeltaHS fetal liver hematopoietic progenitors for 4 generations in methocult M3234 under megakaryocyte promoting conditions, IL3, TPO, IL6, and IL11. Cells were subject to retro-viral infection with MIGR1GFP, MIGR1ETS2, MIGR1ERG, and MIGR1FLI1.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression profile for GFP + immortalized MIGR1-GFP Gata1deltaneodeltaHS fetal liver progenitors to that of GFP+ Gata1deltaneodeltaHS MIGR1-ETS2, MIGR1-ERG, and MIGR1FLI1 fetal liver progenitors
