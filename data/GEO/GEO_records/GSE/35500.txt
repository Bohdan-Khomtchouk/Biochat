TITLE
Gene expression and ChIP-chip analysis of U251 human glioblastoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using human U251 glioblastoma cells with endogenous mutp53 expression as a model, we performed a ChIP-chip analysis of mutp53 binding sites on a custom tiling array, coupled with global expression profiling and an analysis of the epigenetic status of mutp53 regulated promoters. Mutp53 binds preferentially, and independent of other transcription factors (e.g. ETS1 and SP1), to G/C-rich DNA stretches around transcriptional start sites (TSS) of many genes. Mutp53-bound regions are frequently located in CpG islands and are highly prone to adopt non-B DNA conformation(s). Analysis of the transcriptional status of mutp53-regulated genes demonstrated that mutp53 generally modulates transcription from active promoters marked by H3K4me3. Based on our data we propose a dual mode model of mutp53 GOF, which includes both stochastic and deterministic components. On a local scale, mutp53 acts as a basal transcriptional co-factor that has the potential to bind autonomously and selectively to non-B DNA structures around TSSs of active genes and to modulate transcription rates of many genes in a context and stimulus-dependent fashion. Resulting stochastic alterations generate transcriptional plasticity and enhance transcriptional competence on a global scale. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
