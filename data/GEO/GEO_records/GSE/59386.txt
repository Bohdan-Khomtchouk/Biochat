TITLE
Human intestinal DC and MNP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Parallel subpopulations of CD11c+ MNPs present in the mouse intestine similarly exist in the human intestine (Fig. 6A and Ref. (Merad et al., 2013)). To evaluate whether these distinct subpopulations of MNPs from human intestinal tissue functioned similarly, we examined the phenotypic properties of CD103+ DCs and CD14+ MNPs (which express CX3CR1 (Kamada et al., 2008)) within the CD11c+ MHCII+ fraction of LPMCs (Fig. 6B).  In contrast to CD103+ DCs, CD14+ MNPs expressed CD64 as well as higher levels of CD86.  Consistent with the phenotypic characterization of these subsets, transcriptional analysis of these populations by RNA-seq revealed higher levels of CLEC9A, XCR1, and CD207 expression in the CD103+ cells, while MERTK, STAB1, and CX3CR1 were higher in the CD14+ cells (Fig. 6C).  We tested the potential of these subsets to induce IL-22 production by co-culturing TLR-stimulated CD14+ MNPs and CD103+ DCs from human intestinal resections with intestinal ILCs.  Intracellular cytokine staining at 18 hours revealed that the CD14+ MNP were more effective than the CD103+ DCs at stimulating IL-22 production by ILCs (Fig. 6D).  Neither cell population induced significant IL-17 or IFNg production by ILCs (Fig. 6D, 6E).
