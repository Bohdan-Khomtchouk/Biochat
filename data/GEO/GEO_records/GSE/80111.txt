TITLE
A. thaliana transcriptomic responses against UV-B stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
By using A. thaliana microarray platform, the transcriptomic response of shoot tissues was characterized at 4h and 8h post exposure to UV-B radiation at wavelength of 300 nm..

DESIGN
Four weeks old Arabidopsis thaliana, Col 0 rosettes were exposed to UV-B radiation in the environmental chamber of Helmholtz Zentrum, Muenchen and tissues were harvested at 4h and 8h post-exposure time points.

PLATFORM
GPL16892 Agilent-029132 At8X60 [Probe Name version]
