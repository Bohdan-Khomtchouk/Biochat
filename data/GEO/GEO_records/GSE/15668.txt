TITLE
Human Mammary Epithelial Cell Response to EGF, microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand how integration of multiple data types can help decipher cellular responses at the systems level, we analyzed the mitogenic response of human mammary epithelial cells to epidermal growth factor (EGF) using whole genome microarrays, mass spectrometry-based proteomics and large-scale western blots with over 1000 antibodies.  A time course analysis revealed significant differences in the expression of 3172 genes and 596 proteins, including protein phosphorylation changes measured by western blot. Integration of these disparate data types showed that each contributed qualitatively different components to the observed cell response to EGF and that varying degrees of concordance in gene expression and protein abundance measurements could be linked to specific biological processes.  Networks inferred from individual data types were relatively limited, whereas networks derived from the integrated data recapitulated the known major cellular responses to EGF and exhibited more highly connected signaling nodes than networks derived from any individual dataset.  While cell cycle regulatory pathways were altered as anticipated, we found the most robust response to mitogenic concentrations of EGF was induction of matrix metalloprotease cascades, highlighting the importance of the EGFR system as a regulator of the extracellular environment.  These results demonstrate the value of integrating multiple levels of biological information to more accurately reconstruct networks of cellular response. Keywords: time-course analysis

DESIGN
Synchronized human mammary epithelial cells were stimulated into mitosis using epidermal growth factor and samples were harvested at 1, 4, 8, 13, 18 and 24hrs for parallel analysis by microarray, global proteomics and western blot analysis.
