TITLE
Expression data from chick embryonic midbrain over-expressing constitutively active integrin-beta 1 in a hetergenous manner.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Integrins have long been known to have a role in adhesion of neural stem cells within the neuroepithelium, but little is known about their role in regulating stem cell behaviour through signalling.  We aimed to investigate the effect of integrin-beta 1 signalling (itgb1) on these cells by transfection of a constitutively active itgb1.  This creates a heterogenous pattern of expression allowing the study of cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous effects.

DESIGN
Chick embryonic midbrains were electroporated with the CA*b1 construct at E2, onset of neurogenesis, creating a hetergenous pattern of expression.  At E4, cells were FACS sorted into expressing and non expressing and sent for microarray analysis of gene expression.  5-8 embryos were pooled for each replicate.
