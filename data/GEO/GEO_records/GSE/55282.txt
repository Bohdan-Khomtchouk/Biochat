TITLE
Characterization of distinct classes of differential gene expression in osteoblast cultures from non-syndromic craniosynostosis bone

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report on explant osteoblast cultures from human patients, demonstrating that there are at least three sub-types of non-syndromic craniosynostosis defined by similarity of gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
Osteoblast growth in culture, 23 craniosynostosis skull samples (7 metopic; 8 coronal; 3 lambdoid; 5 sagittal) and 8 normal (4 cranial bones and 4 long bones)

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
