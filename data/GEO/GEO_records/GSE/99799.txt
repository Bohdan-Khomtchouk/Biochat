TITLE
Aedes aegypti response to bloodfeeding and bacterial ingestion in midgut tissues of females from two strains

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
Rockefeller and Singapore strain Aedes aegypti female mosquitoes differ in the number of bacteria present in the midgut. Females from each strain were either maintained on 3% sucrose solution, fed a sterile blood meal, or fed a blood meal containing a cocktail of bacteria. Differential transcript abundance was compared between females from each strain/treatment combination and a common reference sample pool. The overall goal was to determine how gene expression in Rockefeller females differs from Singapore females in order to better understand why the gut microbiome differs between the strains.

DESIGN
15 midguts collected per sample, 3 replicate samples per treatment. Treatments: Rockefeller Sucrose fed vs. Reference, Rockefeller blood fed vs. Reference, Rockefeller blood + bacteria fed vs. Reference, Singapore Sucrose fed vs. Reference, Singapore blood fed vs. Reference, Singapore blood + bacteria fed vs. Reference.
