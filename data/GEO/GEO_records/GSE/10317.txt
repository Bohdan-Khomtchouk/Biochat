TITLE
A case of primary hyperparathyroidism and undetectable serum PTH due to a truncating PTH gene mutation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A investigation of the gene expression of one parathyroid tumour compared to its adjacent normal tissue Keywords: differentially expressed gene profile

DESIGN
Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Chip (Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 Array. One sample compared directly to the other to find genes that are differentially expressed and that are significant to the tumour. Univariate analysis was applied.
