TITLE
Time course expression data from early Bovine embryo, Human embryo, and Mouse embryo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Bos taurus ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The process of early development of mammals is subtly and accurately controlled by the regulation networks of embryo cells. Time course expression data measured at different stages during early embryo development process can give us valuable information by revealing the dynamic expression patterns of genes in genome wide scale. In this study, bovine embryo expression data were generated  at oocyte, one cell stage, two cell stage, four cell stage, eight cell stage, sixteen cell stage, morula, and blastocyst; Human embryo expression data were generated at one cell stage, two cell stage, four cell stage, eight cell stage, morula, and blastocyst; Mouse embryo expression data were generated at one cell stage, two cell stage, four cell stage, eight cell stage, morula, and blastocyst. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Bovine, Human, and Mouse embryos were harvested at successive stage from oocyte to blastocyste. Total RNAs were extracted, amplified and hybridized onto Affymetrix microarrays.
