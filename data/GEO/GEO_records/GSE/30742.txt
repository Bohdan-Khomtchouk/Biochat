TITLE
Transcription profile of primordium gut organs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mechanisms of gastrointestinal morphogenesis in mammals are not well understood. This is partly due to the lack of organ specific gene expression pattern in the gastrointestinal tract during development. The initiation of organ bud formation occurs at E9.5-E11.5 in mice. These primordia for the digestive organs, including esophagus, stomach, and intestine,  protrude from a tube-like structured endoderm, and have their own distinct morphogenesis. Thus, using mouse embryos, we surveyed transcription of prospective these three regions at E11.5 during gastrointestinal morphogenesis. This early digestive organ specific transcription profile will be useful for understanding of the mechanisms of gastrointestinal development.

DESIGN
Mouse gut organs morphogenesis begin at E9.5-E11.5. The primordium esophagus, stomach, and intestine at E11.5 were dissected and analysed transcription profile.
