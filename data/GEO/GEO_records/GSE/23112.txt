TITLE
Profiling and Functional Analyses of MicroRNAs and Their Target Gene Products in Human Uterine Leiomyomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human uterine leiomyomas (ULM) are characterized by dysregulation of a large number of genes and non-coding regulatory microRNAs. In order to identify microRNA::mRNA associations relevant to ULM pathogenesis, we examined global correlation patterns between the altered microRNA expression and the predicted target genes in leiomyomas and matched myometria. We found that some but not all of the predicted and inversely correlated target genes in ULMs can be directly regulated by microRNAs in vitro. Our findings provide a broad overview of molecular events underlying the tumorigenesis of uterine leiomyoma and identify select genetic and regulatory events that alter microRNA expression and may play important roles in ULM pathobiology by positively regulating tumor growth while maintaining the non-invasive character of ULMs Keywords: Differential gene expression

DESIGN
Paired normal (myometrium) and tumor (ULM) samples derived from 5 patients were used
