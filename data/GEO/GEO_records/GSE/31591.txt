TITLE
Gene expression profile after oral vaccination against infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV)

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
Oral immunization of trout against infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) have been recently reported by using a DNA vector coding the viral capsid VP2 gene encapsulated in alginate microspheres. We report here an study of the transcripts in head kidney and pyloric ceca 7 days after oral vaccination of rainbow trout by using a newly designed rainbow trout 60-mer oligo microarray focused in their immune-related genes.

DESIGN
Trout were obtained from 4 different farms, one group of trout was defined as belonging to one of the farms. Each of the trout 4 groups were divided into two subgroups of 6 trout for each subgroup. Subgroup I was orally vaccinated with 10 µl of suspension of the vaccine microspheres each containing 10 µg of pcDNA-VP2 diluted in 10µl of PBS, while subgroup II received similar microspheres suspension but pcDNA. Head kidney and pyloric ceca  were collected from each subgroup and RNA was extracted.
