TITLE
Investigation of the effect of succinate and dimethyl malonate on murine bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated with or without LPS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We aim to further elucidate the effect of succinate and the succinate dehydrogenase inhibtor, dimethyl malonate, on macrophages treated with LPS. Specifically we want to deepen our understanding of how these reagents influence both LPS-induced IL-1B and IL-10.

DESIGN
BMDMs were either left untreated or treated with succinate or dimethyl malonate for 3 h prior to treatment with or without LPS for 4 or 48 h.
