TITLE
Expression data from  Ad-atrogin-1-GFP or Ad-GFP infected cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Cardiomyocyte cell death and renewal are the pivotal events in the pathogenesis of heart failure .Atrogin-1/MAFbx is an ubiquitin E3 ligase that regulates myocardial structure and function through the cellular mechanism of protein degradation. We used DNA microarrays to detail the global trends in gene expression underlying atrogin-1- overexpressed cardiomyocytes and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Our findings suggest that atrogin-1 plays a critical role in regulating cardiac dysfunction at transcriptional level and may provide novel insight into how atrogin-1 modulates the programming of cardiac muscle gene expression.

DESIGN
Cardiomyocytes were infected with GFP control or atrogin-1 adenoviruses for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to define the effects of atrogin-1 on the global programme of gene expression in primary cardiomyocytes. To that end, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were infected with GFP control (G) or atrogin-1 adenovirus (A) for 24 hours.
