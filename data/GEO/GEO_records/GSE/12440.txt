TITLE
Expression analysis of Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 delta-gmd-fcl delta-fkp and B. fragilis NCTC 9343 delta-lfg

ORGANISM
Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 delta-gmd-fcl delta-fkp mutant strain and a Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 delta-lfg mutant strain, each as compared to the wild-type strain. The mutations engineered into these strains interfere with B. fragilis protein glycosylation.

DESIGN
A nine chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures of Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343, three separate cultures of Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 delta-gmd-fcl delta-fkp, in which gmd (BF1888) and fcl (BF1887) and fkp (BF2607) are deleted, and three separate cultures of Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 delta-lfg, in which nine genes (BF4298 through BF4306) of the lfg locus are truncated or deleted entirely.  Each chip measures the expression level of 4,231 genes from Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 and the associated plasmid pBF9343 with eighteen 60-mer probes per gene, with five-fold technical redundancy.
