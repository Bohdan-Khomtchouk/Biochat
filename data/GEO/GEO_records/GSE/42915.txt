TITLE
Differential miRNA expression profiles in the first and third trimester human placentas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of miRNA in the placental development, we analyzed miRNA expression profiles in the first and third trimester human placentas. Total RNA was isolated from 12 placentas (6 from first trimester and 6 from third trimester). miRNA expression profiles were determined by Affymetrix GeneChip 2.0 miRNA Microarray.

DESIGN
Using miRNA microarray to determine miRNA expression profiles in the human placenta between first and third trimester pregnancies.
