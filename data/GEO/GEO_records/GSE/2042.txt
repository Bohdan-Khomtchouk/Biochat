TITLE
Apoptosis and differentiation commitment:novel insights revealed by gene profiling studies in mouse Embryonic Stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells remain pluripotent in vitro when grown in presence of Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF). LIF starvation leads to apoptosis of some of the ES-derived differentiated cells, together with p38a MAP kinase activation. Apoptosis, but not morphological cell differentiation, is blocked by a p38 inhibitor, PD 169316. To further understand the mechanism of action of this compound, we have identified its specific targets by microarray studies. We report on the global expression profiles of genes expressed at three days upon LIF withdrawal (d3) compared to pluripotent cells and of genes whose expression is modulated at d3 under anti-apoptotic conditions. We showed that at d3 without LIF cells express, earlier than anticipated, specialized cell markers and that when the apoptotic process was impaired, expression of differentiation markers was altered. In addition, functional tests revealed properties of anti-apoptotic proteins not to alter cell pluripotency and a novel role for metallothionein 1 gene which prevents apoptosis of early differentiated cells.
