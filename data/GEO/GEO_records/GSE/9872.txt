TITLE
Gene expression in the Antarctic fish Trematomus bernacchii shows a muted response to heat stress

ORGANISM
Gillichthys mirabilis ; Trematomus bernacchii

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to measure the effect of heat stress on the transcriptome of a cold-adapted fish (Trematomus bernacchii) and compare it to a temperate species (Gillichthys mirabilis). This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
In the first experiment (Gillichthys mirabilis), three control fish are compared to three heat-shocked fish. In the second experiment (Trematomus bernacchii), three control fish are compared to 3 heat-shocked fish, 3 short-term recovery fish and 3 longer term recovery fish.

PLATFORM
GPL5573 Gillichthys mirabilis cDNA microarray
