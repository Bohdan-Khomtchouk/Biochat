SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptional profiles of mRNA and microRNA in Rasless fibroblasts. 4-Hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT) treatment triggers removal of K-Ras expression in [H-Ras-/-;N-Ras-/-;K-Raslox/lox;RERTert/ert ] mouse fibroblasts (named K-Raslox) generating “Rasless” MEFs which are unable to proliferate, but recover proliferative ability after ectopic expression of constitutively active downstream kinases such as BRAF and MEK1. Using Affymetrix microarrays, we compared the transcriptional profiles of Rasless fibroblasts to those of K-Raslox (MEFs lacking only H-Ras and N-Ras). We also compared the transcriptional profile of Rasless cells with those of BRAF and MEK1-transfected Rasless cells which recovered proliferative ability. Re-entry of the Rasless cells into cell cycle progression through ectopic expression of activated BRAF or MEK1 resulted in full reversion of most transcriptional alterations identified in cells lacking the three canonical Ras proteins.
