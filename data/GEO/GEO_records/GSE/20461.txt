TITLE
Global coordinated bistable activation of the core region of the ICEclc genomic island in Pseudomonas knackmussii

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas knackmussii

SUMMARY
To further characterize the organization of the transcriptional units and the global behaviour of the genomic island ICEclc in Pseudomonas knackmussii, we have employed Agilent DNA custom microarray in the 8X15K format.

DESIGN
ICEclc-specific gene expression in Pseudomonas knackmussii strain B13 was measured during exponential phase growth on 10mM 3-chlorobenzoate (3CBA) as sole carbon and energy source and during the following stationary phase. Both growth phases were performed in triplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL10091 Agilent-020923 ICEclcB13
