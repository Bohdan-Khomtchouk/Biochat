TITLE
Cuc1 mutants expressing the chimeric repressor TCP3-SRDX

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Downstream genes of Arabidopsis TCP3 transcription factor were tried to be identified. The expression of TCP3-SRDX was induced after germination by estrogen-induction system in a wild type and cuc1 mutant background to reduce an effect of CUC induction by TCP3-SRDX.

DESIGN
Two Two-condition experiments, induced vs. non-induced and induced in cuc1 vs non-induced in cuc1. Biological replicates: 3 or 4 replicates.
