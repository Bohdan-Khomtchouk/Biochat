TITLE
Gene Expression Data in HDAC2 KO Myocardium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cardiac development by HDAC2 and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: Genetic Modification

DESIGN
Embryonic heart ventricles were dissected at E17.5 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Wild type and HDAC2-deficient littermates were used.  Tissue from 2-3 individual animals of identical genotype was pooled for each micro-array.
