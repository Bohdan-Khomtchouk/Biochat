TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the whole mouse brain using transcriptome tomography

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We developed a novel framework to assess comprehensive endogenous gene expression maps in a broad and isotropic 3D-anatomical context using a relatively small number of original data points: transcriptome tomography. Using this method, we produced a dataset of gene expression maps of the whole mouse brain, computationally reconstructed from fraction data.

DESIGN
A total of 61 fraction samples obtained with body axes-based slicing preparation conjugated with anatomical image acquisition were analysed. There are two sets of body axes-based preparation series: the S series, composed of 9 fractions/ C of 13 fractions/ H of 6 fractions , and the So series, composed of 10 fractions/ Co of 16 fractions/ Ho of 7 fractions.
