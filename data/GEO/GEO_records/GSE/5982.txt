TITLE
Gene expression in melanocytes and metastases melanoma cells from the pig

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Melanoblastoma-bearing Libechov minipigs (MeLiM) provide an animal model for the study of spontaneous cutaneous melanoma. We compared the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) profile between normal skin melanocytes and melanoma cells from a pulmonary metastasis of MeLiM. Keywords: disease state study

DESIGN
To minimise the contribution of cells other than melanocytes, we constructed SAGE libraries from a primary culture of melanoma cells derived from a pulmonary melanoma metastasis of a young MeLiM and from a pigmented melanocyte cell line, PigMel, derived from the skin of a healthy Meishan pig.
