TITLE
Stump project-- mRNA basal layer keratinocytes; Volar versus non-volar acral skin gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We were interested in defining the gene signature of volar skin.

DESIGN
Punch biopsies of skin were split into epidermis and dermis after dispase treatment. Epidermis was trypsinized and sorted for alpha 6 integrin positive basal layer keratinocytes  We collected RNA from basal layer keratinocytes  of soles and backs of feet and submitted for Affymetrix Exon arrays. 2 replicates of each site from distinct human donors were included; total of 4 samples analyzed

PLATFORM
GPL5175 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
