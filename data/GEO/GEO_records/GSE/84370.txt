TITLE
Gene expression profiling of adipocyte precursor cells in response to Pdgfa

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adipocyte precursor cells were treated with Pdgfa during 1 or 2 hours in vitro to identify early changes in transciprion in response to treatment. This experiment supports the evidence that Pdgfa induces proliferation and maintenance of adipocyte stem cells.

DESIGN
Adipocyte precursor cells were isolated by FACS and treated with 30ng/ml of recombinant mouse Pdgfa for 1 or 2 hours.
