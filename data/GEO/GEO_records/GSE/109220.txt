TITLE
miRNA expression data from human PBMC derived form acute infectious mononucleosis patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is the etiological agent of acute infectious mononucleosis (IM). Since acute IM is a self-resolving disease with most patients regaining health in one to three weeks there have been few studies examining molecular signatures in early acute stages of the disease. microRNAs have been shown, however, to influence immune cell function and consequently the generation of antibody responses in IM. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed microRNAs in early stage uncomplicated acute IM. We used microarrays to profile microRNAs from patient peripheral blood obtained at the time of IM diagnosis and at subsequent time points, and identified differentially regulated microRNAs in this process.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood samples were derived from symptomatic patients at diagnosis, 1 , 2 and 7 months and processed to obtain PBMCs which were frozen and then maintained in liquid nitrogen until use. PBMCs were also isolated from blood derived from healthy age-matched individuals. Patient (n = 16) and healthy control (n = 3) PBMCs were suspended and lysed in TRIzol Reagent  and cleaned-up with RNeasy spin columns using a modified protocol for isolation of total RNA and hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 4.0 arrays.
