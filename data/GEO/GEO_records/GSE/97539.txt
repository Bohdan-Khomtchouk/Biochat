TITLE
Gene expression changes in the absence of the carbon catabolite repressor, CreA.

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to test the change in gene expression in the absence of the transcription factor, CreA. Two media conditions were tested to determine the role of this  transcription factor in repressing (glucose) and derepressing (ethanol) carbon sources.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from a creA-null mutant and the parental wild type strain (CEA10) under two media conditions (glucose, ethanol).
