TITLE
Copy number profile of human prostate cancer organoid lines using Agilent 1M aCGH platform

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Advanced prostate cancer is a highly heterogenous disease with few in vitro models. We report generation of seven novel 3D organoid lines of patient-derived prostate cancer. We determine the copy number alterations of these lines using array CGH. They contain may classic alterations of prostate cancer such as lost of the short arm of chromosome 8 and gain of the long arm of chromosome 8. In addition, we found homozygous deleteion of tumor suppressor PTEN and CHD1 as well as the TMPRSS2-ERG interstitial deletion.

DESIGN
Prostate cancer organoid lines, ~2 months after in vitro propagation, were used for profiling  on Agilent 1M aCGH arrays per manufacturer's instructions. A pooled reference normal DNA was used as the reference.
