TITLE
A Methylation Assay Predicts Response to Radiation Therapy in Patients with Glioblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of glioma sphere-forming cells (GSC) derived from surgery specimens of glioblastoma patients.The Illumina Infinium 450K Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in 12 GSC samples. Clonogeneic assays were used to detemine the radiation response of these 12 GSCs.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 12 GSCs were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
