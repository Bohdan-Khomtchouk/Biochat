TITLE
[E-MTAB-935] GENCODE PCR-Seq Batch VII

ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
As part of the ENCODE consortium the GENCODE project is producing a reference gene set through manual and automated gene prediction. Selected transcript models are verified experimentally by RT-PCR amplification followed by sequencing. This is batch VII, which targets annotations from Gencode 8 (March 2011).
