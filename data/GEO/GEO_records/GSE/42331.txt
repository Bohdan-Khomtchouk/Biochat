TITLE
Gene expression data from whole blood of Klinefelter Syndrome patients compared to male and female controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients with Klinefelter Syndrome have the karyotype 47,XXY. These men are suffering from hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and are infertile. It is debated whether the different hormonal constitution observed in these patients or different gene expression With the Microarray analysis we could identify genes on the X-chromosomes that are upregulated in KS-patietns compared to healthy male controls. But also autosomal genes were found to be differentially regulated.

DESIGN
mRNA was isolated from whole blood of 35 KS-patients and 15 healthy male and 15 healthy female controls and hybridization on Affymetrix Arrays.
