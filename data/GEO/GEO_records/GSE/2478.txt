TITLE
Transcripts affected by RNAi to POLRMT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rho0 HeLa cells (devoid of mitochondrial DNA and functional mitochondria) were infected with recombinant lentiviral vector pLSLG expressing short hairpin RNAi complementary to Exons 3 and 17 of POLRMT gene.  48 hours after infection total RNA was isolated and analyzed for inhibition of POLRMT transcripts by RT-PCR.  Total RNA from Rho0 HeLa infected with empty pLSLG vector was used as control.  The two samples of RNA were used for microarray hybridization with Affymetrix human genome U133 2.0 plus microarray in order to monitor changes in gene expression patterns after inhibition of POLRMT gene. Keywords: parallel sample
