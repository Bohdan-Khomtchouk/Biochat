TITLE
Effect of lactation on transcriptomic expression in bovine adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The objective was to study the transcriptomic changes in adipose tissue in the early stages of lactation, specifically in Bos Taurus, Holstein dairy cattle as a function of milk production and genetic merit. Chip quality backgrounds averaged below 50 units, and 3’/5’ bias on control genes < 2.0. Correlations among replicates were > 0.85.

DESIGN
The design was a simple paired sampling, with time (30 d prepartum and 14 d postpartum as the sampling times.  There was no dietary manipulation.  Animals were all first calving Holstein heifers, all raised on the same farm on the same diet
