TITLE
Effect of lactation on transcriptomic expression in bovine adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The objective was to study the transcriptomic changes in adipose tissue in the early stages of lactation, specifically in Bos Taurus, Holstein dairy cattle as a function of milk production and genetic merit. Chip quality backgrounds averaged below 50 units, and 3’/5’ bias on control genes < 2.0. Correlations among replicates were > 0.85.
