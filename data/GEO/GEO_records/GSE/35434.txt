TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of human macrophages stimulated with IL-4 (10ng/ml) (Illumina)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of alternative activation of macrophages at gene expression level. The study forms part of a wider study where we compare the effects of IL-4 in different human and mouse macrophages. Our results support the notion that in vitro culture conditions greatly affect the macrophage response to IL-4.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human monocyte derived macrophages upon exposure to 10 ng/ml of IL-4 for 48 hours.  Monocytes were induced to mature into macrophages using X Vivo 10 medium supplemented with 1% autologous serum.
