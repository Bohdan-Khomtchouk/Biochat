TITLE
A microfluidics-based in vitro model of the gastrointestinal human-microbe interface

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have developed a microfluidics-based in vitro model of the human gut allowing co-culture of human and microbial cells and subsequent multi-omic assessment of the effect of the co-culture on the host transcriptome. We compare the transcriptional changes induced in the human epithelial cell line, Caco-2 after co-culture with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or a consortium of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bacteroides caccae.
