TITLE
An extensive investigation of sulfur metabolism in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica

ORGANISM
Yarrowia lipolytica

SUMMARY
A comparison between high and low sulfur source supplies, i.e., sulfate, methionine or cystine, was carried out in order to identify key steps in the biosynthetic and catabolic pathways of the sulfur amino acids.

DESIGN
Two conditions experiment, high versus low sulfur conditions (sulfate, cystine or methionine with a ratio of 1 to 1000). Three biological experiments with a dye swap for each for  cystine and sulfate. Two biological experiments with a dye swap for each for methionine.
