TITLE
Comparative analysis of gene expression  WT and Nrf2-/- mice Type II cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesize that gene expression in the Type II cells of Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- mice are divergent thus contributing the cell growth. More specifically, type II cells from Nrf2-/- mice have increased reactive oxygen species that cause the impaired cell growth.  In order to test these hypotheses at the gene expression level, we utilized microarray analysis to examine transcriptional differences between Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- cells. Keywords: comparative expression profiling

DESIGN
. This study utilizes microarray analysis to test these hypotheses. Three sets of type II cells were isolated from lungs from both Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- mice and grown for 5 days. RNA was isolated and used for global gene expression profiling (Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 array). Statistically significant gene expression was determined as a minimum 6 counts of 9 pairwise comparisons, minimum 1.5-fold change, and p < 0.05. Further, Absolute | FC - FC SEM | > = 1.5.
