TITLE
Adiponectin-cre FTO flox/flox and FTO flox/flox mouse white fat tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single nucleotide polymorphisms in intron 1 of the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene were found to be associated with an increased risk of adult obesity. Enhanced FTO expression in mice leads to hyperphagia, increased fat mass, and higher body weight. Neuronal-specific FTOâ€“deleted mice have an identical lean body weight phenotype to global FTO-deleted mice. The physiological role of adipose FTO in the homeostasis of energy regulation remains to be elucidated. We used microarrays to elucidate the metabolic pathways that are regulated by FTO in the white fat.

DESIGN
FTO flox/flox and Adiponectin-cre FTO flox/flox (AFO) mice were fed with chow diet. White fat tissues from epididymal adipose pad were harvested under ad lib condition for RNA isolation. Three independent pools of FTO flox/flox and AFO mouse white fat RNA were included in the study.
