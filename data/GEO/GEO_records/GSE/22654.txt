TITLE
Myc-regulated gene expression in human fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Myc regulates many gene expression during cell growth, development, or other many cellular events. C-Myc is a well known molecule which expression increase in many cancers. Overexpression of c-Myc causes cell transformation, apoptosis, etc. There are several Myc family genes in human, mouse, or other species. The function of N-Myc was well characterized and was similar to that of c-Myc. However, the function of L-Myc is not clearly examined. To examine the function of L-Myc, we perfomed microarray analyses using L-Myc overexpressed human fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Adult human fibroblasts were transduced with Myc and their mutants and were used for microarray analyses.
