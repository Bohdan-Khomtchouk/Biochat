TITLE
Hoxb1 mutant mRNA levels  in rhombomere 4 at E10.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hoxb1 is required for proper specification of rhombomere 4 and the facial motor neurons. This study analyzed gene expression in the corresponding hindbrain segment of E10.5 mutant embryos. Several genetic pathways were found altered, including transcription factors such as Phox2b, Gata3, Nkx2-2 and Nkx6-1. Keywords: hindbrain development, rhombomere 4, Hoxb1

DESIGN
Each of the three mutant and control samples was an independent biological replicate. Pools of r4 segments from multiple embryos were snap frozen on dry ice and stored at -80ÂºC. Total RNA was isolated, processed with standard Affymetrix protocols and hybridized to GeneChip Mouse Expression Sets 430A.
