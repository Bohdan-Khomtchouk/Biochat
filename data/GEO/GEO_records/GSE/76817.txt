TITLE
Identification of candidate targets for Haizao Yuhu Decoction acting on goiter rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To predict the different genes, this study compared the gene expression level among the control group, the model group and the treatment groups.

DESIGN
In this present study, 20 Wistar rats, weighting 160-180g and as the sex evenly, were randomly divided into five groups: normal control group, model control group , Haizao Yuhu decoction group,  Haizao Yuhu decotion lacking Sargassum fusiforme (DL-S) group, and  Haizao Yuhu decotion lacking Radix Glycyrrhiza (DL-G)  group. Except the rats in control and model groups, the three other groups, which were established as goiter model, were administered appropriate medication  at the dose of 1mL/100g for 28 consecutive days. After all animals sacrificed, thyroids were removed and then put in Trizol for microarray experiments.
