TITLE
Expression data from WT and Fezf2 KO mTECs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fezf2 is highly and specifically expressed in mTECs in mouse thymus and Fezf2 deficiency (Fezf2 KO) in the thymus leads to autoimmunity. However, it is unclear how Fezf2 contributes to thymic gene expression. We collected WT and Fezf2 KO mTECs by FACS, and performed microarrays to determine genes regulated by Fezf2.

DESIGN
mTECs were subjected to RNA extraction (from WT or Fezf2 KO mTECs) and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
