TITLE
ChIP-seq to profile LPS-induced RNA polymerase II transcription in bone marrow-derived macrophages  from WT and Hes1 KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We characterized the RNA polymerase II occupancy on gene loci in WT and Hes1 KO  BMDMs under untreated and LPS-stimulated conditions

DESIGN
WT and Hes1 KO BMDMs were left untreated or stimulated with LPS  for 1 hour. Pol II ChIP was performed and the DNA products were subject to ChIPseq
