TITLE
Epigenetic-scale comparison of human iPSCs generated by retrovirus, Sendai virus or episomal vectors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined genome-wide DNA methylation with 20  human iPSC lines derived from five different cell types,and 7 human ESC lines using Illuminaâ€™s Infinium HumanMethylation450K and compared among iPSCs by retrovirus, Sendai virus or episomal vectors.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 30 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450K Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
