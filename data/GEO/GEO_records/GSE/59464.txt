TITLE
Polycomb PRC2 antagonizes de novo DNA methylation at the maternal Gtl2-Rian-Mirg locus [Affymetrix Expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild-type mouse embryonic stem cells are compared with mutants for components of PRC2 including  Ezh2-/-, Eed-/-, and Jarid2-/- cells. Gene expression microarrays were used to compare the expression for these.

DESIGN
This experiment compares wild-type gene expression with mutants for different PRC2 components, including Ezh2-/-, Eee-/- and Jarid2-/- with two replicates for each using Affymetrix Gene Expression Arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL8321 [Mouse430A_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array
