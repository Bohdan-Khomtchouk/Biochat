TITLE
Ets homologous factor has critical roles in epithelial dysfunction in airway disease [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ets homologous factor (EHF) is an Ets family transcription factor expressed in many epithelial cell types including those lining the respiratory system. Disruption of the airway epithelium is central to many lung diseases, and a network of transcription factors coordinates its normal function. EHF can act as a transcriptional activator or a repressor. Using EHF ChIP-seq and RNA-seq after EHF depletion, we show its targets in HBE cells are enriched for genes involved in degradation of misfolded proteins, inflammation, and wound repair.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from primary human bronchial epithelial cells treated with negative control (NC) or EHF siRNA, in quintuplicate.
