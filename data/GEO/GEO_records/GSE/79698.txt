TITLE
The effect of niclosamide on the growth and progression of endometriosis in an experimental mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Because niclosamide inhibits growth and progression of endometriotic lesions, we performed RNA-seq in order to identify genes whose expression is regulated by niclosamide in endometriotic lesions. Our results shown that niclosamide modulates several genes related to cell signaling, extracellular matrix, and inflammatory signaling.

DESIGN
A direct comparison of endometriotic like lesions developed in mice (n=3 per group) treated orally with either vehicle control or 200 mg/kg bw day of niclosamide for 3 weeks.
