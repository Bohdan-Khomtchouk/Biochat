TITLE
Comparative Genomic Hybridization between S. cerevisaie strains JAY270 and S288c.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The arrays in this series correspond to a comparative genomic analysis between S. cerevisiae strain JAY270 and the reference laboratory strain S288c. JAY270 is a heterothalic diploid used in bioethanol production from sugar cane feedstock in Brazil. This strain has several chromosomal length polymorphisms between homologous chromosomes. The two Chr6 homologs, Chr6 short and Chr6 long, were examined using microarrays to determine the genomic regions which are rearranged.

DESIGN
Three arrays are provided in this series. In all three total genomic DNA from a S288c isogenic strain was labeled with Cy3 and provides a reference for competitive hybridization to the arrays. The first array in the series is a full CGH-array comparing the complete JAY270 diploid genome to S288c. The second and third arrays correspond the PFGE-purified Chr6 short and Chr6 long DNA from JAY270 compared to the S288c genome (Band-arrays). The arrays used in this study were designed using the genome sequence of the reference S288c strain.
