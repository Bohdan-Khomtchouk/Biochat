TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of the early effects of sex steroid ablation on BM LT-HSCs 2 days post surgery.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene-expression alterations in primitive LT-HSCs as early as 2 days post sex steroid ablation. This study aimed to determine potential intrinsic changes occuring in the LT-HSC population associated with sex steroid ablation (SSA) at a timepoint that preceeded the earliest reported functional hematopoietic enhancements occuring at day 7 post SSA. These results are vital in providing insight into the role of LT-HSCs in initiating SSA-mediated immune regeneration.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from BM-sorted LT-HSC 2 days after sex steroid ablation compared to sham sex steroid ablation controls.
