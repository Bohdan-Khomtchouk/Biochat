TITLE
Temporal transcriptome analysis of control and Zeb2 knockout mESC in pluripotency and in neural differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To capture the Zeb2-dependent transcriptional changes in early cell state/fate decisions we performed RNA-seq on Zeb2 control and Zeb2 knockout cells. We chose three stages, which correspond in control ESCs to the naive pluripotent state (d0; very low amounts of Zeb2 mRNA), multipotent progenitors (d4, low Zeb2 mRNA/protein) and early neural progenitors (d6, high Zeb2 mRNA/protein), respectively.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of Zeb2 control (Ctrl) and Zeb2 knockout (KO) samples on day 0, day 4 and day 6 of neural differentiation were used in this study (18 samples in total)
