TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of inducible GATA6L-overexpressing HT-29 cells stimulated with TNF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to investigate the role of GATA6L with or without TNF stimulation. Microarrays were used to capture the transcriptional response to GATA6L overpexression at intermediate times after TNF stimulation.

DESIGN
Cells were induced for GATA6L overexpression and evaluated at two hours after stimulation with saturating TNF in biological triplicate.
