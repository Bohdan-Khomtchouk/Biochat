TITLE
Temperature dependent gene expression levels at  28°C and 37°C for  Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
To further understand the gene expression characteristics of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, we have applied whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to specify the temperature dependent expression of PAO1 genome at soil and human body temperature. We selected 28°C as temperature representative of the soil niche and 37°C for human body. The results from the temperature dependent transcriptome analysis are consistent to our previous published data that the phzM, ptsP and lasI genes expression is upregulated at 37°C [11]. The comparison analysis of the M18 genome expressional profiles at 28°C and 37°C indicated a total of 596 genes expressed in a temperature dependent manner over two fold.

DESIGN
Cells were grown to OD600=5.0-6.0 (late exponential phase) in LB medium at 28℃ and 37℃, respectively. Three independent experiments were performed at each time.

PLATFORM
GPL11372 Agilent_custom_Pseudomonas sp. M18_ 8*15K
