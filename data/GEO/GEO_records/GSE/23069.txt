TITLE
Gene expression profiling of HUVEC after stimulation with an inflammatory mediator cocktail

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the transcripts regulated by inflammation and how this regulation may differ between different individuals, the transcriptome of HUVECs stimulated with inflammatory mediators was examined in 9 different individuals.

DESIGN
In the study present here, HUVEC isolates from 9 different individuals were cultured until passage 4 in fully supplemented growth conditions. Passage 4 HUVEC isolates were then treated with a cocktail of inflammatory mediators (10ng/ml TNF-α, Il-1β, Il-8) for a period of 24 hours prior to RNA extraction. RNA was extracted and hybridised onto CodeLink microarrays. The expression profiles in the inflammatory mediator treated condition were examined along side a superset of the same biological replicates that were untreated (also submitted), to facilitate assessment of the resting transcriptome.
