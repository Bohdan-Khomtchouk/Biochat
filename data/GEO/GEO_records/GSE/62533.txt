TITLE
Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins as promising therapeutic targets in chronic lymphocytic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are expressed at high levels in CLL cells and may contribute to evasion of cell death leading to poor therapeutic outcome. Of note, prognostic unfavourable cases with e.g. non-mutated VH-status and TP53 mutation responded significantly better to BV6 than samples with unknown or favourable prognosis e.g. 13q deletion. The majority of cases with 17p deletion (10/12) and Fludarabine refractory cases were sensitive to BV6, indicating that BV6 acts independently of the p53 pathway. Importantly, BV6 dose-dependently induced cell death in 28 of 51 (54%) investigated patient samples while B cells from healthy donors were largely unaffected. BV6 also triggered cell death under survival conditions mimicking the microenvironment e.g. by adding CD40 ligand or in conditioned medium. Gene expression profiling identified cell death- and NF-kB-signaling among the top pathways regulated by BV6. This was confirmed by data showing that BV6 causes degradation of cIAP1 and cIAP2 and NF-kB pathway activation. BV6 induced cell death depended on production of reactive oxygen species, since addition of ROS scavengers significantly rescued BV6-triggerd cell death. In contrast, BV6 induced cell death independently of caspase activity, RIP1 activity or TNF-alpha, since zVAD.fmk, necrostatin-1 or TNF-alpha-blocking antibody Enbrel failed to protect against cell death. Of note, transcripts of ROS regulatory proteins were modulated by BV6. Thus, these data have important implications for developing new therapeutic strategies to overcome cell death resistance in CLL especially in poor prognostic subgroups.

DESIGN
Gene expression was profiled in 12 CLL samples [n=3 CLL cases for 4 hours and 20 hours with either DMSO or BV6].
