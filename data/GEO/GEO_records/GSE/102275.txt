TITLE
PCAN_TRAUMATEST

ORGANISM
Pinus canariensis

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis in response to mechanical injuries in Pinus canariensis, known for a great healing ability. Traumatic xylem formed in the margins of the wounds were compared to control tissues, sampled from remote parts of the plant, in order to check transcriptomical variations in three dates during the response: H1, H2 and H3 for 7, 78 and 92 days after wounding.

DESIGN
Two-color experiment comparing gene expression in response to wounding to regular growth, at three times during the healing process. Three biological replicates for each sampling date.
