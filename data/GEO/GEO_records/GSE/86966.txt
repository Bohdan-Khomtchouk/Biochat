TITLE
Concentration dependent binding states of the Bicoid Homeodomain Protein

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We have measured by ChIP-seq the distribution of Bicoid protein in Wild Type embryos, and in embryos in which the sole source of Bicoid is expressed at single concentrations representative of individual positions along the morphogen gradient. In addition, we have measured chromatin accessibility and nucleosome positioning by ATAC seq in Wild Type, bicoid mutant, uniform bicoid, and zelda mutant embryos.

DESIGN
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation in Drosophila melanogaster embryos of GFP-tagged Bicoid with 1) wild-type (graded) protein distribution; 2) at three different uniform levels of expression; and 3) wild-type (graded) protein distribution lacking posterior and terminal patterning cues (nos and tsl). ATAC-seq of single embryos staged at 12 minutes into nuclear cycle 14 in seven genotypes: wild-type, bcd[E1], zelda[294], bcd[E1] nos[L7] tsl[4], and three transgenic lines expressing uniform bicoid.

PLATFORM
