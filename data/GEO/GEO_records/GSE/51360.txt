TITLE
A genetic and functional investigation of the Zn2Cys6 transcription factors RSE2 and RSE3 in Podospora anserina

ORGANISM
Podospora anserina

SUMMARY
Abstract    In Podospora anserina, the two zinc cluster proteins RSE2 and RSE3 are essential for the expression of the gene encoding the alternative oxidase (aox) when the mitochondrial electron transport chain is impaired. In parallel they activated the expression of gluconeogenic genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pck) and fructose-1,6-biphosphatase (fbp). Orthologues of these transcription factors are present in a wide range of filamentous fungi and no other role than the regulation of these three genes has been evidenced so far. In order to better understand the function and the organisation of RSE2 and RSE3, we conducted a saturated genetic screen based on the constitutive expression of the aox gene. We identified 10 independent mutations in 9 positions in rse2 and 11 in 5 positions in rse3. Deletions were generated at some of these positions and the effects analyzed. This analysis suggests the presence of central regulatory domains and a C-ter activation domain in both proteins. Microarray analysis revealed 598 genes that were differentially expressed in the strains containing gain- or loss-of-function mutations in rse2 or rse3.  It showed that in addition of aox, fbp and pck, RSE2 and RSE3 regulate the expression of genes encoding the alternative NADH dehydrogenase, a Zn2Cys6 transcription factor, a flavohemoglobin and various hydrolases. As a complement to expression data, a metabolome profiling approach revealed that both an rse2 gain-of-function mutation and growth on antimycin result in similar metabolic alterations in amino acids, fatty acids and α-ketoglutarate pools.
