TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed genes in fetal and postnatal pig skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Fetal myogenesis and postnatal skeletal muscle hypertrophy in growing pigs are critical yet poorly understood processes.  Global gene expression analyses will increase understanding of these processes by identifying key genes and pathways controlling skeletal muscle development.  For this study, a pig 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray was used to identify differentially expressed genes in hind limb skeletal muscle of pigs at 60 days of gestation and 7 weeks of age.  This oligonucleotide microarray experiment revealed 162 genes that were differentially expressed between 60 day fetal and 7 week postnatal samples.  Relative real-time RT-PCR was used to confirm differential expression of three genes.  This experiment identified genes exhibiting different developmental patterns of gene expression in pig skeletal muscle. Keywords: developmental study
