TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed genes in fetal and postnatal pig skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Fetal myogenesis and postnatal skeletal muscle hypertrophy in growing pigs are critical yet poorly understood processes.  Global gene expression analyses will increase understanding of these processes by identifying key genes and pathways controlling skeletal muscle development.  For this study, a pig 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray was used to identify differentially expressed genes in hind limb skeletal muscle of pigs at 60 days of gestation and 7 weeks of age.  This oligonucleotide microarray experiment revealed 162 genes that were differentially expressed between 60 day fetal and 7 week postnatal samples.  Relative real-time RT-PCR was used to confirm differential expression of three genes.  This experiment identified genes exhibiting different developmental patterns of gene expression in pig skeletal muscle. Keywords: developmental study

DESIGN
Oligonucleotide microarrays used for this study consisted of 13,297 70-mer oligos (Pig Array-Ready Oligo Set v. 1.0 and Pig Oligo Extension Set v. 1.0, Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) each spotted once on a single slide .  Controls included 76 Arabidopsis thaliana gene spots, 17 beta tubulin spots, 17 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase spots, 85 heat shock protein gene spots, 69 ribosomal protein gene spots, 112 randomly generated negative control spots and 470 blanks.  The oligonucleotide microarray was screened with samples obtained from pigs at 60 days of gestation and 7 weeks of age postnatal (n = 3 per age).  Six oligonucleotide microarray slides were screened.  All samples were used twice, labeled once with Cy3 and once with Cy5, and each 60 day gestation sample was randomly paired with two different 7 week postnatal samples.
