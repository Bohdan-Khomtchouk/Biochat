TITLE
Comparison of human Rheumatoid arthritis patient peripheral whole blood mRNAs just before and after Leukocytapheresis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Leukocytapheresis((LCAP) is a safe, unique therapy prevalent for intractable rheumatoid arthritis even in case of drug allergy or infectious state. To investigate how to improve LCAP efficacy, we have conducted genes expressions analysis from peripheral blood of Rheumatoid arthritis patients using high resolution DNA microarray just before and after LCAP procedure.

DESIGN
8 Rheurmatoid arthritis patients have been compared just before and after Leukocytapheresis treatment (overall 16 samples). The Pre-LCAP samples were labeled using Cy5, and the Post-LCAP labeled with Cy3.
