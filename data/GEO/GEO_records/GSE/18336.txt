TITLE
Effect of AAF overexpression on the leaves before bolting

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of leaves from 3-week old transgenic plants overexpressing AAF, which is a senescence-associated gene. Overexpression of AAF promoted leaf senescence and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in transgenic plants. Results provide insight in the role of AAF in ROS homeostasis and the function in leaf senescence.

DESIGN
3-week-old plants of Col-0 (wild type, as control) and AAF-OX (overexpression line) were grown in long day condition (16hr light/8hr dark). Rosette leaves of Col-0 and AAF-OX were used for total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. cDNA labeling, array hybridization, and scanning followed standard Affymetrix expression array protocol. Two independent sets of microarray analyses were performed in this study.
