TITLE
Disruption of sorting nexin 5 causes respiratory failure associated with undifferentiated alveolar epithelial type I cells in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Deletion of Snx5 leads to respiratory failure in neonatal mice. Here we analyzed the effect of depleted SNX5 in a lung. We used expression microarray to compare between  wild lungs and mutant lungs at E18.5 and  E18.5 after air-breathing test.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from embryonic 18.5 day (E18.5) wild and mutant mice lung. Also other total RNA samples were extracted after air-breathing test at E18.5.

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
