TITLE
Epigenome analysis of control and KLF4-overexpressing podocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of control (vector-transfected) and KLF4-overexpressing human podocytes (parental cell line: Saleem et al. JASN 13:630, 2002). The Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA samples from control (vector-transfected, n=1) and KLF4-overexpressing human podocytes (n=1) were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip and DNA methylation was compared.
