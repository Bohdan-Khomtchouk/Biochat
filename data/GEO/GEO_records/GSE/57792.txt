TITLE
Gene expression profiling of zebrafish embryos at 5 days post fertilization

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We use the zebrafish embryo model to study the innate immune response against Mycobacterium marinum. Therefore, we injected M. marinum  into the yolk at the 64 cell stage and took samples at 5 days post injection.

DESIGN
This deep sequence study was designed to determine the gene expression profile by  Mycobacterium marinum  infection. RNA was isolated from embryos at 5 days post injection. Wildtypes zebrafish embryos were micro-injected into the yolk (64 cell stage) with 40 CFU of Mycobacterium marinum E11 mCherry bacteria suspended in PVP (Polyvinylpyrrolidone), or Non-injected as a control. After injections embryos were transferred into fresh egg water and incubated at 28Â°C. At 5 days post injection 50 embryos per group were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent.
