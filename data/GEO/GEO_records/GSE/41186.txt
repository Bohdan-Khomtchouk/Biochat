TITLE
Chip-chip from Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12, WT and ∆fnr strains

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 ; Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655star

SUMMARY
Mapping the occupancy of FNR, HNS, and IHF throughout the genome of Escherchia coli MG1655 K-12 using an affinity purified antibody under anerobic growth conditions. We also mapped the binding of the ß subunit of RNA Polymerase under both aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions. As a control, we also performed ChIP-chip on FNR in a ∆fnr mutant strain of Escherchia coli MG1655 K-12.  We also examined FNR immunoprecipitation at various FNR concentrations using IPTG and Ptac::fnr (PK8263). The ∆hns/∆stpA strains were also used. Descirbed in the manuscript Genome-scale Analysis of E. coli FNR Reveals the Complexity of Bacterial Regulon Structure

DESIGN
Mapping of occupancy of FNR, NNS, IHF and ß of RNAP in the genome of Escherchia coli MG1655 K-12 under aerobic or anaerobic growth conditions. Immunoprecipitated DNA compared to INPUT for each sample.
