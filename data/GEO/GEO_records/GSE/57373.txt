TITLE
Taurine transporter (SLC6A6)-deficient skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscle from taurine transporter (TauT) knockout mice at 3 or 18 months of age. Knocking out TauT result in a decrease in muscle cell size, impaired exercise capacity and accelerated muscle aging.  Results provide molecular insights into physiological role of taurine.
