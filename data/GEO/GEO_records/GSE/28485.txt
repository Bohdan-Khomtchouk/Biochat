TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the zebrafish embryonic host response to Edwardsiella tarda infection [experiment B]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of the zebrafish embryonic host response to infection by injection of 200 CFUs of Edwardsiella tarda (strain FL6-60)

DESIGN
All infection experiments were performed using mixed egg clutches of Albino strain zebrafish. Embryos were staged at 28 hours post fertilization (hpf) by morphological criteria and approximately 200 cfu of mCherry expressing E. tarda bacteria were injected into the caudal vein close to the urogenital opening. As a control an equal volume of PBS was likewise injected. Single embryos of the infected and control group were collected 8 hours post infection (hpi).

PLATFORM
