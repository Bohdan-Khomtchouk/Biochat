TITLE
Gene microarray data for HT-29 monolayer and spheroids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Colorectal cancers have a rare population of cells that express specific cell surface markers, and are referred to as cancer stem cells (CSC). Targeting CSCs, implicated in tumor relapse, is a paradigm shifting approach for colorectal cancer. We used gene microarray to analyze gene expression in HT-29, a colon cancer cell line, grown as monolayer and spheroid and identify metabolic pathways that are upregulated.

DESIGN
HT-29 monolayer cells were grown in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% FBS, and 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic liquid (AA); and spheroids were grown in stem cell media [DMEM:F12, 1X AA, 1X B27, epidermal growth factors, and fibroblast growth factor for five days. Total RNA was isolated using the mirVanaâ„¢ miRNA Isolation Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA intergrity was confirmed on the Nanodrop ND-1000 and analyzed with Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. The arrays were scanned with the Affymetrix 3000 7G plus scanner.
