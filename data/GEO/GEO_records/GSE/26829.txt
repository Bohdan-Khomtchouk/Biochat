TITLE
Measurements of mRNA abundance and decay for two strains 211 (wt) and 212 (mutant)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
For each strain two time courses for mRNA abundance: Oxidative and MMS and two time courses for decay: reference decay and following oxidative stress

DESIGN
We used Affymetrix microarrays to quantify changes in mRNA abundance following oxidative stress and DNA damage stress and also decay following transcription inhibition with and without oxidative stress. Each of the experiments were done for both strains 211 (wt) and 212 (mutant)
