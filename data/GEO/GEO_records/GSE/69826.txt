TITLE
The E3 SUMO ligase Mms21 controls ribosome biogenesis

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The budding yeast E3 SUMO ligase Mms21, a component of the Smc5-6 complex, regulates sister chromatid cohesion, DNA replication, and DNA repair. We identify a role for Mms21 in ribosome biogenesis. The mms21RINGD mutant exhibits reduced rRNA production, nuclear accumulation of 60S and 40S ribosomal proteins, and elevated Gcn4 translation. Genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and translation are down-regulated in the mms21RINGD mutant.

DESIGN
Examining gene expression profile of mms21RINGD mutant compared to wild-type by RNA Seq using Ilumina sequencing
