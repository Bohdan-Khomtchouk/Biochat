TITLE
Gata6 induced XEN-like cells w/o Sox7

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the role of Sox7 in primitive endoderm differentiation, we compare the gene expression pattern of Sox7 (+/-) and Sox7 (-/-) ES cells with or without dexamethasome (Dex) treatment. Because these ES cells harbour Gata6-GR transgene, Dex treatment forces ES cells differentate into XEN-like cells. As Sox7 (-/-) ES cells can differentiate into XEN-like cell by morphology,  we assessed genome wide gene expression pattern.

DESIGN
Sox7 (+/-) ES cells and Sox7 (-/-) ES cells are forced to differentiate into XEN-like cells by Gata6-GR transgene. To compare the gene expression, we collected RNA samples at day4 with or without dexamethasone treatment from each genotype.
