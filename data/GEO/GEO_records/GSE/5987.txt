TITLE
Mouse model of Endometrioid Ovarian Adenocarcinomas by conditional inactivation of PTEN and APC genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fifty million plaque-forming units of AdCre was injected into the right ovarian bursal cavity of 56- 70 day old female mice.  Mice were euthanized 63 days later to obtain ovary tumors and normal ovary tissue.  Seven individual ovarian tumors and 4 individual normal ovary samples were each assayed on an Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array. Keywords: Tumor vs normal comparisons
