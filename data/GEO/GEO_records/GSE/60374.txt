TITLE
Polysome purified mRNA in control and RACK1 silenced in human hepatocarcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fighting viral infections is hampered by the scarcity of viral targets and their variability resulting in development of resistance. Viruses depend on cellular molecules for their life cycle, which are attractive alternative targets, provided that they are dispensable for normal cell functions. Using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, we identify the ribosomal protein RACK1 as a cellular factor required for infection by internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-containing viruses. We further show that RACK1 is an essential determinant for hepatitis C virus translation and infection indicating that its function is conserved among distantly related human and fly viruses. Inhibition of RACK1 does not affect Drosophila or human cell viability and proliferation, and RACK1-silenced adult flies are viable, indicating that this protein is not essential for general translation. Our findings demonstrate a specific function for RACK1 in selective mRNA translation and uncover a new target for the development of broad antiviral intervention.
