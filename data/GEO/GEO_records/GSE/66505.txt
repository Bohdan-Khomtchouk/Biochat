TITLE
DNA Methylation Sequencing of Prostate Tumors Reveals Possible Molecular Mechanisms for Cancer Aggressiveness

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A major challenge in the clinical management of prostate cancer is the inability to definitively diagnose indolent versus aggressive cases. Contributing to this challenge is a lack of basic science understanding of the molecular basis behind aggressiveness subtypes in prostate cancer. DNA methylation is the epigenetic addition of a methyl group to the DNA base cytosine and has been found to regulate cell proliferation and environmental adaptation. We hypothesized that DNA methylation changes are a mechanism by which an aggressive cancer attains phenotypes that distinguish it from indolent cases via disruption of regulatory networks. This hypothesis was tested by comparing DNA methylation between benign prostate and both low grade (Gleason score 6) and high grade (Gleason score 8 to 10) groups. Methylome-wide next generation sequencing was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples from radical prostatectomy cases using MBD-isolated genome sequencing (MiGS). This technique uses a DNA methylation binding protein (MBD) to purify fragments from a genomic library with a high level of CpG DNA methylation. These fragments were then sequenced via next generation sequencing, the reads were aligned to a reference genome, and then the reads were counted within non-overlapping 50bp windows genome wide. Statistical analysis was then performed on these windowed counts to produce differentially methylated regions (DMRs).

DESIGN
MBD-isolated Genome Sequencing (MiGS) for groups of benign prostate (from cystoprostatectomy), low grade prostate cancer (from radical prostatectomy with Gleason Score 6), and high grade prostate cancer (from radical prostatectomy with Gleason Scores 8 to 10) in both European Americans and African Americans
