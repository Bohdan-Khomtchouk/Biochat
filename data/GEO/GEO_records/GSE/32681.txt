TITLE
Alterations in gene expression in lacrimal and salivary glands of male NOD mice  due to LTBR-Ig treatment relative to control antibody

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NOD mice were injected once a week with LTBR-Ig to block the LTBR-pathway, or with control monoclonal antibody MOPC from age 8 to 16 weeks old.  Extraorbital  lacrimal glands or submaxillary glands were dissected and total mRNA prepared.    Each sample was either the combined lacrimals (2) from each mouse or individual  salivary glands.  There were 4 mice in each treatment group. Total mRNA was isolated  and the quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,  Palo Alto, CA).  Reverse transcription to prepare cDNA was performed using Invitrogen  M-MLV system. The purpose was to determine changes in gene expression in glands  due to blockade of the LTBR-pathway.
