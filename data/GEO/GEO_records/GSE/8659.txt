TITLE
Whole genome microarray analysis of C. elegans rrf-3 and eri-1 mutants

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
RRF-3 and ERI-1 are first identified proteins required for accumulation of at least some endogenous secondary siRNAs in C.elegans. Genome wide gene expression analysis was performed on L4 stage rrf-3 and eri-1 mutant C. elegans to study effects caused by loss of these proteins. Mutant rrf-3 and eri-1 strains exhibited similar expression patterns when compared to N2 wild type, while 72 transcripts were found to be co-overexpressed and 4 transcripts co-underexpressed ( > 2-fold, p < 0.05). Ontology analysis indicated many of the gene products were associated with protein phosphorylation and sperm function. These results provide additional support for the hypothesis that RRF-3 and ERI-1 act together in a siRNA pathway and may indicate biological processes that are related to endo-siRNAs.
