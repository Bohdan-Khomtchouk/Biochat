TITLE
Expression data for PAR-1-positive and -negative melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PAR-1 is known to be involved in the transition from non-metastatic to metastatic melanoma. We sought to determine the downstream target genes regulated by PAR-1 to determine how PAR-1 is contributing to the metastatic melanoma phenotype.

DESIGN
The A375SM metastatic melanoma cell line was subjected to stable transduction of lentiviral-delivered small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting PAR-1. As a control, a non-targeting shRNA sequence (no homology to any human gene) was also transduced into A375SM cells.
