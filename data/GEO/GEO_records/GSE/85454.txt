TITLE
Molecular Changes in the Nasal Cavity after 5 days of N, N-dimethyl-p-toluidine Exposure

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To identify nasal cavity transcripts differentially expressed due to treatment with N, N-dimethyl-p-toluidine (DMPT), we collected RNA during the from male F344/N rats exposed to 120 mg/kg DMPT, 5 days after DMPT exposure for animals 5-6 weeks of age.  These samples were interrogated with the Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 GeneChip Array. A total of 2,561 gene transcripts were differentially expressed due to DMPT treatment (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05).

DESIGN
There were 2 groups and 5x replication for each group, for 10 total samples. The groups were (1) DMPT and (2) vehicle control. We compared vehicle control vs DMPT using ORIOGEN software. The permutation based p-values for each test were significant for FDRâ‰¤5%.
