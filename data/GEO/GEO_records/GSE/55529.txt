TITLE
EcadEGFP expression in MDA-MB-134 and IPH-926

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment aims to study transcriptional alterations induced by reconstitution of wild type E-cadherin expression in human lobular breast cancer cells harbouring deleterious, somatic CDH-1 mutations

DESIGN
Two cell lines (IPH-926 and MDA-MB-134) expressing synthetic Ecad (EcadEGFP) or not (EGFP) were compared against each other. Analysis were conducted in triplicates (IPH-926) and quadruplicates (MDA-MB-134), respectively.
