TITLE
Undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells, differentiated nestin-positive cells and fibroblast feeder layer.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Embryonic stem (ES) cells and ES cell-derived progeny characterized by nestin expression (including neural progenitors) were studied (three independent experiments). The mouse ES cell line R1 was cultured on a feeder layer of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (FL). ES cells were differentiated into nestin-positive cells for 4+8 days and 4+11 days according to the differentiation protocol by Rolletschek et al. (Mechanisms of Development 105, 93-104, 2001). The study was performed with three independent cell cultures (= triplicates). RNA was prepared from both undifferentiated ES cells and ES cell-derived nestin-positive cells, and from fibroblast feeder cells.
