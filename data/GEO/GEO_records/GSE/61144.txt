TITLE
Expression data from blood samples of STEMI and Same STEMI patients after PIC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aim to determine blood transcriptome-based molecular signature of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and to identify novel serum biomarkers for early stage ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)

DESIGN
We obtained peripheral blood from the patients with ACS who visited emergency department within 4 hours after the onset of chest pain: a set of blood samples of patients with STEMI (n=7) before and 7 days after the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (n=7) and normal control (n=10)
