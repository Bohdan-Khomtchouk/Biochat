TITLE
Gene expression analysis of B16-F1 melanoma tumors established in WT and Stat2KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
STAT2 is an essential transcription factor in type I interferon (IFN) signaling. STAT2 mediates the antigrowth and apoptotic effects of IFN as demonstrated in cell lines thus leading to the hypothesis that STAT2 has tumor suppressor function. We used microarrays to identify genes in the tumors that are STAT2 dependent and important in anti-tumor immunity.

DESIGN
B16-F1 melanoma tumor cells were implanted on the dorsal flank of either wild type (WT) or Stat2KO (S2KO). Tumor growth was monitored during the course of 3 weeks. S2KO mice developed larger tumors when compared to WT mice.
