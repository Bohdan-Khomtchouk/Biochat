TITLE
Mutation of GATA3 in Human Breast Tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
293T epithelial kidney cell line was infected with retrovirus containing pBabe puro empty plasmid or with pBabe puro plasmid containing either GATA3 wild type or mutation R367-L. Stable colonies were selected, grown, and their mRNAs harvested.  mRNA from three independent transfections of 293T cells with the empty plasmid was pooled and used as the reference RNA.  Dye flips were performed resulting in four arrays. This series also contains two additional arrays (GSM13007 & GSM13008) not in the publication. Keywords: other
