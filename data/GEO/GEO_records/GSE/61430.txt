TITLE
pSMAD1/5/8 ChIP-Seq in hair follicle stem cell lineage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP_Seq on purified hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs)and their direct progenty, transit amplifying cells (TACs) using and antibody against pSMAD1/5/8. We report novel common and unique in vivo pSMAD targets for each population.

DESIGN
Examination of pSMAD1/5/8 targets in a stem cell lineage

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
