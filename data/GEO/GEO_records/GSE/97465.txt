TITLE
Characterization of Notch transcription complex sequence paired sites

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Notch transcription complexes (NTCs) drive target gene expression by binding to two distinct types of genomic response elements, NTC monomer-binding sites and sequence-paired sites (SPSs) that bind NTC dimers. SPSs are conserved and are linked to the Notch-responsiveness of a few genes, but their overall contribution to Notch-dependent gene regulation is unknown. To address this issue, we determined the DNA sequence requirements for NTC dimerization using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, and applied insights from these in vitro studies to Notch-“addicted” leukemia cells. We find that SPSs contribute to the regulation of approximately a third of direct Notch target genes. While originally described in promoters, SPSs are present mainly in long-range enhancers. Our work provides a general method for identifying sequence-paired sites in genome-wide data sets and highlights the widespread role of NTC dimerization in Notch-transformed leukemia cells.

DESIGN
All samples were run in triplicate and all samples were treated either with DMSO or a gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI).  The samples were T6E cells transfected with the empty MigR1 vector, a dominant negative MAML (DNMAML), intracellular Notch 1 (ICN1), or a dimerization defective intracellular Notch 1(R1984A).
