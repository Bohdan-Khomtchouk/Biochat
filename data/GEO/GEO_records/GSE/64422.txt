TITLE
Identification of miRNome of cancer stem cells in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Accumulating evidence suggests that cancer cells possess characters reminiscent of those of normal counterparts. Unveiling small RNAs responsible for cell stemness, diseases progression and progress will eventually lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

DESIGN
Expression profiles of FadU cells and its cancer spheres expanded under stem cell medium cultivation were generated for identifying key miRNAs.

PLATFORM
