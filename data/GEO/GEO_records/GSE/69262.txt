TITLE
Transcriptional profile of C. elegans following RNAi of elt-2 [L4 stage]

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq to identify 292 genes that are differentially-regulated following elt-2 RNAi

DESIGN
Whole-worm mRNA was sequenced from elt-2 RNAi- and control-fed worms.  Biological triplicates were assay for each condition

PLATFORM
GPL13657 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Caenorhabditis elegans)
