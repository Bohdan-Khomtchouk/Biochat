TITLE
Gene Level Expression Profiling: Activity dependent genes in the olfactory epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene level analysis of RNA samples from mice olfactory epithelium Gene expression profiling in the olfactory epithelium was performed to obtain a better understanding of the processes mediating activity dependent gene regulation

DESIGN
We analyzed total RNA from olfactory epithelium tissue from 3 mice at 5 days following unilateral naris occlusion (NO) using the Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array, comparing unilateral and ipsilateral epithelia.
