TITLE
Gene expression in experimental aortic coarctation and repair: candidate genes for therapeutic intervention?

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
The objective of the current investigation was to use microarray techniques to quantify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the upstream aorta subjected to high arterial BP after surgical induction of CoA, and restoration of normal arterial BP after its correction. DEGs may offer additional insight into potential mechanisms of persistent CV morbidity despite successful surgical repair.

DESIGN
Male New Zealand white rabbits ~10 weeks old and weighing ~1.0 kg randomly underwent proximal dAo CoA. A 20 mmHg BP gradient was imposed using silk (permanent) or Vicryl (degradable) suture to mimic untreated CoA and surgically corrected CoA, respectively. Rabbits develop a pronounced stenosis and accompanying elevated BP as a stimulus for arterial remodeling within one week. Degradation of Vicryl suture in the corrected group restores aortic diameter close to normal, but with modest residual narrowing. Non-experimental rabbits were designated as a control group. This results in a statistically significant increase in mean, systolic and pulse BP proximal to the coarctation for CoA as compared to both control and corrected rabbits. A ~4 mm circumferential region from the proximal aorta between the coarctation site and left subclavian artery was excised at harvest (32 weeks of age) and frozen. Frozen samples (n=4/group) were shipped overnight to Arraystar, Inc (Rockville, MD) for microarray analysis.
