TITLE
Deregulation of the Ras-Erk Signaling Axis Modulates the Enhancer Landscape [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Unrestrained receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling and epigenetic deregulation are root causes of tumorigenesis. We establish linkage between these processes by demonstrating that aberrant RTK signaling unleashed by oncogenic HRasG12V or loss of negative feedback through Sprouty gene deletion remodels histone modifications associated with active typical and super-enhancers. However, while both lesions disrupt the Ras-Erk axis, the expression programs, enhancer signatures, and transcription factor networks modulated upon HRasG12V-transformation or Sprouty deletion are largely distinct. Oncogenic HRasG12V elevates histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) levels at enhancers near the transcription factor Gata4 and the kinase Prkcb, as well as their expression levels. We show that Gata4 is necessary for the aberrant gene expression and H3K27ac marking at enhancers, and Prkcb is required for the oncogenic effects of HRasG12V-driven cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that dynamic reprogramming of the cellular enhancer landscape is a major effect of oncogenic RTK signaling.

DESIGN
We assessed gene expression changes upon loss of feedback regulation through Sprouty (Spry) deletion, and upon unrestrained signaling driven by mutant oncogenes. RNA-seq was performed in biological triplicate; replicate number is included in the sample name. Spry124fl/fl (VEC) and Spry124-/- (CRE) MEFs were profiled in three conditions: unsynchronized (U), serum starved (S), and serum starved and FGF treated (F). Spry124fl/fl (VEC) MEFs transduced with empty vector (EV) control or the indicated oncogenes (KRasG12V, HRasG12V, and BRafV600E) as well as Spry124-/- (CRE) MEFs transduced with EV control were profiled in the unsynchronized state.
