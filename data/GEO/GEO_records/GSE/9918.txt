TITLE
temporal profiling of retinal transcriptome regulation after IONT and IONC

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
retinal ganglion cells die after optic nerve injury, either crush or transection. The molecular causesunderlying this degeneration are largely unkwon the purpose of this job is to find which  (if any) gene regulation triggers RGC death with the final goal of design neuroprotective protocols Keywords: time course
