TITLE
temporal profiling of retinal transcriptome regulation after IONT and IONC

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
retinal ganglion cells die after optic nerve injury, either crush or transection. The molecular causesunderlying this degeneration are largely unkwon the purpose of this job is to find which  (if any) gene regulation triggers RGC death with the final goal of design neuroprotective protocols Keywords: time course

DESIGN
3 groups: naive, IONT (intraorbital nerve transection) IONC (intraorbital nerve crush). IONT and IONC lesioned animals were kept the appropriate times postlesion (12h,. 24h, 48h, 3d, 7d, and 15d). For each time point 8-12 animals were used. RNA from 4 animals was pooled and extracted to hybridaze 1 array replica.  All replicas were pooled biological replicas: 5 for naive RNA (each replica 4 retinas, therefore  5 independent RNA extractions were done with a total of 20 retinas), IONT: 12h 3 replicas, 24h 2 replicas, 48h 3replicas, 3d 2 replicas, 7d 3 replicas, 15d 2 replicas. IONC: 3 replicas per time point: 12h, 24h, 48h, 3d and 7d)
