TITLE
Genome-wide localization of Gcn5 under normal and stress conditions in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Here we studied genome-wide localization  of Gcn5  under normal and KCl stress conditions in both yeast species. We found that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the enrichment of Gcn5 on genes changes from a relatively even distribution between coding region and intergenic region in the absence of stress, to a predominant localization in gene coding regions under stress conditions. This altered pattern changes are at global level indicates an important role of Gcn5 in modifying chromatin structure for stress adaptation in S. cerevisiae. The altered pattern changes are not observed in Saccharomyces pombe suggesting the different regulatory mechinery between two yeast speices. The related data series is GSE5218, where we have compared the gene regulation of Gcn5 at expression level in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe.
