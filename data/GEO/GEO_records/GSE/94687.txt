TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of FoxO3 or Geminin/FoxO3 depletion on MDA-MB-231 cells Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated 2 Gb of high-quality sequencing data (~1 Gb per sample) and catalogued the expression profiles of 48,162 annotated human genes in each sample. The analysis showed differences of transcriptomes between Control and Geminin/FoxO3 co-depletion expression changes. We identified numerous differentially expressed genes that exhibited distinct expression patterns. These genes are appealing candidates for further investigation of the gene expression and associated regulatory mechanisms by Geminin and FoxO3 .

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 mRNA profiles of Control, FoxO3 and Geminin/FoxO3 co-depletion were generated by deep sequencing,  using Illumina HiSeq4000.
