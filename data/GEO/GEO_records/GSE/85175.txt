TITLE
A general transcription co-factor, Smad3, potentiates master transcription factor mediated cell identity conversions [ATAC-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have identified that expression of constitutive active Smad3 (Smad3CA) significantly enhanced reprogramming by Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc. To investigate how Smad3CA expression impacts on chromatin opening, we performed ATAC-seq on day 3 of reprogramming in the presence or absence of Smad3CA expression.

DESIGN
ATAC-seq on day 3 of reprogramming in the presence or absence of Smad3CA expression.

PLATFORM
