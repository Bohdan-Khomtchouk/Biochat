TITLE
Washington Human Monocyte Macrophage Profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to study the gene expression profiles of monocyte and macrophages, we collected three type of cells and performed pair-wised comparison. It includes human peripheral blood monocyte (MONO), human peripheral blood monocyte derived macrophages treated with M-CSF (MACRO)and primary alveolar macrophages (BAL). All the experiments are performed comparing two of the three cell types from the same person (total 4 persons). Totally we got three set of microarray data, MONO/MACRO, MONO/BAL and MACRO/BAL with 4 biological replicates. Keywords: cell_type_comparison_design
