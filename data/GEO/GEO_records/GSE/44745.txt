TITLE
Identification of copy number variations by array comparative genomic hybridization in multi-ethnic multiple myeloma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to identify copy number variations in multiple myeloma patients from the 3 major ethnic groups (Malays, Chinese and Indians) in Malaysia. Identification of common chromosomal aberrations and their degree of penetrance is possible by comparing the microarray data across all the samples under studied.

DESIGN
63 multiple myeloma samples were analyzed. Each sample was compared against normal control (match with patient's race and gender), which was pooled from ten healthy individuals.
