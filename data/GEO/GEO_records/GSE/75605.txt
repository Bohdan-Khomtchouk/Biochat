TITLE
Gene expression data in obinuzumab treated Karpas-1106P PMBL cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary Mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) representing 2% of mature B-cell NHL in patients less than 18 years of age.We compared the gene expression profiling between fully humanized anti-CD20 targeted monoclonal antibody recognizing a unique CD20 type II epitope, obinutuzumab and IgG or PBS treated Karpas Primary Mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) cell line. -

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from PBS, IgG and obinutuzumab treated Karpas PMBL cells and perforemd using Illumina Human HT-12 v4 array.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
