TITLE
Transcriptome response to the deletion of Gcr1, Nup84 or Nup84 & Gcr1 (double deletion)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
This experiment compares the transcriptional response of yeast cells to the deletion of Gcr1, Nup84, or both, to isogenic wild type strains grown in YPD at 23C.  The goal was to identify misregulated target genes and analyze the functional classifications of those targets. Keywords: cell type comparison (knock-outs)

DESIGN
This experiment included biological replicates as well as technical dye-swap replicates of each biological sample.

PLATFORM
GPL2883 Agilent-013384 Yeast Oligo Microarray (V2) G4140B (Feature Number version)
