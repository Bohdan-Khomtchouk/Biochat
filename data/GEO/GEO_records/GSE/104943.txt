TITLE
Molecular profiling of prelimbic projections to NAc, BLA, and VTA using vTRAP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Translational profiling of prelimbic cortical projections to nucleus accumbens, basolateral amygdala, and ventral tegmental area was performed. Studies were performed using AAV5-IV-GFPL10 (in prelimbic cortex) in tandem with CAV2-Cre (in the projection target), which enables rapid, projection-specific translational profiling.

DESIGN
Polysome-bound mRNA in each of the projections was immunoprecipitated (IP) and compared to the total (Input) RNA in the surrounding prelimbic cortex.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
