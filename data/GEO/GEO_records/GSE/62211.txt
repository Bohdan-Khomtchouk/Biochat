TITLE
Mapping genome-wide binding sites of Kruppel-like factor-9 by ChIP-seq in human glioblastoma stem cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kruppel-like factor-9 (KLF9), a member of the large KLF transcription factor family, has emerged as a regulator of oncogenesis, cell differentiation and neural development; however, the molecular basis for KLF9â€™s diverse contextual functions remains unclear. This study focuses on the functions of KLF9 in human glioblastoma stem-like cells. We establish for the first time a genome-wide map of KLF9-regulated targets in human glioblastoma stem-like cells, and show that KLF9 functions as a transcriptional repressor and thereby regulates multiple signaling pathways involved in oncogenesis and stem cell regulation. A detailed analysis of one such pathway, integrin signaling, shows that the capacity of KLF9 to inhibit glioblastoma cell stemness and tumorigenicity requires ITGA6 repression. These findings enhance our understanding of the transcriptional networks underlying cancer cell stemness and differentiation, and identify KLF9-regulated molecular targets applicable to cancer therapeutics.

DESIGN
Two cell lines were used as biological replicates. Each cell line have one KLF9 ChIP-enriched DNA sample and one input genomic DNA sample.
