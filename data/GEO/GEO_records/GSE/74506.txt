TITLE
SynapTRAP on SNAP25 TRAP Cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SynapTRAP. Identification of Synaptic mRNA of neurons of the cortex. Technique combines sucrose percoll fractionation of a synaptically rich sample (SN) and TRAP tagged ribosome IP (PreIP and PostIP). This experiment uses pan neuronal SNAP25 mice and a cortical dissection.

DESIGN
Three replicates of four samples.
