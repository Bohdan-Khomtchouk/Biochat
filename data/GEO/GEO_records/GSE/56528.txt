TITLE
Whole C57BL/6 mouse esophagus: embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) vs. postnatal day 2 (P2)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was performed using the total RNA isolated from pooled esophagi (plural of esophagus) of embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) C57BL/6 mouse embryos and total RNA isolated from pooled esophagi of postnatal day 2 (P2) C57BL/6 pups. The goal was to identify differentially regulated genes in these two separate developmental stages.

DESIGN
Single replicate two-color experiment.
