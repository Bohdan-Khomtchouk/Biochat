TITLE
MicroRNA-dependent regulation of transcription in lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective is to establish robust transcriptional regulation differences between squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC) by studying miRNA and concurrent transcriptional profiles. This series represents the miRNA profiles only (not mRNA). The related mRNA data is in Series GSE42998.

DESIGN
The present study was performed in 44 tumour samples following surgical resection for clinical early stage NSCLC (20 lung adenocarcinoma and 24 squamous cell lung cancer). Mature human miRNA expression was detected and quantified using the TaqMan® Low Density Arrays (TLDA). The Human MicroRNA Card Set v2.0 array is a two card set containing a total of 384 TaqMan® MicroRNA Assays per card to enable accurate quantification of 667 human microRNAs, all catalogued in the miRBase database.Expression of target miRNAs was normalized in relation to the expression of RNU48.  Cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated using the SDS software v.2.3 using automatic baseline settings and a threshold of 0.2. Relative quantification of miRNA expression was calculated by the 2−ΔCt method (Applied Biosystems user bulletin no. 2 (P/N 4303859)).
