TITLE
Gene expression regulated by Transparent Testa16 in Brassica napus

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
To broadly identify genes regulated by Transparent Testa16 in Brassica napus

DESIGN
In order to broadly identify genes regulated by BnTT16s, microarray technology was employed to compare gene expression levels in developing seeds (2-DAP) of Bntt16 RNAi and wild-type plants.
