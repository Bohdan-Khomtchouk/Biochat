TITLE
miRNA Expression Profiles in Human AML Samples And in Human and Mouse Blood Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiles of a human cohort of 67 cytogenetically normal AML samples, including both TET2 wildtype and TET2 mutants, and human and mouse cell lines comaring control with TET2 overexpression or TET2 knockdown

DESIGN
We profiled the 67 human AML samples together with one biological replicate. Each cell line was grown and treated at the same conditions and triplicacte samples were profiled.
