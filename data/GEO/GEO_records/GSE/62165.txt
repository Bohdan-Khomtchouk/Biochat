TITLE
Prognostic relevance of molecular subtypes and master regulators in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate the prognostic relevance of molecular subtypes and key transcription factors in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we performed gene expression analysis of whole-tumor tissue obtained from 118 surgically resected PDAC and 13 control samples.

DESIGN
Genome wide expression profiling on 118 PDAC samples and 13 control samples.
