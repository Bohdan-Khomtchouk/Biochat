TITLE
Small non-coding RNA expression in murine germ cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to monitor the changes in small RNAs expression during mouse spermatogenesis. Type A spermatogonia, pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids were isolated following collagenase treatment of testes and trypsin digestion of isolated seminiferous tubules using unit gravity sedimentation in a bovine serum albumin gradient. The small RNA fraction (18-36nt) was cloned and sequenced from total RNA of each cell type.

DESIGN
Three types of mouse germ cells small RNAs were used for high throughput sequencing analysis
