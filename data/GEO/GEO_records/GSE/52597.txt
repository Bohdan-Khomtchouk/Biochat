TITLE
Expression data during plantaris muscle hypertrophy with/without satellite cells induced by synergist ablation in young adult Pax7-DTA mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression patterns were determined from microarray results from sham surgery or following 1 week of plantaris muscle hypertrophy induced by synergist ablation in young adult Pax7-DTA mice (4 months). Vehicle treated mice have their full complement of satellite cells; tamoxifen treated mice have had their satellite cells genetically depleted through Cre-loxP technology

DESIGN
After sham surgery or 1 week of overload, Affymetrix chips (mouse430_2.0) were used with 1 Âµg of total RNA derived from a pooled sample of the right and left plantaris muscles from 11 animals.
