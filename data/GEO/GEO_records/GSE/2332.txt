TITLE
Profiling FACS Sorted Calvarial Osteoblast Cultures: Day 7 (pOBCol3.6GFP) and Day 17 (pOBCol2.3GFP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study compares a comprehensive microarray analysis of unsorted mCOB cultures at two level of cell differentiation with cells that are more homogeneous for a level of cellular differentiation. It demonstrates the loss of information and in some cases misinformation that occurs when a heterogeneous population of cells are used for a microarray study. Keywords: other
