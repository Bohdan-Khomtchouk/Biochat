TITLE
The Chronic Gavage Toxicity/Carcinogenicity Study of Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C) in Harlan Sprague-Dawley Rats (G823524-B), CAS No 700-06-1

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Indole-3-carbinol is used as a dietary supplement and has potential use as a therapeutic agent for the prevention of various types of cancer. While substantial evidence exists that indole-3-carbinol can reduce the risk of cancers induced by several known carcinogens when administered to animals, indole-3-carbinol can also function as an initiator and tumor promoter in certain models. The carcinogenic potential of indole-3-carbinol has not been studied in a 2-year bioassay. The objective of the microarray study was to evaluate the transcriptional changes in liver from rats exposed to 0 or 300 mg/kg indole-3-carbinol. At 3 months, livers were analyzed from female Harlan Sprague Dawley rats in the 2-year gavage study of indole-3-carbinol.

DESIGN
Female rats were administered 300 mg indole-3-carbinol/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage, 5 days per week in a 2 year toxicology study of indole-3-carbinol.   Gene expression studies were performed on rat liver with samples hybridized to whole rat genome RG230_2.0 rat GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix, CA).
