TITLE
Microarray analysis of colon carcinoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate potential differences between strong and weak oscillators at the gene expression level we carried out a transcriptome analysis for each cell line.   Our results indicate that phenotypic circadian clock differences are reflected by gene expression differences both in genes of the core network, but also in additional genes not directly associated with circadian clock functions.

DESIGN
We carried out a gene expression analysis of 6 colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, RKO, SW480, LIM1512 and CaCo2) for each the RNA was collected at two time points (0hr and 48 hr after syncronization). As a reference the osteosarcoma U2OS cell line was used. No treatment was applied.
