TITLE
Gene expression profiling data from sooty mangabeys treated with interferon alpha

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
In contrast to pathogenic HIV and SIV infection of humans and macaques, SIV infection of sooty mangabeys (SMs) is typically non-pathogenic despite high virus replication. A key feature of primary SIV infection of SMs is a strong type I interferon (IFN-I) response, characterized by massive up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), followed by rapid resolution during the acute-to-chronic phase transition and establishment of an immune quiescent state that persists throughout the chronic infection. Based on these observations we hypothesized that low levels of IFN-I signaling may be instrumental in preventing chronic immune activation and disease progression in SIV-infected SMs. We used microarrays to characterize gene expression changes induced by IFNalpha treatment.
