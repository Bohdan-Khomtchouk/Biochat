TITLE
786-O and 786-VHL in EMCV study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
786-0 is a cell line derived from a clear cell renal carcinoma.  Previous studies have shown that the 786-O cell line harbors an inactivating mutation in the von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene.  Mutations  in the VHL gene occur in the majority of sporadic clear cell renal cell.  To determine how inactivation of the VHL affects cellular functions, we created a derivative of 786-0, which we call 786-VHL in which a functional allele of VHL has been introduced back into the 786-O cell line.

DESIGN
The renal cell carcinoma cell line 786-0, which harbors a mutated allele of VHL, was compared to a cell line derived from 786-0, termed 786-VHL, that contains a functional allele of VHL.  Genes whose expression characteristics were dependent on functional VHL were identified.
