TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of sequential tumours from breast cancer patients provides a global view of metastatic expression changes following endocrine therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled primary breast cancer, nodal and liver metastatic tumours from three patients. At the time of initial diagnosis, all three patients presented with luminal breast cancer with adjacent nodal metastasis. They all received 5 years of enodrine therapy and all subsequently developed liver metastasis.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA differences between primary, nodal and metastatic tumour samples.
