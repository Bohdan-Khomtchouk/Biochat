TITLE
PGC-1 alpha isoforms and muscle hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An alternative promoter of the PGC-1alpha gene gives rise to three new PGC-1alpha isoforms refered to as PGC-1a2 (A2), PGC-1a3 (A3) and PGC-1a4 (A4). The proximal PGC-1 alpha promotor transcribes the canonical PGC-1 alpha which is refered to as PGC-1a1 (A1).G1/G2/G3 samples refer to the Green fluorescent protein (GFP) control samples used in this experiment. Forced expression of the PGC-1a4 isoform results in muslce hypertrophy associated with increased IGF-1 signaling and repression of myostatin signaling.

DESIGN
Mouse primary myoblasts isolated from C57BL/6 mice were differentiated in vitro. Fully differentiated myotubes were transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing GFP (as control) or each of the PGC-1alpha isoforms originating from the proximal or alternative promotor.
