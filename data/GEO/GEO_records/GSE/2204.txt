TITLE
Mouse ES cells versus XEN cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of mouse ES cells and three different XEN cell cultures. Three XEN cell cultures: Two different strains (IM8A1 is PO, and XEN1-3 is ICR). And two different culture conditions (IM8A1-I versus IM8A1-II). Three biological replicates of XEN cell RNA were submitted to the Centre for Applied Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada) for preparation of cRNA and hybridization to the mouse U74Av2 Affymetrix gene array. QIAGEN RNeasy midi kit (QIAGEN Inc., Santa Clarita, CA) was used to extract total RNA from all samples according to manufacturer's instructions. The samples were (1) XEN1-3 cells at passage 18 (ICR strain, male) cultured on gelatin with 70% EMFI-CM, (2) IM8A1 cells at passage 27 (PO strain) cultured on gelatin with 70% EMFI-CM, (3) IM8A1 cells at passage 27 cultured on tissue culture plastic in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 20% FBS (CanSera, Rexdale, Canada), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 mg/ml each of penicillin/streptomycin (all from Gibco), 100 uM b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) for 4 days. RNA was also obtained from R1 ES cells grown in the absence of EMFIs in the above medium with LIF. Keywords = ES cells Keywords = XEN cells Keywords: ordered
