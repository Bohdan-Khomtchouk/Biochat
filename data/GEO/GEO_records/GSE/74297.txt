TITLE
MALT1 protease activity controls the expression of inflammatory genes in keratinocytes upon Zymosan stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The protease activity of the paracaspase MALT1 plays an important role in antigen receptor-mediated lymphocyte activation by controlling the activity of the transcription factor NF-kB and is thus essential for the expression of inflammatory target genes. MALT1 is not only present in cells of the hematopoietic lineage, but is ubiquitously expressed. Here we report that Zymosan or S. aureus stimulation induced MALT1 protease activity in human primary keratinocytes.

DESIGN
Human primary keratinocytes were treated for 8 h with solvent control (DMSO), PMA/Ionomycin (P/I) or P/I with MALT1-inhibitor LVSR-fmk. Three biological replicates of each stimualtion were analyzed for gene expression profiles.
