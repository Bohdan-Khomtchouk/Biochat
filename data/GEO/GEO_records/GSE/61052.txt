TITLE
SRSF2 is essential for hematopoiesis and its myelodysplastic syndromes-related mutations dysregulate alternative pre-mRNA splicing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the biological function of Srsf2 in hematopoiesis in conditional knockout mouse models. Ablation of Srsf2 in the hematopoietic lineage caused embryonic lethality, and Srsf2-deficient fetal liver cells showed significantly enhanced apoptosis and decreased hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Induced ablation of Srsf2 in adult Mx1Cre/ Srsf2flox/flox mice upon polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid injection demonstrated a significant decrease in lineage-/Sca+/cKit+ cells in bone marrow. To reveal the functional impact of MDS-associated mutations in SRSF2, we profiled global splicing responses on an MDS-L cell line using RASL-seq, and found that the P95H missense mutation and P95 to R102 in-frame 8 amino-acid deletion caused significant changes in alternative splicing. The affected genes were enriched in cancer development and apoptosis. These findings suggest that intact Srsf2 is essential for the functional integrity of the hematopoietic system, and its mutations are likely key driver events to MDS.

DESIGN
MDS-L cells (in triplicate) were transfected by srsf2 shRNA only, or pTRIPZ vectors containing both srsf2 shRNA and srsf2 mutants cDNA including P95H and P95 8 amino acid deletion as well as wild-type construct, followed by Dox induction. Total RNAs were extracted and been analyzed by RASL-seq.
