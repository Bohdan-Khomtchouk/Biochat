TITLE
Chromosomal changes in primary human uveal melanomas [RPCI]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Uveal melanoma is the most common cancer of the eye arising from melanocytes within the choroid, ciliary bodies and iris.  Almost half of uveal melanomas metastasize hematogenously to distant organs, most often the liver, where the disease becomes fatal.  One of the first genetic alterations to be identified in primary uveal melanomas was monosomy 3, which was found to be strongly associated with metastasis.  We used gene expression profiling to identify two phenotypically distinct classes of uveal melanomas: class 1 tumors with low-grade morphology and low metastatic risk; and class 2 tumors with aggressive morphology and high metastatic risk.  Our initial studies suggested that gene expression profiling was a better predictor of metastasis than monosomy 3.  For this study, BAC-array comparative genomic hybridization was used to assay genomic DNA isolated from fresh frozen primary uveal melanoma samples of known molecular class based on gene expression profiling.  Independent samples were sent to the aCGH cores at the University of California, San Francisco and the Roswell Park Cancer Institute for hybridization, and log2 ratios were reported.

DESIGN
Total genomic DNA was obtained from tumor samples that were collected at the time of treatment.  Samples were analyzed by the Microarray Shared Resource at the Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco or by the Microarray and Genomics Facility of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute.
