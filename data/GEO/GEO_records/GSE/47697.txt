TITLE
ETV4 promotes metastasis in response to combined activation of PI3kinase and RAS signaling in a mouse model of advanced prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptome of mouse models of prostate cancer. NP (Nkx3.1CreERT2/+; Ptenfloxed/floxed) mice develop non-metastatic tumors while NPK (Nkx3.1CreERT2/+; Ptenfloxed/floxed; KrasG12D/+) mice develop metastatic tumors The NPK mice are also analyzed at early and late stages of tumorigenesis (1 vs. 3 months after induction)

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from prostate tumors of different genotypes and at different stages of dissease as indicated

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
