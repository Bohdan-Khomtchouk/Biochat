TITLE
Chronic SAHA in mouse frontal cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We employed microarray analysis to compare gene expression profiles in mice chronically treated with the HDAC inhibitor SAHA. Several of the differentially expressed genes were specifically associated to mechanisms that govern cellular assembly and/or synaptic connectivity

DESIGN
Mice were chronically (21 days) treated with SAHA (Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid; vorinostat) (20 mg/kg ip), or vehicle, and sacrificed one day after the last injection. The day of the experiment, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and bilateral frontal cortex was dissected.
