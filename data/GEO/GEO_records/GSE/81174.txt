TITLE
MEIS2 is a novel oncogenic partner in AML1-ETO positive AML [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MEIS2 collaborates with AML1-ETO in inducing acute myeloid leukemia in a murine bone marrow transplantation model

DESIGN
We compared Gene expression profile (GEP) of murine bone marrow cells transduced with GFP, AML1-ETO, MEIS2, and AML1-ETO/MEIS2. Data from MEIS1 and AML1-ETO/MEIS1 is also included. Mouse bone marrow cells were kept in culture for 48hrs after retroviral transduction. GFP positive cells were then sorted and cells were kept for further 24 hours in culture before microarray analysis.
