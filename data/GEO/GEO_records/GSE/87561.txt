TITLE
Gene expression profile analysis of CD8+ T cells isolated from splenic red and white pulp upon LCMV infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed RNAseq analysis on CD8+ T cells isolated from splenic white and red pulp upon lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-Arm infection to understand how cell function and fate are determined. Analyses of transcriptional profiles revealed that decisions for gene expression patterns to become a memory cell were established during the early contraction phase by 11 days post infection (dpi) and their expression remained constant throughout the T cell development. This study may have important implication for development of efficacious vaccines.

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice that received P14 T cells were infected with LCMV Arm. At 0, 7, 11, 15, 33 days post infection, P14 T cells were sorted from splenic white and red pulp for RNAseq analysis The sample titles contain sample information according to the following scheme: First digit(s) = refers to unique sample ID (#1-50; 41 and 42 were removed due to poor quality) Second digit(s) = refers to the timepoint (0, 7, 11, 15, 33 days) C or T = designation refers to circulating (C; red pulp) or tissue (T; white pulp) Third digit(s) = refers to biological replicate (#1-5)
