TITLE
The WNT target SP5 negatively regulates WNT transcriptional programs in human pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The WNT/Î²-catenin signaling pathway is a prominent player in many developmental processes, including gastrulation, anterior-posterior axis specification, organ and tissue development and homeostasis. Here, we use human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to study the dynamics of the transcriptional response to exogenous activation of the WNT pathway. We describe a mechanism involving the WNT target gene SP5 that leads to termination of the transcriptional program initiated by WNT signaling. Integration of gene expression profiles of wildtype and SP5 mutant cells with genome-wide SP5 binding events reveals that SP5 acts to diminish expression of genes previously activated by the WNT pathway. Furthermore, we show that activation of SP5 by WNT signaling is most robust in cells with developmental potential, such as stem cells. These findings indicate a mechanism by which the developmental WNT signaling pathway reins in expression of transcriptional programs.

DESIGN
Time series analysis of Wnt3a-treated human embryonic stem cells, including knock-out of SP5 target transcription factor.
