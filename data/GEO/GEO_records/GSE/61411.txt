TITLE
Effects of Active or Inactive PARP9/DTX3L Overexpression on ISG Expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
U3A cells expressing Stat1 were transfected with either wild-type PARP9 and DTX3L, or inactive mutants of PARP9 and DTX3L. Stable lines were assessed for gene expression to identify effects of PARP9/DTX3L overexpression on ISG expression. Keywords: interferon, PARP9, DTX3L, antiviral

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from stable U3A-STAT1 lines overexpressing either wild-type or inactive mutants of PARP9 and DTX3L.
