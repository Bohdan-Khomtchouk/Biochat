TITLE
Expression data from peripheral blood lymphocytes of major depression, subsyndromal symptomatic depression, and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Several studies have suggested that SSD is a transitory phenomena in the depression spectrum and is thus considered a subtype of depression. However, the pathophysioloy of depression remain largely obscure and studies on SSD are limited. The present study compared the expression profile and made the classification with the leukocytes by using whole-genome cRNA microarrays among drug-free first-episode subjects with SSD, MDD, and healthy controls. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression to develop blood-based gene expression profiles models for classification of subsyndromal symptomatic depression and major depressive disorder

DESIGN
The present study compared the expression profile and made the classification with the leukocytes by using whole-genome cRNA microarrays among drug-free first-episode subjects with SSD, MDD, and matched controls (8 subjects in each group). Support vector machines (SVMs) were utilized for training and testing on candidate signature expression profiles from signature selection step.
