TITLE
Differential transcrpitome analysis of Sertoli cells during their phases of postnatal maturation in rat testes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Spermatogenesis is a complex process involving multiple cells and cellular signals. Among all other cells, Sertoli cells (Sc) are absolutely indispensable for sperm production because they provide biochemical signal and physical support to developing germ cells in the testis. Sc drastically transform during the process of attainment of reproductive maturity. Stage specific gene expression by Sc, supplement for the changing need of developing germ cells. A conspicuous absence of comprehensive gene expression data from various stages of developing Sertoli cells hinders our knowledge of regulating inputs necessary for the process of spermatogenesis.

DESIGN
We have compared genome wide expression of genes among 5 days, 12 days and 60 days old Sc. Agilent one-color experiment, Agilent Whole Genome Rat  4x44k  (AMADID: 014879), Labeling kit: Agilent Quick-Amp labeling Kit (p/n5190-0442)
