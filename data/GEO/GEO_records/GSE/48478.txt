TITLE
Growth phase dependent gene expression of Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 parental strain and isogenic ∆relA, ∆spoT ppGpp null strain

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 parental starin and isogenic ∆relA, ∆spoT ppGpp null strain grown in LB medium with RNA samples talken at AD600=1.0 (mid log, ML), 2.3 (early stationary phase, ESP), 3.0 (mid stationary phase MSP) and 3.6 (Late stationary phase (LSP)

DESIGN
Each array used labelled cDNA against a common genomic DNA reference. Triplicate biologically independent RNA samples were arrayed for each of the 2 strains at each of the 4 growth phases

PLATFORM
GPL5780 IFR_Salmonella_7.3k_v1.0
