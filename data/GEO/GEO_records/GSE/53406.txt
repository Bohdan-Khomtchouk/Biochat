TITLE
Expression profile of Medicago truncatula roots inoculated with human enteric pathogens.

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
Disease outbreaks due to the consumption of legume seedlings contaminated with human enteric bacterial pathogens like Escherichia coli O157:H7 and  Salmonella enterica are reported every year. We found surface and internal colonization of Medicago truncatula by Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli O157:H7 even with inoculum levels as low as two bacteria per plant. Expression analyses using microarray revealed that some Medicago truncatula genes were regulated in a similar manner in response to both of these enteric pathogens.

DESIGN
Medicago truncatula roots were inoculated with low inoculum levels of two enteric bacteria per plant (E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella). 10 days post inoculated plants were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
