TITLE
Microarray Expression Analysis of ASPP2 Knockdown in HCC-LM3 cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ASPP2, also known as 53BP2L, belongs to ASPP family of proteins. ASPP2 is proved to be a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in ASPP2-deficient mouse models with ASPP2+/- mice having a high incidence of spontaneous tumors and Î³-irradiation-induced tumors. Clinical data reveals that ASPP2 is frequently decreased in a variety of cancers.  We have previously showed that ASPP2 was frequently down-regulated by methylation and decreased expression of ASPP2 was positively correlated with recurrence and poor prognosis in HCC patients. We also investigated that ASPP2 may induce apoptosis, inhibit cell migration and invasion in vitro, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown.This chip experiment was carried out to investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes induced by ASPP2 knockdown.

DESIGN
HCC-LM3 cells were infected with LV-shASPP2 or LV-shNon control virus, one week later total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Three biological replicates were included .Six samples were amplified and labeled using a NimbleGen One-Color DNA Labeling Kit.
