TITLE
Landscape and evolution of tissue-specific alternative polyadenylation across Drosophila species

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila virilis ; Drosophila yakuba

SUMMARY
we generated developmental and tissue-specific 3'-seq libraries from D. yakuba and D. virilis  to study the role of alternative polyadenylation across Drosophila species

DESIGN
Deep 3'-sequencing data from 23 developmental stages, tissues and cell lines of D. melanogaster,  D.yakuba, and D. virilis Please note that 23 refer to # samples in Drosophila melanogaster.  D. yakuba and D. virillis samples were used to study species homology in the paper, which are from the same tissue type as D. melanogaster.
