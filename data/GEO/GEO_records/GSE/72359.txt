TITLE
p53 amplifies Toll-like receptor 5 response in MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using gene expression profiling we characterize the global effect of p53 on the TLR5-mediated transcription in MCF7 cells. We found that combined activation of p53 and TLR5 pathways synergistically increases expression of over 200 genes, mostly associated with immunity and inflammation. The synergy was observed in several human cancer cells and primary lymphocytes. Oncotarget. 2015 Jul 10;6(19):16963-80, PMID 26220208

DESIGN
10 experimental conditions, each in triplicate, several samples were hybridized twice at two separate ocasions as indicated in 'description' field.  29 samples total and 35 arrays total.
