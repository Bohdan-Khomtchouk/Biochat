TITLE
Four subgroups by gene expression profile correlate with biological and clinical features in colorectal cancer.

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
(Purpose) Biological classification of colorectal cancer (CRC) can help to understand its heterogeneous background. The purpose of this study is to classify CRC based on gene expression profiles using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples and to correlate subgroups of CRC with biological features and clinical outcomes. (Results) CRC was clustered into four subgroups by unsupervised hierarchical clustering method. These subgroups show different biological and clinical features. (Conclusion) Gene expression profiles of CRC using FFPE samples distinguish four subgroups that had different biological features and clinical outcomes. These subgroups may explain heterogeneity of CRC and be useful biomarker for clinical.

DESIGN
Patients and Methods: One hundred patients with unresectable and advanced or recurrent CRC who underwent the surgical resection from 1998 to 2010 were enrolled in this study. RNA extracted from FFPE samples was subjected to gene expression microarray. After comprehensive gene expression analysis, CRC were classified by an unsupervised hierarchical clustering and a principle component analysis (PCA). Mutation analysis of KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and TP53 genes were performed by direct DNA sequencing. Correlation between the biological information, clinicopathological factors and clinical outcomes were analyzed.
