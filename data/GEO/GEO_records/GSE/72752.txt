TITLE
CD39 expression identifies terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exhausted T cells express multiple co-inhibitory molecules that impair their function and limit immunity to chronic viral infection. Defining novel markers of exhaustion is important both for identifying and potentially reversing T cell exhaustion. Herein, we show that the ectonucleotidse CD39 is a marker of exhausted CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells specific for HCV or HIV express high levels of CD39, but those specific for EBV and CMV do not. CD39 expressed by CD8+ T cells in chronic infection is enzymatically active, co-expressed with PD-1, marks cells with a transcriptional signature of T cell exhaustion and correlates with viral load in HIV and HCV. In the mouse model of chronic Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus infection, virus-specific CD8+ T cells contain a population of CD39high CD8+ T cells that is absent in functional memory cells elicited by acute infection. This CD39high CD8+ T cell population is enriched for cells with the phenotypic and functional profile of terminal exhaustion. These findings provide a new marker of T cell exhaustion, and implicate the purinergic pathway in the regulation of T cell exhaustion.

DESIGN
CD8+ T cells from subjects with HCV infection were sorted and pelleted and re-suspended in TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA extraction was performed using the RNAdvance Tissue Isolation kit (Agencourt). Concentrations of total RNA were determined with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer or Ribogreen RNA quantification kits (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). RNA purity was determined by Bioanalyzer 2100 traces (Agilent Technologies). Total RNA was amplified with the WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification system (NuGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After fragmentation and biotinylation, cDNA was hybridized to HG-U133A 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix).
