TITLE
RANK-Fc treatment in MMTV-PyMT late carcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of MMTV-PyMT late carcinomas after adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment with RANK-Fc (receptor activator of NF-kB) cells isolated from one single MMTV-PyMT carcinoma were orthotopically injected in syngeneic WT mice, which were randomized 1:1 for neoadjuvant RANK-Fc or mock treatment (passage 1) for 4 weeks. Cells isolated from both treatment arms were pooled and injected into the fat pad of FvB recipients (passage 2) in limiting dilutions (mimicking occult disease) and again randomized 1:1 for additional RANK-Fc (adjuvant) or mock treatment

DESIGN
passage 1: 2 control tumor samples (CT), 3 RANK-Fc treated tumor samples (Fc); passage 2: 2 control tumor samples (CT_CT), 3 neoadjuvant RANK-Fc treated  tumor samples (Fc_CT, pre-RANK-Fc), 3 adjuvant RANK-Fc treated  tumor samples (CT_Fc, post-RANK-Fc); 3 neoadjuvant and adjuvant RANK-Fc treated  tumor samples (FC_FC, pre & post-RANK-Fc)
