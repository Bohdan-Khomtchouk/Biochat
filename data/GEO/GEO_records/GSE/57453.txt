TITLE
Ten day time course of the effect of influenza A infection on mediastinal lymph node gene expression in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These data were generated as part of a study to model gene regulatory networks influenced by influenza infection. Other tissue compartments included in the study were blood, lung, and spleen.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from mediatinal lymph nodes of female mice that did not have any experimental treatment (n = 3, labeled as T-9) or that received intranasal administration of influenza A virus either immediately before (n = 3, T0) or 1 to 10 days before being euthanized for tissue collection (T1 through T10, n =3 per day). Gene expression profiles were determined with comprehensive microarrays (Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 1.0).
