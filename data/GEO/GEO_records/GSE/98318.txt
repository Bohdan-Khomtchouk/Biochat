TITLE
Expression data from Nup210-depleted C2C12 myotubes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify the genome-wide changes in gene expression of post-mitotic muscle cells when Nup210 is depleted

DESIGN
C2C12 cells were induced to differentiated and then infected with control or specific-shRNA carrying lentiviruses 36 hs later. Cells were allowed to differentiate for an additional 48hs and collected for microarray assays.

PLATFORM
