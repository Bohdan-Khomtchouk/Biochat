TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of E2f4, H3K4me2 and H3K27ac in the mouse livers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Arid1a is the subunit of SWI/SNF complex, which was reported to guide SWI/SNF to DNA. Here, we found that loss of Arid1a in the liver  results in improved liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy.Genome-wide analysis showed that after hepatectomy,loss of Arid1a reduces the recruitment and activity of E2F4 on target promoters, resulting in expression programs that favor regeneration during injury. Correspondingly, these promoters showed increased H3k4me2 and H3k27ac marks, indicating de-repression of these E2f target genes.

DESIGN
The post partial hepatectomy mice liver cells were fixed and isolated, analysis of genomic occupancy of E2f4,H3K4me2,H3K27ac in  hepatocytes from Arid1a WT and Arid1a liver specific KO mice by ChIP-seq.
