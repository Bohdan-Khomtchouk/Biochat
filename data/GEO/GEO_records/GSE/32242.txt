TITLE
Differentially regulated genes induced in Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis by in vitro infection of THP-1 human macrophage cell line

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis in in vitro THP-1 (ATCC TIB-202) cell line infection, comparing bacteria grown in host medium and intracellular bacteria recovered from infected THP-1 cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, MAP-K vs. intracellular MAP-THP-1. Biological replicates: 10 controls, 10 intracellular MAP-THP-1, independently grown and harvested. In controls and  intracellular MAP-THP-1 cells, good quality RNA samples obtained from each pellet were pooled together and used for microarray experiments to get an average of 10 separate experiments, four replicates per array.

PLATFORM
