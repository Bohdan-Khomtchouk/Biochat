TITLE
Dermatophytes CGH based on a Trichophyton rubrum cDNA microarray

ORGANISM
Trichophyton rubrum ; Trichophyton schoenleinii ; Trichophyton violaceum ; Epidermophyton floccosum ; Trichophyton benhamiae ; Nannizzia gypsea ; Microsporum canis ; Trichophyton verrucosum ; Trichophyton soudanense ; Arthroderma uncinatum ; Microsporum ferrugineum ; Trichophyton terrestre ; Microsporum distortum ; Nannizzia nana ; [Arthroderma] racemosum ; Trichophyton longifusum ; Paraphyton cookei ; Lophophyton gallinae

SUMMARY
A cDNA microarray was constructed from the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of different developmental stages, and comparative genome hybridization based on microarray procedures were carried out. Dermatophyte species are classified into three genera: Epidermophyton, Microsporum, and Trichophyton. To determine the relationship between these three groups comparative genome hybridization were used in our experiment. Trichophyton rubrum genmic DNA was reference DNA and labelled by Cy3 while the other dermatophytes genomic DNA were test DNA and labelled by CY5. Test and reference DNA were co-hybridized with the T. rubrum cDNA microarray and the numbers of genes shared between each species and T. rubrum were determined. Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridization

DESIGN
We used a Trichophyton rubrum cDNA microarray prepared in our lab through comparative genome hybridization of genomic DNA of 21 dermatophyte strains (belonging to 20 species) to elucidate the taxonomy and evolution profiles of 20 dermatophyte species. The numbers of genes shared between each species and T. rubrum were determined. Each strain DNA hybridized for 3 times. The slides were separated into three groups base on different datasets.
