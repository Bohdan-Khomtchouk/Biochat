TITLE
HIV-1 burden influences host response to co-infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene networks involved in HIV-1 infection of human PBMCs were investigated by dose dependant infection with HIV-1 (Bal).  Perturbation of networks was evaluted using a co-infection with N. gonorrheae.  Hierarchical clustering, fold change analysis, and contour mapping of genes was used to identify gene groups that were then anlayzed for statisically significant associations using EASE. Keywords: dose response
