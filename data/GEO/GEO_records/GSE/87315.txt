TITLE
Identification of PU. 1 target genes in mouse developing pro-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined expression of PU.1 target genes in mouse developing pro-B cells by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Our goal was to determine the PU.1 target genes specificly required at the pro-B cell stage in B cell development.

DESIGN
A PU.1 doxycycline-inducible mouse pro-B cell line (i660 BM) was used. Description: PU.1 expression was induced for 48 hours using doxycycline at the concentration of 70ng/ml, followed by RNA extraction. Non-induced cells were used as controls. qPCRs were performed in order to validate the samples before high-throughput sequencing. Three PU.1 induced samples and three PU.1 non-induced samples were submitted to sequencing.
