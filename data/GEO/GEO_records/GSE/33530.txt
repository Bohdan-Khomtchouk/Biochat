SUMMARY
Four stable and robust TCE-dechlorinating microbial communities were enriched from TCE-contaminated groundwater under four different conditions exploring two parameters, high and low methanogenic activity (Meth and NoMeth), with and without vitamin B12 supplement  (MethB12 and NoMethB12, Meth and NoMeth, respectively).  Identical amounts of lactate (2.7 mmol) and TCE (20 Î¼l) were supplied as electron donor and electron acceptor.  All four cultures were capable of reductively dechlorinating TCE to VC and ethene.  Genomic DNA of the four enrichments was applied on a quad-Dhc-genome microarray in order to characterize the gene content of Dehalococcoides species present in the four enrichments

DESIGN
The genomic DNA of four enrichment cultures completely dechlorinated TCE to VC and ethene was used on the microarray to query Dehalococcoides species present in the mixed cultures.
