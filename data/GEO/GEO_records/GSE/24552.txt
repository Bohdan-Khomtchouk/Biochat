TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana - Pseudomonas interaction

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Some soil bacteria promote plant growth, including Pseudomonas species. With this approach we detected significant changes in Arabidopsis genes related to primary metabolism that were induced by the bacteria.
