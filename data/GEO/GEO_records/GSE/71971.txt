TITLE
Clustering of Drosophila housekeeping promoters facilitates their expression

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In this study, using thousands of reporters integrated in parallel in Drosophila Kc167 cells, we identify chromosome conformation as the main driver of position effects along chromosome arms.

DESIGN
Barcoded libraries for different reporter-promoters were generated by PCR. The libraries were electroporated to 20 Million KC167 cells populations. After non-integrated plasmid dilution was achieved, DNA and RNA were extracted. DNA was used to map the integrated reporters, to normalize for barcode abundance and RNA to assess the level of expression of every single integrated reporter.
