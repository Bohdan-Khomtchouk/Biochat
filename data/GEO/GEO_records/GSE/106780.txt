TITLE
MicroRNA expression data obtained from skin samples of female pattern hair loss patients, healthy females and males

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Female pattern hair loss  is a disease with genetic predisposition but precise mechanisms of its development remains unclear. The goal of the study was to determine microRNAsexpression pattern specific for the FPHL.

DESIGN
3 alopecia skin samples, 5 skin biopsy samples from the head of healthy women and 5 skin biopsy samples from the back of men were used for microRNA profiling

PLATFORM
GPL21572 [miRNA-4] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-4 Array [ProbeSet ID version]
