TITLE
Effect of nonylphenol on gene expression in Atlantic salmon liver, gill, hypothalamus, pituitary, and olfactory rosettes

ORGANISM
Osmerus mordax

SUMMARY
Exposure to environmental contaminants like nonylphenol can disrupt smolt development and may be a contributing factor in salmon population declines.  We used GRASP 16K cDNA microarrays to identify genes that are differentially expressed in the liver, gill, hypothalamus, pituitary, and olfactory rosettes of Atlantic salmon smolts treated with nonylphenol compared to control smolts.  Nonylphenol treatment was confirmed using physiological assays: nonylphenol-treatment significantly decreased gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity and plasma cortisol and T3 levels.
