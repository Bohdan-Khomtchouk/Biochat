TITLE
Skeletal muscle gene expression in response to resistance exercise: sex specific regulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanisms underlying the sex differences in human muscle morphology and function remain to be elucidated. The purpose of the study was to detect the sex differences in the skeletal muscle transcriptome in both the resting state and following anabolic stimuli, resistance exericse.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to profile the transcriptome of the biceps brachii of young men and women who underwent an acute unilateral RE session following 12 weeks of progressive training. Bilateral muscle biopsies were obtained either at an early (4h post-exercise) or late recovery (24h post-exercise) time point. Muscle transcription profiles were compared in the resting state between men (n=6) and women (n=8), and in response to acute RE in trained exercised vs. untrained non-exercised control muscle for each sex and time point separately (4h post-exercise, n=3 males, n=4 females; 24h post-exercise, n=3 males, n=4 females). A logistic regression-based method (LRpath), following Bayesian moderated t-statistic (IMBT), was used to test gene functional groups and biological pathways enriched with differentially expressed genes.
