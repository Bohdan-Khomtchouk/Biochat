TITLE
miR-155 role in osteoclast differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to understand the effect miR-155 has on osteoclast differentiation.

DESIGN
RAW264.7 cells were grown in a-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. mRNA extracted from wild-type RAW264.7 cells and miR-155 mis-expressing cells either before or after 72 hr of stimulation with 20ng/ml RANKL and M-CSF to induce osteoclast differentiation.

PLATFORM
