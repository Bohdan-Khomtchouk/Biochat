TITLE
Radical prostatectomy specimens with and without TMPRSS2:ERG fusion from 139 patients with prostate in a Toronto cohort

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate tumors with the gene fusion TMPRSS2:ERG have been reported to have a significantly higher risk of recurrence compared with tumors lacking the fusion. Tumors from 139 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were analyzed for the expression of 502 cancer-related genes to identify genes differentially regulated in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion tumors as well as identify biomarkers of biochemical recurrence.

DESIGN
139 prostate fresh-frozen tumors from radical prostatectomy surgery where profiled on the Illumina Human Cancer DASL Panel. 69 tumors were positive for the gene fusion TMPRSS2:ERG while 70 where not. 33 of the 139 patients experienced biochemical recurrence. Data was analyzed for differential genes in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive tumors as well as clinical and molecular biomarkers of recurrence.
