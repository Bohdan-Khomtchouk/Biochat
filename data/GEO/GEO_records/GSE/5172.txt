TITLE
Human decidual NK cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed on highly purified human CD56brightCD16- decidual NK  cells pooled from healthy 1st trimester elective terminations. Experiment was performed to find out about genes expressed in this subset. Keywords: Genes transcribed in cells studied

DESIGN
Total cellular RNA from dNK subset was pooled and subjected to clean up protocol with RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s specifications.  First and second strand cDNA was prepared from RNA template, and the cDNA was subjected to in vitro transcription in the presence of biotinylated nucleoside triphosphates. The biotinylated cRNA was fragmented to uniform sizes (~100nt). CodeLinkTM Uniset Human 20K I Bioarrays (Amersham Biosceinces) were hybridized with each prepared cRNA target in duplicates and stained with Cy5-streptavidin and subsequently washed according to manufacturer’s instructions, and then scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner.
