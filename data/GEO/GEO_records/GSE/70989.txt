TITLE
Temperature-dependent regulation of gene expression in Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus treated with Edwardsiella tarda formalin-killed cells (FKC)

ORGANISM
Paralichthys olivaceus

SUMMARY
156 genes showed more than 4-fold up or down-regulated expressions by FKC at 15 ºC and 22 ºC.

DESIGN
Fish were treated with FKC and reared at 15 ºC and 22 ºC and isolation of total RNA from spleen of the fish at 6 hours, 3days and 28 days after the treatment.
