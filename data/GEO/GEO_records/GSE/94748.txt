TITLE
Identification of the Sulfolobus acidocaldarius small RNome and L7Ae-RNA interactome

ORGANISM
Sulfolobus acidocaldarius

SUMMARY
Small RNAs and L7Ae co-immunoprecipitated RNA were isolated from the thermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and subjected to Illumina sequencing. The sRNome revealed a high abundance of C/D box sRNAs and CRISPR RNAs. The L7Ae-RNA interactome showed enrichment of all known interactors of the L7Ae protein, i.e. C/D box sRNAs, H/ACA box sRNAs, RNaseP, rRNA. A high abundance of reads for the SRP RNA was found, suggesting L7AeÂ´s interaction with this universal RNA. Many mRNA reads were enriched, several of them comprise binding sites for the L7Ae protein.

DESIGN
A S. acidocaldarius small RNA isolate and RNA that was co-immunoprecipitated with L7Ae were subjected to Illumina sequencing.
