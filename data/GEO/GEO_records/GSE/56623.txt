TITLE
RNAseq to investigate transcriptional changes in human MM cell lines due to panobinostat, 5-Azacytidine, panobinostat+5-Azacytidine or n-methyl-2-pyrroldine (NMP) treatments.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: We applied RNA sequencing technology for high-throughput analysis of transcriptional changes within human MM cell lines JJN3 and U266 due to individual and combination drug treatment. Methods: JJN3 and U266 cells were treated with pan-HDACi panbobinostat, DNMTi 5-Azacytidine, panobinostat+5-Azacytidine or NMP for 4h or 24h in triplicate and transcriptional changes assessed by RNAseq using Illumina HiSeq platform. Specifically, JJN3 cells were treated with 10nM panobinostat, 2.5µM 5-Azacytidine, panobinostat+5-Azacytidine (at given doses), or 10mM NMP. U266 cells were treated with 10nM panobinostat, 10µM 5-Azacytidine, panobinostat+5-Azacytidine (at given doses), or 10mM NMP. Results: We report unique and overlapping transcriptional signatures that lead to the induction of apoptosis in human MM cell lines in a cell-specific manner due to individual or combination treatments. Conclusions: A detailed analysis of differential transcriptional events in human MM cell lines due to HDACi, DNMTi, HDACi+DNMTi and NMP appear to define the molecular events leading to apoptosis and drug mechanism of action.

DESIGN
We tested triplicate experiments at 4h and 24hr time points in JJN3 and U266 cell lines against vehicle control treated cells.
