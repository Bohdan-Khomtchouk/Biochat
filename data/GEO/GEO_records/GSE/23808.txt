TITLE
Molecular studies on sex-different control of the hepatic metabolism in relations to insulin sensitivity (set 1)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In this study we have analyzed gene expression and metabolite levels in the livers of male and female Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. We speculated that the sex different development of diabetes in the ZDF animals presents the opportunity to relate gender to diabetes (since only males become diabetic on normal diet). In this model one can search for parameters that distinguish  females fed normal diet compared to high fat diet (i.e. components that vary with the development of diabetes)  and evaluate if such changes can be related to components that characterize  male diabetic animals..

DESIGN
Biological replicates:  4 ZDF female rat livers from rats on a standard diet (SD) and 4 ZDF female rat livers from rats on high-fat diet (HFD) (6 weeks).  One replicate per array. Hepatic gene expression, hepatic metabolites, sex-differences
