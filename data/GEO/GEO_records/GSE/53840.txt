TITLE
Whole blood DNA methylation samples from HIV positive men [2013 study]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiles of whole blood from HIV positive men. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 480,000 CpGs. Dataset included 120 subjects from the USA but because of missing clinical characteristics only 109 subjects were used in the scientific publication. The study analyzed the effect of HIV viral load on host DNA methylation levels.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 120  HIV positive men were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip. Subjects had different levels of HIV viral load. This dataset reports DNA methylation data set on 120 subjects that were generated in 2013 (while the other data set of 24 subjects reports DNA methylation data generated in 2012). Details on what each sample characteristics and their values represent are provided in the 'characteristics_readme.txt' file. Please cite PMID: 25969563.
