TITLE
Expression Profiles of Long Noncoding RNAs and mRNAs in Post-Cardiac Arrest Rat Brains

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To investigate lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in post-cardiac arrest (CA) brains, an external transthoracic electrical current was applied for eight minutes to induce CA (the CA group). Four rats received sham-operations and served as the blank control (BC) group. Upon return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), lncRNA and mRNA expression in the rat cerebral cortex was assayed with high-throughput Agilent lncRNA and mRNA microarrays. Thirty-seven lncRNAs were upregulated and 21 lncRNAs were downregulated in the CA group, and 258 mRNA transcripts were differentially expressed with 177 mRNAs upregulated and 81 mRNAs downregulated in the CA group.
