TITLE
Human liver Huh cell transcriptome response to a Wild-type ΔVP30 Ebola virus, EHUH003 [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA analysis in human liver Huh cells using the following viruses obtained by reverse genetics: Zaire Ebola virus wild-type (WT) in the ΔVP30 background (wild).

DESIGN
Human liver Huh cells were infected with  a Wild-type ΔVP30 Ebola virus. The Huh7.0 VP30 cells were on split 5 for this experiment. Infected samples were collected in quintuplet; time-matched mocks were collected in quintuplet in parallel with infected samples. Two time courses were performed to generate samples for this experiment (the second set was started within 24 h of the first set). The time courses were 0h, 8h, 24h, 48h, and 72h.
