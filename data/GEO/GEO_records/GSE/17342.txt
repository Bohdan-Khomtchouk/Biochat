TITLE
The role of miRNA in Wilms' tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We show that oncogenesis in Wilmsâ€™ tumor - the most common pediatric renal cancer- is mediated by small non-coding RNAs miRNAs.Interestingly, several differentially expressed miRNAs target genes that are known to play important role in kidney development.

DESIGN
miRNA profile of Wilm's tumor vs. normal kidney with two color microarray protocol
