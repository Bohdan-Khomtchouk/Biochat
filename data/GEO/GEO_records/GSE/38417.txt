TITLE
Gene expression data from Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients versus controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
gene expression data is from RNA extracted from muscle biopsy samples taken from boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or pathologically normal controls (CTRL). Each muscle biospy was examined in detail histologically by Dr. Eric P. Hoffman at Children's National Medical Center to determine stage of disease. In addition, the absence or presence of dystrophin was determined via western blot analyses. We utilized Human U133 2.0 arrays to examine the transcriptome of each muscle, and then we compared differential gene expression between DMD patient muscles and CTRL muscules. We set the FDR p value for significance at 0.05 and at least a 1.5 fold difference in DMD/CTRL

DESIGN
compared differential gene exrpression between DMD versus Control
