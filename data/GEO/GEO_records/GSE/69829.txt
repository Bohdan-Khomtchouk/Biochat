TITLE
Genome wide binding sites of NsrR in uropathogenic E.coli CFT073

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli CFT073

SUMMARY
We applied ChIP-seq to identify genome wide binding targets of NsrR in E.coli CFT073. NsrR is a nitric oxide sensitive regulator of transcription.  Genome wide binding targets of NsrR have been identified in E.coli K12 using ChIP-chip. The genome of CFT073 is about 0.6Mb larger than that of K12. In this study,  we identify the novel NsrR binding sites in CFT073.

DESIGN
The nsrR gene was modified by the addition of DNA sequences encoding a C-terminal 3X-Flag tag, and the tagged gene was integrated into the chromosome. NsrR bound DNA was isolated by chromatin immunoprecipitation and  it was sequenced using Miseq platform.
