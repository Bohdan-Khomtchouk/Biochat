TITLE
Transcriptional response of S.cerevisiae to aeration after anaerobic growth

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To determine the transcriptional changes that occur when yeast is shifted from anaerobic growth to an aerobic environment over a period of 120 minutes. Keywords: time course, stress response, environmental response, aerobic, anaerobic

DESIGN
This experiment consists of 11 arrays; however, the normalization strategy involves condensing the dye-swap technical replicate data for each time-point (except for the 0min vs 0min control) into a single Sample, for a total of 6 Sample records. Biological replicates are considered to be included as the time-point samples originated from separate flasks and were compared to a pooled sample of RNA from the anaerobic samples (0min).
