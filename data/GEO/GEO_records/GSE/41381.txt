Modulation of T cell responses by type I interferons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Type I interferons (IFNs) play a key role in linking the innate and adaptive immune responses. IFNs can have both positive and negative effects on the development of memory CD8+ T cells, but their contribution to the priming of naïve T cells is unclear. Using OT-I TCR transgenic T cells, we show strong effects on TCR-induced functional response when sensitized by IFN-β prior to their stimulation with cognate antigen. These effects are only seen in the absence of co-stimulation and at suboptimal TCR stimulation conditions. Pre-stimulation of naïve T cells inhibits certain TCR-mediated functions like cell proliferation and the induction of genes such as IFN-γ and IL-2. However, type I IFN does not influence the induction of other TCR-induced functions like the expression of the T cell activation marker CD25 and a number of other genes. IFN-mediated impairment of proliferation is due to the lack of IL-2 induction since it can be compensated by exogenous IL-2. Further analysis reveals an IFN-mediated inhibition of Ca2+ flux and ERK phosphorylation. In vivo studies confirm that pre-stimulation with IFNs inhibits early T cell responses, whereas long-term responses are positively affected. Our results reveal that IFN exerts negative effects on naïve T cells in a timely defined range under sub-optimal TCR stimulation conditions. These results highlight the importance of timing of immune-regulatory events and reveal a novel role for type I IFNs by shaping the immune response, such that T cells are not able to react until optimal stimulation is provided.
