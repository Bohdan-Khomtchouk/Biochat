TITLE
Sera-induced transcriptional signatures in human leukemia cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inflammation is common to many disorders and responsible for tissue and organ damage. However, the associated peripheral cytokine milieu is frequently dilute and difficult to measure, necessitating development of more sensitive and informative biomarkers for mechanistic studies, earlier diagnosis, and monitoring therapeutic interventions. Previously, we have shown that sera from type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients induces a unique disease-specific pro-inflammatory transcriptional profile in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) compared to sera of healthy controls. To address the potential variance introduced by heterogeneity in responsiveness of PBMCs from different donors, we evaluated human leukemia cell lines as surrogates for fresh PBMCs.  Expression signatures of 7 different cell lines were 1) tested in their power to differentiate sera of T1D patients from healthy controls; and 2) compared to the signature obtained with fresh PBMCs.

DESIGN
For each of the 7 cell lines, we assayed 6 individual samples (three stimulated with recent-onset (RO) T1D sera and three stimulated with healthy control sera). Hence, a total of 42 samples were analyzed in this study.
