TITLE
C. elegans daf-10(m79) mutants vs wild-type worms

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of whole day 1 adult C. elegans, comparing animals carrying the m79 mutation in the daf-10 gene and wild-type isogenic animals. Genes that act downstream of sensory neurons to influence longevity, dauer formation and pathogen responses in Caenorhabditis elegans Manuscript abstract:

DESIGN
Two-condition experiments, daf-10 vs wt, 3 biological repeats of each grown in parallel, verified lifespan increase in daf-10 mutant animals

PLATFORM
