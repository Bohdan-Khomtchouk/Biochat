TITLE
Effect of Smyd1 conditional knockout on gene expression in skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq of tibialis anterior muscle from control and Smyd1 myocyte-specific conditional knockout mice at 6 weeks of age.  Smyd1 is a methyltransferase specifically expressed in striated muscle and CD8+ T cells.  Smyd1 deficiency resulted in centronuclear myopathy primarily affecting fast-twitch muscle fibers.  These results provide insight into how loss of Smyd1 altered transcriptional programs resulting in centronuclear myopathy.

DESIGN
6 animals per group (control and Smyd1 conditional knockout)

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
