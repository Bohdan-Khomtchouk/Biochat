TITLE
shRNA Sensor Analysis of 5' U converted shRNAs reveals 3' target bias exists in addition to 5' guide bias

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
shRNAs selected with the shERWOOD algorithm were converted to have a U at the 5' end of their guide. When endogenous 1U shRNAs were compared to artificial shRNA via the sensor algorithm, the endogenous shRNAs were found to be more efficacious.

DESIGN
Purpose: Structural studies have hinted that the 5' end of shRNA guides is engulfed in the RISC complex. It has also been reported that shRNAs with a 5' U are more efficacious than those with other 5' caps. We wished to determine whether replacement of shRNA guide 5' nucleotides with a U, regardless of the corresponding target base, would increase their efficacy. Method: For each gene in the " druggable genome " 10 shRNAs were selected with the shERWOOD algorithm. In each case the score was assessed as if the guide had a 5' U. Sensor constructs were designed pairing 1U-guide shRNAs with their endogenous target. shRNAs were assessed for efficacy via the shRNA sensor assay (Fellmann et al. Mol Cell 2011). Results: shRNAs with artificial 5' Us were found to be less efficacious than those with an endogenous 5' U,
