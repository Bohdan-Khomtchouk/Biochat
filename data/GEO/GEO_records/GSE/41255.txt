TITLE
Screening for potential markers of metastases between low versus highly metastatic derived cell lines of same parental origin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study is to identify metastatic candidates via initial screening by gene expression profiling between subcloned cell lines of low (C5 and FG) and high (C5LM2 and L3.6) metastatic potential from their parental primary human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines (Panc1 and COLO357). Agilent arrays were utilized for this experiment and there are 3 replicates for each cell line.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, C5 vs. C5LM2 cell lysates with 3 replicates per cell line and FG vs. L3.6 cell lysates.
