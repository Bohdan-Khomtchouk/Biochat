TITLE
Suppression of SOX7 by DNA methylation and its tumor suppressor function in acute myeloid leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SOX7 was commonly downregulated in AML by hypermethylation. Re-expression of SOX7 in AML reduced the survival of AML

DESIGN
Overexpression of GFP-SOX7 by lenti-viral transduction in 3 AML cell lines and compared the expression level of genes normalized to GFP control
