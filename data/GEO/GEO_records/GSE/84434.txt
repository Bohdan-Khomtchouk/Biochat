TITLE
MicroRNA Expression data from transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to evaluate the change of liver status in the presence of hepatitis B viral proteins We evaluated the microRNA expression profiles of liver tissues of transgenic mices carrying wild type or mutant viral surface proteins

DESIGN
We checked the differential microRNA expressions in different transgenic mice, each with three biological replicates
