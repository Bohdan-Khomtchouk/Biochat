TITLE
CpG B and R848 induced gene expression in IRAK2 wildtype and deficient mouse macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Compared to wildtype macrophages, IRAK2 deficient macrophages show higher induced gene expression in responsse to CpG B, but not R848 Manuscipt title: The dual function of IRAK2 in TLR9-mediated interfereon and proinflammatory cytokine production

DESIGN
Bone marrow derived macrophages from wildtype and IRAK2 knockout mouse were stimulated with CpG B or R848 for 2 hours, or untreated.
