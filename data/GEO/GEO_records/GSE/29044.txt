TITLE
Expression data from breast tumors  in different age-specific cohorts  and for different sequentional disease stages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Compared transccriptome of breast cancer in young women to those arising in two mature groups to characterize the underlying biological mechanisms of the breast cancer in Middle Eastern young women. Also, compared the gene expression profile characteristic of the sequential disease stages (ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)) of breast cancer to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of breast cancer progression in young women.

DESIGN
Analyzed the whole-genome mRNA expression profile from tumor (n=73) and adjacent disease free tissues (n=36) using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.
