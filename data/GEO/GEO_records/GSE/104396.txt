TITLE
Cross-Platform single cell analysis of kidney development shows stromal cells express Gdnf

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The developing kidney provides a useful model for study of the principles of organogenesis. In this report we use three independent platforms, Drop-seq, Chromium 10XGenomics and Fluidigm C1, to carry out single cell RNA-seq analysis of the E14.5 mouse kidney. Using the software AltAnalyze, in conjunction with the unsupervised approach ICGS, we were able to identify and confirm the presence of 16 distinct cell populations during this stage of active nephrogenesis.

DESIGN
E14.5 mouse kidney cells were analyzed using three different single-cell rna-seq platforms: Drop-seq, Chromium 10X, and Fluidigm C1.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
