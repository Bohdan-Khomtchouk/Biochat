TITLE
Expression analysis of WASH knockout LT-HSC cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in WASH knockout LT-HSCs, compared to the WASH WT strain.  To find the reason that causes LT-HSC abnormal.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling using sorted LT-HSC samples from C57/BL6 strain. Total RNA extracted from WASH     control (isolated RNA from WT, IRWT) and knockout mice (IRKO) were quantified by the NanoDrop ND-1000 and     RNA integrity was assessed by standard denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis.Each chip measures the     expression level of 44, 170 genes from Mus Musculus.
