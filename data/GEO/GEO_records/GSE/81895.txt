TITLE
caArray_lavar-00109: Differential expression of genes characterize neuroblastic tumours with distinct ploidy status

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neuroblastic tumours (NBTs) represent a heterogeneous spectrum of neoplastic diseases associated with multiple genetic alterations. Structural and numerical chromosomal changes are frequent and are predictive parameters of NBTs outcome. We performed a comparative analysis of the biological entities constituted by NBTs with different ploidy status. Gene expression profiling of 49 diagnostic primary near-triploid (n= 22) and near-diploid/tetraploid (n=27) NBTs performed using Affymetrix U95Av2 arrays, revealed distinct expression profiles associated with each NBT subgroup. A statistically significant portion of genes mapped to 1p36 (P=0.01) and 17p13-q21 (P < 0.0001). Specific chromosomal abnormalities observed in NBTs, 1p loss, 17q and whole chromosome 17 gains, were reflected in the gene expression profiles. This study demonstrates that NBTs with different cellular DNA content display distinct transcriptional profiles with a significant portion of differentially expressed genes mapping to specific chromosomal regions known to be associated with outcome. Furthermore, our results suggest that NBTs with different ploidy status may result from different mechanisms of aneuploidy driving tumourigenesis.
