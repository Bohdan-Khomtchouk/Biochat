TITLE
In utero exposure to arsenic via drinking water impairs lung development and mucociliary clearance genes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In utero exposure to arsenic via drinking water increases the risk of lower respiratory tract infections during infancy and mortality from bronchiectasis in adulthood. Pregnant mice were exposed to arsenic, and gene expression patterns were profiled in peripheral lung tissue obtained from the offspring at 2 weeks of age.

DESIGN
Pregnant Mice (BALB/c, C57BL/6, C3H/HeARC) mice were exposed to arsenic (or control) via drinking water from day 8 of gestation until the birth of their offspring. After giving birth, mothers were given control drinking water. At 2 weeks post-natal age, total RNA was extracted from peripheral lung tissue of the offspring and analysed on Affymetrix microarrays.
