TITLE
ATAC-Seq on Cohesin mutant HSPCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Understanding the impact of cohesin mutations on HSPC chromatin structure

DESIGN
We examined chromatin structure using ATAC-seq in CD34+ enriched-human HSPC that were transduced with either cohesin WT, mutant or empty vector controls
