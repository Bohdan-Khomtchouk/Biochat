TITLE
Analysis of gene expression to find the effect of aspirin on oral cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aspirin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Till date there is no information on the molecular mechanism of aspirin on oral cancer cells. In this study, treated oral cancer cells were compared with untreated ones for gene expression for finding the effect of aspirin on biological process and significant pathways involved. Aspirin plays an important role in inducing apoptotic effect by activating regulators and further inhibits cell cycle progression.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from oral cancer cell line, SCC25, treated with 2.0mM of aspirin and untreated compared as a control

PLATFORM
GPL10904 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip (gene symbol)
