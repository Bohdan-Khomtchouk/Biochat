TITLE
Gene expression profiling in AML with normal karyotype: A multicenter study investigating molecular markers in 251 cases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease and AML with normal karyotype (AML-NK) is categorized as an intermediate-risk group. Over the past years molecular analyses successfully identified biomarkers that will further allow to dissecting clinically meaningful subgroups in this disease. Thus far, somatic mutations were identified which elucidate the disturbance of cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation processes in hematopoietic progenitor cells. In AML-NK, acquired gene mutations with prognostic relevance were identified for FLT3, CEBPA, and NPM1. FLT3-ITD mutations were associated with short relapse-free and overall survival, while mutations in CEBPA or NPM1 (without concomitant FLT3-ITD) had a more favorable outcome. Here, we present a multicenter study investigating gene expression profiles of 251 cases of AML-NK. In three centers whole-genome microarray analyses were performed to delineate robust and common expression signatures for molecular markers in AML-NK.

DESIGN
All samples were obtained from untreated patients at the time of diagnosis. Cells used for microarray analysis were collected from the purified fraction of mononuclear cells after Ficoll density centrifugation (Dresden, n=78; Munich, n=97; Ulm, n=77). Each laboratory performed its routine diagnostic algorithms, including the characterization of molecular markers.
