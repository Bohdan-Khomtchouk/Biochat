TITLE
ColoCare Project: Epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in colorectal cancer and adjacent mucosa tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Within the ColoCare Project we obtained genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from 149 mucosa and 112 colorectal cancer tissues using Illumina HumanMethylation450k BeadChips. DNA methylation profiles were analysed by patient characteristics, lifestyle and exposures.

DESIGN
Colorectal cancer patients were recruited at the University Hospital of Heidelberg. Genomic DNA from 149 mucosa and 112 tumor samples were analyzed, including 105 tumor-mucosa pairs. For one patient 3 replicates coming from different chips were included.
