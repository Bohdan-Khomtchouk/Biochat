TITLE
Expression analysis of Kasumi-1 cells treated with or without FTY720

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The clinical outcomes of M2 subtype Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML-M2) with t(8;21) are poor. Here we report that FTY720 (Fingolimod), a sphingosine analogue and an FDA approved drug for treatment of multiple sclerosis, showed great antitumorigenic activity against Kasumi-1 cell line, xenograft mouse model and  leukemic blasts isolated from AML-M2 with t(8;21) patients. Primary investigation indicated that FTY720 caused cell apoptosis through caspase and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activation. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed that FTY720 treatment could upregulate AML1 target genes and interfere with genes involved in ceramide synthesis. FTY720 treatment led to the elimination of AML1-ETO oncoprotein and caused cell cycle arrest. More importantly, FTY720 treatment resulted in rapid and significant increment of pro-apoptotic ceramide levels, determined by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS (high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry) based lipidomic approaches. Additionally, structural simulation model indicated that the directly binding of ceramide to inhibitor 2 of PP2A (I2PP2A) could reactivate PP2A and cause cell death. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that accumulation of ceramide plays a central role in FTY720 induced cell death of AML-M2 with t(8;21). Targeting sphingolipid metabolism by using FTY720 may provide novel insight into drug development for AML-M2 treatment.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate cultures of DMSO-treated Kasumi-1 cells and three separate cultures of FTY720-treated Kasumi-1 cells.Each chip measures the expression level of genes from DMSO-/FTY720-treated Kasumi-1 cells.
