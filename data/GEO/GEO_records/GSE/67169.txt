TITLE
mRNA-Seq profiling of Stra8-deficient and wild-type testes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA in grossly enlarged testes from 1-year-old Stra8-deficient mice, and in testes from adult male wild-type controls, to verify that Stra8-deficient testes are enriched for genes normally expressed in type A spermatogonia.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in 6 whole-testis samples (3 replicates of each genotype). Specifically, we sequenced mRNA in grossly enlarged testes from three 1-year-old Stra8-deficient male mice, and in normal testes from three adult male wild-type controls
