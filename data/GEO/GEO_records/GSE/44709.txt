TITLE
Expression data from Bifidobacterium longum strains exposed to hydrogen peroxide stress

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705 ; Bifidobacterium longum

SUMMARY
Stress survival tactics in bacteria utalize the up- and down-regulation of stress response genes. In bacterial that lack classical stress response genes for oxidative stress, other cellular systems can be used for cell survival. We used custom microarrays to study the regulation of genes in Bifidobacterium longum strains to oxidative stress to elucidate novel stress response mechanisms.

DESIGN
Bifidobacterium cells were grown to late log phase then harvested and exposed to a sub-lethal level of hydrogen peroxide. Samples were taken at 5 and 60 mins for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Controls were prepared for each time point which recieved no hydrogen peroxide treatment.
