TITLE
Candidate Genes for Panhypopituitarism identified by gene expression profile

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prop1 controls the expression of genes besides Pit1 that are important for cell mgration, survival and differentiation in the mouse and human pituitary gland. Microarray analysis was used to compare pituitary RNA from newborn Prop1 and Pit1 mutants and their wild type littermates.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected and pooled  from Prop1df/df, Porp1+/+, Pit1dw/dw, and Pit+/+ at the age of P1. 5 pools per genotype were hybridized to the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array.
