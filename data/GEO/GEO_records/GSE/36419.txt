TITLE
Systematic Analysis of Tissue-Restricted miRISCs Reveals a Broad Role for microRNAs in Suppressing Basal Activation of the C. elegans Pathogen Response

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Gene regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) under specific physiological conditions often involves complex interactions between multiple miRNAs and a large number of their targets, as well as coordination with other regulatory mechanisms, limiting the effectiveness of classical genetic methods to identify miRNA functions.  We took a systematic approach to analyze the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) in individual tissues of C. elegans and found that mRNAs encoded by pathogen-responsive genes were dramatically over-represented in the intestinal miRISC, and that multiple miRNAs accumulated in the intestinal miRISCs upon infection.  Inactivation of the miRISC or ablation of miRNAs from different families, resulted in over-expression of several pathogen-responsive genes under basal conditions and, surprisingly, enhanced worm survival on pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  These results indicate that much of the miRNA activity in the gut is dedicated to attenuating the activity of the pathogen response system, uncovering a novel and complex physiological function of the miRNA network.

DESIGN
Each array was used for one biological replicate of a given experiment.  One channel was used to probe Total RNA, the other was for IP RNA.  Channels were swapped between biological replicates.  4 biological replicates for each asynchronous intestine IPs, 4 biological replicates for asynchronous muscle IP, 5 biolgoical replicates for L4 intestine IP, and two new biological replicates for the GFP control IP (previous biological replicates can be found in GSE9073: GSM230865-GSM2308657 and GSM230873-GSM230875).
