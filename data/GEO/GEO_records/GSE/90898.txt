TITLE
Single-base resolution methylomes of Xenopus laevis x Xenopus tropicalis embryos

ORGANISM
Xenopus tropicalis x Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Genome duplication has played a pivotal role in the evolution of many eukaryotic lineages, including the vertebrates. The most recent vertebrate genome duplication is that in Xenopus laevis, which resulted from the hybridization of two closely related species about 17 million years ago. Here we generated epigenetic profiles and determined gene expression in X.laevis embryos to study the consequences of this duplication at the level of the genome, the epigenome, and gene expression.

DESIGN
WGBS profiling of Xenopus tropicalis x Xenopus laevis st.10.5 embryos.

PLATFORM
GPL22749 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Xenopus tropicalis x Xenopus laevis)
