TITLE
Sensors, Pathways and Transcription factors regulating IR-induced inflammatory transcriptional output [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Radiation induced interferon response is mediated by IRF1 but not by the IRF3. Phosphorylated p53 binds strongly within 1kb of TTS of p53 dependent genes that are potently induced by ionizing radiation.

DESIGN
Bone marrow-derived macrophages were irradiated with 6Gy IR for 0, 0.5h, 1h, 2h and 6h. Chromatin from 0, 1h, 2h and 6h was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against IRF1 or IRF3. For p-p53 ChIP-seq, chromatin were prepared from 0, 0.5h, 1h, 2h and 6h time points.
