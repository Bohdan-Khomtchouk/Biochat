TITLE
Microarrays of macrophages infected with smooth or rough Brucella suis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The macrophage-Brucella interaction is critical for the establishment of a chronic Brucella infection.  Smooth virulent B. suis strain 1330 (S1330) prevents macrophage cell death. However, rough attenuated B. suis strain VTRS1 induces strong macrophage cell death. To further investigate the mechanism of VTRS1-induced macrophage cell death, microarrays were used to analyze temporal transcriptional responses of murine macrophage-like J774. A1 cells infected with S1330 or VTRS1.

DESIGN
Murine J774.A1 macrophages were plated in T75 at 8 x 10^6 cells per flask one day prior to infection, and then infected with B. suis S1330 or VTRS1 at a MOI of 200:1. Total RNAs were isolated by TRIzol and further purified using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h post infection. The RNA samples were stored at -80 ºC until an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) was used to assess the concentrations and quality of RNA samples. Total RNA (20 µg) per sample was used for hybridization with Affymetrix mouse GeneChip 430 2.0 array. Preparation of cDNA, hybridization, quality controls and scanning of the GeneChip 430 2.0 arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) .
