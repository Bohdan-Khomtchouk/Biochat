SUMMARY
In this study, Affymetrix MG_U74Av2 and MG_U74Cv2 GeneChips were used to analyze gene expression over a 12 day time course in C2C12 myoblasts induced to differentiate in vitro.  Triplicate cultures were studied during cell proliferation (days -2 and -1), at cell cycle withdrawal (day 0) and during myogenic fusion and maturation of multinucleated myotubes (days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).
