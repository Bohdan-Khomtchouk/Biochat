TITLE
Cooperative Associations with Sites on Different Nucleosomes Mediate Heterochromatin Spreading

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Sir3wH and Sir4CC are required for SIR complex spreading in vivo but play partially redundant roles when Sir3 is overexpressed.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq analysis of Sir3 chromatin binding and its dependence on Sir3wH domain deletion and Sir4-I1311N mutation.
