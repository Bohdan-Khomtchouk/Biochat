TITLE
Host imprinting on bacterial genomes-rapid, divergent evolution in individual hosts

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (ABU) Escherichia coli strain 83972 comparing the progenitor wild type strain ABU83972 with its re-isolates from human bladder colonization (PI-2, PII-4, PIII-4) and in vitro cultivation experiment (4.9).

DESIGN
Wild type vs. re-isolate cells. Biological replicates: 3 wild type, 3 re-isolates, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL9941 Operon E. coli Custom 3.8K 55156017 array
