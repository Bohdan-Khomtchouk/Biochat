TITLE
SMYD2 specificly regulate BIX-01294 induced TP53 target genes revealed by RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We characterized expression profilings of SMYD2 knockdown and control cells treated by BIX-01294 and Rapamycin.

DESIGN
We used siRNAs to knockdown SMYD2 in HCT116 cells, and NC as control. We treated those cell lines with BIX-01294 and Rapamycin, and the expression profilings were perfomed by Illumina high throughput sequencing.
