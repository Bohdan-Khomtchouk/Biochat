TITLE
Large-Scale Gene Expression Profiling of Developing Soybean Seeds of Evans

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Developing Evans seeds at 25, 30, 40, 45 and 50 days after flowering (DAF) were harvested and analyzed to gain insights as to the biochemical program that determines soybean seed development. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying seed development and identified distinct classes of genes with changed expression during this process.

DESIGN
Sampled developing Evans seeds at 25, 30, 40, 45 and 50 days after flowering (5 time points), with two replicates each.
