TITLE
Genome-wide maps of H3K4me2 and DNase I hypersensitivity sites in prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and breast cancer cell line MCF-7.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the high-throughput profiling of histone modification and DNase I hypersensitivity sites in prostate cancer and breaset cancer cells. We found that while AR binding is associated with nucleosome depletion, ER binding is not. We showed that a quantitative measure of DNase I hypersensitivity changes is a powerful tool in indentifying transcription factor cistromes.

DESIGN
Examination of histone modification marked nucleosomes and Dnase I hypersensitivity in prostate cancer and breast cancer cells with and without hormone treatment.
