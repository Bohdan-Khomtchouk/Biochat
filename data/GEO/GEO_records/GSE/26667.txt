TITLE
Expression array using Maffucci tumours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We did whole genome analysis of enchondromas and chondrosarcomas of Maffucci patients. Since the disease is very rare, we had only three frozen tumour samples were available to continue with the expression array. Enchondromas of Maffucci syndrome did not show any loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or common copy number alterations (CNA) and we looked at the differentially expressed genes between Ollier high grade and Maffucci high grade tumours. There were no significant differentially expressed genes were found between these two groups. This might be due to the small sample size.

DESIGN
We used Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array on enchondromas (n=4) and chondrosarcomas (n=2) and compared the results to a previously studied cohort of patients with Ollier disease (n = 37). We used Illumina expression array v3 chip on enchondroma (n=1) and chondrosarcomas (n=2) from Maffucci patients.
