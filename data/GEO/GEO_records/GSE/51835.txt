TITLE
Effects of exercise on gene expression level in human monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We tested the hypothesis on the mechanisms responsible for the early control of monocytes function by identifying a discrete set of genes in circulating monocytes that were altered by exercise. Exercise leads to a rapid change in the profile of gene expression in monocytes.

DESIGN
Twelve healthy men (22-30 yr old) performed 10 2-min bouts of cycle ergometer exercise interspersed with 1-min rest at a constant work equivalent to about 82% of VO2max. A baseline blood sample was taken before the and immediately after the exercise.  Monocytes  were isolated from PBMC using a negative magnetic cell separation methods (Miltenyi Biotec Monocyte Isolation Kit II human  #130-091-153 and the autoMACS® Pro Separator). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol®.  For this study we used Affymetrix plus 2  (total of 24 chips).
