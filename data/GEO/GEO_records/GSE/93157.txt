TITLE
Programmed death 1 receptor blockade and immune-related gene expression profiling in non-small cell lung carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA from tumor samples from 65 patients with melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck treated  anti-PD1was analyzed on the nCounter system using the PanCancer 730-Immune Panel.

DESIGN
Twenty-three immune-related genes or signatures were linked to response. The intra- and inter-biopsy variability of PD1, PDL1, CD8A and CD4 mRNA.
