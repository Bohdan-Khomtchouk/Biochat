TITLE
DNA damage checkpoint kinases regulate a global network of transcription factors

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
DNA damage results in the activation of checkpoint kinases, which phosphorylate downstream effectors that inhibit the cell cycle, activate DNA repair, and cause widespread changes in transcription. However, the specific connections between the checkpoint kinases and downstream transcription factors (TFs) are not well understood. Here, we introduce a strategy for mapping regulatory networks between kinases and TFs involving integration of kinase mutant expression profiles, transcriptional regulatory interactions, and phosphoproteomics. We use this approach to investigate the role of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae checkpoint kinases (Mec1, Tel1, Chk1, Rad53, and Dun1) in the transcriptional response to DNA damage caused by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The result is a global kinase-TF regulatory network in which Mec1 and Tel1 signal through Rad53 to synergistically regulate the expression of more than 600 genes. This network implicates at least nine TFs, including Msn4, Gcn4, SBF (Swi4/Swi6), MBF (Swi6/Mbp1), and Fkh2/Ndd1/Mcm1, nearly all of which have sites of Rad53-dependent phosphorylation, as downstream regulators of checkpoint kinase-dependent genes. We also identify a major DNA damage-induced transcriptional network acting independently of Rad53 and other checkpoint kinases to regulate expression of genes involved in general and oxidative stress responses.

DESIGN
Expression was profiled with and without treatment in several genetic backgrounds (gene deletion strains)
