TITLE
The absence of a Ca(2+) signal during mouse egg activation can affect development and gene expression patterns

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The absence of a Ca(2+) signal during mouse egg activation can affect parthenogenetic preimplantation development, gene expression patterns, and blastocyst quality. Gene expression pattern of parthenogenetic mouse embryos by cycloheximide or Sr2+. Keywords: development or differentiation design
