TITLE
Gene expression profiling after Wig-1 knockdown in HCT116 cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Wig-1 is a p53 target gene that encodes an RNA-binding protein involved in regulation of mRNA stability through binding to AU-rich elements (AREs). The aims of this study were to identify novel Wig-1 target mRNAs and to characterize the mechanisms of their regulation. Using a microarray approach, we identified 2447 transcripts with > 4-fold differential expression between Wig-1 siRNA and control siRNA treated HCT116 cells. Among the deregulated transcripts we found a number of p53 target genes. We demonstrated that Wig-1increases 14-3-3σ transcription while it binds to an ARE in the FAS 3’UTR and decreases the FAS mRNA stability. Furthermore, we show that Wig-1 depletion favours cell death rather that cell cycle arrest after DNA damage. We propose a role of Wig-1 in directing the p53 stress response towards cell cycle arrest rather than cell death through regulation of 14-3-3σ and FAS mRNA levels.

DESIGN
Use HEEBO microarrays to examine the effects of Wig-1 protein knockdown by siRNA silencing in HCT116 cells. 3 microarrays in total.
