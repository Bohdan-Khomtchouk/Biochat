TITLE
The HLA-B*35 allele modulates ER stress, inflammation and proliferation in PBMCs from Limited Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to assess whether the presence of HLA-B*35 contributes to activation of ER stress/UPR and inflammation in lcSScPAH PBMC. HLA-B*35 is associated with increased risk of developing PAH in lcSSc patietns. Also we previously reported that HLA-B*35 induces ECs dysfunction via activation of ER stress/UPR and upregulation of the inflammatory response. Our study demonstrates that HLA-B*35 contributes to the dysregulated expression of selected ER stress, inflammation and proliferation related genes in lcSSc patient PBMCs, as well as healthy individuals, thus supporting a pathogenic role of HLA-B*35 as a risk factor for developing PAH in SSc patients.

DESIGN
In this study, PBMCs from 3 healthy controls were investigated.
