TITLE
Involvement of a chromatin remodeling complex in damage tolerance during DNA replication

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes have been shown to participate in DNA replication in addition to transcription and DNA repair. However, the mechanisms of their involvement in DNA replication remain unclear. Here, we reveal a specific function of the yeast INO80 chromatin remodeling complex in the DNA damage tolerance pathways. Whereas INO80 is necessary for the resumption of replication at forks stalled by methyl methane sulfonate (MMS), it is not required for replication fork collapse after treatment with hydroxyurea (HU). Mechanistically, INO80 regulates DNA damage tolerance during replication through modulation of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) ubiquitination and Rad51-mediated processing of recombination intermediates at impeded replication forks. Our findings establish a mechanistic link between INO80 and DNA damage tolerance pathways, indicating that chromatin remodeling is important for accurate DNA replication.

DESIGN
INO80 distribution in WT cells was measured.
