TITLE
Expression data profile of A498 cells inoculated with E. coli 83972 and E. coli CFT073

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) constitute a highly relevant model of microbial adaptation, in which the contrasting effects of pathogens and commensals on host tissues are clearly displayed. While virulent Escherichia coli cause severe, potentially life-threatening disease by breaking the inertia of the mucosal barrier and infecting the kidneys, the most common outcome of bacteriuria is an asymptomatic carrier state resembling commensalism at other mucosal sites. It remains unclear if the lack of destructive inflammation merely reflects low virulence or if carrier strains actively inhibit disease associated responses in the host. To address this question, we examined the effects of asymptomatic bacterial carriage on host gene expression. A498 cell line has been validated as a model of uropathogenic E. coli infection; the cells express functional receptors for bacterial virulence ligands and the response to virulent strains reflects human UTI. The cells were infected with asymptomatic and pathogenic E. coli in vitro, and harvested RNA was subjected to whole genome transcriptome analysis.

DESIGN
A498 human kidney epithelial cells were infected with the asymptomatic (E. coli 83972) or virulent strains (E. coli CFT073) for 4 hours. The cells with culture medium alone were used as a control. The experiment was performed in biological duplicates or triplicates.
