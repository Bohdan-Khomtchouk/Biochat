TITLE
SDF-1 chemokine signaling modulates the apoptotic responses of clathrin-depleted DT40 cells

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The cell line DKO-S is derived form chicken B-Cell DT40 cells where the clathrin heavy-chain has been placed under  the control of a tetracycline-regulatable promoter (Tet-Off). The originally derived cell-line DKO-S underwent apoptosis when clathrin expression was repressed. A cell line, DKO-R, derived from DKO-S cells that was less sensitive to clathrin-depletion. This project explores the differnces in gene expression between DKO-R and DKO-S cells

DESIGN
Duplicate samples ofDT40, DKO-S or DKO_R cells either with or without treatment with deoxycyclin are compared as is the expression between DKO-R and DKO-S cell lines
