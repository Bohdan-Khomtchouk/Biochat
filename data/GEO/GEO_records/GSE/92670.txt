TITLE
Elucidation of the molecular responses to waterlogging in Sesbania cannabina roots

ORGANISM
Sesbania cannabina

SUMMARY
To better understand the molecular mechanisms of the response of S. cannabina to soil waterlogging, the transcriptional profile in both short and long term of waterlogged S. cannabina roots were performed using the Illumina HiSeqâ„¢ 2000 sequencing platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Bioinformatic analysis of transcriptome data was performed to allow identification and functional annotation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). By comparing the different genes appeared in control and treatment groups, we can learn more about the species-specific responses employed by S. cannabina and find novel associated genes or strategies in waterlogging resistant species.

DESIGN
S. cannabina root mRNA profiles of 30-day old control (untreated) , 3h and 27h waterlogging treatment were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina GAIIx.
