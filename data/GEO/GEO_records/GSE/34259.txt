TITLE
Study of the effect on indoxyl sulfate on endothelial gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to determine the molecular mechanism by which indoxyl sulfate acts on endothelial cells. Endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated  with medium containing indoxyl sulfate at concentration found in chronic kidney disease patients (1mM). Since indoxyl sulfate is a potassium salt, control medium contains KCl at 1mM. Cells were incubated during  four hours in presence of indoxyl sulfate or KCl. Seven biological replicates were obtained for these two conditions.

DESIGN
To understand how uremic solutes participate in endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular complications of chronic kidney disease patients

PLATFORM
