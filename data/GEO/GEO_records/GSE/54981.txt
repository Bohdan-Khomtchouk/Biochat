TITLE
Comparison of H460 derived CSCs and cisplatin-resistant cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription profile of cancer stem cells isolated from human non-small cells lung cancer (NSCLC) H460 cells. The profile of H460 cells that were made resistant to cisplatin after a single treatment with the drug was also determined. Both profiles were finally compared.

DESIGN
Each microarray contained one of these comparative experiments (two-channels): H460C (H460 derived CSCs) vs H460 and H460R (cisplatin-resistant H460 cells) vs H460. Technical replicates were made with dye-swap-based design. Total biological replicates per cell type (H460C and H460R): 2.
