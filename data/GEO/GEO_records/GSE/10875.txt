TITLE
3-Deazaadenosine treated hCASMC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
cDNA expression prfiles of purified human smooth muscle cells treated with c³Ado were compared to those of untreated cells. Keywords: treatment-versus-control

DESIGN
Cells were treated with c³Ado or left untreated (controls). Five cultures each were prepared. Total RNA was reverse transcribed, labeled with 32P, and hybridized to nylon filters spotted with 1200 human cDNAs.
