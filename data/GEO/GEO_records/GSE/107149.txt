TITLE
DNA methylation state is associated with the formation of loops and links in hematopoietic stem cells [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We present the high resolution HiC study of genome folding in primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We investigated the relationship of chromosomal contacts with other epigenetic marks, particularly DNA methylation which is known to be important for appropriate stem cell differentiation.

DESIGN
We use RNA-Seq to probe relationship of chromosomal contacts and gene expression changes in hematopoietic stem cell

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
