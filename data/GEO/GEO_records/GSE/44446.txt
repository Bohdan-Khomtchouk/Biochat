TITLE
Characterization of the DNA methylation patterns in oxaliplatin chemosensitive and chemoresistant human colorectal cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of LoVo oxaliplatin sensitive (LoVo_S) and LoVo 10 fold oxaliplatin resistant (LoVo_R) cell lines. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in cell lines genomic DNA samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the LoVo_S and LoVo_R samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
