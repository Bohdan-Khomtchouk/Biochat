TITLE
Hormone effects on gene expression in somatic cells of rat testes (Rattus norvegicus)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hormone effects on irradiated LBNF1 rat testes, which contain only somatic cells except for a few type A spermatgogonia.  Rats were treated for 2 weeks with either sham treatment (group X), hormonal ablation (GnRH antagonist and the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide, group XAF), testosterone supplementation (GnRH antagonist and testosterone, group XAT), and FSH supplementation ((GnRH antagonist, androgen receptor antagonist, and FSH, group XAFF).  Results provide insight into identifying genes in the somatic testis cells regulated by testosterone, LH, or FSH.

DESIGN
14 Sample replicates of sham treatment, 11 Sample replicates of hormonal ablation, 5 Sample replicates of testosterone supplementation, and 5 Sample replicates of FSH supplementation were studied.
