TITLE
Expression data of SW480 cells with TFAP2E overexpression and without TFAP2E (empty vector control)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AP2 transcription factors play important roles in development and cancer, we tried to clarify the role of the so far uncharacterised TFAP2E in colorectal cancer. We used GENE ST 1.0 Arrays to detail up and downregulated target genes of this AP-2 transcription factor.

DESIGN
We used the ptarget mammalian expression vector (Promega) to overexpress the TFAP2E gene in the SW480 CRC line.
