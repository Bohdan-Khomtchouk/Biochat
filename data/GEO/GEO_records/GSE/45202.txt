TITLE
Amplitude modulation of androgen signaling by c-MYC [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Androgen-stimulated growth of the molecular apocrine breast cancer is mediated by an androgen receptor (AR)-regulated transcriptional program.  Through profiling the genomic licalizations of AR and its co-regulators FOXA1 and TCF7L2 in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, we revealed the molecular details of the AR-centered regulatory network. We further identified that  c-MYC is a key downstream target co-regulated by AR, FOXA1 and TCF7L2, and reinforces the transctiopnal activation of androgen-responsive genes in this subtype of breast cancers.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells were transfected with control of MYC siRNA for 48 h, followed by treatment with 10nM DHT or vehicle for 6 h. The cells were subjected to mRNA purification and library praparation for RNA-seq on Illumina HiSeq2000 platform.

PLATFORM
