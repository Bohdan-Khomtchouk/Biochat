TITLE
MES-4, an autosome-associated HMT that participates in silencing the X chromosomes in the C. elegans germ line

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Microarray-based expression profiling of dissected gonads from mes-4 mutants reveals that MES-4 is required to repress expression of a set of X-linked genes. Keywords: Mutant analysis of mes-4 in dissected C. elegans gonads
