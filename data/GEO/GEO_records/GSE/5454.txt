TITLE
MES-4, an autosome-associated HMT that participates in silencing the X chromosomes in the C. elegans germ line

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Microarray-based expression profiling of dissected gonads from mes-4 mutants reveals that MES-4 is required to repress expression of a set of X-linked genes. Keywords: Mutant analysis of mes-4 in dissected C. elegans gonads

DESIGN
We isolated dissected gonads from mes-4(bn85) mutant adults and compared to dissected gonads from wild type (N2 animals.  RNA was linearly amplified prior to labeling for all genotypes.  Comparison was done in quadruplicate on independently grown and isolated animals.
