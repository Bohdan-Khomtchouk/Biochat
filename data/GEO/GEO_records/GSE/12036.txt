TITLE
mouse lung resistance or sensitivity to cigarette smoke

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have investigated the effects of cigarette smoke exposure in three different strains of mice. DBA/2 and C57Bl/6J are susceptible to smoke and develop different lung changes in response to chronic exposure, while ICR mice are resistant to smoke and do not develop emphysema. The present study was carried out to determine early changes in the gene expression profile of mice exposed to cigarette smoke with either a susceptible or resistant phenotype.

DESIGN
Three strains of mice were exposed to smoke from three cigarette/day, 5d/wk for 4 weeks. Microarray analysis was carried out on total RNA extracted from the lung utilizing the Affymetrix platform.
