TITLE
Gene expression in tobacco (Nicotiana) nectaries

ORGANISM
Nicotiana glauca ; Nicotiana plumbaginifolia ; Nicotiana rustica ; Nicotiana benthamiana ; Nicotiana clevelandii ; Nicotiana bonariensis

SUMMARY
Nectaries are the glands responsible for nectar secretion. To understand the genetic programming underlying nectar production, floral nectaries of six Nicotiana species at four different time points (floral stage 6,9, and 12, a post-secretory stage) in biological triplicate were collected, with RNA being isolated and subjected to Illumina RNA-seq analysis.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of nectaries from six species of Nicotiana. This series includes RNA-seq of leaf, ovary and sepal tissue from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia.
