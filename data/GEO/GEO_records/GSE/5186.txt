TITLE
Gene expression changes in fetuses exposed to ethanol in utero

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Timed pregnant C57Bl6 mice were exposed to ethanol during a critical period, gestational day 15 to 18, of cerebral cortical development to identify gene expression changes in the cerebral cortex of developing fetus due to this ethanol exposure Keywords: Compared animals exposed to ethanol (alcohol fed group) to a pair-fed control group and both groups were normalized to a control group (animals fed adlibitum)

DESIGN
We analyzed 14, dual labeled, 22K Mouse arrays where one channel (Ch1) represents the sample for animals fed with alcohol (alcohol fed group) or to animals fed with maltose dextrose (pair-fed group) and the other channel (Ch2) corresponds to universal control (total RNA from 7 animals fed adlibitum with food and water; control)

PLATFORM
