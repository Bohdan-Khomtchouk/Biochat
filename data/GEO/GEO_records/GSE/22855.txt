TITLE
Comparison of enchondromas with controls (growth plate and cartilage)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ollier disease is a rare, non-hereditary disorder which is characterized by the presence of multiple enchondromas (EC), benign cartilaginous neoplasms arising within the medulla of the bone, with an asymmetric distribution. The risk of malignant transformation towards central chondrosarcoma (CS) is increased up to 35%. The etiology of Ollier disease is unknown. We therefore undertook genome-wide expression profiling using Illumina Beadarray v3.0 for 7 enchondromas of 6 patients and compared them with controls in order to find differentially expressed genes in these benign tumors.

DESIGN
The goal of this study was to find differentially expressed genes between enchondromas, a benign cartilage forming tumor occuring in the metaphyses of bone, and controls. We have used samples of normal growth plate and articular cartilage as the controls. Seven enchondromas were compared to two growth plate and four cartilage samples.
