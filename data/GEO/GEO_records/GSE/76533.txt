TITLE
Epigenetic characteristics and gene-expression analysis of Derivative 3-3 de novo centromere in maize

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
De novo centromeres originate occasionally from non-centromeric regions of chromosomes, providing an excellent model system to study centromeric chromatin. The maize mini-chromosome Derivative 3-3 contains a de novo centromere, which was derived from a euchromatic site on the short arm of chromosome 9 that lacks traditional centromeric repeat sequences. Our previous study found that the CENH3 binding domain of this de novo centromere is only 288 kb with a high-density gene distribution with low-density of transposons. Here we applied next generation sequencing technology to analyze gene transcription, DNA methylation for this region. Our RNA-seq data revealed that active chromatin is not a barrier for de novo centromere formation. Bisulfite-ChIP-seq results indicate a slightly increased DNA methylation level after de novo centromere formation, reaching the level of a native centromere. These results provide insight into the mechanism of de novo centromere formation and subsequent consequences.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was carried out using material from seedling and young leaves between control and Derivative 3-3.  Bisulfite-ChIP-seq was carried out with anti-CENH3 antibodies using material from young leaves in Derivative 3-3.
