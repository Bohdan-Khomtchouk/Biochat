TITLE
Transposon-based construction of strand-specific RNA-seq libraries

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have developed two methods for efficiently consructing RNA-seq libraries using transposition.  Each method constructs high quality RNA-seq libraries when compared to standard approaches. One of the methods (Directional Tn-RNA-seq) maintains strand-of-origin information and exhibits strand specificity comparable to current approaches.

DESIGN
RNA-seq libraries were constructed from ECC-1, a human cell line, and Universal Human Reference RNA using transposon-based and standard RNA-seq library construciton methods.
