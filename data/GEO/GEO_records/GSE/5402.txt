TITLE
Signalling molecules in MEFs/FL

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In silico analysis identified signalling molecules related to Wnt (Wnt1, 2, 5a, 5b, 6, 11, 14, Wisp1, 2, sFRP1 and 2, Dkks 2 and 3) and BMP (BMP1, 4, 5) pathways.  Many of these tags matched multiple transcripts in GenBank, while other potential molecules could not be detected because the transcripts either lacked an anchoring enzyme site or the site was immediately adjacent to the polyA+ sequence. Keywords: SAGE

DESIGN
To identify potential signalling molecules (secreted or cell-cell interacting) implicated in the formation of INPs, we constructed a SAGE library from MEFs
