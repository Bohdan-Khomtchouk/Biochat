TITLE
Rice seedling hormone treatment

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Indica rice seedlings of IR64 variety were grown hydroponically for 7-days in a culture room with a daily photoperiodic cycle of 14h light and 10h dark. Seedlings were incubated in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (control) or 50 micromolar solutions of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA treatment) and benzyl aminopurine (BAP treatment) for 1h and 3h. Equal amounts of 1h and 3h samoles were pooled for each treatment before RNA isolation. The 5 micrograms of each total RNA sample was processed for microarray analysis according to Affymetrix protocol. Keywords: Rice, seedling, IAA, BAP, hormone response
