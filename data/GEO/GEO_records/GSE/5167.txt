TITLE
Rice seedling hormone treatment

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Indica rice seedlings of IR64 variety were grown hydroponically for 7-days in a culture room with a daily photoperiodic cycle of 14h light and 10h dark. Seedlings were incubated in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (control) or 50 micromolar solutions of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA treatment) and benzyl aminopurine (BAP treatment) for 1h and 3h. Equal amounts of 1h and 3h samoles were pooled for each treatment before RNA isolation. The 5 micrograms of each total RNA sample was processed for microarray analysis according to Affymetrix protocol. Keywords: Rice, seedling, IAA, BAP, hormone response

DESIGN
Two biological replicates for each sample (control, IAA treated, BAP treated) were used for microarray analysis. The experiment involves the identification of differentially expressed genes in IAA and BAP treated samples as compared to control.
