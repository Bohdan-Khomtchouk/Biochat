SUMMARY
Esophageal cancer is among the 10 most common malignancies and ranks as the 6th leading cause of death from cancer. It constitutes 7% of all gastrointestinal cancers and is one of the most lethal of all cancers. The large variation in the incidence of esophageal cancer in different geographic regions has often been thought to be due to variation in exposure to environmental factors; however, hereditary factors may also contribute to the variation in rates. A positive family history was found to be associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer in several case-control and cohort studies in China. Familial aggregation also has been observed in Iran and Japan. The cancer data generated from six hospital based cancer registries in India under National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP, Annual Report, 2003-2004) has revealed that the occurrence of esophageal cancer in Assam is highest in India. The aggregation of esophageal cancer in families is a long-observed and well-documented phenomenon in Assam of North-east part of India (AAR=32.6). In Assam high incidence of esophageal cancer with familial aggregation need investigation for etiology. The etiology of esophageal cancer in Northeast Indian population is different from other population at India due to wide variations in dietary habits or nutritional factors, tobacco chewing and alcohol habits. With in these high-risk regions, studies have shown a strong tendency toward familial aggregation, suggesting that genetic susceptibility, in conjunction with potential environmental exposures, may be involved in the etiology of esophageal cancer. Familial clustering of cancer has been one of the main avenues to the understanding of cancer etiology and the signal to the involvement of heritable genes. Familial clustering of cancer may be due to environmental factors shared by family members or due to shared genes. However, the familial aggregation of esophageal cancer among the population in northeast India may reflect the influence of environmental factors operating on individuals who are already genetically susceptible. Epidemiological studies indicate that tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption are the major factors for esophageal cancer, the role  of genetic factors for familial aggregation has not been elucidated. In this study, tumor and matched normal tissue from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients with a family history of upper gastrointestinal cancer were analyzed using cDNA microarray containing 10,000genes to evaluate gene expression differences in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients with a family history of upper gastrointestinal cancer from a high- risk area in India. To identify alteration in genes and molecular functional pathways in esophageal cancer in a high incidence region of India where there is wide spread use of tobacco and betel quid with fermented areca nuts and familial aggregation cancer.
