TITLE
MiRNA profiling of meningioma of different grades and histological subtypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although meningiomas are one of the most frequent primary intracranial tumors, there are only a few studies dealing with gene regulation processes in meningiomas. MiRNAs are key regulators of gene expression and regulation and miRNA profiles offer themselves as biomarkers for cancer development and progression. To investigate the role of miRNAs during meningioma growth and progression, we compared expression of 1205 miRNAs in 55 meningioma samples of different tumor grades and histological subtypes. We were able to classify histological subtypes in WHO grade I meningiomas with up to 97% accuracy (meningothelial versus fibroblastic) and different WHO grades with up to 93% accuracy (WHO I versus WHO III). We found significant downregulation of miRNAs on chromosome 1p36 and within two large miRNA clusters on 14q32 in high grade meningiomas, two regions that are yet associated with meningioma progression. We also identified several miRNAs associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition differentially expressed in meningothelial meningioma compared to fibroblastic meningioma. Combined, our data show that meningiomas of different WHO grades and histological subtypes show a specific miRNA expression profile. Some individual miRNAs can also serve as potential biomarkers for meningioma progression.

DESIGN
Tumor miRNA profile of 55 meningioma tumor samples, including 11 samples of each meningotheliall, fibroblastic and transitional meningioma (WHO grade I), atypical meningioma (WHO grade II) and anaplastic meningioma (WHO grade III).
