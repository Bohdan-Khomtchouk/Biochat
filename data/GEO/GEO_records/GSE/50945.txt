TITLE
Effect of DHA enriched fish oil on human placental cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The omega-3 long chain poly-unsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plays a central role in fetal and neonatal development in humans, in particular the development of the brain and nervous system, and this has led to numerous studies focussed on determining the effect of exposure to an increased supply of DHA on pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of treatment with a DHA-enriched fish-oil emulsion on fatty acid composition, proliferation rate and gene expression in human placental HTR8/SVneo cells in vitro.

DESIGN
This set contains 12 arrays culture experiments. 4 controls, 4 treated with DHA-enriched fish-oil emulsion, 4 treated with soy-oil emulsion.
