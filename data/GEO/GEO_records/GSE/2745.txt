MMP101

ORGANISM
Methanococcus maripaludis

SUMMARY
Methanococcus maripaludis is a methanogenic archaeon. Within its genome, there are two operons for membrane associated hydrogenases, eha and ehb. To investigate the regulation of ehb on the cell, an S40 mutant was constructed in such a way that a portion of the ehb operon was replaced by pac cassette in the wild type parental strain S2 (done by Whitman's group at the University of Georgia). Four samples of each strain were grown in batch culture. Differences in transcriptional expression between S40 and S2 were measured using cDNA arrays, with flip dye experiments for each biological replicate. Keywords: mutant, archaea, carbon, hydrogenase, methanogen
