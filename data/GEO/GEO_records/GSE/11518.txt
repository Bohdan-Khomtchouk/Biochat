TITLE
Wild type H37Rv vs htpX deletion mutant

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
We compared global transcription in the wild type strain and a htpX (Rv0563) mutant strain. 3 seperate experiments (replicates) were performed.

DESIGN
Cultures were grown in 7H9 media until mid log phase (OD600 0.5). RNA was harvested using the Trizol method. TIGR protocols for cDNA synthesis, cy dye labeling and hybridisation were followed closely.
