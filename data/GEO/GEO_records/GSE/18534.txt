TITLE
Mouse small cell lung cancer model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A mouse model for human small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) has been developed based on evidence in human tumors that the tumor suppressor functions of RB and p53 are defective in more than 90% of SCLC cases. We also developed another mouse model also combines loss of p130 (Rbl2), an RB-related gene, with deletion of RB and p53. These two mouse tumors were shown to closely resemble human SCLC.
