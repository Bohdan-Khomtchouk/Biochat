TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Rai1 binding sites in mouse cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By generating knockin mice with an epitope tag on the C terminus of endogenous Rai1, we were able to perform in vivo ChIP-seq. Rai1 peaks co-localize with H3K4me3, Pol2, and Zfx peaks. Our data suggest that Rai1 is a transcription factor that interacts with chromatin, specifically in the promoter and enhancer regions.
