TITLE
microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling of A549 with H5N1 Influenza A Virus (hm/06)infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study miRNA expression profiles during highly pathogenic avian influenza  virus infection, we conducted global miRNA expression profiling in human lung epithelial cells (A549) with or without H5N1 IAV infection. .

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from uninfected and hm/06-infected A549 cells.The involved labelling, hybridization, scanning, normalization, and data analysis steps were performed with Exiqon miRNA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL19221 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, v.11.0 - hsa, mmu & rno [human]
