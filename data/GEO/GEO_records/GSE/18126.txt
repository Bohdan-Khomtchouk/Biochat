TITLE
Methylation status in AG- and PG-derived cells and sperm

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genomic imprinting describes the expression of a subset of mammalian genes from one parental chromosome. The parent-of-origin specific expression of imprinted genes relies on DNA methylation of CpG-dinucleotides at differentially methylated regions (DMRs) during gametogenesis. We identified the paternally methylated DMRs at mouse chromosome 1 near the imprinted Zdbf2 gene using a methylated-DNA immunoprecipitation-on-chip (meDIP-on-chip) method applied to DNA from parthenogenetic (PG)- and androgenetic (AG)-derived cells and sperm.

DESIGN
To identify novel DMRs, genome-wide methylation analysis of three samples were performed using MeDIP and whole genome tiling array.
