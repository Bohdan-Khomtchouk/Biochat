TITLE
microRNA analysis of infantile hemangioma, lymphatic malformation, and skin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Surgical specimens from children with infantile hemangioma or lymphatic malformations, as well as healthy appearing adjacent skin, were analyzed by microarray analysis of microRNA expression. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed to identify microRNAs that were differentially expressed in IH compared to lymphatic malformations and skin

DESIGN
19 patients who underwent surgical excision of either a lymphatic malformation or infantile hemangioma were used in the study. 5 patients have multiple samples on the array and these duplicates are from different regions of the excised tissue or separate lesions as indicated. Tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for RNA extraction
