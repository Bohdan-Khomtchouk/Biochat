TITLE
Gene expression profiles of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line HNE2 following TP53 overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent studies have revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in all steps of cancer initiation and progression by regulating protein coding genes at the epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. LncRNAs are in turn regulated by other genes, forming a complex regulatory network. The regulation networks between the p53 tumor suppressor and lncRNAs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory roles of the TP53 gene in regulating lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in NPC cell line HNE2.

DESIGN
p53 induced gene expression in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line HNE2 was measured at 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours after transfected by pCMV-p53 plasmid.
