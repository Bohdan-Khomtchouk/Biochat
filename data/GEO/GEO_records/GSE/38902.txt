TITLE
leaf transcriptome comparison between wt and urt1 (salk_087647) -Transcriptome comparison between WT and a mutant impaired in RNA uridylation.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs11-10_urt1 - leaf transcriptome comparison between wt and urt1 (salk_087647)  - Identification of mRNA targets of the terminal uridylyltransferase URT1 (AT2G45620) in Arabidopsis thaliana. - Identification of the RNA targets of the terminal uridylyl transferase URT1 (AT2G45620). Mature rosettte leaf transcriptomes were compared between WT and a urt1 knock-out mutant (SALK_087647).

DESIGN
3 dye-swap - gene knock out

PLATFORM
GPL15719 INRA-CNRS-UEVE Arabidopsis thaliana 73K CATMAv6-HD12 [100701_Athal_CATMA6_SB_exp]
