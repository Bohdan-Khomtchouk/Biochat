TITLE
Global gene-expression profiles analysis of iPSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene-expression profiles analysis of hESCs, patient-specific iPSCs, gene-corrected iPSCs, and patient fibroblast cells.

DESIGN
Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Inc.) was used for microarray hybridizations to examine the global gene expression of hES cells, piPS7 cells, ciPS5 cells and patient fibroblast cells. Briefly, total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized and amplified with WT cDNA Synthesis and Amplification Kit (Affymetrix, Inc.), labeled with biotin using WT Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix, Inc.), hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 Array and analyzed by GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G3000 (Affymetrix, Inc.). All samples were prepared in three biological repeats. Data were analyzed using GCOS 1.4 software provided by Affymetrix.
