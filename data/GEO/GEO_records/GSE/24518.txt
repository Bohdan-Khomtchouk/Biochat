TITLE
Co-activation of GR and NF-kB leads to extensive rearrangemnet of their binding sites and target genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global identification of activated GR and p65 binding sites and target genes using ChIP-seq in HeLa B2 cells.

DESIGN
generation genome-wide chromatin state-maps of GR, p65 and RNAPII in HeLa B2 cells under conditions 1) DMSO  (control); 2) TA 1µM 4hr; 3) TNFα 10ng/ml ; 4) TA 1µM 4hr at at third hour 10ng/ml TNF α  was added

PLATFORM
