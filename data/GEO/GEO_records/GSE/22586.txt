TITLE
The forced loss of Epstein Barr virus from Burkitt's lymphoma cells: uncomplemented cells vs BART miRNA complemented cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Burkitt lymphoma cells engineered to inducibly express dominant negative EBNA1 (dnEBNA1), which forces the loss of Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Profiles are made of cells in which all of EBV is lost (dnEBNA1 on) or all of EBV except the BART miRNAs is lost (dnEBNA1 on, BART miRNAs ectopically expressed).

DESIGN
This is a 2-condition experiment: uncomplemented cells (EBV evicted with dnEBNA1), and BART-complemented cells (EBV evicted with dnEBNA1, BART miRNAs expressed ectopically). There are 3 biological replicates for each condition.
