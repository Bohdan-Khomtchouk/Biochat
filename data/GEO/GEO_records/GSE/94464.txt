TITLE
Gene expression of  thyroid cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: The primary goal of this study was to identify gene-expression profiles of  anaplastic thyroid cancer and  to identify some novel in-frame gene fusions that could result in translated protein products affecting the development of  anaplastic thyroid cancer. Methods: RNAseq Data was processed with TCGA UNC V2 RNAseq protocol and different expressed genes were identify by using DESeq2, limma-voom, and edgeR. Potential fusion genes were identified by using SOAPfuse, Chimerascan and TopHat-Fusion. Potential fusion genes were confirmed by cDNA PCR and Sanger sequencing. Results: A total of 21 fusion genes were detected, including six predicted in-frame fusions; none were recurrent. Global gene expression analysis showed 661 genes to be differentially expressed between anaplastic thyroid cancer and papillary thyroid cancer cell lines, with pathway enrichment analyses showing downregulation of TP53-signaling as well as cell adhesion molecules in anaplastic thyroid cancer . Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines and found several novel in-frame gene fusions that could result in translated protein products affecting the development of anaplastic thyroid cancer. These data provide novel insights into the tumorigenesis of  anaplastic thyroid cancer and may be used to identify new therapeutic targets.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines and papillary thyroid cancer cell lines were generated by deep sequencing by using Illumina HiSeq2000 platform.
