TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles between erf5/6 and WT Arabidopsis in response to chitooctaose

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcription factors ERF5 and ERF6 may play a regulatory role in regulating the expression of chitin-responsive genes. We compared the gene expression profiles between the double mutant erf5/6 and WT plants in response to chitooctaose using the Affymetrix Arabidopsis Whole Genome Arrays.

DESIGN
Both the double mutant erf5/6 and WT plants were grown in liquid MS medium in a growth chamber with constant light. Two-week-old seedlings were treated with chitooctaose at a final concentration of 1 uM for 30 minutes. The controls were similarly treated with an equivalent amount of ddH2O. The treated seedlings were harvested for RNA isolation. Three biological replicates were conducted for the experiment.
