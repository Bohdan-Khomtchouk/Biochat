TITLE
Expression data from Sinorhizobium meliloti strains Rm8530 and Rm8530 mucR.

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to analyze the effects of the disruption of mucR in planktonic S. meliloti strain Rm8530.

DESIGN
S. meliloti were grown in minimal low-phosphate media to OD600 = 1.2 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
