TITLE
atnar2.1-1-Atnar2.1-1 response to transfer on low nitrate condition

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra05-12_nar2 - atnar2.1-1 - Does the ko of AtNAR2.1 leads to a differential expression in comparison to the WT when grown under high nitrate condition and transfered onto low nitrate concentration? - Plants were grown for 41 days in hydroponics in media containing 6 mM nitrate and then transferred to 6 or 0.2 mM nitrate media for 24h ( short days, irradiation 150 uE). Plants were harvested on day 42 during the first 2 hours of light. Keywords: dose response,gene knock out
