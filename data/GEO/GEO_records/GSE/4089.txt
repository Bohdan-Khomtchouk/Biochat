DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-dC-treated prostate cancer cell lines

SUMMARY
This microarray dataset accompanies the publication by Kim et al, " The retinoic acid synthesis gene ALDH1a2 is a candidate tumor suppressor in prostate cancer " .  The dataset comprises four prostate cancer cell lines treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-dC.  For each cell line, gene expression in treated (channel 2; Cy5) and untreated (channel 1; Cy3) cells is directly compared by hybridization to the same DNA microarray.  Further details on the treatment conditions are provided in the manuscript. A compound treatment design type is where the response to administration of a compound or chemical (including biological compounds such as hormones) is assayed. Keywords: compound_treatment_design
