TITLE
FRUM and EcR-regulated expression during Drosophila development

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In Drosophila, male-specific FRU (FRUM) is required to establish the potential for courtship behaviors, but the downstream effectors of FRUM during development are largely unknown.  A microarray-based approach identified genes that are differentially expressed as a consequence of FRUM in pupae, in both whole body and CNS tissues.  Genes were also identified that are sex-differentially expressed in CNS tissues. The FRUM-regulated sets were significantly overrepresented with genes also regulated by the ecdysone regulatory pathway. Two EcR isoforms (EcRA and EcRB1) are expressed in FRUM-expressing neurons during distinct periods of metamorphosis.  Males with abrogated EcRA function in FRUM-expressing neurons aggressively court other males.  Transcriptional profiles of mutants with abrogated EcRA function in the fru circuit demonstrate that EcR and FRUM regulate common gene sets, including the early gene broad.  These results demonstrate a novel role for EcR in specifying male courtship behavior through its actions specifically in the FRUM neural circuitry.
