TITLE
Histone Deacetylase 3 is an Epigenomic Brake in Macrophage Alternative Activation (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the genomic regions enriched in Histone Deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in mouse bone marrow derived macrophages.  Furthermore, we also report the genomic acetylation pattern on Histone 3, Lysine 9 (H3K9) in macrophages with and without HDAC3 and/or treated with Th2 cytokine IL-4.

DESIGN
HDAC3 enriched genomic regions in mouse bone marrow dervied macrophages and H3K9Ac enriched genomic regions in wild-type macrophages and macrophages treated with IL-4 and/or deficient in HDAC3.

PLATFORM
