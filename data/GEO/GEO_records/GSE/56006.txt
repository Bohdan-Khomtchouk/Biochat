TITLE
Expression data from control, E2f TKO, Myc KO and E2f/Myc QKO crypts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Combined ablation of Myc and E2f1-3 results in disruption of crypt-villus integrity in the small intestine due to a S-G2 cell cycle blockade. We used Affymetrix microarrays to profile the global gene expression changes caused by loss of Myc and/or E2f1-3.

DESIGN
Myc and/or E2f1-3 were conditionally ablated in the small intestine of mice and crypts were harvested 2 days after. Total RNA was isolated from control, E2f TKO, Myc KO and E2f/Myc QKO groups and profiled.
