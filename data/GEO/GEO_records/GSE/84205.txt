TITLE
mTOR and HDAC inhibitors converge on the TXNIP/thioredoxin pathway to cause catastrophic oxidative stress and regression of RAS-driven tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mTOR and HDAC inhibitors induce cell death of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) in vitro, and in vivo We performed microarray analysis of mTOR and HDAC inhibition alone and in combination 24 hours after treatment, prior to induction of cell death, to identify transcriptional changes that might be mechanistic drivers of the therapeutic efficacy

DESIGN
12 samples, in triplicate, 3X vehicle, 3X INK-128, 3X Vorinostat, 3X INK-128 + Vorinostat

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
