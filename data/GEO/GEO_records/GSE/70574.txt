TITLE
microRNA profiles for lymph node metastasis in T1-stage colorectal cancers.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
If we can more accurately predict the likelihood of regional lymph node metastasis (LNM) for endoscopically resected T1-stage colorectal cancers (CRC), the number of unnecessary additional surgeries can be reduced. We aimed of identify miRNA markers that can predict LNM-positive tumors among T1-stage CRCs and we also developed a miRNA classifier set for facilitating the accuracy and applicability.

DESIGN
Tumor cell rich areas ( > 70% of tumor cells) were selected and microdissected under a microscope. Total RNA was extracted using the RecoverAllâ„¢ Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit for FFPE. Then, we examined global miRNA expression profiles from 16 T1-stage CRCs (7 LNM-positive and 9 LNM- negative tumors) using miRNA-array analysis.
