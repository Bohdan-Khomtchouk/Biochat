TITLE
Characterization of Mouse Otic Sensory Lineage Specific Genes via Embryo-wide Comparative Profiling and Expression Pattern Assessment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E10.5 mouse embryos were dissected into three tissue groups, consiting of: 20 pooled otic vesicles (Ovs), periotic tissues, and whole embryos with the otic regions removed. N=3 for each grouip

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from dissected mouse tissues
