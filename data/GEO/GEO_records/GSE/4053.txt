TITLE
ORNL 5wk Hr(n)/+ mice skin array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This array is spotted in house in order to survey the interested genes expressed mainly in skin with the selection of the clones from Research Genetics. Keywords: Genetic Mutant

DESIGN
5 week-old heterozygous Hr(n) mutant mice vs wild-type mice was used in the microarray. Four biological replicates were included from the same litter. Dye swapping was done to control dye-specific errors. The data was analyzed with ImaGene and GeneSight from BioDiscovery.

PLATFORM
