TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of heart regeneration in adult zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
After heart injury, adult zebrafish can perfectly regenerate its heart without any scar tissue left. We performed 100bp*2, paired-end, strand-specific, polyA-positive RNA-seq on hearts from 2 group of adult zebrafish, in which one was sham group and the other 7 days after heart tip amputation (7dpa). We found pathways involving hydrogen peroxidate related functions significantly up-regulated in 7dpa group, indicating its role in heart regeneration.

DESIGN
RNA-seq: hearts from sham or 7dpa adult zebrafish
