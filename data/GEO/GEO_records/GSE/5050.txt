Regulation of 22q11 orthologous genes during mouse development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
22q11-deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a developmental anomaly caused by a microdeletion on human chromosome 22q11. Although mouse models indicated Tbx1 as the gene responsible of the syndrome, the phenotypic spectrum of del22q11 patients is complex suggesting that gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, probably during embryonic development, are crucial in delineating the pathogenesis of 22q11DS. In order to define cis-acting regulatory effects of 22q11Ds haploinsufficiency during development we analysed the expression pattern of MM16 mouse genes, that is the syntenic region to 22q11, in RNA from total embryos at different stages (from 4.5 dpc to 14.5 dpc; corresponding to pharyngeal development) by a low density microarray (22q11DS-chip). Keywords: time-course
