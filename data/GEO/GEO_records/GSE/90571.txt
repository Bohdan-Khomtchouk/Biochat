TITLE
Identification of genes regulated by Rb in wild-type and SREBP1 KO MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine the expressions of Rb regulated genes in wild-type and SREBP1 KO MEFs, we performed DNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
mRNA levels in wild-type and SREBP1 KO MEFs, which were infected with lentivirus expressing Non-target shRNA, or Rb shRNA and cultured with 1%FBS containing media for 24 hours, were analyzed by DNA microarray anaysis.
