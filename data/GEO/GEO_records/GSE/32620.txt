TITLE
Human keratinocytes stimulated with IL-17C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IL-17C is important for the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as IBD and psoriasis. We found that IL-17C is highly induced in a murine model of psoriasis. Recent results suggest that IL-17C can target epithelial cells that express both IL-17RA and IL-17RE receptor chains. Here we identify genes induced in response to IL-17C treatment of human keratinocytes to provide the tools for dissection of the IL-17C signaling pathway.

DESIGN
Human keratinocytes, HEKn, were incubated in the absence (n = 3) and presence (n = 5) of 500 ng/ml recombinant human IL-17C for 3 and 24 hours. Whole RNA was isolated via RNeasy kit (Qiagen).
