TITLE
Expression data from human hematopoietic stem and progenitor compartments from patients with acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied a novel approach of parallel transcriptional analysis of multiple, highly fractionated stem and progenitor populations from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a normal karyotype. We isolated phenotypic long-term HSC (LT-HSC), short-term HSC (ST-HSC), and committed granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP) from individual patients, and measured gene expression profiles of each population, and in comparison to their phenotypic counterparts from age-matched healthy controls.

DESIGN
Bone marrow samples from AML patients with normal karyotype and age-matched healthy controls were used in this study. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor compartments were purified by multiparameter-high speed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from CD34+ enriched bone marrow to isolate LT-HSC (Lin-/CD34+/CD38-/CD90+), ST-HSC (Lin-/CD34+/CD38-/CD90-), and GMP (Lin-/CD34+/CD38+/CD123+/CD45R+).
