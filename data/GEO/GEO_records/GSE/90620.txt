TITLE
Carbon sources tune antibiotic susceptibility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa via TCA cycle control

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1

SUMMARY
This study examines the mechanisms underlying fumarate- and glyoxylate-mediated changes in tobraymcyin sensitivity in PAO1 cells Grant ID: NIH Grant K99 GM 118907 Grant title: Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility Funding Source: NIH NIGMS Name: Jason Yang

DESIGN
Stationary phase PAO1 cells were resuspended in M9 supplemented with 15 mM fumarate, 30 mM glyoxylate, or their combination. Cells were incubated for 1 hr at 37C with shaking and then harvested for RNA extraction.
