TITLE
Contribution of unique genes by individual cell lines to Universal Human Reference RNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA isolated from 10 individual human cell lines were reverse-transcribed to cDNA, labeled with Cy5 and co-hybridized with Cy3-labeled UHRR onto 43,000-spot cDNA microarrays (Stanford University). The data was analyzed using GeneTraffic software. Approximately 6000-8000 spots out of 43,000 (14-18 %) were flagged on each microarray and excluded from further analysis. Spots with hybridization signals in Cy5 channel higher than 1000 and with Cy5/Cy3 ratio greater than 2 were collected and the number of spots with these characteristics in only one cell line was determined. A reference experiment design type is where all samples are compared to a common reference. Keywords: reference_design
