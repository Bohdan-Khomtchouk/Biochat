TITLE
Epigenetic regulation of miRNA in CLL [MCIp_hsa_miRNA_v3b]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation 35 kb upstream and 5 kb downstream of  microRNAs in 24 CLL patients and B cells of 2 healthy donors versus a pool of 10 healthy donors.

DESIGN
26 samples total (24 CLL B cell samples and 2 healthy donor B cell samples) were hybridized against a pool of 10 healthy donor B cell samples.
