TITLE
Transcriptional Profiling of Human Placentas from Pregnancies Complicated by Preeclampsia Reveals Disregulation of Sialic Acid Acetylesterase and Immune Signaling Pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The placenta plays an important role as a regulator of fetal nutrition and growth throughout development and placental factors contribute to gestational abnormalities such as preeclampsia. This study describes the genome-wide gene expression profiles of a large (n=60) set of human placentas in order to uncover gene expression patterns associated with preeclampsia.  In addition to confirming changes in expression of soluble factors associated with preeclampsia such as sFLT1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1), sENG (soluble endoglin), and INHA (inhibin alpha), we also find changes in immune-associated signaling pathways, offering a potential upstream explanation for the shallow trophoblast invasion and inadequate uterine remodeling typically observed in pathogenesis of preeclampsia.  Notably, we also find evidence of preeclampsia-associated placental upregulation of sialic acid acetylesterase (SIAE), a gene functionally associated with autoimmune diseases.

DESIGN
23 preeclamptic, and 37 control placentas included in this study were collected during the years of 2004-2008 and hybridized in two batches to microarrays.  Samples were randomized across arrays to control for array and batch variability.
