ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An International Multi-Center Study to Define the Clinical Utility of Microarrayâ€“Based Gene Expression Profiling in the Diagnosis and Sub-classification of Leukemia (MILE Study) Established in 2005, the MILE (Microarray Innovations in LEukemia) study research program included 11 participating centers in three continents. This cohort of n=2,096 samples represents data on the retrospective whole-genome analysis phase. This dataset is part of the MILE Study (Microarray Innovations In LEukemia) program, headed by the European Leukemia Network (ELN) and sponsored by Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.

DESIGN
2096 blood or bone marrow samples of acute and chronic leukemia patients were hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips.
