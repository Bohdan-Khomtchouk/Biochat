TITLE
Wound-induced gene expression changes in Populus: 1 week; clone RM5

ORGANISM
Populus fremontii x Populus angustifolia

SUMMARY
Gene expression response of Populus plants subjected to leaf wounding was analyzed using the Affymetrix poplar genome microarrays. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Populus fremontii x angustifolia genotypes were grown hydroponically.  Wounding treatment was applied by pinching leaves at Leaf Plastchron Index (LPI) 8-12 with pliers at a rate of 10 1-inch wounds per leaf.  Young (LPI 0 and LPI 1) and mature leaves (LPI 5) were sampled 1 week after the treatment.  Two biological replicates were obtained for each condition.
