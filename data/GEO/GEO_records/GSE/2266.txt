TITLE
Identification of neural genes using Xenopus DNA microarrays

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
In order to isolate novel genes regulating neural induction, we utilized a DNA microarray approach.  As neural induction is thought to occur via the inhibition of BMP signaling, BMP signaling was inhibited in ectodermal cells by overexpression of a dominant-negative receptor. RNAs were isolated from control animal cap explants and from dominant-negative BMP receptor expressing animal caps and subjected to a microarray experiment using newly generated high-density Xenopus DNA microarray chips. Keywords = neural induction Keywords = BMP Keywords = nervous system Keywords = Xenopus Keywords = microarray Keywords: parallel sample
