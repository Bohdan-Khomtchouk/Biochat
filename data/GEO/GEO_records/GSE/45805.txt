TITLE
Mannose receptor-induced T cell tolerance via interaction with CD45 and up-regulation of CTLA-4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The MR is an endocytic receptor, which plays an important role in serum homeostasis and antigen presentation. In this study, we firstly describe an important role of the MR as a direct regulator of CD8+ T cell activity. We could demonstrate that the presence of the MR on DCs impaired the cytotoxicity of activated CD8+ T cells both in vitro and in vivo. This regulatory effect was mediated by a direct interaction of the MR with CD45 on the T cells surface, which abolished CD45 activity. MR-mediated suppression of CD45 resulted in the up-regulation of the inhibitory molecule CTLA-4, which in turn was responsible for the reduced T cell activity. MR-mediated inactivation of CD45, up-regulation of CTLA-4 and T cell inactivation could be circumvented by increased signaling via CD28, which was achieved by DC maturation. These implications point out an important role of the MR in maintaining the balance between tolerance and immunity and might have pivotal implications for the development of vaccination strategies aimed at dampening adaptive immunity.

DESIGN
DesTCR T cells were incubated with MR-deficient DCs in the presence of FcMR or isotype controls for the indicated time points. Afterwards, CD8+ T cells were isolated by cell sorting (FACSAria), and immediately lysed in Trizol (Invitrogen) before storage at -80Â°C for RNA isolation.
