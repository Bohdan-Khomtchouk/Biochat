TITLE
SINGLET OXYGEN RESISTANT 1 links reactive electrophile signaling to singlet oxygen acclimation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
To identify components involved in the signal transduction and activation of the singlet oxygen-mediated response, a mutant selection was performed. This led to the isolation of the singlet oxygen resistant 1 (sor1) mutant, which is more tolerant to singlet oxygen-producing chemicals and shows a constitutively higher expression of GPXH and GSTS1. Map-based cloning revealed that the SOR1 gene encodes a novel bZIP transcription factor, which seems to control its own expression as well as that of a large number of oxidative stress response and detoxification genes. In the promoter region of many of these genes a highly conserved 8-bp palindromic sequence element was found to be enriched. This element was shown to be essential for GSTS1 overexpression in sor1 and for induction by increased levels of lipophilic reactive electrophile species (RES) suggesting that it functions as an electrophile response element (ERE). RES can be formed after singlet oxygen-induced lipid peroxidation, indicating that a RES-stimulated and SOR1-mediated response of detoxification genes is part of the singlet oxygen-induced acclimation process in C. reinhardtii.
