TITLE
Gene expression data from compstatin treated E.coli-Induced primate sepsis model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Severe sepsis leads to massive activation of coagulation and complement cascades that could contribute to multiple organ failure (MOF) and death. To investigate the role of the complement and its crosstalk with the hemostatic system in the pathophysiology and therapeutics of sepsis, we have used a potent inhibitor (compstatin) administered early or late post E. coli challenge in a baboon model of sepsis-induced MOF. Microarray was used to study the affect of complement pathway on global gene expression pattern in sepsis, aims on exploring and discovering the new target genes as potential drugs for the early treatment and prevention of sepsis.
