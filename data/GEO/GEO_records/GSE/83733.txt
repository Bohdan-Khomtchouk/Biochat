TITLE
Identification of the molecular targets of Orm1 in regenerating mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the molecular targets of orosomucoid (Orm1) during liver regeneration, GeneChip analysis was performed at 48 h after partial hepatectomy (PH) in regenerating mouse liver treated with siControl or siOrm. A total of 180 differentially expressed genes in Orm1 konckdown mouse liver by comparing with siControl were identified with a fold change more than 2. Then, pathway analysis performed on the altered gene expression profiles using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) program revealed that cell cycle, Toll-like receptor and TGF-beta receptor signaling pathways were under control of Orm1 in regenerating mouse livers.

DESIGN
Three days post In vivo knockdown of Orm1 with its siRNA administered to mice using Invivofectamine 3.0 by a single injection, 40% PH was perfomred and gene expression prolifes of regenerating mouse livers at 48 h after PH was measued using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array.
