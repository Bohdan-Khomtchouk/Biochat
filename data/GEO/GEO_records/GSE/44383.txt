TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis by TEAD4 knockdown in a gastric cancer cell line SNU216

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To access oncogenic roles of TEAD4 in gastric cancer, TEAD4-regulated genes were investigated using a SNU216 cell line in which TEAD4 expression was knockdown by shRNA.

DESIGN
To compare control to TEAD4 knockdown cell, total RNA was extracted from two cell lines generated by non-silencing shRNA control and TEAD4 knockdown.
