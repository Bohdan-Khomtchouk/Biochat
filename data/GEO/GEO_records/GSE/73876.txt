TITLE
Effect of mutant p53 R282W on miRNA expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The H1299 cells stably transfected with mutp53 R282W or the control vector were respectively analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 4.0 microarray with three biological replications. The labeled RNA was consequently hybridized for sixteen hours to an Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA array according to the product manual. Microarrays were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450, and scanned on the Affymetrix G3000 GeneArray Scanner.

DESIGN
Controlled experiments with 3 repeats for each condition.

PLATFORM
