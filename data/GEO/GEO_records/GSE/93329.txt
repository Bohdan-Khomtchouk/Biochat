TITLE
Expression data from BEAS-2B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BEAS-2B cells are human bronchial epithelial cells, and often used as a in vitro model for the detection of potential pulmonary toxicity of chemicals. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes after treated with chemical substance

DESIGN
BEAS-2B cells were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We tested the expression data of BEAB-2B cells treated with PM2.5 suspended in DMEM or DMEM only as normal control.

PLATFORM
GPL17586 [HTA-2_0] Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 [transcript (gene) version]
