TITLE
Poly(A)-ClickSeq resolves CF25-mediated alternative poly-adenylation, HeLa

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Poly(A)-ClickSeq is a new methodology for the sequencing of the 3'UTR/poly(A) tail junction of RNA. We analysed both wild-type and CF25Im knock-down HeLa cells in culture using Poly(A)-ClickSeq to find the distribution of poly(A) sites in these samples and determine the role of CF25Im in poly(A) site selection (alternative poly-adenylation, APA).

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from HeLa cells with or without CF25Im Knock-down, each in triplicates, and sequenced using Poly(A)-ClickSeq and sequencing once on a HiSeq and once on a MiSeq
