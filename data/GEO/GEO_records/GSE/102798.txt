TITLE
RNA-seq Analysis of the effect of Tfcp2l1 knockdown on Human ESC maintenace

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose:The goal of this study is to analyze the candidate genes motified byTfcp2l1 knockdown to regulated the human embryonic stem cell (ESC) fate through RNA-seq approach.

DESIGN
HES2 human ESCs infected with scramble or Tfcp2l1 knockdown lentivirus were cultured in 10%KSR basal media supplemented with 10 ng/ml FGF2 and 10 ng/ml Activin A  for three passages and then were collected by using Trizol. These samples were sent to BGI (China) company to do deep sequencing by using BGISEQ-500.

PLATFORM
GPL23227 BGISEQ-500 (Homo sapiens)
