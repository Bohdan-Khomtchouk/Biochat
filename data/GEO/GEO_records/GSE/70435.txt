TITLE
RNAseq measurments of gene expression during simultanous replication and mitosis using the S. Pombe minimal cell cycle strain

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Cell cycle arrested G1 cells were exposed to high Cdk1 activity, so undergo replication and mitosis at the same time.

DESIGN
Samples were collected at the indicated time points (0, 20, 40) from released (R) vs. Arrested (A) cells.

PLATFORM
GPL13988 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe)
