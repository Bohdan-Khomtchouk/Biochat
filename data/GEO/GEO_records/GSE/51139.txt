TITLE
Transcription profile of FBL-knock down ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pluripotent stem cells have been shown to have unique nuclear properties, e.g., hyperdynamic chromatin and large, condensed nucleoli. However, the contribution of the latter unique nucleolar character to pluripotency has not been well understood. Here, we show fibrillarin (FBL), a critical methyltransferase for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing in nucleoli, as one of the proteins highly expressed in pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells. Stable expression of FBL in ES cells prolonged the pluripotent state of mouse ES cells cultured in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Analyses using deletion mutants and a point mutant revealed that the methyltransferase activity of FBL regulates stem cell pluripotency. Knock down of this gene led to significant delays in rRNA processing, growth inhibition, and apoptosis in mouse ES cells. Interestingly, both partial knock down of FBL and treatment with actinomycin D, an inhibitor for rRNA synthesis, induced the expression of differentiation markers in the presence of LIF and promoted stem cell differentiation into neuronal lineages. Moreover, we identified p53 signaling as the regulatory pathway for pluripotency and differentiation of ES cells. These results suggest that proper activity of rRNA production in nucleoli is a novel factor for the regulation of pluripotency and differentiation ability of ES cells.

DESIGN
Tc-inducible FBL-knock down ES cells were cultured for 2 days with or without Tc in the presence of LIF. These 2 conditions were analysed transcription profile.
