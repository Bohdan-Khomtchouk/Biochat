TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of rescue of Tfr-mediated B cell suppression with IL-21

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tfh and B cells were cultured together with or without Tfr cells and IL-21.  After 4 days Tfh and B cells were sorted and prepared for 3' targeted RNA-seq.

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptional changes upon IL-21 rescue of B cell suppression

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
