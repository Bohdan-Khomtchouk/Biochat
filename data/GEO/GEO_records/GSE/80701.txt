TITLE
Distinct Enhancer Classes in Drosophila Bind Different Architectural Proteins and Mediate Unique Chromatin Interactions and 3D Architecture [Hi-C]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In this study, we further characterized the hkCP and dCP enhancers, which were identified by STARR-seq, and shown to have an intrinsic capacity to interact with a specific type of core promoter depending on the presence of a DRE motif [9]. hkCP enhancers are marked by H3K4me3, associated with TAD borders, and mediate large TSS-clustered interactions to promote robust transcription. Furthermore, they contain the architectural proteins CAP-H2, Chromator, DREF and Z4. In contrast, dCP enhancers are marked by H3K4me1, associated with chromatin loop anchors and are more commonly associated with single TSS-contacts. dCP enhancers are depleted of the hkCP-specific architectural proteins and show an enrichment for Fs(1)h-L and Rad21 instead. Thus, our data supports the model that the unique occupancy of architectural proteins in the distinct enhancer classes are key contributors to the types of interactions that enhancers can mediate genome-wide, ultimately affecting enhancer-promoter specificity.
