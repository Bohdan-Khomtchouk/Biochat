TITLE
Expression profiling of PBMC from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant gene expression analysis between peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from healthy individuals and patients with pancreatic carcinoma, gastric carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were identified using Affymetrix gene arrays.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from healthy individuals, patients with pancreatic carcinoma, gastric carcinoma and HCC were isolated and total RNA was extracted for Affymetrix gene microarray analysis.
