TITLE
Microarray studies of dr2518 knockout mutant vs wild type

ORGANISM
Deinococcus radiodurans

SUMMARY
Bacterial cells lacking pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) were sensitive to gamma radiation as compared to wild type cells. Deinococcus radiodurans genome encode for five putative PQQ binding STK domain-containing proteins. The comparison of gamma radiation response of all five-deletion mutants with wild type suggested that dr2518 mutant was hypersensitive to gamma radiation as compared to wild type and other mutants. DR2518 is an auto kinase. Hence, the effect of dr2518 mutation on cellular response of Deinococcus radiodurans R1, to DNA damage and subsequently to its genome functions under both normal and post irradiation growth condition was further examined. Transcriptome analysis of dr2518 mutant grown under normal conditions and post-irradiated cells was done and compared with wild type cells. Mutant lacking dr2518 become extremely sensitive to gamma radiation and complete arrest in DSB repair. These cells were therefore checked for gene expression profile in native growth and gamma irradiated growth conditions
