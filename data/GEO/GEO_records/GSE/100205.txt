TITLE
Expression analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and parg1 with and without PARP inhibitor (3AB, 3MB), with and without MAMP (flg22, elf18)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of the effects of PARP inhibitor (3AB) and, separately, a parg1 knockout, on early microbe-associate molecular pattern (MAMP)-induced gene expression in the plant basal defense response. Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type (Col-0), 3AB-treated and parg1-2 T-DNA knockout plants responding to the MAMP elicitors flg22 or elf18 were studied. The mutant and PARP inhibitors analyzed in this study are further described in Adams-Phillips, L.,C., Briggs, A.,G., Bent, A., F.  2010. Disruption of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation mechanisms alters responses of Arabidopsis to biotic stress. Planty Physiol. 152(1):267-80 DOI: 10.1104/pp.109.148049.

DESIGN
A 27 chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type extracts of Arabidopsis Col-0 and three separate cultures of a parg1-2 knockout strain, in which a TDNA insertion has knocked out expression of At2g31870, treated for 1 hour with vehicle, flg22, elf28, 3AB, or 3MB.  Each chip measures the expression level of 30,387 genes from Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 with 6 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with two-fold technical redundancy and three-fold biological redundancy.

PLATFORM
GPL23603 NimbleGen Arabidopsis thaliana expression array [2006-08-28_Arabidopsis_60mer_expr]
