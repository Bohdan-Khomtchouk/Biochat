TITLE
mRNA-seq data from embryonic autopods of the common bent-wing bat (Miniopterus schreibersii)

ORGANISM
Miniopterus schreibersii

SUMMARY
The only freely flying mammals, bats, develop a pair of dramatically elongated hands and broad wing membranes. It is hypothesized that alterations of many gene expressions result in the bat wing formation. However, it remains to be proved. Here, by mRNA-seq, we found that hundreds of genes are significantly high expressed in the elongating forelimb digits.

DESIGN
mRNA-seq data of 14 autopod samples from embryonic bats (Miniopterus schreibersii) were obtained by Illumina HiSeq 2000.
