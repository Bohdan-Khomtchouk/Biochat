TITLE
Identification and mode of action of a plant natural product targeting human fungal pathogens

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Candida albicans was subjected to treatment with tomatidine and samples were taken at 2 different time points (1h, 3h). The results show that tomatidine induces genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis as compared to untreated controls.

DESIGN
C. albicans SC5314 strain was exposed to 250 ÂµM tomatidine and total RNA was extracted after 1 h or 3 h tomatidine/solvent exposure.

PLATFORM
