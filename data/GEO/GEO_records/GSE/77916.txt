TITLE
DOT1L inhibition with EPZ-5676 in human articular chondrocytes from 5 non-OA hip fracture patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify DOT1L targets, associated signaling pathways and networks in chondrocytes, we used genome-wide gene expression microarray analysis in human articular chondrocytes of 5 different donors (without known or documented joint disease) treated with EPZ-5676 or vehicle for 4 days. It is known that DOT1L inhibitors require longer time of treatment in order to show effect and influence the expression of MLL target genes in leukemia cells, but we opted for this relatively short inhibition time to be able to identify early changes induced by DOT1L inhibition.

DESIGN
Human articular chondrocytes were obtained from 5 non-OA hip fracture patients. The cells were treated with 3 Î¼M EPZ-5676 or vehicle (DMSO) for 4 days.
