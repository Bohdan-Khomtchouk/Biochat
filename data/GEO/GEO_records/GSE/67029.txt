TITLE
Enrichment of H3K9me2 on unsynapsed chromatin in C. elegans does not target de novo sites [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA isolated from adult hermaphrodite met-2;him-8 and him-8 gonads in order to determine the gene expression profile of germ cells with or without H3K9me2.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA profiles in nematode gonad of met-2;him-8 (without H3K9me2) and him-8 (with H3K9me2)

PLATFORM
GPL13657 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Caenorhabditis elegans)
