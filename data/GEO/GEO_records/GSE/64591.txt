TITLE
Circulating microRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of non-small-cell lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Plasma samples from 100 early stage (I to IIIA) nonâ€“small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and 100 non-cancer controls were screened for 754 circulating microRNAs via qRT-PCR, using TaqMan MicroRNA Arrays. Our objective was to identify a panel of circulating microRNAs in plasma that will contribute to early detection of lung cancer.

DESIGN
Case-control design
