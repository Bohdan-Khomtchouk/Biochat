TITLE
Prevention of Mouse AA with IL-15 pathway inhibitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our goal was to identify gene expression patterns that correlated with prevention of autoimmune alopecia in C3H/HeJ mice following alopecic graft transplantation skin from 3-5 mice were taken at 5/6 weeks and 12/13 weeks of drug administration following grafting; mice were treated with ruxolitinib (jak12i) by oral gavage, tofacitinib (jak3i) by osmotic pump, antiIL15R-beta antibody by i.p. injection, or control pbs by either ip injection, oral gavage, or osmotic pump. sham indicates mice that received no graft.

DESIGN
3-5 biological replicates were taken at each time point for each treatment modality
