TITLE
Genes upregulated by cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) in Polaromonas sp. strain JS666

ORGANISM
Polaromonas sp. JS666

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in cultures of Polaromonas sp. JS666 grown on cDCE compared to the reference substrate glycolate. JS666 is the first organism isolated capable of coupling growth to the aerobic oxidation of the chlorinated solvent, cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE).

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA extracted from cultures of JS666 grown on cDCE or glycolate in triplicate.
