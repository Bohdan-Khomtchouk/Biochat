TITLE
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of post-exercise milk product intake during interval walking training.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of post-exercise milk product intake during interval walking training. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in peripheral blood samples. Samples include 24 subjects (12, placebo intake; 12, milk product intake).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 48 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
