TITLE
Expression profiling of mouse B1a cells with high expression of PC1 vs. those with low expression of PC1.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse peritoneal B1a cells were classified into two groups based upon the expression level of PC1. One is PC1 high group and the other is PC1 low. To evaluate gene expression patterns that distinguished PC1 high expressing B1a cells from PC1 low expressing B1a cells, we used Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Mouse gene 1.0 ST Array.

DESIGN
FACS-sorted PC1 high and low cells from individual mouse were used for RNA extraction and Affyarray hybridization. There were six independent biological replications in each group - six cases of PC1 high cells and six cases of PC1 low cells.
