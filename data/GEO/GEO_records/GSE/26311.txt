TITLE
The stress response factors Yap6, Cin5, Phd1, and Skn7 direct targeting of the conserved co-repressor Tup1-Ssn6

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The budding yeast transcriptional corepressor Tup1-Ssn6 is a model for studying similar repressosome complexes in multicellular eukaryotes. Tup1-Ssn6 does not bind DNA directly, but is directed to individual promoters by one or more DNA-binding proteins, referred to as Tup1 recruiters. We determined the genomic distribution of Tup1 and Ssn6 by ChIP-chip and found that most loci bound by Tup1-Ssn6 could not be explained by co-occupancy with a known recruiting cofactor. Furthermore, we found that individual deletions of known Tup1 recruiters did not significantly alter Tup1 binding profile. These two observations suggest that Tup1 recruitment typically depends on multiple recruiting cofactors, and that new Tup1 recruiting proteins remain to be discovered. To identify new recruiting proteins we computationally screened for factors with binding patterns similar to the observed Tup1-Ssn6 genomic distribution. Four top candidates, Cin5, Skn7, Phd1, and Yap6, all known to be associated with stress response gene regulation, were experimentally confirmed to physically interact with Tup1 and/or Ssn6.  Incorporating these new cofactors with previously characterized cofactors now accounts for the majority of Tup1 binding across the genome, and expands our understanding of the mechanism by which Tup1-Ssn6 is directed to its targets.
