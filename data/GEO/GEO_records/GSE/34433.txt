TITLE
Identification of soybean seed developmental stage specific and tissue specific miRNA targets by degradome sequencing .

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Five degradome libraries were constructed from three different seed developmental stages. Separate degradome libraries were constructed for seed coat and cotyledons to identify the tissue specific miRNAs and their potential targets. Sequencing and analysis of degradome libraries gives identification of 183 different targets for 80 known soybean miRNAs. We found 30 cotyledon specific, 18 seed coat specific and 32 miRNAs found in both tissues irrespective of the developmental stages. One interesting observation is that we found more miRNA targets in late seed developmental stages than earlier stages.  Additionally, we have validated four different auxin response factor genes as targets for gma-miR160 via RNA ligase mediated 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-5′RACE). GO analysis indicated the enrichment of miRNA target genes in seed development.
