TITLE
Expression data from murine colon tissue after exposure to 4% DSS for 6 days DSS followed by 4 days of water or 1% L-arginine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
L-Arginine (L-Arg) is the substrate for both inducible nitric oxide synthase and arginase, which are upregulated in human IBD and in mouse colitis models. We have found that L-Arg supplementation enhances wound restitution in vitro, and improves the clinical parameters of weight loss, survival, and colon weight/length, in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced murine colitis. Our aim was to further identify the potential mechanisms underlying the clinical benefit of L-Arg supplementation.

DESIGN
12 Total samples were analyzed, 3 samples from each of 4 groups. We generated the following pairwise comparisons: Ctrl vs Ctrl + L-Arg; Ctrl vs DSS; DSS vs DSS + L-Arg; Ctrl + L-Arg vs DSS, Ctrl + L-Arg vs DSS + L-Arg. Genes with a p-value < 0.01 and a fold-change ≥2 were selected. To identify genes that were altered in response to L-Arg, we performed the following multiple sample comparisons using a p-value < 0.01 and a fold-change ≥2: Ctrl vs DSS vs DSS + L-Arg
