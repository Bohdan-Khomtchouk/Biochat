TITLE
Rapid alteration of microRNA levels by histone deacetylase inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of miRNA expression profiles in SKBr3 breast cancer cells treated with HDAC inhibitor LAQ-824 vs. untreated SKBr3 cells. Keywords: Expression profiling of pharmacological response to HDAC inhibitor

DESIGN
MicroRNA expression was compared between treated/untreated SKBr3 breast cancer cells to examine the effects of the HDAC inhibitor LAQ-824 on miRNA expression. SKBr3 control (untreated breast cancer cell line) SKBr3 treated (breast cancer cell line treated with 20 uM LAQ-824 for 5 hours) Both cell lines were grown to ~70% confluency and harvested for enriched miRNAs using the mirVana miRNA Isolation kit from Ambion per the manufacturers instructions.  Untreated SKBr3 cell miRNA was labeled with Cy3 and treated SKBr3 treated cell miRNA was labeled with Cy5.

PLATFORM
