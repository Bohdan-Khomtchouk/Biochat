TITLE
TCF7L1 knockdown in pancreatic cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNAi mediated depletion of TCF7L1 increases activity of a Wnt-based reporter and imparts more aggressive tumor phenotypes in vitro in pancreatic cancer cell lines that express TCF7L1. We sought to determine what changes in transcription ocurred after RNAi mediated knockdown of TCF7L1 in these cells by RNA-sequencing

DESIGN
12 samples, 4 different conditions with 3 replicates each
