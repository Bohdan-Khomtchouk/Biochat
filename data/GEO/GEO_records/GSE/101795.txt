TITLE
Generation of mouse haploid somatic cells by small molecules for genome-wide genetic screening

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using piggyBac transposon based insertional mutagenesis, we have generated a haploid neural cell library harboring genome-wide mutations for genetic screening, and identified Park2 gene as a proof-of-concept in screening for Mn2+-mediated toxicity.

DESIGN
To identify the trapping sites of piggyBac transposon in a pool of cells, the splinkerette PCR was performed and the PCR products were sequenced with on HiSeq 2500

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
