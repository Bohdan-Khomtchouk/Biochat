TITLE
Transcriptional response of rat cerebrocortical tissue following acute exposure to permethrin or deltamethrin.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Pyrethroids are neurotoxicants that disrupt nervous system function by interacting with a variety of membrane bound ion channels on neuronal plasma membranes.  This study is designed to investigate the transcriptional events downstream of pyrethroid-induced disruption of nervous system excitability.  Adult, male Long-Evans rats were orally dosed in vivo with a single dose of either permethrin (1, 10, or 100 mg/kg) or deltamethrin (0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg) at levels that produce only modest behaviroal effects in the whole animal (Wolansky et al. 2006).  Transcriptional profiles were obtained from frontal cerebrocortical tissue 6 hours after acute exposure.  The primary goals were 1) to identify dose-responsive biomarkers of effect for pyrethroids and 2) identify sensitive intracellular signaling or metabolic pathways sensitive to pyrethroid compounds. Keywords: dose response

DESIGN
In total 60 samples were analyzed in the present study: vehicle control (n = 12), 1 mg/kg permethrin (n=8), 10 mg/kg permethrin (n = 8), 100 mg/kg permethrin (n = 8), 0.3 mg/kg deltamethrin (n = 8), 1 mg/kg deltamethrin (n = 8), 3 mg/kg deltamethrin (n = 8).  Transcriptional profiles for each test subject were obtained independently, without sample pooling. The publication will include an Appendix Table comparing the variability of RMA values (see Sample VALUE columns) to that of GCOS values (see Sample .CHP files).
