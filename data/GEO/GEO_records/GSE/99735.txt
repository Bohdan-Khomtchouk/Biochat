TITLE
Comparing single cell sequences between WT vs. Spp1-/- BM multi-potent progenitor cells (MPP) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
WT vs. Spp1-/- MPPs showed distict patterns in tgene transcription profiles when analyzed with single cell sequencing

DESIGN
MPPs from mice treated with thioglycollate were FACS-sorted, and gene expression profiles were compared between WT vs. Spp1-/- cells.
