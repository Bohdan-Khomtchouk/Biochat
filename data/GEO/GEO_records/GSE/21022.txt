TITLE
FBLN1 and FABP4 are drivers of resistance to fleece rot in Australian Merino sheep

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Ovine skin samples comparing resistant (RES) to susceptible (SUS) animals following fleece rot induction.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, RES vs SUS biopsies, over 3 time points. 31 RES 31 SUS T0: Prior to commencment of treatment T1: 2-3 days post commencment T2: 11 days post commencment The first skin biopsies were taken on the first day (T0) prior to commencement of the five day regime of simulated rainfall. Subsequent skin biopsies were taken 2-3 days into the wetting regime (T1) and following a recovery period of 11 days from the time that the wetting regime had begun (T2).
