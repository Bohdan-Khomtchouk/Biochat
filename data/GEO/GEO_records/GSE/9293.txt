TITLE
Genomic profile of trinitrobencenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) rat colitis is one of the most widely used models of inflammatory bowel disease, a condition whose etiology and pathophysiology are incompletely understood. We have characterized the model at the genomic level following a longitudinal approach. Keywords: Time course and differentially expressed genes analysis

DESIGN
A single enema of 10mg of TNBS in 50% ethanol was administered to rats at day 0. Samples were recovered at days 2, 5, 7 and 14. According to inflammatory markers (myeloperoxidase activity, body weigh loss, colonic weigh/length ratio) we selected three replicates at each time point for the genimoc analysis, and 6 healthy control rats that received a saline enema. RNA was extracted from homogenized full-thickness colonic tissues in Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen) and purified with RNeasy affinity columns (Qiagen), according to manufacturer´s protocol. The microarray analysis was performed by Progenika Biopharma (Bilbao, Spain) on GeneChip® Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array (Affymetrix). All sample labeling (biotin), hybridization, staining and scanning procedures were carried out using Affimetrix, standard protocols (www.affymetrix.com). Normalization was carried out using Bioconductor sofware (affyPLM package).
