TITLE
Pac1+/+ versus Pac1-/- TG-macrophages_LPS 6h

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LPS-stimulated macrophages from Pac1+/+ and Pac1-/- mice were compared to assess gene expression changes in the absence of PAC-1 (also known as Dual specificity phosphatase 2). Keywords: Comparison of Pac1+/+ with Pac1-/- activated macrophages

DESIGN
Age matched Pac1+/+ and Pac1-/- littermates were used to obtain equal numbers of thiolycollate-elicited macrophages. Pure populations of macrophages were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of LPS for 6 hours. 6 hours was chosen to assess mainly inflammatory gene expression.
