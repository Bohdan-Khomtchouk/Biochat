TITLE
Epigenetic analysis of gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of gastric tumors and matched gastric non-malignant samples. The Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across 27,578 CpGs in 203 gastric tumors and  94 matched non-malignant gastric samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite-converted DNA from the 203 gastric tumors and 94 matched gastric non-malignant samples was hybridized to the Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip.
