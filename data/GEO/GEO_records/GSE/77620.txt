TITLE
Heliothis virescens gene expression on gossypol suppelemented diet, larval gut and rest of body

ORGANISM
Heliothis virescens

SUMMARY
The transcriptional response of H. virescens larvae was analyzed after feeding on gossypol supplemented diet, a toxic secondary metabolite produced in cotton plants, to detect potential detoxification enzymes possibly involved in detoxification of gossypol by H. virescens.

DESIGN
A one-color microarray-based gene expression analysis was performed with Cy3 labeled cRNA of gut and rest of the body of H. virescens larvae that fed on 0.32% gossypol and control diet. For each treatment and tissue four biological replicates were used.

PLATFORM
GPL21432 Agilent-035315 Helicoverpa virescens microarray HelioVir-V2 [Probe Name version]
