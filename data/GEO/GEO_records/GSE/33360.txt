TITLE
Discovery of novel microRNAs in rat kidney using microarray analyses

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate a variety of biological processes. In the last version of the miRBase database (Release 17), 720 mouse microRNAs are accompanied by only 408 rat microRNAs.  Given the importance of rat as a model organism, we used next generation sequencing and microarray technologies to discover novel microRNAs in rat kidneys.

DESIGN
Four male, 6-week-old Big Blue rats were treated with 10.0 mg/kg aristolochic acid(AA) 5 times a week for 12 weeks, four untreated rats as control. The animals were sacrificed 1 day after the last treatment and total RNA were isolated.  All eight rat samples were used to deep sequencing analyses (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Microarray Core Facility), while 6 samples (3 AA-treated and 3 control) were used to custom vertebrate microRNA microarray analysis (LC Sciences).  We used the miRanalyzer standalone version for the prediction of novel microRNAs and microRNA microarray to confirm novel microRNAs.
