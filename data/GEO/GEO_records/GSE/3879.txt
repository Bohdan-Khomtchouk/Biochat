TITLE
RNA co-immunoprecipitations with yeast She proteins

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
RNA co-immunoprecipitations with C-terminal protein A-tagged She proteins. One liter of cells were cultured at 30 degrees in YPAD medium and collected during exponential growth by centrifugation.  Cells were washed twice and broken mechanically with glass beads. Extracts were incubated with IgG-agarose beads (Sigma).  The beads were washed four times, and She proteins were released from the beads by cleavage with TEV-protease (Invitrogen).  RNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation from TEV eluates, which corresponds to the purified fraction, and from extracts (input).  Both RNA samples, input and purified, were reverse transcribed and labeled with the fluorescent dyes Cy3 and Cy5 (Amersham), respectively.  The samples were mixed and competitively hybridized to yeast DNA microarrays containing all yeast genes Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
