SUMMARY
A hallmark feature of mature B cell tumors in humans is the occurrence of balanced chromosomal translocations, most often involving immunoglobulin (Ig) genes and a wide range of partner genes. Ig/oncogene translocations also occur in mice. However, they are regularly associated with a specific tumor type only for plasmacytomas (PCT), a neoplasm that features Ig/Myc translocations in over 95% of cases. In addition to the contribution of Myc signaling to mouse B cell lymphomagenesis, to identify any other oncogenic pathway in mouse PCT, expression profiling of mouse PCT was performed.
