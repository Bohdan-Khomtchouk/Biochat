TITLE
Transcriptomic study of breast angiosarcomas induced by radiotherapy using formalin-fixed paraffin (FFPE) embedded tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A transcriptome signature which discriminate efficiently primary and radiation induced breast angiosarcomas can be generated from FFPE tumor samples.FFPE samples are good material to unlock relevant informations from tumors.

DESIGN
The transcriptome of 35 FFPE breast angiosarcomas (10 primary and 25 radiation induced) were analysed using Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays according to the FFPE dedicated protocole from NuGEN and compared to paired fresh frozen samples previously analysed. FF Samples are also available in Array Express as E-MEXP-3252.

PLATFORM
GPL5175 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
