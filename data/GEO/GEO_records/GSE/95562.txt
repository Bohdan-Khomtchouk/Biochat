TITLE
ChIP-seq for Polycomb repressive complex 2 in wild type and mutants in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq for the Polycomb protein FIE using anti-FIE antiserum in germinated wild-type and double class I BPC and C1-2iD transcruption factor family knockdown seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates for each condition and three biological replicate for input
