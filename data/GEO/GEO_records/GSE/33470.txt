TITLE
Expression profiling of sorted human Thymocyte populations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Thymus samples were obtained as surgical tissue discards from 3 pediatric patients (age from 7 days to 6 months) undergoing cardiac surgery at the New York Presbyterian Hospital. RNA was excracted and processed for expression analysis from 7 isolated T-Cell populations.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of 7 T-Cell populations isolated from surgical samples of 3 human thymi
