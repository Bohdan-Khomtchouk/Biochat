TITLE
Myogeneic differentiation in Rb1 or Kdm5a/Jarid1a/Rbp2 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cells lacking Rb1 are deficient in differentiation. Loss of Kdm5a rescues myogenic differentiation, as judged by appearance of morphologically normal myotubes that display expression of late markers of differentiation. In order to better understand how Kdm5a loss rescues differentiation, we induced mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) of different genotypes to undergo myogenic differentiation and analyzed gene expression changes in wild-type, Kdm5a-/-, Rb1-/- and Kdm5a-/-; Rb1-/- cells. Rb1-/- cells stained single nucleated, did not exhibit morphological changes and increased expression of the myogenic marker MYHC. Except for Rb1-/- cells, all other cells were undergoing successful convertion into aligned multinucleated myotubes and were MYHC-positive. We obtained purified populations of myotubes for the wild-type and Kdm5a-/-; Rb1-/- cells.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis of gene expression in Rb1 or Kdm5a deficient MEFs that were induced for myogenic differentiation.
