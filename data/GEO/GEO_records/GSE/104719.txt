TITLE
miRNA expression microarrays in GM-CSF or GM-CSF+IL6-induced mouse MDSC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have emerged as major regulators of immune responses in cancer and other pathological conditions. Multiple factors including cytokines, transcription factors  and multiple signaling pathways are involved in MDSC differentiation. Cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin(IL-6) etc could in vitro mediate development of MDSCs.IL-6 with GM-CSF mediated MDSC not only had stronger suppressive function but also the dynamics of their suppressive function was different from GM-CSF alone mediated MDSCs.To found a new regulatory factor (s) in tumor and inflammatory environments, we compared GM-CSF and IL-6 mediated MDSCs with GM-CSF alone mediated MDSCs using lncRNA microarray, miRNA microarrays and protein-coding mRNA microarrays.

DESIGN
Inflammatory factors associated MDSCs were generated by cultivating bone marrow cells of C57BL/6 mice in petri dishes for 4 days in the presence of 5% FBS medium containing GM-CSF (40 ng/ml) only, GM-CSF (40 ng/ml) plus IL-6 (40 ng/ml) using different processing group for each experiment.
