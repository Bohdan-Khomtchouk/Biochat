TITLE
Circulating U2 small nuclear RNA fragments as a novel diagnostic biomarker for pancreatic and colorectal adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global microRNA expression profiling of serum were collected using Agilent miRNA microarrays (G4471A Human, Amadid 29297, Sanger 14)  carrying 887 individual human miRNA probes. Two different sources of RNA were analyzed: serum from NMRI-nu/nu mice carrying a xenograft tumor derived from human primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (CA, n=6) and serum from tumor free control NMRI-nu/nu mice (N, n=6)

DESIGN
Two condition (CA, N), each condition is represented by 6 biological replicates
