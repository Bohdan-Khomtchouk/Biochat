TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of human whole-blood samples in  in response to dengue disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We looked at the whole-blood transcriptional profiling on dengue patients sampled within 72h of fever presentation and compared the signatures with autologous samples drawn at defervescence and convalescence and to control patients with fever of other etiology. Our data show that the early response in patients mimics those previously only described in vitro and suggests that this innate immune responses may initiate the later adaptive immune responses.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from whole-blood of dengue patients with fever presentation, defervescence and convalescence are compared. Also, dengue patients with fever presentation are compared with control patients which are with fever of other etiology. 119 samples are analysed, which include 31 dengue patients and 26 control patients.
