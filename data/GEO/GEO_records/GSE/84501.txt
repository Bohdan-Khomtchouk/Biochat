TITLE
The gene expression profile of Helicobacter pylori exposed to 0.25μg/ml (2×MIC) Clarithromycin (CLA) stress

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori 26695

SUMMARY
Analysis of Helicobacter pylori strain 26695 after 20 minutes of 0.25μg/ml Clarithromycin. Results provide insight into the mechanisms employed by the bacterium that help it adapt to Clarithromycin stress

DESIGN
In the study presented here, we compared the gene expression profile between H.pylori without CLA treatment and H.pylori treated with 0.25μg/ml Clarithromycin.
