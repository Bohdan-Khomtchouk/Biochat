TITLE
Studying relative gene expression in primary and xenograft CRC samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare the gene expression profile in primary human colorectal cancer samples and samples passaged in mice for two generations

DESIGN
Primary human CRC samples were implanted in mice and allowed to grow for 2 generations. The tumors were then excised and a relative expression profile was evaluated to see similarity/dissimilarity between the two.
