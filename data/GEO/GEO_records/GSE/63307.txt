TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of early and late CD8 memory T cells expressing CD62L

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Memory CD8+ P14 cells were generarted through adoptive transfer and infection with LCMV armstrong. Then, early memory (after 30 - 45 days) and late memory (after 8 months) cells were sort purified based on CD62L expression. Genome-wide expression profiles were captured for early and late memory cells with high and low levels on CD62L using Affymetrics arrays to show their molecular and functional differences.

DESIGN
Replicates of early memory P14 cells that are CD62L-, early memory P14 cells that are CD62L+, late memory P14 cells that are CD62L-, and late memory P14 cells that are CD62L+ were analysed for differentially regulated genes and networks.
