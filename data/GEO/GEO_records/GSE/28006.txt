TITLE
The pioneer factor PBX1 guides a distinct ERa signaling in breast cancer [mRNA profiling]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Effect of PBX1 silencing on global gene expression of MCF7 cells stimulated with estradiol. The hypothesis tested was that PBX1 is essential for estrogen signaling in ERa positive breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from MCF7 cells treated with siRNA directed at PBX1 or an siControl for 72h. Cells were then stimulated with estradiol (E2) for 3h prior to RNA extraction.
