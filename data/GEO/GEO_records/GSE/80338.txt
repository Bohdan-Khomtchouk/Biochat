TITLE
Human glioblastoma-associated microglia/monocytes express a distinct RNA profile compared to human control and murine samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used RNA sequencing to compare the expression profile of 8 CD11b+ human glioblastoma-associated microglia/monocytes (hGAMs) samples to 8 human non-tumor CD11b+ microglia samples. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis showed a clear separation of the two sample groups and we identified 334 significantly regulated genes in hGAMs. In comparison to human control microglia hGAMs up-regulate genes associated with mitotic cell cycle, cell migration, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix organization.

DESIGN
Comparison of the mRNA expression profile of 8 CD11b+ human glioblastoma-associated microglia/monocytes samples and 8 human non-tumor CD11b+ microglia samples (isolated form postmortem and epilepsy tissues).
