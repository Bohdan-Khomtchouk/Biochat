TITLE
Expression profiles of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Until now, it is nearly impossible to diagnose malignancy of peochormocytoma/paraganglioma with pathological examinations. The aim of the study is to find the genes which can be applied as a biomarker in the clinic to distinguish benign and malignant forms of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma.

DESIGN
We generated exprssion profiles of 9 samples of benign tumors, 3 samples of malignant tumors and 3 samples of normal adrenal medulla.
