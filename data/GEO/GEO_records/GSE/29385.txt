TITLE
Influenzavirus serotype association to global whole blood transcriptional changes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Febrile patients PCR positive for H1N1 swine flu, seasonal H1N1  and seasonal H3N2 in nasal swabs and  controls consisting of febrile patients with rhinovirus infection or febrile patients of non-viral etiology (nasal swabs PCR negative for common respiratory viruses and blood PCR negative for dengue and parvovirus B19) were assessed consecutively for global transcriptional changes in whole blood

DESIGN
Peripheral whole blood collected in PAX-gene tubes and extracted for total RNA

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
