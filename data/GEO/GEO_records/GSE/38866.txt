TITLE
Expression Data from siRae1 and siNT infected with VSV or mock infected

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To test the effect of silencing Rae1 on expression on RNA polymerase II transcripts, host mRNAs were analysed by cDNA microarrays. We hypothesized that if silencing Rae1 expression increases cellular resistance to inhibition of transcription in VSV infected cells, mRNA characteristic of host antiviral response would be increased than compared to cells transfected with control siRNA.

DESIGN
HeLa cells transfected with siRNA targeted against Rae1 (siRae1) or against non-targeting siRNA (siNT). The sequence of nontargeting (NT) siRNA is scrambled and does not match any sequence on the human genome. Transfected cells were either infected with VSV or mock infected. Six hours later RNA was extracted from the cells. Two separate experiments of such were analyzed by microarrays
