TITLE
Regulation of gene expression by WAC/RNF20/RNF40 in HEK293A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
WAC is a known positive regulator of (macro)autophagy. WAC also forms a complex with RNF20/RNF40 to promote H2B monoubiquitination and hence to affect transcriptional regulation. This study addresses whether the WAC/RNF20/RNF40 complex regulates autophagy through effects on gene expression.

DESIGN
WAC, RNF20 and RNF40 were knocked-down using pools of siRNAs in HEK293A cells. Each knockdown was in triplicate and the control was RISCfree siRNA. mRNA expression profiles were investigated using an Illumina HT12v4 Bead Array.
