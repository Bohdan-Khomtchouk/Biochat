TITLE
Molecular response of the coral Acropora millepora to three settlement and/or metamorphosis induced stimuli

ORGANISM
Acropora millepora

SUMMARY
Two known settlement/metamorphosis inducing stimuli (crustose coralline algae, and ethanolic extract of crustose coralline algae) and one stimulus which just induces metamorphosis (LWamide) were used to stimulate competent planula larvae of the coral Acropora millepora.  Samples were taken 0.5h, 4h and 12h post induction isolate the genes controlling settlement and metamorphosis in this coral.
