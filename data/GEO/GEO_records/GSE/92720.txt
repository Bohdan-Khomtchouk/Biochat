TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Control and H3.3 Knockdown neural stem cell Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of gene expression. The goals of this study are to compare the different transcripts between control or Histone H3.3 knockdown in the neural stem cells.

DESIGN
Methods:Neural stem cell isolated from E12 mice and cultured in vitro. RNA used for global transcriptome analysis were extracted from the different lentivirus infected neural stem cells and sequenced by Hiseq 2500. Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified when we compared Normalized Reads Count between groups with p < 0.05 and |Log2FoldChange| > 1.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
