TITLE
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation of TRA-1 in C. elegans and C. briggsae

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis briggsae ; Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify and characterize sites in the C. elegans genome bound by the transcription factor TRA-1.

DESIGN
TRA-1 ChIP-seq was performed in the following stages of animals in duplicate: 1) L2 stage of C. elegans wild-type N2 strain; 2) L3 stage of C. elegans wild-type N2 strain; 3) young adult stage of C. elegans glp-4(bn2) mutant; 4) young adult stage of C. elegans spe-11(hc77) mutant; 5) L3 stage of C. briggsae wild-type AF16 strain. As a negative control, TRA-1 ChIP-seq was also performed in C. elegans L3 stage with tra-1(e1834) homozygous and heterozygous mutation. Input DNA was also sequenced in each condition.
