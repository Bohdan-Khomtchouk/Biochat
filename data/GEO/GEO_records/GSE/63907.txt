TITLE
Gene expression data from anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) treated mouse ovary follicles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) has an inhibitory effect on ovarian follicle development. However, the mechanism by which AMH regulates folliculogenesis remains to be elucidated. In this study we aimed to investigate the changes in transcriptome of preantral to small antral mice follicles after culturing with AMH and thereby identify candidate genes to be involved. This study is a repetition of a previous study (GEO accession .no.: GSE56737) at the concentration of 50 ng/mL.  The overall design are almost similar to GSE56737 except that it was performed in quadruplicate.

DESIGN
Preantral to small antral follicles were collected from dissected ovaries from six to eight weeks old female C57BL/6Tac mice. Twelve hour as well as 24 hour experiments were performed in one fixed concentration of AMH and an untreated control. The experiments were performed in quadroplicate. In total 16 samples: 2 x conc. (control and 50 ng/ml AMH), 2 x time points, 4 x experiments (quadroplicate). Samples are pairwise comparable within each experiment, that is, sample 1-2 or 3-4 or 5-6 or 7-8 or 9-10 or 11-12 or 13-14 or 15-16. Data are also comparable groupwise; (1,5,9,13) vs (2,6,10,14) or (3,7,11,15) vs (4,8,12,16).
