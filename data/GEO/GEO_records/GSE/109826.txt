TITLE
Expression data from developing zebrafish embryos treated with pesticides and 11-ketotestosterone

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
During critical periods the developing organism is particularly sensitive to exposure to bioactive environmental contaminants. Our objective was to test p,pâ€™-DDE and dieldrin in a zebrafish whole embryo model in order to identify potential endocrine disrupting activity during development.

DESIGN
Zebrafish embryos were collected and raised in egg water until treatment at 72-96 hours post fertilization

PLATFORM
GPL24541 [Zebrafish] Affymetrix Zebrafish Genome Array [CDF: Brainarray Entrez Gene CDF version 14.0.0]
