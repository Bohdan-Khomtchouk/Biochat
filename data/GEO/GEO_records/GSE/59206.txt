TITLE
Peripheral blood gene-expression in heavy vs. moderate drinkers exposed to three types of personalized imagery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alterations in stress-related gene-expression may play a role in stress-related drinking and the risk for alcohol dependence.  Microarrays were used to measure changes in gene-expression in peripheral blood in non-smoking, social drinking subjects exposed to three types of personalized imagery: neutral, stressful (but not alcohol- related), and alcohol-related cues. Gene-expression was measured at baseline, immediately after, and 1 hour after stimulus presentation. Subjects were allowed to drink up to 750cc of beer in a “taste-test” following stimulus presentation in each imagery condition, and the amount of beer consumed was recorded. Gene-expression levels were compared in 2 groups of non-smoking subjects (n=11/group): heavy drinkers (HD, defined as regular alcohol use over the past year of at least 8 standard drinks/week for women and at least 15 standard drinks/week for men), and moderate drinkers (MD, defined as up to 7 standard drinks/week for women and 14 standard drinks/week for men).

DESIGN
198 samples total. Total RNA isolated from PAXgene blood RNA tubes from heavy drinkers (n=11) and moderate drinkers (n=11) exposed to 3 different types of personalized imagery (stress, neutral, or alcohol-cue) at three time-points per condition (baseline, immediately after cue presentation,and 1 hour after cue presentation)(9 samples per subject).
