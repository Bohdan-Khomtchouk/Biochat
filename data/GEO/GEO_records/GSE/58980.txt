TITLE
Expression analysis of colorectal cancer cell line SW480 expressing  FOXC2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a colorectal cancer cell line SW480  expressing FOXC2, compared to the pBabe control cells.  Genes associated with metastasis regulated by FOXC2 in colorectal cancer were analysed. The role of FOXC2 in breast cancer metastasis are further described in Mani SA, Yang J et al. Mesenchyme Forkhead 1 (FOXC2) plays a key role in metastasis and is associated with aggressive basal-like breast cancers. PNAS  2007; 104: 10069-10074 .

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate  cultures of SW480/pBabe and  three separate cultures of SW480/FOXC2.  Each chip measures the expression level of 45033 genes from SW480/pBabe or SW480/FOXC2.
