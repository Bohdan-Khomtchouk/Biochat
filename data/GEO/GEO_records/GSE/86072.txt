TITLE
Transcriptional regulatory networks underlying reprogramming of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) to multipotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We present key transcription factors (TFs) and transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) delineating how they control cellular processes related to the SSC reprogramming.

DESIGN
Using the SSCs, we first established intermediate SSCs (iSSCs) undergoing the transition to multipotent SSCs (mSSCs) and then generated gene expression profiles of SSCs, iSSCs, and mSSCs.
