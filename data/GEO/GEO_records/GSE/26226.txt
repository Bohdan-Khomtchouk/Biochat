TITLE
Expression data from Caco-2 cells expressing TLR4 and associated mutants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Common missense mutations (D299G, T399I) have been recently identified in the human TLR4 gene. The aim of this study was to determine how TLR4 and associated mutants affect gene expression in Caco-2 cells. We used microarrays to asses gene expression profiles in Caco-2 stably overexpressing TLR4-WT, TLR4-D299G, TLR4-T399I or untransfected.

DESIGN
Caco-2 clones stably overexpressing HA-tagged wildtype TLR4-WT, mutant TLR4-D299G or TLR4-T399I were generated. Prior to analysis, cell clones were cultured for 8 days in all experiments. RNA (triplicate) was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
