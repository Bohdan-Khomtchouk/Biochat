TITLE
Gene expression changes in femur bone induced by skeletal muscle unloading

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes in femur bone induced by acute skeletal muscle unloading, which leads to physiological changes including muscle atrophy, weakness and results in bone remodelling and subsequent loss of bone mass, was investigated by hind-limb suspension (HLS) treatment of Male ICR mice (28â€“32 g body wt; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN). AgilentTM Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarrays were utilised to examine the effects of HLS on mRNA expression profiles of the femur bone in the hindlimbs of freely ambulating control and 24h HLS treated mice. Five independent biological replicates of this experiment were carried out.

DESIGN
Five independent biological replicates of this experiment (Control and HLS) were carried out.
