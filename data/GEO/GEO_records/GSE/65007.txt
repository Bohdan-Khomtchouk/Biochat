TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of wild type and erythromycin-producing strain of S. erythraea

ORGANISM
Saccharopolyspora erythraea

SUMMARY
Erythromycin is a medically important antibiotic, biosynthesized by the actinomycete Saccharopolyspora erythraea. We used transcriptomic approach to compare whole genome expression in erythromycin high-producing strain, compared to the wild type S. erythraea strain in four stages of fermentation.

DESIGN
2 strains (3 individual fermentations each), 4 time points -- > 24 samples (2 exluded from anaysis, 22 remaining); one color design
