TITLE
Temporal transcriptional profiling of growth resumption following polyamine-depletion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Polyamines are absolutely required for cell growth and proliferation. While polyamine depletion results in reversible cell cycle arrest, the actual mechanism of growth inhibition is still obscure. This experiment aimed at determining the cellular processes elicited by re-addition of polyamines to polyamine-depleted (growth arrested) cells.

DESIGN
In order to reveal the general transcriptional responses to polyamine re-addition, NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were first treated with 1mM L-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) for 96 hours and then growth stimulated by spermidine. Cells were collected at 0, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360, 480 and 600 min upon addition of spermidine to polyamine-depleted (growth arrested) cells. Total RNA was isolated, reverse-transcribed, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix MoGene 1.0 ST  DNA array.
