TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of the WEHI-231-derived stable cell lines WEHI-control and WEHI-miR-148a

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNAs regulate the expression of its targets genes by promoting mRNA degradation and translational repression. The goal of this study is to perform RNA-Seq in control or miR-148a-expressing WEHI-231 cell lines for the identification of miR-148a target genes.

DESIGN
WEHI-control and WEHI-miR-148a cells were stimulated with anti-IgM (2 ug/ml) for 14 h. Total RNA was extracted, enriched for polyA-containing RNAs and submitted to RNA-Seq.
