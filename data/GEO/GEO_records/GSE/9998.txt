TITLE
14028 Promoter libraries through human PC3 tumor in nude mice

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Salmonella typhimurium 14028s promoter library (180,000 clones, both stable and destabilized GFP versions) recovered from either spleens / PC3 tumors 2 days after IV / IT delivery into nude mice, sorted for green bacteria using FACS, compared to the initial promoter library grown in LB Ampicillin broth, O/N at 37Â°C with aeration Keywords: promoter screen

DESIGN
used 5 mice each for IT delivery of the 14028 promoter libraries into tumor or IV delivery and subsequent harvest from spleen. Sorted for green bacteria using FACS. Compared various sortings after these environments to the original promoter library after plasmid recovery and Klenow labeling of PCR amplified plasmid inserts by hybridization onto 380k custom-made Nimblegen Salmonella tiling oligo array
