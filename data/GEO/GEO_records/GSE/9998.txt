TITLE
14028 Promoter libraries through human PC3 tumor in nude mice

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. LT2

SUMMARY
Salmonella typhimurium 14028s promoter library (180,000 clones, both stable and destabilized GFP versions) recovered from either spleens / PC3 tumors 2 days after IV / IT delivery into nude mice, sorted for green bacteria using FACS, compared to the initial promoter library grown in LB Ampicillin broth, O/N at 37Â°C with aeration Keywords: promoter screen
