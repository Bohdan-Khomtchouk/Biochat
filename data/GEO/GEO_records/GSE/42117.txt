TITLE
Precise Maps of RNA Polymerase Reveal How Promoters Direct Initiation and Pausing

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transcription regulation occurs frequently through promoter-associated pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We developed a Precision nuclear Run-On and sequencing assay (PRO-seq) to map the genome-wide distribution of transcriptionally-engaged Pol II at base-pair resolution. Pol II accumulates immediately downstream of promoters, at intron-exon junctions that are efficiently used for splicing, and over 3' poly-adenylation sites. Focused analyses of promoters reveal that pausing is not fixed relative to initiation sites nor is it specified directly by the position of a particular core promoter element or the first nucleosome. Core promoter elements function beyond initiation, and when optimally positioned they act collectively to dictate the position and strength of pausing . We test this ‘Complex Interaction’ model with insertional mutagenesis of the Drosophila Hsp70 core promoter.

DESIGN
Identification of RNA polymerase active sites in Drosophila S2 cell line using PRO-seq method. Identification of transcription initiation sites in Drosophila S2 cell line using PRO-cap method. Identification of changes in RNA polymerase active sites on transgenic Hsp70 promoters upon disruption of DNA sequence elements in 3 transgenic fly lines using PRO-seq method.
