TITLE
mRNA profiling of Apis mellifera larvae fed with diets containing quercetin

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
To determine the impact of quercetin on honeybee development and physiology, we conducted an RNASeq analysis of gene expression in neonate larvae exposed for three days to control “bee candy” diet (comprising sucrose and sugar syrup) or diets to which 0.1 mM or 0.25 mM quercetin was added.

DESIGN
Three replicates of each treatment: A. mellifera larvae in control diet, A. mellifera larvae in diet with added 0.25mM quercetin, and A. mellifera larvae in diet with added 0.1 mM quercetin
