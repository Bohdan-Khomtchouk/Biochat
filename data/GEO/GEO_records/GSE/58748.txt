TITLE
Identification of targets genes of PRDM2 in G0 arrested myoblasts of C2C12

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PRDM2 directly associates with the Myogenin promoter and repress its transcription. This led to the hypothesis that PRDM2 could potentially associate directly with other promoters and regulate their expression.To gain further insight into the pathways and genes controlled by PRDM2, ChIP-on-Chip analysis was performed using mouse 44K promoter array. Since PRDM2 represses transcription by H3K9 dimethylation, we were interested in determining which targets were occupied by PRDM2 as well as showed enrichment for H3K9me2. Hence ChIP-on-Chip analysis for H3K9me2 was performed to find the overlap between PRDM2 and H3K9me2 marked promoters.
