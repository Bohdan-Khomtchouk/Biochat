SUMMARY
Retinoic acid (RA) triggers physiological processes by activating heterodimeric transcription factors comprising retinoic acid (RARa,b,g) and retinoid X (RXRa,b,g) receptors. How a single signal induces highly complex temporally controlled networks that ultimately orchestrate physiological processes is unclear. Using an RA-inducible differentiation model we defined the temporal changes in the genome-wide binding patterns of RARg and RXRa and correlated them with transcription regulation. Unexpectedly, both receptors displayed a highly dynamic binding, with different RXRa heterodimers targeting identical loci. Comparison of RARg and RXRa co-binding at RA-regulated genes identified putative RXRa-RARg target genes that were validated with subtype-selective agonists. Gene regulatory decisions during differentiation were inferred from transcription factor target gene information and temporal gene expression.  This analysis revealed 6 distinct co-expression paths of which RXRa-RARg is associated with transcription activation, while Sox2 and Egr1 were predicted to regulate repression. Finally, RXRa-RARg regulatory networks were reconstructed through integration of functional co-citations. Our analysis provides a dynamic view of RA signalling during cell differentiation, reveals RA heterodimer dynamics and promiscuity, and predicts decisions that diversify the RA signal into distinct gene-regulatory programs.

DESIGN
RXRa; RARg and RNA Polymerase II chromatin binding has been assessed at five time points; in addition an input control for F9 cells as well as a RXRa ChIP-seq assay from a rxra-/- ko strain has been performed.
