TITLE
Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor gamma- Deficiency in Endothelial Cells Impairs Angiogenic Capacity by Loss-of E2F1 Mediated Wnt Effector Genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Some of the functions and mechanisms of PPARγ-mediated regulation of vascular homeostasis have been revealed, the potential role of PPARγ in angiogenesis is obscure. In human ECs, PPARγ-deficiency was studied using siRNA strategy and RNA sequencing was utilized to reveal angiogenesis-associated targets for PPARg.

DESIGN
Our aim is to reveal the possible role of PPARy in angiogenesis.
