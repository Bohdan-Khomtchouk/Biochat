TITLE
Expression data from  Shp2f/f and SCSKO mice testis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ability of male reproduction is seriously dependent on Sertoli cells. However, the mechanisms governing the functional integrity of Sertoli cells remained largely unexplored. Tyrosine phosphatase protein Shp2 is expressed in germ, Leydig and Sertoli cells of mice testes. But the physiological role of Shp2 in the spermatogenesis was not fully understood. Thus, we conditionally deleted Shp2 gene in Sertoli cells using two transgenic models, and demonstrated that Shp2 deficiency caused infertility, excessive differentiation of SSCs and abnormal BTB in mice. To further discover the underlying mechanism of Shp2 regulation, we collected the mRNA of testes from wild type or knockout mice at 16.5 fetal day, Postnatal 3 days, 1 weeks, 2 weeks, and then screened the gene expression.

DESIGN
Testis tissues from Shp2f/f and SCSKO mice were for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
