TITLE
Unexpected role of interferon-g in regulating neuronal connectivity and social behavior

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified an enrichment in IFN-gamma dependent genes in the prefrontal cortex of group housed mice compared to single housed mice.

DESIGN
Mice were house either grouped or single for 6 days. Mice were euthanized and brains were removed. The prefrontal cortex was disected and prepared for RNA-seq analysis.
