TITLE
LIX75 vs H37Rv under Log phase growth (± 5 mM Nitrate), and during hypoxic growth (48 h)

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Transcription analysis of ΔnarL mutant (LIX75) versus wild type H37Rv during aerobic growth in absence or presence of 5 mM Nitrate, and during hypoxic growth. This will elucidate the regulatory role of NarL response regulator duirng aerobic growth in absence of presence of exogenous nitrate supplemen and during hypoxic growth conditions and help identify genes that require NarL for expression under the three experimental conditions.
