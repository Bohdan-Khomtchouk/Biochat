TITLE
Polyploidy can drive rapid adaptation in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Analysis of copy number variation in evolved haploid, diploid, tetraploid strains.

DESIGN
All experimental samples were compared to the same reference strain S288C. The samples include the progenitor strains for the haploid, diploid, and tetraploid evolution experiments, and single colony isolates (clones) from the evolving populations at given time points. Evolved clones were analyzed at generation 250 unless the name is followed by gen35, gen55 or gen500, in which case those generations were analyzed.
