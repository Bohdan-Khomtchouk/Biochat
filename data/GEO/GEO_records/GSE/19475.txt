SUMMARY
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in infants ( < 1 year) is characterized by a poor prognosis and a high incidence of MLL translocations. Several studies demonstrated the unique gene expression profile associated with MLL-rearranged ALL, but generally small cohorts were analyzed as uniform patient groups regardless of the type of MLL translocation, while the analysis of translocation-negative infant ALL remained unacknowledged.
