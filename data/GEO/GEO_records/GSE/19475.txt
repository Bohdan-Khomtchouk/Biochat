TITLE
Gene expression data from infants ( < 1 year of age) diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in infants ( < 1 year) is characterized by a poor prognosis and a high incidence of MLL translocations. Several studies demonstrated the unique gene expression profile associated with MLL-rearranged ALL, but generally small cohorts were analyzed as uniform patient groups regardless of the type of MLL translocation, while the analysis of translocation-negative infant ALL remained unacknowledged.

DESIGN
We generated and analyzed primary infant ALL expression profiles (n=73) typified by translocations t(4;11), t(11;19) and t(9;11), or the absence of MLL translocations, in order to study translocation-specific gene expression between the different genetic subtypes of infant ALL.
