TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of esopageal adenocarcinoma tumor biopsy using high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to define a comprehensive genetic profile of 23 esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) primary tumor biopsies based on loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and DNA copy number changes. Alterations were common, averaging 97 (range 23-208) per tumor. LOH and gains averaged 33 (range 3-83) and 31 (range 11-73) per tumor, respectively. Copy neutral LOH events averaged 27 (range 7-57) per EAC. We noted 126 homozygous deletions (HDs) across the EAC panel (range 0-11 in individual tumors). Frequent HDs within FHIT (17/23), WWOX (8/23) and DMD (6/23) suggest a role for common fragile sites or genomic instability in EAC etiology. HDs were also noted for known tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) including: CDKN2A, CDKN2B, SMAD4 and GALR1, and identified PDE4D and MGC48628 as potentially novel TSGs. All tumors showed LOH for most of chromosome 17p, suggesting that TSGs other than TP53 maybe targeted. Frequent gains were noted around MYC (13/23), BCL9 (12/23), CTAGE1 (14/23) and ZNF217 (12/23). Thus, we have confirmed previous reports indicating frequent changes to FHIT, CDKN2A, TP53 and MYC in EAC and identified additional genes of interest. Meta analysis of previous genome-wide EAC studies together with the data presented here, highlighted consistent regions of gain on 8q, 18q and 20q, and multiple LOH regions on 4q, 5q, 17p and 18q, suggesting that more than one gene may be targeted on each of these chromosome arms. The focal gains and deletions documented here are a step towards identifying the key genes involved in EAC development. Keywords: High Density SNP array

DESIGN
Here we use Illumina 317K whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to define a comprehensive allelotype of melanoma based on loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number changes in a panel of 23 esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) primary tumor biopsies. Each EAC was paired to normal squamous biopsy from 40328 (GSM266078) to generate the log_R_ratio.
