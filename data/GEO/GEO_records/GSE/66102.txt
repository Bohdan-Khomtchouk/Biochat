TITLE
Comparison of Ly6D- common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) from OcnCre;iDTR control and mutant mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression microarray comparing Ly6D- CLPs isolated from OcnCre;iDTR control and mutant mice by flow cytometry.

DESIGN
Ly6D- CLPs were isolated from the bone marrow of OcnCre;iDTR control or mutant mice by flow cytometry and subjected to Affymetrix microarray comparison of gene expression. Markers used to define Ly6D- CLP by flow cytometry was: LineageLo, cKit+, Sca+, CD127+, Thy1.2-, Ly6D-
