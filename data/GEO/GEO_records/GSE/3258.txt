TITLE
Comparison of three populations of OECs

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Comparison of three populations of OECs derived from the ONL of rats. The three populations were cultured employing the same culture medium but were maintained in vitro for a different amount of time (number of population doublings or PDs). OEC Ep cells were maintained for less than one week in vitro (less than 3 PDs); OEC Lp were maintained for over a year (more than 50 PDs) and TEG3 OEC cell line has been serially passed in culture for long-periods of time after genetic immortalization. Keywords: OEC cells, adaptation to long-term culture, genetic immortalization
