TITLE
Transcriptome response of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium N-15 and Bifidobacterium thermophilum RBL67  in co-culture

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium thermophilum ; Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Bifidobacterium thermophilum RBL67 (RBL67), a human fecal isolate and promising probiotic candidate, showed antagonistic and protective effects against Salmonella and Listeria in vitro. However, the underlying mechanisms fostering these health-related effects remain unknown. Therefor the transcriptome response of RBL67 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium N-15 (N-15) in co-culture compared to the response in their respective mono-cultures. RNA was extracted from culture samples taken after 4 (N-15) or 5 h (RBL67) and RNAseq was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer. Three biological replciates were performed resulting in 12 data sets: 3 RBL67 mono culture, 3 N15 mono-culture, 3 RBL67 co-culture, 3 N15 co-culture. Our study provided first insights into probiotic-pathogen interaction on transcriptional level and suggests a mechanism for how probiotic organisms can protect the host from infections.
