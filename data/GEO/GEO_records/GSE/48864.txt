TITLE
Expression analysis of Aspergillus oryzae grown on different carbon sources

ORGANISM
Aspergillus oryzae RIB40

SUMMARY
In this study, we focused on chemically defined inducers or substrates to drive expression of cellulases, hemicellulases and accessory enzymes in the model filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae. Cellohexaose (O-CHE), mannohexaose (O-MHE), xylopentaose (O-XPE), arabinoheptaose (O-AHP), 1,3:1,4-β-glucohexaose (O-BGHEXA), 63-α-D-glucosyl-maltotriosyl-maltotriose (O-GMH), 61-α-D-galactosyl-mannotriose (O-GM3), xyloglucan (X3Glc4-borohydride reduced; O-X3G4R), turanose (TYR) and sophorose (SOP) were used to induce the plant polysaccharide degradation machinery of A. oryzae.

DESIGN
The strain used in this study was the A. oryzae sequenced strain RIB40, obtained from IBT culture collection at Technical University of Denmark. To obtain a global view of the A. oryzae transcriptome activated for plant biomass conversion, mRNA from growth after 2 h on 10 different carbohydrate active enzyme inducers (di- and –oligo saccharides) was subjected to custom-designed Agilent microarray analysis.
