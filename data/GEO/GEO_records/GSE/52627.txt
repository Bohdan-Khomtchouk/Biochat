TITLE
RUNX2 selectively attenuates or augments androgen-driven transcription in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate carcinogenesis is associated with changes in androgen signaling from driving cellular differentiation to promoting oncogenic behaviors.  RUNX2 binds the androgen receptor (AR), and ectopic expression of RUNX2 is linked to prostate cancer (PCa) progression.  We therefore investigated genome-wide the influence of RUNX2 on androgen-induced gene expression and AR DNA binding in PCa cells.  The predominant function of RUNX2 is to inhibit the androgen response, attributable in part to dissociation of AR from target genes such as the tumor suppressor NKX3-1.  At a minority of AR target genes, however, AR activity persists in the presence of RUNX2.  Some of these genes are co-operatively stimulated by androgen and RUNX2 signaling and are characterized by the presence of putative enhancers co-occupied by AR and RUNX2.  Genes synergistically stimulated by AR and RUNX2 include the invasion-promoting transcription factor SNAI2.  Indeed, co-activation of AR and RUNX2, but neither alone, stimulated PCa cell invasiveness, which was abolished by SNAI2 silencing.  Accordingly, PCa biopsies most strongly stained for SNAI2 exhibit high nuclear expression of both RUNX2 and AR.  The RUNX2-mediated locus-dependent modulation of AR activity in PCa opens a research avenue that may guide the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to patient management.

DESIGN
total RNA from C4-2B/Rx2dox cells was extracted in biological triplicates from four different conditions.  Ethanol vehicle control, dox to induce RUNX2 expression, DHT to activate androgen receptor and DHT+dox combined.
