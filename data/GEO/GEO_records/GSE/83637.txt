TITLE
RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ and CD8+CD103+CD49- T cells from healthy human skin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptome analysis of epidermal CD8 tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells from healthy human skin. Specifically, epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ and CD8+CD103+CD49- TRM cells from healthy human skin were sorted by FACS. Differential gene expression analysis revealed functional dichotomy of epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ and CD8+CD103+CD49- TRM cells.

DESIGN
Analysis of differentially expressed genes between epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ and CD8+CD103+CD49- T cells from healthy human skin, biological replicates (n=7) (healthy skin donors).
