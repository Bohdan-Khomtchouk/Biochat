TITLE
A large-scale clinical study of gene expression response to severe burn injury

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the age-dependent response to burn injury, blood samples from pediatric and adult patients  were collected at different times after severe burn injury. Gene expression was measured using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays for both patient samples and healthy controls. Time points were binned into two groups: early stage for < 11 days and middle stage for 11-49 days.

DESIGN
114 arrays for 57 patients (2 time points per patient) and 63 arrays for 63 healthy controls.
