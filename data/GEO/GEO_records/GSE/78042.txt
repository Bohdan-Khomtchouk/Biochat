TITLE
Gene expression across 3 days of lens-induced myopia and hyperopia induction in chick

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from 34 retina/RPE/choroid samples taken from the right eyes of male chicks across a time-course of normal development or refractive error induction (defocus-induced myopia and hyperopia).

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in individual retina/RPE/choroid samples across three time-points (1, 2, and 3 days) and three lens conditions (no lens, +10 diopter lens, and -10 diopter lens)

PLATFORM
GPL21476 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Gallus gallus)
