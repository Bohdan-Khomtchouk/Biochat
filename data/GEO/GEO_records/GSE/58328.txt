TITLE
Expression data from mouse spleen CD11c dendritic cells, bone marrow Gr1DC11b cells, and RAW264.7 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated in mouse models how enhanced coagulation activation due to a common disease polymorphism in coagulation factor V (fV Leiden Arg506Gln) modifies the host response to infection and inflammation We used microarrays to characterize the in vivo and in vitro inflammatory responses of mouse spleen dendritic cells, macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells, and bone marrow myeloid cells

DESIGN
Samples 1-6 were generated by pooling equal amounts of RNA prepared from FACS-enriched spleen dendritic cells isolated from 6 individual mice before (control sample 1) or 16 hours after challenge with lipopolysaccharide. Samples 7-10 were generated by pooling equal amounts of RNA prepared from triplicate cultures of RAW264.7 cells. Samples 10-14 (2 replicas per condition) were prepared from RNA isolated from FACS-enriched bone marrow myeloid cells (pooled from 4 adoptively transferred animals each) 7 days after infection with S.aureus.
