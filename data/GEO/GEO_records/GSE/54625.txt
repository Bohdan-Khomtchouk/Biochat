TITLE
Polysomes from DENR knockdown cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The aim was to identify transcripts that are poorly translated upon knockdown of DENR. Lysates from control (GFP) and DENR knockdown S2 cells were run on polysome gradients. RNA from the (80S peak + polysome peaks) was isolated and analyzed by microarrays. In parallel, total RNA from the cells was also profiled as a normalization control and profiled. The 'translation score' of translated mRNA to total RNA was then calculated for control and DENR knockdown cells.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates for DENR knockdown and GFP knockdown were performed. For each sample, (80S+polysomes) and total RNA were profiled, leading to 8 samples in total.
