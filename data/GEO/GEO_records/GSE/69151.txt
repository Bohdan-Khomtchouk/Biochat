TITLE
TNFalpha and IL-6 induced anorexia: effects on serotonin turnover

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Anorexia can occur as a serious complication of chronic disease. Increasing evidence suggests that inflammation plays a major role, along with a hypothalamic dysregulation characterized by locally elevated serotonin levels. The present study was undertaken to further explore the connections between peripheral inflammation, anorexia and hypothalamic serotonin metabolism and signaling pathways. We studied transcriptomic changes and serotonergic activity in the hypothalamus of mice after an intraperitoneal injection with TNFα, IL-6 or a combination of TNFα and IL-6.

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with TNFalpha, IL-6 Low, IL-6 High, combination TNF+IL-6 Low or combination TNF+IL-6 High. Each group comprised of 12 animals, of which 6 animals were used for transcriptomics.
