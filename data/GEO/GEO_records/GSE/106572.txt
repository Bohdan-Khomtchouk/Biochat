TITLE
Accurate Design of Translational Output by a Neural Network Model of Ribosome Distribution

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We present a ribosome profiling data set from S. cerevisiae as part of a larger study that models the elongation rate along transcripts as a function of local sequence neighborhoods. We then apply this model to design coding sequences that are optimized for translational output.

DESIGN
Two lanes of sequencing from one ribosome profiling experiment

PLATFORM
GPL21656 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
