TITLE
Multiplex three dimensional brain gene expression mapping in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Voxelation is a novel technology designed to produce high throughput, three-dimensional imaging of gene expression patterns in the brain. In these experiments, mouse brains were dissected into 40 voxels, or cubes, by cutting 10 serial coronal sections and transecting each coronal section into fourths. Using microarrays, the gene expression pattern of 9000 genes was acquired for both a normal and a pharmacological model of Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse brain. The mice used in these experiments were C57BL/6J males 10-24 weeks in age. Keywords = voxelation, 3-D gene expression, Parkinson's disease Keywords: other
