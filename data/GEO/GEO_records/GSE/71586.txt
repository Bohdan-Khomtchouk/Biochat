TITLE
Multiple targeted metabolic effects of an oriental herb medicine “Taeeumjowuitang” with transcriptional response in diet-induced obesity; comparison with green tea extract

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the effect of an oriental herbal medicine “Taeeumjowuitang” on phenotype characteristics and elucidated anti-obesity mechanism based on RNA-seq transcriptomic profiles in an obesity animal model comparison with green tea extract.

DESIGN
Total RNA of epididymal adipose tissues was obtained from normal diet, high-fat diet and Taeeumjowuitang (TJ) or green tea extract (GT) added high-fat diet-fed mice and mRNA expression-associated with lipid, and glucose metabolism was measured.

PLATFORM
