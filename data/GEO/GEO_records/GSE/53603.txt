TITLE
Expression data from SKOV3 cells treated with SAHA or vehicle control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a microarray experiment to assess SAHA-induced changes in expression of genes of the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway

DESIGN
SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells were treated with 1ÂµM SAHA or vehicle-control (0.01% DMSO) for 6 or 24 hours, harvested and processed for RNA isolation.  Data for both time-points for SAHA and vehicle-control treated cells were obtained in duplicate.  Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis and hybridization on oligonucleotide microarrays (U133 Plus 2.0 Array GeneChip, Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) were carried out using standard protocols.
