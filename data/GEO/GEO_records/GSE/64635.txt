TITLE
Human CD8 T central memory (Tcm) cells: Control vs. norepinephrine (NE) treated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of CD8 Tcm cells comparing untreated control cells to 16 hour norepinephrine treated cells. The goal was to examine the impact of norepinephrine treatment on CD8 Tcm cell global gene expression compared to untreated cells, and also to examine changes that occurred in resting cells and activated cells 24 and 72 hours after stimulation with CD3/28 beads.

DESIGN
Two-conditional experiment: Control vs. NE treated CD8 Tcm cells. Biological replicates: 3 replicates for 0 hour and 24 hours, and 2 replicates for 72 hours. Each sample consisted of pooled RNA from 3 different donors.
