TITLE
Comparative genomic analysis of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans strains during short term persistent infections using a pan-genome microarray

ORGANISM
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans

SUMMARY
To analyze the gain and lost of genes in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans during short-term persistent infection in the same host

DESIGN
The microarray was used to compare gene contents of 4 different pairs of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans strains (SCC393 vs A160, SCC1398 vs SCC4092, SCC2302 vs AAS4a, and S23A vs I23C), where each pair was isolated from an individual over time. Two biological duplicates were carried out for each strain.
