TITLE
An interspecies analysis reveals sequence determinants of the bivalent chromatin state

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The sequence determinants of chromatin bivalency remain unclear. We analysed sequence determinants of chromatin bivalency genome-wide in several mammalian species and performed a series of transgenic experiments in mouse ES cells.

DESIGN
Genome-wide mapping of H3K27me3 in rat ES cells and ChIP-seq with anti-Ezh2 antibody in transgenic mouse ES cells
