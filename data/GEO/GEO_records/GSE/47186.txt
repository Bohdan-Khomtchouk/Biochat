TITLE
MiR-376c down-regulation accelerates EGF-dependent migration by targeting GRB2 in the HuCCT1 human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The biological significance of the down-regulation of miR-376c in HuCCT1 cells is unknown. We revealed that miR-376c significantly reduced EGF-dependent cell migration through its target GRB2 in HuCCT1 cells. To elucidate key molecules in EGF-dependent HuCCT1 migration, in which GRB2 upregulation is caused by abnormal suppression of miR-376c, we compared expression profiles of mRNAs affected by pre-miR-376c and siRNA targeting GRB2.

DESIGN
We compared expression profiles of mRNAs affected by pre-miR-376c and siRNA targeting GRB2 in EGF-treated HuCCT1 cells.
