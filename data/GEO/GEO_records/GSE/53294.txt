TITLE
Molecular signatures of the evolving immune response in mice following a Bordetella pertussis infection.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine gene expression responses to Bordetella pertussis were determined in lung and spleen, between 0 and 28 days post infection. Data were compared to other parameters such as microarray, flow cytometry, multiplex immunoassays, and lung clearance.

DESIGN
A 57 array study with 27 arrays for lung and 30 for spleen. For each tissue we used a common reference made from RNA samples of the same tissue. Please note that the reference samples are made by pooling RNA of all samples used for a tissue (either infected or uninfected). Thus, Lung and spleen each have their own reference.
