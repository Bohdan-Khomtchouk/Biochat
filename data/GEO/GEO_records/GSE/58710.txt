TITLE
Time Course of Gene Expression in the Substantia Nigra in Response to Intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine in the rat.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) rat model of parkinsonism is among the first, and most commonly used, animal models of Parkinson’s disease. It provides insight into the compensatory changes that occur in the brain after dopamine (DA) neuron degeneration. In order to better define the consequences of substantia nigra DA neuron loss on the neural and glial populations during and following nigrostriatal degeneration, tissue was collected and evaluated from the substantia nigra of 6OHDA or vehicle treated, or naïve rats at 1, 2, 4, 6 & 16 weeks. Comprehensive gene expression analysis was conducted to detect significant differences in gene expression. Comparisons were conducted within the same treatment groups over time as well as across treatments within the same post-treatment interval. Longitudinal expression patterns were parsed using a k-means clustering algorithm as a method for finding patterns indicative of neuronal loss, upregulation in response to lesion or surgical damage exclusive of lesion.

DESIGN
Tissue was collected from the substantia nigra of 6OHDA treated, sham and naïve rats at 1, 2, 4, 6 & 16 weeks post-treatment.  A unilateral striatal lesion was employed that results in a 99% striatal DA reduction and an 80% loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra.  6OHDA lesions were confirmed via catecholamine quantitation by HPLC. RNA integrity was assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with minimum RIN acceptance criteria of 8.0. Multidimensional plots and Pearson Correlations were used to establish group/treatment homogeneity.  Tissue was subjected to comprehensive gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0ST array.
