TITLE
The RNA-binding protein Musashi1 is a central regulator of adhesion pathways in glioblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The conserved RNA-binding protein Musashi1 (MSI1) has emerged as a key oncogenic factor in numerous solid tumors, including glioblastoma. However, its mechanism of action has not yet been established comprehensively. We set out to map its impact on the transcriptome in U251 cells using RNA-seq and iCLIP.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression and splicing changes upon KD of Musashi1 in U251 cells and link to iCLIP-identified Musashi1 RNA binding sites
