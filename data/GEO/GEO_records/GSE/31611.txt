TITLE
Expression data from embryoid body with BRCA1 mutation [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the functional significance of the R1699Q variant of human BRCA1 gene using a mouse ES cell-based assay.

DESIGN
The total RNA from the embryoid body of WT, R1699Q and M1652I at day 7 were labeled and used for hybridization against Affymetrix gene expression microarray.
