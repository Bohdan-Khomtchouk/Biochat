TITLE
Expression analysis of 13 squamous cell carcinomas arising in the vulva

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The genome of 14 vulvar SCC was analyzed by aCGH and microarray to identify common imbalances present in the tumors as well as which genes were deregulated. Overall there was a good concordance between the imbalances scored by aCGH and the level of gene expression found by microarray, i.e., the genes located in gained regions were overexpressed while those located in lost regions were found down-regulated.

DESIGN
The whole-gene expression profile of 14 SCC of the vulva was compared to 5 normal vulvar samples to identify genes that were deregulated in the tumors genome. Vulvar hyperplasia 03-48 not further analyzed and not included in the normalized data but included in the non-normalized data
