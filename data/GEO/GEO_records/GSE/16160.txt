TITLE
Expression data of HL-60 leukemia cells after treatment with Curcumin and TCDD

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Curcumin has antileukemic potential that is mediated by dfifferent pathways. Because we could not confirm that the Arylhydrocarbonreceptor, a ligand activated transcription factor, is involved in curcumins antileukemic effects, we performed microarray experiments to have an overall screening of the pathways affected by curcumin in HL-60 cells. We identified an involvement of the vitamin D receptor in the effects of curcumin on HL-60 cells by comparing our results with other experiments.

DESIGN
HL-60 cells were treated for 24h with 100 ÂµM curcumin, 10 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), or 0.5 % DMSO as control.
