TITLE
Monocyte-derived dendritic cells stimulated with LPS, Poly(I:C), CD40L or a combination of IL-1-b, IL-6, TNF-a and PGE2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is known to possess important regulatory functions in the immune response. To gain a better and first comprehensive insight into the mechanisms underlying the conversion of immature to mature DC in terms of the expression of UPS related genes, we undertook a comparative gene expression profiling during DC maturation in response to four different prototypic maturation stimuli. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Monocyte-derived DC were harvested at 3 different periods of time following stimulation for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
