TITLE
Human memory CD8 T-cell effector-potential is epigenetically preserved during in vivo homeostasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Maintenance of memory CD8 T cell effector function is coupled to stability ofeffector DNA methylation programs during homeostatic proliferation

DESIGN
Human na√Øve and memory CD8 T cell subsets were sorted for Whole genome bisulfite sequencing analyses
