TITLE
microRNAs profiling in hippocampal cells of mouse with Pilocarpine-induced Status Epilepticus (SE)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SE was induced in mice (NMRI) chemically by a single dose of Pilocarpine (300mg/kg;i.p.). RNA was extracted from the hippocampi of treated and wild-type mice at 24 h and 28 d after induction. microRNA expressions were measured via microarray technology using Exiqon's miCURYâ„¢ LNA Arrays.

DESIGN
4 conditions, Pilocarpine treated mice at 24 h and 28 d, and the control wild-type at the same types, each of 8 replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL11432 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, 5th generation - hsa, mmu & rno
