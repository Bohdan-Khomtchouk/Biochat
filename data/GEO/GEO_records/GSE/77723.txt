TITLE
Comprehensive RNA profiling of susceptible and resistant (LepR1) Brassica napus to L. Maculans

ORGANISM
Brassica napus ; Leptosphaeria maculans

SUMMARY
The hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans is the causal agent of blackleg disease in Brassica napus (canola, oilseed rape) and causes significant losses in crop yields worldwide. While genetic resistance has been used to mitigate the disease, little information about the genes and gene regulatory networks underlying blackleg resistance is currently available. High-throughput RNA sequencing and rigorous bioinformatics approaches revealed dynamic changes in the host transcriptome and identified plant defense pathways specific to the host-pathogen incompatible LepR1-AvrLepR1 interaction.

DESIGN
In total, 36 samples were sequenced â€“ 18 from the resistant (LepR1) genotype and 18 from the susceptible genotype (Westar). Samples were collected 0, 3, 7, and 11 days post inoculation in triplicate. Mock inoculated controls were collected at 3, 7, and 11 days post inoculation in duplicate. Samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 at the UC Davis Genome Core, 50 bp SR.

PLATFORM
