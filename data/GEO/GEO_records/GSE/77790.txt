TITLE
Differentially expressed genes after miRNA or siRNA transfection in human cancer cell lines II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes by anti cancer treatments (microRNAs or siRNAs) in human cancer, several cell lines (pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma) were subjected to Agilent whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Human cell lines (Panc-1, sw1990, TE8, TE9, A549, MRC-5, BOY, T24, PC3, C4-2, 786-O, A-498 and EBC-1) were treated with miRNAs (miR-375, miR-29a, miR-26a, miR-145-5p, miR-145-3p, miR-218, miR-320a), siRNAs (si-MMP11, si-LAMP1, si-LOXL2, si-PLOD2, si-UHRF1, and si-FOXM1).
