TITLE
Identification of microRNAs with the potential role in progression of thioacetamide-induced liver fibrosis in mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We applied Solexa deep sequencing technology to identify which miRNAs were regulated in thioacetamide-induced fibrotic liver tissue

DESIGN
Control liver tissue vs. Thioacetamide (TAA)-introduced liver tissue with biological replicates
