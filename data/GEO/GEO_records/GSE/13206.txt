TITLE
Human shSIRT6 TNF-alpha timecourse

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established HeLa cell lines stably expressing a short hairpin RNA against SIRT6 (S6 sh2), and then completed genome-wide microarray analysis in shSIRT6 knock-down and control pSR HeLa cells. Prior to RNA extraction, HeLa cells were treated with TNF-alpha (5 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and amplified with Ambion MessageAmp RNA Amplification kit. Amplified human Universal Reference RNA (Stratagene) was used as reference RNA for analysis. Construction and array hybridization of human cDNA microarrays were performed as previously described (Perou et al., 2000). Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series. Compound Based Treatment: 5 ng/ml TNF-alpha Keywords: time_series_design
