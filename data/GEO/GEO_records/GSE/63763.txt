TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state of WDR5 and KAT2A in gastric cancer BGC823 cells [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we performed ChIP coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) for WDR5 and KAT2A in BGC823 cells. WDR5 and KAT2A ChIP-Seq data analysis revealed 5449 and 6485 called peaks, respectively in BGC823 cells with control shRNA transfection.

DESIGN
Examination of WDR5 and KAT2A genomic bingding efficiency and histone modifications pattern change in gastri cancer cell BGC823 cells after downregulation of GAS1 expression.
