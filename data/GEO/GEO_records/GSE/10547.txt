TITLE
Radiation-induced gene translation profiles reveal tumor type and cancer specific components

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the radiation-induced gene translation profiles generated from human tumor cell lines that are treated with radiation. Keywords: stimulus or stress design

DESIGN
A panel of cell lines included 5 gliomas, 4 pancreatic carcinomas, 3 breast carcinomas and 2 non-small cell lung carcinomas. In addition, radiation-induced gene translation profiles were generated for 4 normal human cell lines: a skin fibroblast (BJ), 2 lung fibroblasts (MRC5, MRC9) and mammary epithelial (MEC). Specifically, cell lines were exposed to 2 Gy or sham irradiated, polysome-bound RNA was isolated 6h later and subjected to microarray analyses. Each cell line was evaluated in biological replicates.
