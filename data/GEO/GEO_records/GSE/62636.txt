TITLE
Identification of metastasis-related genes and metastasis-related pathway in squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore metastasis-related genes in high-metastatic cells (HOC313-LM), we performed gene expression array analysis with HOC313-LM and HOC313-Parent (HOC313-P). Moreover, to identify metastasis-related signaling pathway, gene expression profiles of each of transplanted tumor tissues in the primary site or in the metastatic site were analyzed by systems biology analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Ingenuity Systems, Inc., Redwood City, CA).  As a result, RhoA signaling pathway emerged as the critical molecular pathway in the metastatic tumor compared to the primary tumor. Identification of metastasis-related genes and metastasis-related pathway in squamous cell carcinoma

DESIGN
Extraction of difference of gene expression level between high-metastatic subline (HOC313-LM) and low-metastatic subline (HOC313-P)
