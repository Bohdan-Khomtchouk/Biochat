TITLE
Expression data from bovine nucleus pulposus interverteral disc cells

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Assessment of the putative differential gene expression profiles in high osmolality-treated bovine nucleus pulposus intervertebral disc cells for a short (5 h) and a long (24 h) time period. Identification of novel genes up- or down-regulated as an early or a late response to hyperosmotic stress. A 5 and 24 h-hyperosmotic treatment of nucleus pulposus cells led to transcriptional changes in > 100 and 200 genes, respectively.

DESIGN
Nucleus pulposus intervertebral disc cells were exposed to hyperosmotic stress for 5 and 24 h before RNA extraction and transcriptomics analysis. Three biological replicates were tested for each condition. Selected genes found to be differentially expressed were validated by RT-qPCR. Functional experiments were performed in order to assess the role of specific proteins encoded by genes found to be up-regulated in the osmo-reguatory response of intervertebral disc cells.
