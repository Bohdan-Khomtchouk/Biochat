TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of WT and NOD1 knockout zebrafish (mTor)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zebrafish larvae from WT and NOD1-1IS-/- collected at 10 dpf were used for Zebrafish mTOR Signaling RT² Profiler™ PCR Array.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. Larvae from WT and NOD1-deficient zebrafish were collected at 10 dpf.Three biological replicates were performed for the WT and NOD1-deficient zebrafish. 200~250 larvae per replicate were pooled and used for gene expression analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL21768 zebrafish mTOR Signaling RT² Profiler™ PCR Array (Qiagen)
