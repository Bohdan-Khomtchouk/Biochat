TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of gene expression and transcription factors binding reveals new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation during Drosophila spermatogenesis [DamID]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To investigate the mechanisms of gene regulation during Drosophila spermatogenesis, we obtained genome-wide binding profiles of the proteins involved in gene regulation during drosophila spermatogenesis using germline-specific DamID-Seq approach.

DESIGN
DamID-Seq protein binding profiling of Comr, Can, CG9879, Mip40 in germline cells of WT Drosophila testes. We also performed DamID profiling of Mip40 and Polycomb at the different developmental stages of male germ cells, using testes of bam-, aly- and can-mutants. For every experiment Dam-alone control was performed. Experiments were performed in replicates.
