TITLE
The transcriptome of ejaculates used for successful/failed in vitro-fertilization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the transcriptome obtained from microarray analysis of human ejaculates used in an IVF programme. The gene expression profiles are to be correlated with successful/failed induction of oocyte fertilisation and/or pregnancy. Since human ejaculates are often contaminated with so-called 'round cells' (mostly somatic cells such as leukocytes and macrophages, but also immature germ cells), a considerable part of the gene expression pertains not to spermatozoa. Rigorous statistical analysis of the data is to be used to extract genes that correlate with fertilization success.

DESIGN
A set of 25 human ejaculates (12 pregnancy; 3 biochemical pregnancy; 7 oocyte fertilization; 3 no oocyte fertilization) from an IVF procedure were used for RNA extraction and microarray hybridization.
