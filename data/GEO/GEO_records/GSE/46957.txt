TITLE
TAL1 regulated miRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling of Jurkat T-ALL cells after knockdown with two control shRNAs and two shRNAs targeting TAL1 to identify miRNAs that are regulated by TAL1

DESIGN
miRNA profiling using Exiqon arrays 48hrs after transduction of Jurkat cells with two control shRNAs (pLKO1-GFP and pLKO1-LUCIFERASE) vs two shRNAs targeting TAL1 (pLKO1-shRNA1 and pLKO1-shRNA2). Biological duplicates per shRNA. One replicate per array.Total of 8 arrays.

PLATFORM
