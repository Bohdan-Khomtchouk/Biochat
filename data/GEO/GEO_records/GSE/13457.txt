TITLE
Effect of the different protein diets on the intestinal ecosystem

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
This study examines the evidence that dietary can regulate genes in the intestinal epithelium and it discusses the physiologic relevance of such alterations in gene expression.

DESIGN
Seven RNA samples were analyzed  using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Porcine Genome Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) containing 23,937 probe sets that interrogate approximately 23,256 transcripts from 20,201 S. scrofa genes.
