TITLE
Claudin 1 mediates TNFα-induced gene expression and cell migration in human lung carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important mechanism in carcinogenesis. To determine the mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of EMT is crucial to develop new biomarkers and therapeutic targets towards cancers. In this study, when TGFß1 and TNFa were used to induce EMT in human lung carcinoma A549 cells, we were surprised to find an increase in an epithelial cell tight junction marker, Claudin 1. We further identified that it was the TNFa and not the TGFß1 that induced the fibroblast-like morphology changes. TNFa also caused the increase in Claudin-1 gene expression and protein levels in Triton X-100 soluble cytoplasm fraction. Down-regulation of Claudin-1, using small interfering RNA (siRNA), inhibited 75% of TNFa-induced gene expression changes. Claudin-1 siRNA effectively blocked TNFa-induced molecular functional networks related to inflammation and cell movement. Wound-healing assay showed that Claudin-1 siRNA was able to significantly reduce TNF-enhanced cell migration. Furthermore, over expression of Claudin 1 with a Claudin 1-pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector enhanced cell migration. In conclusion, these observations indicate that Claudin 1 acts as a critical signal mediator in TNFa-induced gene expression and cell migration in human lung cancer cells. Further analyses of these cellular processes may be helpful in developing novel therapeutic strategies.

DESIGN
4 groups (with or without TNFα, control or Claudin 1 siRNA) of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells with 3 replicates per group.
