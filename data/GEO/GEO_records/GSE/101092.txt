TITLE
RNA Sequencing looking at differential gene expression between p65+/+ and p65-/-  mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We look at differential gene expression between immortalized p65+/+ and p65-/- MEFs to identify potential NF-kB regulated genes which when grouped based on biological function indicates candidates involved in protecting p65+/+ cells from macrophage-mediated killing

DESIGN
Examination of differential gene expression between two cell types either in the presence or absence of p65

PLATFORM
GPL21103 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)
