TITLE
Logjam p24 mutant microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide profiling experiments on tissues from Drosophila melanogaster adult females with a mutation in the p24 gene logjam (loj) to test the hypothesis that loss of loj function causes a transcriptional response characteristic of ER stress activation. Keywords: logjam mutant compared to control

DESIGN
We compared expression profiles from loj mutant females to those of controls. We compared mutant and control abdomen tissue as well as mutant and control tissue preparations from the remainder of the fly (the head/thorax). Three mutant and three control RNA samples for each set of tissue were used for array hybridization (12 total array samples).
