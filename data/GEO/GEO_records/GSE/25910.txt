TITLE
Adipose Tissue MicroRNAs as Regulators of CCL2 Production in Human Obesity (differentiation data)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used an unbiased systems biology approach to study the regulation of gene expression in human adipose tissue focusing on inflammation. We show that microRNAs play a major role as regulators of CCL2 production in obesity.

DESIGN
Subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained from healthy subjects undergoing cosmetic liposuction (n=12). There was no selection for age, sex or BMI. From the tissue, we isolated preadipocytes and in vitro differentiated them to adipocytes. The cells were lysed at day 4/5 (early), 8 (middle) and 12 (late) of differentiation. From the samples, we prepared and hybridised biotinylated complementary RNA to GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Pre-processing was performed using the Affymetrix Expression Console version 1.1 and the following settings: Summarization: PLIER; Background Correction: PM-GCBG; Normalization: Global Median.
