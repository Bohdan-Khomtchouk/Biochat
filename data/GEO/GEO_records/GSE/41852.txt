TITLE
Protein interactions within PLEIOHOMEOTIC-repressive complex are critical for its recruitment to Polycomb target genes (Fruit Fly)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
PcG proteins are critical epigenetic regulators of development. Here we have determined genomic distributions of PHO, PHOL and SFMBT proteins in cultured Drosophila cells by hybridization of ChIP products with tiling microarrays.
