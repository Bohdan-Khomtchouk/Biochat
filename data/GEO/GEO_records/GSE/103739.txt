TITLE
Expression profiling analyses of ECF sigma factor PG0162-PG1660 mutant of Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Porphyromonas gingivalis W83

SUMMARY
The role of ECF sigma factors PG0162, PG01660 were involved in virulence regulationin Porphyromonas gingivalis was published Yuetan Dou, Devon Osbourne, Rachelle McKenzie, Hansel M Fletcher. (2010) Involvement of extracytoplasmic function sigma factors in virulence regulation in Porphyromonas gingivalis W83. FEMS Microbiology Letter, 312(1):24-32.

DESIGN
To study the expression profile of ECF sigma factor PG0162-PG1660 mutant under hydrogen peroxide stress conditions compared to the wild-type W83 by using RNA-Seq.

PLATFORM
