TITLE
Basal and IL-4 response in DAP12 (TYROBP) KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DAP12 is a transmembrane protein, expressed as a disulfide-bonded homodimer and bears an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). DAP12 is broadly expressed in hematopoietic cells and associates with a variety of cell surface receptors in lymphoid and myeloid cells. Macrophages express several DAP12-associated receptors including triggering receptors expressed by myeloid cells (TREM)-1,2 and 3, myeloid DAP12-associating lectin (MDL)-1, CD200R like proteins CD200R3/R4 and CD300C/D/E . Keywords: Cell type comparison

DESIGN
The current experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of DAP12 knockdown on macrophage gene expression, both in basal conditions and in the response to IL-4.
