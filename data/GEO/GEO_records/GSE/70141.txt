TITLE
Regulation of nucleosome positioning by a CHD Type III chromatin remodeller and its relationship to developmental gene expression in Dictyostelium [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Dictyostelium discoideum

SUMMARY
We utilized RNA-seq to profile expression levels in wild type Ax2 cells and a mutants for ChdC a member of a family of ATP-depedent chromatin remodellers in Dictyostelium discoideum. Total RNA was polyA enriched and sequenced at two stages of development: in the growth stage (0H) and loose mound stage of development (10-12H)

DESIGN
Looking at mRNA levels in Ax2 and chdC- cells
