TITLE
Global gene expression in the adult Gata6 null mouse pancreas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the global gene expression of mouse pancreatic cells in a pancreas-specific conditional knock-out mouse for Gata6, as compared with age-matched controls. Total RNA was extracted from the pancreas of 6-8 -week old mice of the two genotypes and analyzed. at this age, Gata6P-/- pancreata are histologically normal, but the acinar differentiation programme is already altered. we observe that loss of Gata6 causes the de-repression of ectopic non-pancreatic genes, as well as some genes involved in the mesenchymal programme.

DESIGN
mRNA extracted from the pancreas of 4 controls and 4 Gata6P-/- mice was sequenced.
