TITLE
Identification of miR-3189-regulated genes in HCT116 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profiles regulated by miR-3189. The hypothesis in this study is that miR-3189 controls cell growth by regulating the expression of subset of genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from HCT116 cells transfected with miR-3189 mimics or control siRNA for 48hr.
