TITLE
cDNA microarray analysis of human keratinocytes cells of patients submitted to chemoradiotherapy and oral low level laser therapy. Pilot study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study investigated possible molecular changes in the oral mucosa of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  patients submitted to chemoradiotherapy with and without low-level laser therapy  by cDNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Patients were randomized in the laser group (LG) and placebo (PG), with 4 patients in LG and 3 patients in PG with 2 techical replicates each in a non-stratified manner and underwent the same protocol of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Samples were collected after the 10th day of CRT and laser treatment or placebo and were analyzed using Affymetrix Gene 1.0 ST array.
