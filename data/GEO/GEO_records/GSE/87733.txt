TITLE
Expression data from Men1 knockout MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type1 (MEN1), an inherited autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by the development of endocrine tumors including NETs, results from mutation in the MEN1 gene that encodes the protein menin. In mouse models, heterozygous loss of Men1 leads to multiple endocrine tumors with loss of heterozygocity at the Men1 locus. Men1 interacts with several partners to regulate cellular processes and gene expression through regulating histone modification. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression change in Men1 knockout MEFs and identified up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Men1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts complemented with vector or Men1 were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain downstream target genes regulated by menin.
