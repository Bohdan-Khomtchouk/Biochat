TITLE
Methylation Changes in Arabidopsis seed development

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
There are four major seed developmental phases in Arabidopsis seed development: morphogenesis, maturation, dormancy and germination. What methylation changes occurring in the different phases, if any, remains unknown. To uncover the possible role of DNA methylation in different parts of the seed, we characterized the methylome of four major seed developmental phases of Arabidopsis using Illumina sequencing: global stage (glob) and linear cotyledon stage (lcot) for morphogenesis phase; mature green stage (mg) and post mature green stage (pmg) for maturation phase; dry seed (dry) for dormancy phase; leaves (leaf) from 4 week plant for vegetative tissues.

DESIGN
Illumina sequencing of bisulfite-converted genomic DNA from six seed developmental stages in Arabidopsis: global stage (glob), linear cotyledon stage (lcot), mature green stage (mg), post mature green stage (pmg), dry seed (dry) and leaves (leaf) from 4 week plant.

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
