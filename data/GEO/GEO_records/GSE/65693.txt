TITLE
Gene expression data from LCMV-specific WT and Tcf7-/- follicular T helper cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We did microarray experiments to elucidate the transcriptome changes due to TCF-1 deficiency in Tfh cells. These data clearly demonstrate that Tfh-associated genes were down-regulated in TCF-1-null Tfh cells, whereas Th1-associated signatures were up-regulated, indicating that TCF-1 initiates the Tfh fate by directly strengthening Tfh signatures while suppressing Th1-associated genes.

DESIGN
We first sorted WT and TCF-1-null Tfh cells (2 samples per group, each sample was pooled from 4 mice) at day 8 after LCMV Armstrong infection. Then, we extracted RNA, which were subsequently sent to microarray analysis.
