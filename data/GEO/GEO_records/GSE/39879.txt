TITLE
FoxA1 specifies unique androgen and glucocorticoid receptor binding events in prostate cancer cells (HTS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the androgen receptor recruitment to the chromatin of androgen responsive prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP-1F5 and VCaP in response to physiological androgen 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) using ChIP-sequencing. We compare the AR recruitment by DHT to that by partial agonist/antagonist cyproterone acetate (CPA), mifepristone (RU486) and bicalutamide (Bica) in LNCaP-1F5 cells. We also report the role of glucocorticoid receptor recruitment in presence of dexamethasone (Dex) in androgen responsive prostate cancer cells. The AR and GR cistrome analysis is subsequently compared with gene expression data and RNA Pol II analysis. The ChIP-seq has been performed using AR, GR, RNA Pol II antibodies.

DESIGN
Examination of AR and GR binding sites in LNCaP-1F5 and VCaP cells in presence of DHT and Dex respectively. Further analysis of AR binding sites in LNCaP-1F5 cells treated with partial agonist/antagonists, CPA, RU486 and Bica. Additionally RNA Pol II mapping is performed in cells treated with DHT and Dex.
