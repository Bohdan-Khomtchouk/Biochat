TITLE
gene profiling in carcinoma cell during EMT

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Modulation of several waves of gene expression during FGF-1 induced Epithelial-mesenchymal transition of carcinoma cells . In vitro FGF-1 induced EMT study using NBTII rat bladder carcinoma cells Keywords: time course ; EMT ; cancer cell line ; FGF-1

DESIGN
NBTII and NBTII-FGFR1 cells were induced by FGF-1. Total RNA were prepared from stimulated and control cells at time 0.5, 2, 6, 24 and 48 hours. Except for control and 0.5 hour stimulated cells, the experiment was done in duplicate for each cell line type
