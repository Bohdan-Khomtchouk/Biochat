TITLE
Somatic copy number variants in monozygotic twins and elderly single-born individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We perfomed copy number analysis of young and old monozygotic twin pairs and young and old single-born individuals to identify somatic copy number changes that occur with age in blood DNA.

DESIGN
DNA from peripheral blood was run on Illumina genotyping arrays and the R and B-allele-frequency data were used to identify somatic copy number events. The young Samples were omited because all young twins lacked CNVs in the > 1 megabase range.
