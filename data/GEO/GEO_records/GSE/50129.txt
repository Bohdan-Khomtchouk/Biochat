TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Runx3 bound regions in IL-2-activated splenic NK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq was conducted using splenic WT NK cells cultured for 7 days with IL-2 using anti-Runx3 antibodies (Ab), anti-H3K4me1 Ab and non-immune serum (NIS) as control.

DESIGN
Two biological Runx3, one H3K4me1 and two NIS IP repeats from splenic NK cells isolated from individual mice by negative selection using NK cell isolation kit (R & D) cultured with IL-2.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
