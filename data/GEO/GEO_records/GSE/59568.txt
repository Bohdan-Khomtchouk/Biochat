TITLE
Gene expression analysis compared myxoid liposarcoma tissue with normal fat tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify molecular biomakers that are useful for diagnosis and its targeting treatment, we compared the gene expression profile of myxiod liposarcoma with that of normal fat tissue.

DESIGN
In the present study, we studied about gene expression profiles comparing 6 non-preoperative myxoid liposarcoma with 3 normal fat tissue.
