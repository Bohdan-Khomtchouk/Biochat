TITLE
Oviductal transcriptome is modified after insemination during spontaneous ovulation in the sow

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Gene Expression Microarray technology was used to compare oviduct transcriptome between inseminated and non-inseminated pigs during spontaneous oestrus. We used an in vivo model approaching the study from a physiological point of view in which no hormonal treatment (animals were in natural oestrus) and no artificial sperm selection (selection was performed within the female genital) were imposed. It is therefore emphasised that no surgical introduction of spermatozoa and no insemination at a site other than the physiological one were used. This approach revealed 17 genes that were two-fold or more up-regulated in oviducts exposed to spermatozoa and/or developing embryos and 9 genes that were two-fold or more down-regulated. These changes would indicate a modification of the environment preparing the oviduct for a successful fertilization and for an adequate embryo early development. The objective of this study was to investigate differences in oviductal transcriptome between inseminated and non-inseminated pigs during spontaneous oestrus in a specific area of the oviduct (ampullary-isthmic junction). We decided to analyse this specific part of the oviduct where spermatozoa released from sperm reservoir arrive close to the time of ovulation because it is where fertilization and zygote formation occurs.

DESIGN
We used 5 artificially inseminated and 5 non-inseminated pigs during spontaneous oestrus. Inseminations were performed with seminal doses at a concentration of 3 x 107 spermatozoa/ml. Complete oviductal tissue samples from the ampullary-isthmic junction (sample size > 1cm including the end of the ampulla) were taken from each animal and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for mRNA extraction.
