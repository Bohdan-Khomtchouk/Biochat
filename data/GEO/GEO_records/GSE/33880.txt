TITLE
Expression data from the T84 human intestinal epithelial cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epithelial cells of the intestine respond to IFN-gamma, which is a critical regulator of the inflammatory response.  Here we sought to determine the impact that this cytokine has on epithelial cell gene expression in an in vitro inflammation model.

DESIGN
T84 cells were treated with IFN-gamma for 0, 6, or 18 hrs for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
