TITLE
Kc167 ORC Localization in hydroxyurea (HU)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Determination of the genome-wide distribution of ORC by chromatin immunoprecipitation in the Drosophila Kc167 cell line at the beginning of S phase.  Kc167 cells were arrested at the G1/S transition with hydroxyurea (HU).  Goal was to test whether the ORC binding distribution remained the same between G1 and S.

DESIGN
ChIP-Chip of ORC in HU compared to input genomic DNA.  Biological Replicates: 1
