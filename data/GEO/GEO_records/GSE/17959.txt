TITLE
Gene expression profiles from nandrolone-treated rats with denervation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We showed that nandrolone attenuated subacute, but not acute, denervation atrophy and upregulation of MAFbx. The present study explored the molecular determinants for this time-dependent effect using microarray analysis to identify genes that were differentially regulated by administration of nandrolone for 7 days beginning either concomitantly with denervation (7 days) or 29 days later (35 days)

DESIGN
The analysis used gastrocnemius muscle from male Wistar-Hannover rats that had undergone left sciatic nerve transaction followed by the administration of nandrolone or vehicle beginning either on the day of surgery or 29 days thereafter.  Animals had been sacrificed 7 days after starting nandrolone (Nan) or vehicle (Veh) (e.g, at days 7 or 35).
