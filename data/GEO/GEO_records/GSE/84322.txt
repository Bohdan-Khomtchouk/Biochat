TITLE
Transcriptome Sequencing of Adipose-Derived Mesechymal Stromal Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-sequencing to determine the abundance of all RNA transcripts expressed by adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AMSC) under proliferating and confluent conditions.

DESIGN
AMSCs were plated at 3,000 cells/cm2 in growth media and incubated at 37Â°C, 5% CO2. Proliferating samples were harvested when cells were 70% confluent, and confluent samples were collected at 100% confluence. Following RNA extraction, RNA-sequencing was performed to evaluate differential transcript abundence between proliferating and confluent samples.
