TITLE
Expression data in WT and ES cells overexpressing Satb1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Satb1 and Satb2 are regulators of higher order chromatin in T cells and osteoblasts repectively. We were interested if Satb1 and Satb2 play a role in the regulation of gene expression in ES cells. ES cells which can inducibly express Satb1 or Satb2 were generated using the tet-ON system. In this experiment, we compared gene expression in uninduced cells to that in cells which had been induced for 24h to express Satb1 ectopcially at very high levels.

DESIGN
Cells were cultured, passaged every 3 days. After trypsinisation cells were grown for 1 day in the presence of LIF only, after 1 day a set of cultures was induced by the addition of DOX to the culture medium. Induction took place for 24h, RNA was generated 48h after passaging.
