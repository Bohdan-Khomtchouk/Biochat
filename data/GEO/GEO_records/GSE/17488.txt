TITLE
Expression data in WT and ES cells overexpressing Satb1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Satb1 and Satb2 are regulators of higher order chromatin in T cells and osteoblasts repectively. We were interested if Satb1 and Satb2 play a role in the regulation of gene expression in ES cells. ES cells which can inducibly express Satb1 or Satb2 were generated using the tet-ON system. In this experiment, we compared gene expression in uninduced cells to that in cells which had been induced for 24h to express Satb1 ectopcially at very high levels.
