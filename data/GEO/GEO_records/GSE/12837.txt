TITLE
Gene expression in human myeloid cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human myelopoiesis is an exciting biological model for cellular differentiation since it represents a plastic process where pluripotent stem cells gradually limit their differentiation potential, generating different precursor cells which finally evolve into distinct terminally differentiated cells. This study aimed at investigating the genomic expression during myeloid differentiation through a computational approach that integrates gene expression profiles with functional information and genome organization. The genomic distribution of myelopoiesis genes was investigated integrating transcriptional and functional characteristics of genes. The analysis of genomic expression during human myelopoiesis using an integrative computational approach allowed discovering important relationships between genomic position, biological function and expression patterns and highlighting chromatin domains, including genes with coordinated expression and lineage-specific functions. The RMA normalized data, analyzed using Bioconductor packages and RMA pre-processing procedure are available as a supplementary file on the Series record.

DESIGN
The gene expression dataset obtained by our laboratory was enriched including third party expression data, from a public repository. Final gene expression dataset includes 24 experiments for 8 different cell types of the human myelopoietic lineage, which were used to generate an integrated myelopoiesis dataset.
