TITLE
Genome-wide maps of histone modification and chromatin remodeler binding in acute myeloid leukemia blast cells and normal hematopoietic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing to map regions of chromatin remodeler binding accompanied by histone modification state. We have used this data to distinguish between the transcriptional state of regulatory genes in leukemic and normal hematopoietic cells, and thus understand contribution of the chromatin remodeler towards leukemogenesis.

DESIGN
Binding profiles of 2 different histone modifications, H3K27ac and H3K27me3, and the core ATP-ase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler, in duplicate, in blast cells derived from 3 different AML patients, and normal hematopoietic cells derived from 1 healthy individual, used as the control.
