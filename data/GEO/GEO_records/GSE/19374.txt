TITLE
Expression data from mouse bone marrow derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophages phagocytose bacteria. Certain pathogenic bacteria access and replicate within the cytosol of infected macrophages and induce changes in macrophage gene expression by triggering of innate immune receptors and/or the effects of bacterial virulence factors. We used microarray analysis to identify changes in macrophage gene expression following infection with Listeria monocytogenes.

DESIGN
Macrophages were cultured from bone marrow of female C57BL/6 mice using 10% L-cell conditioned media and mock infected (3 chips) or infected with log phase L. monocytogenes (2 chips). Samples were harvested for RNA isolation at 10 h after infection. Supplementary file below reports Genesifter-processed data: mean ( " P " only) signal intensities and SEM for the MOCK and LM_INF groups.
