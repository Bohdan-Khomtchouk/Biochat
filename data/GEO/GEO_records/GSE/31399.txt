TITLE
Optimized amplification and single-cell analysis identify GnRH-mediated activation of Rap1b in primary rat gonadotropes.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Identifying the early gene program induced by GnRH would help understand how GnRH-activated signaling pathways modulate gonadotrope secretory response. We previously analyzed GnRH-induced early genes in LbT2 cells, however these lack GnRH self-potentiation, a physiological attribute of gonadotropes. To minimize cellular heterogeneity, rat primary pituitary cultures were enriched for gonadotropes by 40-60% using a sedimentation gradient. Given the limited number of gonadotropes, RNA was amplified prior to microarray analysis. Thirty-three genes were up-regulated 40 minutes after GnRH stimulation. Real-time PCR confirmed regulation of several transcripts including fosB, c-fos, egr-2 and rap1b, a small GTPase and member of the Ras family. GnRH stimulated rap1b gene expression in gonadotropes, measured by a sensitive single cell assay. Immunocytochemistry revealed increased Rap1 protein in GnRH-stimulated gonadotropes. These data establish rap1b as a novel gene rapidly induced by GnRH and a candidate to modulate gonadotropin secretion in rat gonadotropes.

DESIGN
Primary rat gonadotrope cells were exposed to 10 nM GnRH for 40 min, then harvested and processed for RNA extraction using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A total of 12 Affymetrix Rat Expression Array 230 v2.0, namely 6 GnRH-treated and 6 vehicle-treated samples, each containing 31,000 gene clusters, were used. Data analysis was performed by Affymetrix GeneChip Operating System (GCOS). A gene was considered to be up-regulated by GnRH if there is at least 50% concordance across multiple pairwise comparisons of GnRH- vs. vehicle-treated microarrays, and if the fold-change was at least 1.50.
