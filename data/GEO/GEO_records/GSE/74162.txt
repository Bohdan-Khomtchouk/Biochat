TITLE
genome-wide profiling of microRNA in PTSD with comorbid depression (PTSD

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to examine genome-wide differential expression profiles of miRNA in PTSD & Dep cases versus controls

DESIGN
Examined differential expression of miRNAs in 16 cases of PTSD & Dep versus 7 controls with no PTSD and no depression
