TITLE
Gene expression data from Muscle Longissimus dorsi sample of F2 animals

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In this study, we used correlation analysis of the expression profiles and drip loss to produce a list of functional candidate genes under the assumption that genes with strong correlation between their expression values and drip belong to pathways or networks relevant for the control of the trait. Expression QTL analyses for transcripts showing trait dependent expression were done in order to identify genes which show trait associated expression, map to pQTL regions, and exhibit cis regulation. Keywords: Corrrelation and association
