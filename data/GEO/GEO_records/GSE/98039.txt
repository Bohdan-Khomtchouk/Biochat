TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of chickens during dietary methionine restriction reveals compromised immune competency

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare next-generation sequencing (NGS)-derived liver and pectoralis major transcriptome profilings (RNA-seq) of chicken fed control diet to treatment birds fed methionine restriction diet. We sequenced mRNA from 10 Gallus gallus males fed either control (L-Methionine) or L-Methionine-deficient diet (5 control and 5 treatment) from 3-5 weeks of age. We sequenced both liver and the pectoralis major muscle.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in liver and pectoralis major of male Gallus gallus fed either regular (L-Methionine) or L-methionine-deficient diet.
