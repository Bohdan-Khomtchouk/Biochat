TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of a NaCl-resistant Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant obtained by evolutionary engineering

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
NaCl-resistant Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant was obtained by evolutionary engineering. EMS mutagenized culture was used as the initial population for the selection procedure. Gradually increasing levels of NaCl stress was applied through 40 successive batch cultivations. The reference strain could not grow even at 0.85 M NaCl whereas this mutant was shown to be resistant up to 1.45 M NaCl concentration. Whole-genome microarray analysis was used to identify the NaCl resistance mechanisms by comparing NaCl-resistant mutant strain and the reference strain in the absence of NaCl stress.
