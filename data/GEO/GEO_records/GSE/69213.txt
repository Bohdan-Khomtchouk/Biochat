TITLE
Predicting drug response in human prostate cancer from preclinical analysis of in vivo mouse models (II)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptome of allografted mouse tumors after treatment with rapamycin and PD0325901. Nkx3.1CreERT2/+; Ptenflox/flox; KrasLSL-G12D/+ (NPK mice) were induced and their tumors removed to generate allograft lines by implanting a 1.5 mm3 tumor fragment in the subcutaneous space of athymic nude mice. Allografted NPK tumors were allowed to grow until they reached a volume of 1 cm3, at which moment they were randomly assigned to either vehicle (Veh) or combination therapy using rapamycin and PD0325901 (RAPPD). Allografted mice were administered rapamycin (10 mg/kg) and PD0325901 (10 mg/kg) during five consecutive days (Allo SHORT). Mice were euthanized in the fifth day 6 hours after having received the last treatment and the tumors were harvested and snap frozen for subsequent molecular analysis.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from prostate tumors/tissues. Prostate tumors/tissues were harvested and processed for RNA isolation and transcriptome analysis using the MagMAX RNA isolation kit (Ambion). Total RNA was amplified and labelled for subsequent microarrays hybridization using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit.

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
