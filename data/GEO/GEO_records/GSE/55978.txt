TITLE
Exosomes secreted by a nematode parasite transfer small RNAs to mammalian cells and regulate genes of the innate immune system [Heligmosomoides polygyrus]

ORGANISM
Heligmosomoides polygyrus

SUMMARY
In mammalian systems, extracellular small RNAs can operate in a paracrine manner to communicate information between cells, relying on transport within vesicles. “Foreign” small RNAs derived from bacteria, plants and parasites have also been detected in mammalian body fluids, sparking interest in whether these could mediate inter-species communication. However, there is no mechanistic framework for RNA-mediated interspecies communication and the active movement of RNA via vesicles has not been shown outside of mammals. Here we demonstrate that specific microRNAs and Y RNAs are packaged into vesicles secreted by a gastrointestinal nematode, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, which naturally infects mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the secretion product of adult worms and compared to the profile of small RNAs in adult worms, eggs and infective larvae.
