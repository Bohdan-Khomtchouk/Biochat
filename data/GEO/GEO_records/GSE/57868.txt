TITLE
Accumulation of inorganic polyphosphate mediates metabolic downshift and antibiotic tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551

SUMMARY
The stringent response, involving the regulatory molecules inorganic polyphosphate (poly P) and (p)ppGpp, is believed to mediate Mycobacterium tuberculosis persistence. In this study, we identified a novel exopolyphosphatase responsible for poly P hydrolysis. Using two different poly P-accumulating M. tuberculosis recombinant strains, we found that increased poly P content drives the organisms into early growth arrest, and contributes to tolerance to the cell wall-active agent isoniazid, increased resistance to stress conditions, and improved survival in macrophages. Transcriptomic and metabolomics analysis revealed metabolic downshift manifested by reduced expression of the transcriptional and translational machinery, and shift from utilization of glucose as a carbon source. In summary, regulation of the poly P balance is critical for persister formation in M. tuberculosis.

DESIGN
The transcriptome of  poly P accumulation strains, Rv1026 knock-down and ppk1 knock-in were compared to empty vector strains by RNA-seq.
