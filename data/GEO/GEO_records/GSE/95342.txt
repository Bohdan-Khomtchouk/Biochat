TITLE
Epigenetics of Huntington's disease and control patient iPSC-derived neural cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to compare the epigenetic states of HD  and control patient iPSC-derived neural cells to identify differences in chromatin state. We performed ChIP-seq in these cell lines for H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K36me3 in these cell lines and found significant epigenetic differences between HD and control-derived cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K36me3 was performed in 4 HD iPSC-derived neural cell lines (2 biological replicates each from 2 patients) and 3 control cell lines.
