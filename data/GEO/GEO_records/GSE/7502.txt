TITLE
Effects of Aging and Calorie Restriction on the Global Gene Expression Profiles of Mouse Testis and Ovary

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
AGEMAP is an initiative of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) designed to study the aging process on mice with Caloric Restriction (CR) versus Ad Libitum (AL) diet. The aim of the AGEMAP project is to provide a valuable source of information about genetic influences involved in aging of the major organ systems. A total of 67 mice (C57BL/6) were sacrificed. Both male and female mice were divided in 7 categories based on the diet and the age. Four categories in ad libitum (1 month, 6 month,16 month and 24 month) and three categories in caloric restriction (6 month, 16 month and 24 month). In the current study we focused on gonads, using microarray hybridization (Agilent platform 44K array) to identify gene expression changes age-associated CR-associated, between young versus old mice at different time points.
