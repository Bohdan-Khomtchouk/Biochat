TITLE
Impact of Cux2 overexpression on gene expression in male and female mouse liver (Mus musculus)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified genes expressed in mouse liver that are regulated by Cux2, a highly female-specific liver transcription factor whose expression is regulated by sex-dependent plasma GH patterns.  Using adenovirus to overexpress Cux2 (Adeno-Cux2) in male liver, we show that Cux2 represses ~35% of male-biased genes and induces/de-represses ~35% of female-biased genes. Adeno-CMV was used as a control for adenoviral infection.  (Published in: TL Conforto et al 2012, Mol Cell Biol. 2012, 32:4611-4627. PubMed PMID: 22966202; PMCID: PMC3486175)

DESIGN
Liver RNA isolated from the following eight groups of mice was used in the present study:  (1) 8 wk old untreated male (M) mice (n = 10; 5 per each pool); (2) 8 wk old untreated female mice (F) mice (n = 11; 5 or 6 per each pool);  (3) 8 wk old male mice treated with Adeno-Cux2 and euthanized 5 days later (n = 12; 6 per each pool); (4) 8 wk old female mice treated with  Adeno-Cux2 and euthanized 5 days later (n = 8; 4 per each pool); (5) 8 wk old male mice treated with Adeno-CMV and euthanized 5 days later (n = 13; 6 or 7 per each pool); (6) 8 wk old female mice treated with Adeno-CMV and euthanized 5 days later (n = 7; 3 or 4 per each pool); (7) 8 wk old male mice treated with Adeno-Cux2 and euthanized 3 days later (n=11; 5 or 6 per each pool);  (8) 8 wk old  male mice treated with Adeno-CMV and euthanized 3 days later (n=11; 5 or 6 per pool).  These RNA pools were used in four separate sets of competitive hybridization experiments: 1) 8 wk untreated M vs. 8 wk untreated F; 2) 8 wk M + Ad-Cux2 (5 day) vs. 8 wk M + Ad-CMV (5 day); 3) 8 wk F + Ad-Cux2 (5 day) vs. 8 wk F +  Ad-CMV (5 day); 4) 8 wk M + Ad-Cux2 (3 day) vs. 8 wk M +  Ad-CMV (3 day).  Fluorescent labeling of RNA and hybridization of the Alexa 555-labeled (green) and Alexa 647-labeled (red) RNA samples to Agilent Mouse Gene Expression 4x44k v1 microarrays (Agilent Technology, Palo Alto, CA; catalog # G4122F-014868) were carried out, with dye swapping for each of the three hybridization experiments to eliminate dye bias.  Two microarrays, one for each mixed cDNA sample, were hybridized for each of the four fluorescent reverse pairs, giving a total of 8 microarrays.
