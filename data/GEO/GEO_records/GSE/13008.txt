TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of RNA Polymerase II binding sites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Protein coding genes and some of the non-coding RNA genes in eucaryotes are transcribed by RNA Polymerase II. A transcription machinery complex consists of RNA Pol II and many other proteins including transcription factors, activators and repressors of transcription. Pol II binding sites are found in actively transcribing genes and many which are not actively transcribing.
