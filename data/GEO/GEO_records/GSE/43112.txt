TITLE
Expression data comparing human DKK1 and control vector transfected murine osteochondrosarcoma cells (MOS-J)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Canonical Wnt signaling controls proliferation and differentiation of osteogenic progenitor cells, and tumor-derived secretion of the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) is correlated with osteolyses and metastasis in many bone malignancies. However, the role of Dkk1 in the oncogenesis of primary osteosarcoma (OS) remains unexplored. Here, we over-expressed Dkk1 in the OS cell line MOS-J. Contrary to expectations, Dkk1 had autocrine effects on MOSJ cells in that it increased proliferation and resistance to metabolic stress in vitro. In vivo, Dkk1 expressing MOS-J cells formed larger and more destructive tumors than controls.   These effects were attributed in part to up-regulation of the stress response enzyme and cancer stem cell marker aldehyde-dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1) through Jun-N-terminal kinase signaling. This is the first report linking Dkk1 to tumor stress resistance, further supporting the targeting of Dkk1 not only to prevent and treat osteolytic bone lesions but also to reduce numbers of stress-resistant tumor cells.

DESIGN
Two samples were analyzed, one human DKK1 transfected MOS-J cell sample and one control vector transfected MOS-J cell sample.
