TITLE
Expression data from mouse heart deficient of HDAC3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes in the heart of MCH3-KO mouse (HDAC3 f/f, Muscle Creatine Kinase-Cre) versus control WT mouse (HDAC3 f/f). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in cardiac development and function. We show here that mice deficient of HDAC3 in heart and skeletabl muscle are relatively normal on normal chow, but develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure that leads to death on high-fat diet. This microarray experiment is to explore the underlying molecular mechanism.

DESIGN
Hearts from 6-weeks old WT and MCH3-KO C57BL/6 mice (n=4 in each group, male) on normal chow were subjected to RNA extraction and Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0ST analysis.
