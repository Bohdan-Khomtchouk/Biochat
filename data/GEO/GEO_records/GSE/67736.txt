TITLE
Expression profiling of the TC32 Ewing sarcoma cell line following silencing of SUPT6H, SF3B1 or HNRNPH1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The investigation of the function of SUPT6H, SF3B1 and HNRNPH1 in Ewing sarcoma

DESIGN
The expression profiles of TC32 Ewing sarcoma cells were determine 48 hours post siRNA-transfected. Groups consisted of untreated cells (three samples), and negative control (siNeg) transfected-TC32 cells (six samples), and TC32 cells in which either SUPT6H, SF3B1 or HNRNPH1 were silenced; three different siRNAs corresponding to each gene were assessed separately.
