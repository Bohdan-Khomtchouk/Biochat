TITLE
Microgravity effect on C. elegans N2/VC (CERISE, 4 days)

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Microgravity effect on C. elegans gene expression was analysed by whole genome microarray. The worms were cultivated under microgravity for 4 days in the Japanese Module of the International Space Station.

DESIGN
C. elegans N2 was exposed microgravity for 4 days. The worms synchronously were cultivated from L1 larvae to adult. There are two control groups, onboard 1G and ground 1G control.
