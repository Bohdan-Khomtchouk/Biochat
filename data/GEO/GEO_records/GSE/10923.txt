TITLE
NAP provides neuroprotection against kainic acid-induced cell death

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
NAP - neuroprotective peptide demonstrates increase in neuronal survival when injected into the hippocampus of rats in the model of epilepsy Microarray analysis was used to understand the expression of genes following KA treatment and the changes in gene expression following KA+NAP treatment Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
KA was injected into the hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats. The other group of rats was injected with KA and NAP(10-13M). The third group was injected with NAP only and the last group was injected with PBS as a vehicle. CA3 area of hippocampus was removed 24h later and RNA extraction was done. The samples were subjected to microarray analysis.
