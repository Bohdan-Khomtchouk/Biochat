TITLE
Usp22 depletion in E14 mouse ESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse ESCs depleted of the epigenetic modifying enzyme Usp22 fail to differentiate properly.  Ectopic expresison of Usp22 results in spontaneous differnetiation. In order to understand the transcriptional program underlying this biological defect, whole genome expression analysis was performed.

DESIGN
E14 mESCs were infected with lentivirus containing shRNA targeting Usp22 or control (Luc).  RNA was extracted from both samples and subjected to expression analysis by affymetrix array.
