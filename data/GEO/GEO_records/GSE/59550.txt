TITLE
Ethnic specific genetic variation alters smoking associated DNA methylation at HIV co-receptor GPR15

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of smokers and non-smokers in PBMC samples. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.1  was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across  485,577 CpGs in PBMC samples. Samples included 24 smokers and 28 non-smokers.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 52 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.1

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
