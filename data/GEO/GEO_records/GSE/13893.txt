TITLE
Dynamic response of annexin A11-associated gene expression to cisplatin treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Based on a time-course study of cisplatin response in ovarian cancer cells with/without suppression of annexin A11 expression using whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays, we identified a set of differentially expressed genes associated with annexin A11 expression and patterns of gene expressions in response to cisplatin exposure. Keywords: human ovarian cancer cell lines

DESIGN
2008 cells (one ovarian cancer cell line) were transfected with ANXA11_RNAi or control_RNAi for 2 days and then treated with 10 ÂµM cisplatin (Sigma) for 0, 8, 16, 24 hours. Total RNA of 8 samples were prepared for gene expression profiling using the Agilent 44K whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays.

PLATFORM
