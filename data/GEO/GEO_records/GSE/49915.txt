TITLE
Transcriptomic analyses of TCDD treated zebrafish liver

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To fully understand molecular toxicity of TCDD in an in vivo animal model, adult zebrafish were exposed to TCDD at 10 nM for 96 h and the livers were sampled for RNA-sequencing based transcriptomic profiling. A total of 1,058 differently expressed genes were identified based on fold-change > 2 and TPM (transcripts per million) > 10. Among the top 20 up-regulated genes, 10 novel responsive genes were identified and verified by qRT-PCR analysis on independent samples. Transcriptomic analysis indicated several deregulated pathways associated with cell cycle, endocrine disruptors, signal transduction and immune systems. Comparative analyses of TCDD-induced transcriptomic changes between fish and mammalian models revealed that proteomic pathway is consistently up-regulated while calcium signaling pathway and several immune-related pathways are generally down-regulated.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiling of treated sample (TCDD) and control sample (DMSO) were generated by deep sequencing using 3' RNA-SAGE with SOLiD system
