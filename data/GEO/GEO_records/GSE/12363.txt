TITLE
H3K79 methylation profiles define murine and human MLL-AF4 leukemias

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We created a mouse model where conditional expression of physiologic levels of an Mll-AF4 fusion oncogene induces development of acute lymphoblastic (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Immunophenotypic and gene expression analysis of the ALL cells demonstrated bone marrow replacement with B-precursor cells which express a gene expression profile that has significant overlap with profiles in human MLL-rearranged ALL.
