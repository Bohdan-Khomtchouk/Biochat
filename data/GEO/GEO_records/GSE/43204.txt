TITLE
ICL0012 - Host response in human Calu-3 cells to infection with NS1trunc124: A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG4/2004 (H5N1) or WT: A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential expression was determined in Calu-3 cells between mock infected and infection with NS1trunc124: A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG4/2004 (H5N1) or WT: A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) at different times post infection.

DESIGN
Purpose: To obtain samples for transcriptional analysis in triplicate using the VN1203 pathogenicity mutant NS1-trunc124. Overview of Experiment: . Time Points: 0, 3, 7, 12, 18 and 24 hrs post infection. . Done in triplicate. . Triplicates are defined as 3 different wells, plated at the same time using the same cell stock for all replicates. . Time-matched mocks were done in triplicate from the same cell stock as the rest of the samples. . Culture medium (the same as what the virus stock is in) was used for the mock infections. Calu-3 cells were infected with NS1trunc124: A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG4/2004 (H5N1) or mock infected and samples were collected at 0, 3, 7, 12, 18 and 24 hpi. Calu-3 cells were infected with WT: A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) and samples were collected at 7 and 24 hpi. There are 3 mock (2 included here) and 3 infected replicates for each time point. Expression profiles were determined.
