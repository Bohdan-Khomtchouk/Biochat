TITLE
Global gene expression in adult cardiac fibroblasts transduced with cardiac transcription factor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Four transcription factors, GATA4, Hand2, MEF2C, Tbx5 (GHMT) activated cardiac gene expression in cardiac fibroblasts, suggesting that these factors are able to reprogram fibroblasts toward a cardaic cell fate.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from adult cardiac fibroblasts transduced with empty retroviral vector or GHMT-retroviruses for 2, and 4 weeks.
