TITLE
Expression data from LT-HSCs from bone marrow non-irradiated, 8Gy CDR and 8Gy FLASH total body irradiated mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total body irradiation (TBI) of mice using two dose rates, conventional dose rate (CDR) versus flash dose rate (FLASH), induced transient decrease of number of LT-HScs in bone marrow  and a total recovery of these cells 15 days after TBI We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the recovery of LT-HSCs and identified distinct classes of up or down- regulated genes according the modality of irradiation

DESIGN
LT-HScs were isolated  from bone marrow of non-irradiated, 8Gy CDR and 8Gy FLASH irradiated mice 15 days post-TBI for RNA extraction and hybridization on affymetrix microarrays.
