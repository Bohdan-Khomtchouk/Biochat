TITLE
Microbial and Functional Diversity within the Phyllosphere of Espeletia sp. in Andean High Mountain Ecosystems

ORGANISM
plant metagenome

SUMMARY
Functional profiles predicted based on taxonomic affiliations differed from those obtained by GeoChip microarray analysis, which separated community functional capacity based on plant location. The identified metabolic pathways provided insight regarding microbial strategies for colonization and survival in these ecosystems.

DESIGN
Sixteen samples analyzed.

PLATFORM
