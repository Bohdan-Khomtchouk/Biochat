TITLE
T-bet regulated genes in KG1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T-bet is pivotal for initiation and perpetuation of Th1 immunity. Identification of novel T-bet regulated genes is crucial for further understanding the biology of this transcription factor. By combining siRNA technology with genome-wide mRNA analysis, we sought to identify new T-bet regulated genes in IL-18-activated KG1 cells.

DESIGN
KG1 cells were transfected with either control-siRNA (siRNAc) or siRNA targeting T-bet (siRNA-Tbet) and thereafter stimulated with IL-18. Total RNA  was evaluated by genome-wide analysis using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Array System.
