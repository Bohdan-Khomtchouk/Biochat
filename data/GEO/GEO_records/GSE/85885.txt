TITLE
Global expression profile difference of  hiPSCs between hESCs and human Urine-Derived Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Compare difference Global expression profile of hiPSCs between hESCs and human Somatic cells, showing that hiPSCs and hESCs is consistent in lineages and indicated that the induce method is safe and reliable.

DESIGN
There are three groups of samples, each group has two repeated samples, hiPSCs respectively compared with hESCs and human Urine-Derived Cells.
