TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Primary Rat Oligodendrocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Oligodendrocytes undergo extensive changes as they differentiate from progenitors into myelinating cells. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this transformation, we performed a comparative analysis using gene expression profiling of A2B5+ oligodendrocyte progenitors and O4+ oligodendrocytes. Cells were sort-purified ex vivo from postnatal rat brain using flow cytometry. Using Affymetrix microarrays, 1707 transcripts were identified with a more than twofold increase in expression inO4+oligodendrocytes. Many genes required for oligodendrocyte differentiation were upregulated in O4+ oligodendrocytes, including numerous genes encoding myelin proteins. Transcriptional changes included genes required for cell adhesion, actin cytoskeleton regulation, and fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. At the O4+ stage, there was an increase in expression of a novel proline-rich transmembrane protein (Prmp). Localized to the plasma membrane, Prmp displays adhesive properties that may be important for linking the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton. Together, our results highlight the usefulness of this discovery-driven experimental strategy to identify genes relevant to oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Keywords: develepmental stage, oligodendrocyte differentiation

DESIGN
Whole brain dissociates were prepared from one litter of 10 male postnatal day 7 rat pups for each of the 5 A2B5 bioligcal replicates and the 4 O4+ bioligical replicates.  Total RNA was extracted from single A2B5+ and single O4+ cells sorted directly from postnatal day7 rat whole brain dissociates using flow cytometry.
