TITLE
Expression data from lung tumor and stromal cells of KrasTgfbr2 -/- mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent data suggests that repression of the Type II TGF-B Receptor (Tgfr2) repression in human lung adenocarcinoma is important for progression from noninvasive to invasive adenocarcinoma. To test this hypothesis in a animal model of non-invasive lung cancer, we generated an inducible, lung specific Tgfbr2 knockout model in the oncogenic Kras mouse. LSL-KrasG12D positive mice were simultaneously backcrossed to C57/Bl6 mice and to the Tgfbr2 flox/flox mice. To induce tumors, 100 ul of saline containing 3x10e10 particles of an adenovirus containing the Cre recombinase (Ad.Cre) was administered to each LSL-KrasG12D mouse intra-nasally.

DESIGN
We evaluated the tumor microenvironment response to Tgfbr2 deficient tumor cells.  We compared lung tumor cell and stromal cell transcriptional profiles from five-week KrasTgfbr2 -/-  and nine-week KrasTgfbr2 WT mice. We used mice at these time points to allow comparison of the stromal compartment of similarly advanced tumors.
