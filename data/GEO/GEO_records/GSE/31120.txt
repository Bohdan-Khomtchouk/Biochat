TITLE
Evaluation of the role of functional constraints on the integrity of an ultra conserved region in the genus Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Our results indicate that even in highly rearranged genomes like those of Diptera, unusually high levels of gene order conservation cannot be systematically attributed to functional constraints, which points to mechanisms more subtle and diverse than previously thought.

DESIGN
6 genotypes (REC, INV1, INV2, SIM1, REV1, and REV2) and 2 sexes (male and female) were investigated in this study, each with 3 biological replicates (A,B,and C), so a total of 36 (6x2x3) hybridizations were conducted. Differential analysis between genotypes or sexes were analyzed.
