TITLE
Collagen 1 Hydrogel Dynamic Loading Tests

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell viability and global gene expression was anayzed from collagen 1 hydrogel scaffolds following 3 hours of cyclic mechanical loading and compared with non-loaded scaffolds. Keywords: human dermal fibroblasts; dynamic cell culture; mechanical stress

DESIGN
6 samples are analyzed (2 sets in triplicate).  The first set is the Loaded condition in which Collagen 1 hydrogels seeded with Human dermal fibroblasts underwent cyclic loading of 0.1Hz for 180 minutes at 37 degrees Celsius.  The second set is the control Unloaded condition in which the Collagen 1 hydrogels seeded with Human dermal fibroblasts are incubated at 37 degrees Celsius with no loading.
