TITLE
Expression data from QY and QYRC cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We superinfected a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line (QGY-7703,QY) with oncolytic parvovirus H1 (H-1PV) and acquired a group of resistant cells QYRC. Previous studies suggested that cells surviving H-1PV superinfection should behave somewhat similarly to normal cells. When compared with the QGY-7703 cells, the QYRC cells indeed exhibited loss of colony formation in soft agar, and they didnâ€™t form detectable tumors after being hypodermically injected into 5 nude mice. In order to find out what cellular factors may be responsible for the loss of tumor cell phenotype, we compared the cDNA microarray profiles of the QGY-7703 and QYRC cells to find that a series of genes were upregulated in the H-1PV-resistant QYRC cells

DESIGN
We investigated the expression profiles of QY and QYRC cell lines.
