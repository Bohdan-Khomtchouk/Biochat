TITLE
FACS-sorted cells from Young Adults Vaccinated with Influenza TIV or LAIV Vaccines during 2008/09 Flu Season

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Systems vaccinology has emerged as an interdisciplinary field that combines systems wide measurements and network and predictive modeling applied to vaccinology. Here we used the systems vaccinology approach to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the innate responses to the trivalent inactivated influenza (TIV) and live attenuated influenza (LAIV) vaccination in humans, and to identify early gene signatures that predict the magnitude of the antibody responses to influenza vaccination.

DESIGN
During the 2008 influenza season, healthy adults were vaccinated with TIV (6 vaccinees) or LAIV (6 vaccinees), and blood samples isolated at day 0 and at day 7  post-vaccination. Cell subsets (B cells, Monocytes, mDCs and pDCs) were FACS-sorted from frozen PBMCs. Microarrays were performed using amplified total RNA.
