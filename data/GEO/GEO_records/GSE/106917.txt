TITLE
The impact of lncRNA LAST knockdown on gene expression profile in HCT116 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing was employed to analyze the genes whose expression are altered when lncRNA LAST is downregulated by shRNA in HCT116 cells. The Gencode Gene ID of lncRNA LAST is ENSG00000254682.1.

DESIGN
In order to identify the genes whose expression levels were changed under the condition of LAST knockdown,  we performed High-throughput sequencing and mRNA expression profile data analyzing.

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
