TITLE
Expression data from HUVEC adenovirally overexpressing MEF2C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor MEF2C is specifically induced by VEGF in endothelial cells. To delineate target genes of MEF2C in endothelial cells, which might be important during angiogenesis also, MEF2C was overexpressed adenovirally in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) over a period of 8 to 32 hours. Expression data should be compared to control infected cells, to discriminate against virally induced genes, and should be further compared to HUVECs infected with an adenovirus encoding for a dominant-negative form of MEF2.

DESIGN
HUVECs of the same batch, passage 3 were infected with Ad.con, Ad.MEF2C or Ad.DNMEF2 for 8, 16 or 32 hours for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
