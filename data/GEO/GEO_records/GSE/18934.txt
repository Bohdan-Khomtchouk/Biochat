TITLE
Gene expression in fetal mesenchymal stem cells for identification of epitopes suitable for non-invasive isolation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human mesenchymal stem cells circulate in 1st and early 2nd trimester fetal blood, but not in adults. Like other fetal cell types they cross the placenta, and can be found in maternal organs decades later. To determine potential ligands in human fetal mesenchymal stem cells not present in maternal blood, the gene expression of 1st trimester human fetal bone marrow, liver and blood derived mesenchymal stem cells will be compared to blood mononuclear cells from pregnant women using a Affymetrix human gene array system.

DESIGN
Human fetal bone marrow (3 samples), liver (3 samples) and blood derived mesenchymal stem cells (3 samples) compared to blood mononuclear cells (3 samples) from pregnant women

PLATFORM
