TITLE
[E-MTAB-369] Transcription profiling by array of Xenopus laevis embryos at 15 different stages

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of X.laevis development. The experiment were perfomed as a part of our Vertebrate Evo-Devo project. The aim of the project is to compare transcription profiles of normal (unmanipulated, wild-type, whole embryo) vertebrate embryos.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from wild type X.laevis whole embryos at 15 different stages (Stages:2, 5, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 23, 26, 28, 31, 37/38, 43, 48), and hybridized to  Affymetrix Xenopus laevis Genome 2.0 Array. All the stages contains data from 2 biological replications. Each staged-samples consists of pooled total RNA from several whole embryos.
