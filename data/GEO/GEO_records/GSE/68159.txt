TITLE
Gene expression changes in a histone sprocket arginine mutant in histone H2A R78A

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Examined gene expression changes in a histone H2A R78A mutant in Saccharomyces cerevisiae relative to wild-type cells. THe overall goal of this study was to determine the functions of histone 'sprocket' arginine residues, which insert into the DNA minor groove in the nucleosome. We examined the roles of sprocket arginine mutants in gene expression, histone incorporation, and DNA repair.
