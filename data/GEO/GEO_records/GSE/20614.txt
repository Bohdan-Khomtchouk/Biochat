TITLE
Gene expression profiling of mouse tumors arising from Keratin 6-positive mammary cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Conventional transgenic and knockout models do not allow selective introduction of oncogenic alterations into the progenitor population of mammary cells; thus, the role of progenitor cells in mammary tumorigenesis is yet unknown. By generating transgenic mice expressing tva – encoding the receptor for avian leukosis virus subgroup A (ALV/A) – from the Keratin 6a (K6) gene promoter,  we found that K6+ mammary cells are bipotential progenitor cells, but not stem cells.  These K6+ cells were readily induced to form tumors by intraductal injection of RCAS (an ALV/A-derived vector) carrying the gene encoding polyoma middle T antigen.  Compared with tumors induced by the same oncogene-expressing virus in transgenic mice expressing tva from the commonly used MMTV LTR or other murine models of breast cancer, tumors in this K6-tva line were unique in that they resemble the normal breast-like subtype of human breast cancer.  Consequently, these observations suggest that the cell of origin affects mammary tumor phenotypes.  This K6-tva model may be useful for preclinical testing of targeted therapy for normal-like breast cancers in patients. Keywords: Three group comparison

DESIGN
We carried out Affymetrix array analysis of five RCAS-PyMT-induced tumors each from K6-tva mice and MMTV-tva mice, as well as five mammary tumors from MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice.
