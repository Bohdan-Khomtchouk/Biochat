TITLE
Expression data of MIAPaCa-2 cells transfected with NDRG1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NDRG1 functions as a metastasis suppressor in pancreatic and other cancers. To determine the molecular function of NDRG1 in MIAPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells, we performed a whole genome gene array analysis on these cells stably transfected with NDRG1 when compared to empty vector-transfected controls. The differentially expressed genes indetified in this microarray may represent potential molecular targets of NDRG1 in pancreatic cancer.

DESIGN
Two separate RNA extracts of MIAPaCa-2 vector control and NDRG1 transfected cells were collected and hybridised to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 chips.
