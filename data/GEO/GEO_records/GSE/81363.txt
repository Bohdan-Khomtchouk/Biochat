TITLE
Investigation of gene expression alterations of pancreatic cancer caused by Deferasirox administration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the genetic effect of Deferasirox in pancreatic cancer, we examined gene expression alternations in the removed tumors exposed to Deferasirox.

DESIGN
Pancreatic cancer cells (BxPC-3) in culture were harvested and viable cells were injected subcutaneously into the backs of the mice. When tumor volumes reached 150 mm3, treatment began. The treatment group of mice received Deferasirox suspended in saline, which was administered by oral gavage every second day, with three treatments per week, over 21 days at concentrations of 200 mg/kg. The control mice were treated with the vehicle alone. At the end of the experiment, the mice were sacrificed and the tumors were excised and processed for genetic analyses. A total of 6 tumors were analyzed. Of these, 3 tumors were removed from vehicle-treated mice, and the other 3 tumors were removed from Deferasirox 200 mg/kg-treated mice.
