TITLE
Human microRNA (miRNA) expression during serum starvation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study aimed to identify the differentially regulated microRNAs during serum starvation. We identified miRNAs exhibiting altered expression in asynchronous, serum starved and serum re-supplemented human cells. We identified several miRNAs that were upregulated following serum starvation and downregulated upon serum re-supplementation.

DESIGN
Human cells were grown in serum free media for 48 h, after which cells were re-supplemented with fresh media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and further grown for 12 h. Asynchronously growing cells were used as control. Three-condition experiment: Asynchronous (control) vs. Serum starved vs. Serum Re-supplemented. Biological replicates: 2.
