TITLE
Expression profile of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment of FLT3-ITD and FLT3-ITD miR-155-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The miR-155-dependent differences in gene expression in the HSPC compartment of FLT3-ITD mice is unknown. In this experiment, we performed RNA sequencing on FLT3-ITD and FLT3-ITD miR-155-/- mouse LKS cells.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing was performed on RNA extracted from Lin-, cKit+, Sca1+ cells isolated via flow cytometry from FLT3-ITD and FLT3-ITD miR-155-/- mice. 3 samples were submitted for sequencing for each experimental group. Each sample contains RNA from 3 mice, in order to get enough RNA from this rare stem cell population.
