TITLE
AKT regulates de novo induction of Foxp3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells play an essential role in maintaining tolerance via their suppressive function on conventional T cells.  The intracellular signaling pathways that regulate Foxp3 expression are largely unknown.  In this study we describe a novel inhibitory role for AKT in regulating de novo induction of Foxp3 both in vivo and in vitro.  A constitutively active allele of AKT significantly diminished TGF-Ã¢ induced Foxp3 induction via a rapamycin-sensitive pathway, establishing a role for the AKT-mTOR axis in Treg cells. Moreover, the observed impairment in Foxp3 induction was paralleled by a selective downmodulation of the imparted Treg transcriptional signature highlighting the importance of the balance of intracellular signals in Treg differentiation .  Our results provide a basis for further elucidation of molecular mechanisms that regulate Foxp3 induction and identify AKT as an important negative regulator of this process.

DESIGN
All gene expression profiles were obtained from highly purified T cell populations sorted by flow cytometry. To reduce variability, cells from multiple mice were pooled for sorting, and three replicates were generated for all groups. RNA from 0.5-2.5 x 105 cells was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix M430v2 microarrays. Raw data were preprocessed with the RMA algorithm in GenePattern, and averaged expression values were used for analysis.
