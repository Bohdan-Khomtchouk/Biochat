TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of fatty acid synthase (FASN) gene silenced normal liver cells (THLE 2) using cDNA microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fatty acid synthase is a major enzyme involved in de novo lipogenesis, associated with energy homeostasis, lipid storage and signalling in normal liver cells. The effect of fatty acid synthase knockdown in normal liver cells (THLE 2) using siRNA mediated gene silencing were assesed for global gene deregulations. The deregulated metabolism, cell signalling and cell cycle pathway related gene expressions were analysed. Statistical significance values were also recorded. This expermental analysis clearly points to a important biochemical role for FASN in normal liver cell physiology.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the THLE 2 cells transfected with FASN siRNA at 48h, along with its untransfected control cells. cDNA converted samples were run on microarray platform- Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
