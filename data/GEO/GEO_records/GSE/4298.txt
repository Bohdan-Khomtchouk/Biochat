TITLE
Gene expression changes induced by paclitaxel in MCF7 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Time-dependent changes in gene expression induced by paclitaxel in the breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
The Oncochip microarray platform v1.1 contains 9,726 clones corresponding to 6,386 different genes, and it includes 2,489 duplicate clones. Duplicate samples from each condition (no treatment control, paclitaxel 8h, paclitaxel 48h) were labeled with dUTP-Cy5 and hybridized against dUTP-Cy3-labeled Universal Human Reference RNA.
