TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of SPARC(secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine)-responsive gene expression in HTR-8/SVneo cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SPARC is  a matricellular glycoprotein that plays critical roles in the pathologies associated with obesity and diabetes, as well as tumorigenesis. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of SPARC in the process of trophoblast invasion which shares many similarities with tumor cells invasion. Our results reveals that hormones, cell adhesion molecules, ECM molecules, growth factors and cytokines all are mediated by SPARC in EVT invasion.

DESIGN
HTR-8/SVneo cells were transfected with SPARC siRNA or a 25-nucleotide universal negative control siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were harvested and RNA was isolated using standard procedures.
