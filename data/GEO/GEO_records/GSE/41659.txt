TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae stress responses to HMF and furfural

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The inhibitors hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural were added to the feed-medium of carbon-limited anaerobic chemostat cultures. Samples were taken for transcriptome analysis at steady-state from cultures with inhibitors and without inhibitors.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates from each condition (inhibitors, no inhibitors) were analyzed.
