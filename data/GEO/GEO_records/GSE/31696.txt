TITLE
Genolyptus microarray studies of Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus globulus leaf and xylem tissues

ORGANISM
Eucalyptus spp. mixed library

SUMMARY
In order to pinpoint the most differentially expressed genes between Eucalyptus grandis leaf blades and vascular (xylem) tissues as well as between E. grandis and Eucalyptus globulus xylem tissues, a total number of nine 50mer-oligoprobes covering the length of each one of 21,432 unique sequences derived from the Genolyptus EST dataset were synthesized “on-chip” in duplicate, randomly distributed in two blocks of each slide. Probes were also synthesized from ten cDNA sequences encoding known human proteins as negative controls, totaling 21,442 sequences. Leaves and xylem samples were taken from two E. grandis clonal trees, i.e., both derived from the same matrix tree and harboring the same genotype. Two additional xylem samples were collected from two other E. grandis clonal trees of a different genotype, as well as from two E. globulus clonal trees. Therefore, ten cDNA samples and ten identical chips were produced at Roche NimbleGen for the microarray assays, with a total number of 385,956 features per slide. Besides the discovery of differentially expressed genes between leaf and xylem, we wanted to test the validity of the assumed “technical” and “biological duplicates” since all trees were field-grown and four years-old in age.
