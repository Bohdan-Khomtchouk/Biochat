TITLE
Effect of CHADL knockdown in ATDC cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The human genome contains several homologous Small Leucine-Rich Protein (SLRP)-encoding genes, many of which orchestrate collagen fibril assembly. All SLRP gene products have not been identified or characterized. In this report, we describe a novel class IV SLRP - Chondroadherin-like (CHADL). Microarray analysis of CHADL knockdown in ATDC5 cells suggests collagen receptor-related changes, a pro-proliferative and pro-differentiation profile.

DESIGN
Two samples in duplicates are analyzed. The two control samples are transfected with scrambled negative control shRNA.The two knockdown samples are transfected with shRNA specific for CHADL.
