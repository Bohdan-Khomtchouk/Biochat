TITLE
ZFX silencing introduced differential gene expression in leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Zinc finger protein, X-linked (ZFX) is deregulated in various human leukemia patients. The silence of ZFX leads to the inhibited growth and enhance drug sensitivity of both K562 cells and Jurkat cells. To obtain molecular insights of how ZFX controls the proliferation and drug sensitivity of these cells, we generate the microarray data comparing control and ZFX silenced K562 and Jurkat cells.

DESIGN
3 independent biological replicates of control (shNC) and ZFX silenced (shZFX#1 and shZFX#2) K562 and Jurkat cells have been used for RNA extraction, and equal amount of RNA extracts are pooled together to perform microarray analysis with Affymetrix platform.
