TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic profiling of liver tissue from wild-type C57BL-6 mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) supplemented with the probiotic (P) Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum  CECT 7765.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix microarrays to investigate gene expression changes in the liver of wild-type C57BL-6 mice exposed to a high-fat diet that might have been caused by the oral consumption of the probiotic B. pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765.

DESIGN
The aim of this work was to determine whether the daily intake (by oral gavage) of the probiotic (P) B. pseudocatenulatum for seven weeks exerted any modulatory effects, at the level of gene expression, in the liver of C57BL-6 male mice exposed to a high-fat diet (HFD). Male mice were randomly assigned to four experimental groups (n= 5 animals per group) as follows: (1) control group, fed a standard diet (SD); (2) obese group, fed a high-fat diet (HFD); (3) a group that received the SD and a daily dose of the probiotic (1×109 CFU B. pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765) (SD+P); and (d) an obese group that was fed the HFD and a daily dose of the probiotic (1×109 CFU B. pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765) (HFD+P). At the end of the experimental procedure total RNA was extracted from the liver to compare differential gene expression between the groups. Liver differential gene expression after 7 weeks of supplementation between: 1) the HFD group and the SD group (effects of the high-fat diet); 2) the HFD+P and the HFD (effects of the probiotic on the consumption of a high-fat diet) and 3) the SD+P group and the SD (direct effects of the probiotic on the liver of animals consuming a normal diet).
