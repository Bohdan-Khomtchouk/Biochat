TITLE
Toxicogenomics and phenotypic characterization of adult male zebrafish liver treated with estradiol

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We performed microarray-based expression profiling on liver of male zebrafish exposed to 0.5, 5, and 50 Âµg/L of estradiol for 24 and 96 hours, to identify global transcriptional programs and biological pathways involved in estradiol-induced adaptive responses under in vivo environment.

DESIGN
We analyzed 35 arrays of estradiol-treated adult male zebrafish liver and 15 arrays of control fish.
