TITLE
Genome-Wide Analysis In Vivo of Translation with Nucleotide Resolution Using Ribosome Profiling

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Techniques for systematically monitoring protein translation have lagged far behind methods for measuring mRNA levels. Here we present a ribosome profiling strategy, based on deep sequencing of ribosome protected mRNA fragments, that enables genome-wide investigation of translation with sub-codon resolution. We used this technique to monitor translation in budding yeast under both rich and starvation conditions. These studies defined the protein sequences being translated and found extensive translational control both for determining absolute protein abundance and for responding to environmental stress. We also observed distinct phases during translation involving a large decrease in ribosome density going from early to late peptide elongation as well as wide-spread, regulated initiation at non-AUG codons. Ribosome profiling is readily adaptable to other organisms, making high-precision investigation of protein translation experimentally accessible.
