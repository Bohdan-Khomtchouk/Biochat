TITLE
Nitrosomonas europaea expression analysis of biofilm growth and biofilms exposed to phenol and toluene

ORGANISM
Nitrosomonas europaea ATCC 19718

SUMMARY
The physiological and transcriptional response of Nitrosomonas europaea biofilms to phenol and toluene was examined and compared to suspended cells.  Biofilms were grown in Drip Flow Biofilm Reactors under continuous flow conditions of growth medium containing ammonia as growth substrate.  The responses of N. europaea biofilms to the aromatic hydrocarbons phenol and toluene were determined during short-term (3 h) additions of each compound to the biofilms.  Ammonia oxidation in the biofilms was inhibited 50% by 60 uM phenol and 100 uM toluene.  These concentrations were chosen for microarray analysis of phenol- and toluene-exposed N. europaea biofilms.  Liquid batch cultures of exponentially growing N. europaea cells were harvested alongside the biofilms to determine differential gene expression between attached and suspended growth of N. europaea.
