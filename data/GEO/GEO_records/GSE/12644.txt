TITLE
Gene expression profile of normal and calcified stenotic human aortic valves

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We explored gene expression profile of human aortic valves in patients with or without aortic stenosis. The dataset that we generated constitutes a large-scale quantitative measurements of gene expression in normal and stenotic human valves. The goal was to compare gene expression levels between the two groups and identified a list of genes that are up- or down-regulated in aortic stenosis. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Gene expression was performed on ten normal and ten aortic stenosis valves
