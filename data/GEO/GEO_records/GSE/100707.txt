TITLE
Novel genes and regulators for cell surface of Sinorhizobium meliloti.

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
We characterized the transcriptome of a Sinorhizobium meliloti emmA insertion mutant strain.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of an Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm1021 emmA mutant was performed using custom Affymetrix GeneChips. Strain MB805, carrying a Tn5-110 insertion in emmA (locus tag = SMb21521) was compared to strain R4A2A, carrying a Tn5-110 insertion in a putative neutral location (locus tag = SMb21477).
