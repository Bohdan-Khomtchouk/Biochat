TITLE
To detect the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSGP) core proteins that are expressed in these cell lines, so that candidates for the Sulf-2 substrate can be identified

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We are requesting a gene microarray analysis for 10 cell lines that are pertinent to human non-small lung cancer.  A main focus of ours has been the role that Sulf-2 plays in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Sulf-2 is an extracellular sulfatase that acts on internal glucosamine-6-sulfates within heparan sulfate chains.  Sulf-2 can activate Wnt signaling, as well as modulate other signaling pathways.  Our recent work (Oncogene 29:635, 2010) has shown that Sulf-2 is required for the malignant phenotype of five human NSCLC cell lines (increased migration, increased growth, growth in soft agar, and tumorigenecity in nude mice).

DESIGN
Because Sulf-2  acts on HSPGs to regulate signaling, we are interesting in the HSGP core proteins that are expressed in these cell lines, so that candidates for the Sulf-2 substrate can be identified.  In addition we would like to define the expression of heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfatransferase (3 genes) to see whether these genes are upregulated in cells that depend on Sulf-2 for their malignant phenotype.  Finally, gene profiling will define which Wnt ligands and Wnt receptors (Frizzled''s) are expressed in the cells. We are asking for gene profiling on the 5 Sulf-2 expressing NSCLC lines previously studied (H292, H460, P-ST, B-ST, and Calu-6), 3 Sulf-2 negative NSCLC lines (H1299, H1703, H1975) and two normal bronchial epithelial cell populations (B-C, P-C).  All of the cells are human in origin.  There are a total of 10 cell types.  With 3 repicates for each, the request is for 30 arrays.
