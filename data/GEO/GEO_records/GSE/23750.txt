TITLE
Role of REG 1 in Entamoeba histolytica colitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential expression was used to access gene differences after Entamoeba histolytica infection. Entamoeba histolytica is an important diarrheal pathogen worldwide, and induces apoptosis of the intestinal epithelium as part of its disease process.  Regenerating (REG) 1 protein is anti-apoptotic.  We investigated the involvement of REG 1 in E. histolytica colitis.  Colonic biopsy samples were obtained from 8 subjects with acute E. histolytica colitis, and again 60 day later during convalescence. Gene expression in the human colon during acute and convalescent E. histolytica disease was evaluated using microarray and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  REG 1 protein expression was evaluated with immunohistochemistry.  The mechanism of REG 1 involvement in E. histolytica disease was subsequently investigated with a mouse model.  REG 1A and REG 1B were the most upregulated genes in the human intestine in acute versus convalescent E. histolytica disease (p=0.003 and p=0.006 respectively).  PCR confirmed the microarray results (p= < 0.001 and p=0.001 respectively).  Increased REG 1A and REG 1B protein expression was similarly observed by immunohistochemistry. REG 1 -/-mice were found to be significantly more susceptible to E. histolytica infection than wild type mice.

DESIGN
Intestinal Biopsies were taken at day 1 and day 60 post infection.
