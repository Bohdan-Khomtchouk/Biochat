TITLE
Pri-miRNA identification by generating a Drosha null/conditional-null mouse model.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the ability of the Drosha null/conditional-null mouse model to enable the identification of pri-miRNA transcripts. The conditional-null allele of Drosha phenocopies the null allele both in mESC and in mice, upon conversion to the null state with Cre.

DESIGN
Examination of the effects of Drosha deficiency in mouse embryonic stem cells.
