TITLE
Determining the number of individuals to pool

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We compared 10, 20 and 40 animal pools to determine the best number of intact adults to pool Keywords: Agilent microarray, pooling, Drosophila, intact adults

DESIGN
16 vials of flies were reared.  From each vial 5 individuals were selected.  For the 10 animal comparison 4 vials were used with each replicate being a pool of 5 animals over 2 independent vials.  For the 20 animal comparison 8 vials were used with each replicate being a pool of 5 animals over 5 independent vials and for the 40 animal comparison each replicate was a pool of 5 animals over 8 independent vials.  There are two independent replicates of each type for 6 samples which were hybridized on three chips in a loop design.
