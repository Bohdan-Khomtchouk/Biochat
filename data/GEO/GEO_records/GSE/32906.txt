TITLE
Differential expressed miRNAs in Multi-stages and Lymphoid node metastasis of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
According to the evolution of the NPC, with normal time series, we identified microRNAs (miRNAs) showing robust differential expression between nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs) and normal healthy nasopharyngeal epithelial samples. This research use miRNA chip testing at different stages in 12 cases of NPC (TNM â…  - II, III, IV each stage 4 cases), 4 patients matched sample and transfer lymphoma 6 samples. Analysis the difference miRNA distribution of in the NPC development, adopt modern bioinformatics methods selection differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
we study the miRNA dynamic expression profiles in different clinical stages of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and NPC lymphoid node metastasis. Samples were taken from a range of tumors of different stages. 6 cases of normal, 4 respective cases of stage I or II, III, IV and lymph node metastasis. The microdissection was performed with Methyl Green staining to separate tumor cells to non-tumor cells.
