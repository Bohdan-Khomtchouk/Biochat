TITLE
Gene expression in endometrial cancer cells treated with metastin-10 (kp10)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Invasion into deep myometrium and/or lymphovascular space is a well-known risk factor for endometrial cancer metastasis, resulting in poor prognosis. It is therefore clinically important to identify novel molecules that suppress tumor invasion. Reduced expression of the metastasis suppressor, KISS1 (kisspeptin), and its endogenous receptor, GPR54, has been reported in several cancers, but the significance of the KISS1/GPR54 axis in endometrial cancer metastasis has not been clarified. Metastin-10 is the minimal bioactive sequence of genetic products of KISS1. Clinicopathological analysis of 92 endometrial cancers revealed overall survival is improved in cancers with high expression of GPR54. Through RNAi and mousemodel analyses, metastin-10 was predicted to suppress invasion and metastasis of GPR54-expressing endometrial cancers. These data suggest that metastin-10 may induce genetic changes in the metastatic character of endometrial cancers.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to clarify the changes of gene expression along with metastin-10 treatment and to confirm whether the changes were derived via the metastin-GPR54 axis. Gene expression microarray data (Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0) for Ishikawa cells treated with or without 10Î¼M metastin-10 and/or GPR54 siRNA were generated in triplicate and RMA-normalized.
