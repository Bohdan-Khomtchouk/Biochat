TITLE
Key Role of MicroRNA in the Regulation of Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor Expression in Murine Alveolar Epithelial Cells (AEC) during Oxidative Stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A genome wide microarray identified 19 candidate miRNA altered in primary AEC during oxidative stress with reversal by treatment with GM-CSF. Three of these microRNA (miR 133a, miR133a* and miR133b) are also predicited to bind the GM-CSF 3 UTR.

DESIGN
4 samples. Primary murine alveolar epithelial cells were isolated and subjected to room air or 80% oxygen in the presence or absence of recombinant murine GM-CSF (20 ng/ml).  Total RNA was extracted and quality checked (260/280 > 2 and 260/230 > 1.6).  Mouse genome microRNA analysis (MAM3200) was performed by SABioscience.
