TITLE
Prognostic value of gene signatures and proliferation in lymph node negative breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analyses whether, and if so, gene expression can add prognostic information in the subgroups of patients with tumours with low or high proliferative activity. As proliferation measured with MAI and PPH3 has repeatedly been shown to be the best prognosticator in node-negative breast cancer (high sensitivity, little overtreatment).

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from 94 lymph node negative breast cancer patients
