TITLE
Arabidopsis shade avoidance gene expression in adult plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to obtain genome-wide shade-responsive genes in adult plant. We grew plants under long-day condition with high R/FR ratio (simulated " sun " condition) for two weeks. Plants were treated with shade starting at ZT 4 or left in the sun. We prepared two replicates of each sample at 1 hour and 4 hours after sun and shade treatment and five plants were pooled for each replicate. Cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots were removed from the samples, leaving leaves and apical tissue.

DESIGN
SRA Study accession (SRP028684) and BioProject accession (PRJNA214254)
