TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of transcriptomes in cae2-1, CA1-1 and cae2-1 CA1-1 Arabidopsis genotypes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptome comparison was used to determine the genes that are affected by the mutations in cae2-1, CA1-1 and the cae2-1 CA1-1 enhancer.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of young shoots from four genotypes showing various cotyledon cell shape phenotypes, each with two biological replicates.

PLATFORM
