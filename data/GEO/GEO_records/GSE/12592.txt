TITLE
Gene expression analysis of myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma, and morphologically similar lesions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis was performed in cases 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8 as well as in five pooled myxofibrosarcomas using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis, using Pearson correlation and average linkage clustering, separated the control pool and case 6 from the rest of the cases. Cases 1 and 5, both harboring t(1;10)(p22;q24), were in turn segregated from cases 2 and 8. Tumors with t(1;10)(p22;q24) thus seemed to have a more distinct expression pattern than tumors affected by amplification of regions on chromosome 3. Tumors with t(1;10) showed increased expression levels of NPM3 and FGF8 compared with tumors without such a translocation, including the control pool. No other gene in the 5 Mb region proximal to the breakpoint on chromosome 10 displayed a more pronounced difference between the two groups. Of the genes located in the commonly amplified region on chromosome 3, VGLL3 and CHMP2B showed a higher expression in tumors affected by the amplification.
