TITLE
Complex Genomic Rearrangements at the PLP1 Locus Include Triplication and Quadruplication

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inverted repeats (IRs) can facilitate structural variation as crucibles of genomic rearrangement. Complex DUP-TRP/INV-DUP rearrangements that contain breakpoint junctions within IRs have been recently associated with both MECP2 duplication syndrome (MIM#300260) and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD, MIM#312080). We investigated 17 unrelated PMD subjects with copy number gains at the PLP1 locus including triplication and quadruplication of specific genomic intervals – 16/17 were found to have a DUP-TRP/INV-DUP rearrangement product. An IR distal to PLP1 facilitates DUP-TRP/INV-DUP formation as well as an inversion structural variation found frequently amongst normal individuals. We show that a homology—or homeology—driven replicative mechanism of DNA repair can apparently mediate template switches within stretches of microhomology. Moreover, we provide evidence that quadruplication, and potentially higher order amplification of a genomic interval, can occur in a manner consistent with rolling circle amplification as predicted by the microhomology mediated break induced replication (MMBIR) model.

DESIGN
To determine size, genomic extent and gene content for each rearrangement, we used a customized tiling-path oligonucleotide microarray spanning the Xq22 chromosomal region to query the genomic DNA of 7 males with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, and 5 unaffected or carrier/unaffected family members. A 4x44k Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA) microarray was designed using the Agilent e-array website targeting the region of the genome encompassing the dosage-sensitive PLP1 gene.
