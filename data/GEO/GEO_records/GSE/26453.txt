TITLE
Transcriptome data for human ES, IMR90 and IMR90-derived iPS (ESIMR90) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Assessing relevant differences between human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and human embryonic stem (ES) cells is important, given that such differences may impact their potential therapeutic use. We used microarray to profile the changes in global gene expression arising from the reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression between human embryonic stem cells (HES-3), induced pluripotent stem cells (ESIMR90) and its parental fibroblasts (IMR90). A pair of biololical replicates were analysed for each cell line.
