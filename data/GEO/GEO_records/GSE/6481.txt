TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Soft Tissue Sarcomas: Characterization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In soft tissue sarcomas, diagnosis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) has been a very controversial issue, and MFH is now considered to be reclassified into pleomorphic subtypes of other sarcomas. To characterize and reclassify MFH genetically, we analyzed gene expression in 105 samples from ten types of soft tissue tumors. Keywords: myxofibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, fibrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma
