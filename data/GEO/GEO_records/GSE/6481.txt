TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Soft Tissue Sarcomas: Characterization & Reclassification of Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In soft tissue sarcomas, diagnosis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) has been a very controversial issue, and MFH is now considered to be reclassified into pleomorphic subtypes of other sarcomas. To characterize and reclassify MFH genetically, we analyzed gene expression in 105 samples from ten types of soft tissue tumors. Keywords: myxofibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, fibrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma

DESIGN
Gene expression of 105 soft tissue tumor samples consisting of synovial sarcoma (n=16), myxoid liposarcoma (n=19), lipoma (n=3), well-differentiated liposarcoma (n=3), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (n=15), myxofibrosarcoma (n=15), leiomyosarcoma (n=6), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (n=3), fibrosarcoma (n=4) and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (n=21) were analyzed using an Affymetrix HG-U133A array.
