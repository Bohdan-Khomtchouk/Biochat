TITLE
Analysis of neonatal B lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
B lymphocytes in the neonates are poorly define and some of which express the marker CD5. The experiment is based on the flow cytometry cell sorting of 2 populations of B lymphocytes defined according to their phenotype : 1/ CD5 positive sorted as CD20+CD19+CD3-CD5+CD10- ; 2/ CD5 negative B lymphocytes sorted as CD20+CD19+CD3-CD5-CD10-. Cells were isolated from fresh heparinised cord blood used within 24 hours after sample collect, without any additional treatment

DESIGN
Comparison of CD5-positive and CD5-negative B lymphocytes isolated from cord blood obtained from 4 donors
