TITLE
Differential gene expression in intestinal mouse crypts after loss of KLF5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine potential targets of KLF5 we performed RNA-sequencing on jejunal crypts isolated from Klf5-deficient and wildtype mice, using three biological replicates per genotype.  We identified 1,480 genes that showed significant differential expression with at least a 2-fold difference between Klf5-deficient and wildtype (q-value â‰¤ 0.05) (Figure 5A; Supplementary Table 1).  Klf5 expression was significantly downregulated 2.7-fold.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression after loss of KLF5 in the intestine.  Isolated jejunal crypts from 3 wildtype and 3 knockout animals were compared.
