TITLE
Muscle expression of SOD1G93A modulates microRNA and mRNA expression pattern associated with the myelination process in the spinal cord of transgenic mice [RT-PCR]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profile of microRNA in lumbar spinal cord from MLC/SOD1G93A using Applied Biosystem Array Mouse MicroRNA A Card

DESIGN
Lumbar Spinal Cord Ventral samples were collected from mice MLC/SOD1[G93A] and control FVB age matched at 4 month-old. Samples were collected  for RNA extraction and analyzed on Taqman Array Mouse MicroRNA Card A version 3.0

PLATFORM
GPL20703 Applied Biosystems Taqman Array Rodent MicroRNA CardA v3.0
