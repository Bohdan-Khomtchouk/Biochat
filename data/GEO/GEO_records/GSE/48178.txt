TITLE
tiling hen2 and mtr4-HEN2 is a cofactor of the nuclear exosome in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
til-ath-2011_3 - tiling hen2 and mtr4 - Identification and comparison of the RNA substrates that accumulate in hen2 and mtr4 mutants. Total RNA extracted from WT, hen2 and mtr4 mutants was used for oligo-dT primed cDNA preparation. Samples were hybridised to NimbleGen whole genome tiling arrays.

DESIGN
8 dye-swapped samples. Gene knockout, genotype comparison, normal vs. transgenic comparison.

PLATFORM
GPL11005 Custom NimbleGen A. thaliana ChIP-chip tiling array [HD2.3X] GPL17057 HD2.3X_REV
