TITLE
Is Increased Sinusoidal Flow in the Liver Remnant the primary Stimulus to Regeneration after partial Hepatectomy

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The impact of portal arterialization on the liver parenchyma was studied in a series of six pigs with aortoportal shunting of liver segments II, III and IV (and 6 sham animals). Gene expression in the arterialized segments was compared to expression in sham animals. Primary endpoints were gene expression profiles in the hyperperfused segments at sampling time points 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, 90 minutes and 2, 3, 4 and 6 hours after shunt opening. Keywords: time course, treatment comparison

DESIGN
Six pigs were treated with aortoportal shunting of segments II, III and IV and six animals were subject to sham surgery.  Expression profiling was conducted by hybridizing each sample against a common reference, consisting of liver RNA from an unrelated animal..
