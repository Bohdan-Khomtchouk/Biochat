TITLE
Gene expression in RAW264.7 cells infected with VSV and HSV-1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to determine which genes are differentially regulated virus infection in RAW264.7 cells. Cells were infected with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) or herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) for 6h. Then the differentially regulated genes were analyzed, focusing on F-box proteins and E3 ubiquitin ligases.

DESIGN
RAW264.7 cells were infected with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV, MOI=1) or herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1, MOI=5) for 6h. Equal amounts of RNA were assayed for gene expression using Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 arrays.
