TITLE
Gene expression data from ahES cells, ES cells, MEF cells and round sperm

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Haploid stem cells offer an easy-to-manipulate genetic system and therefore have great values for studies of recessive phenotypes. Here, we show that mouse androgenetic haploid ES (ahES) cell lines can be established by transferring sperm into enucleated oocyte. The ahES cells maintain haploidy and stable growth over 30 passages, express pluripotent markers, possess the ability to differentiate into all three germ-layers in vitro and in vivo, and contribute to germline of chimeras when injected into blastocysts. Although epigenetically distinct from sperm cells, the ahES cells can produce viable and fertile progenies after intracytoplasmic injection into mature oocytes. The oocyte injection procedure can also produce viable transgenic mice from genetically engineered ahES cells. We used microarrays to compare the global programme of gene expression among ahES cells, normal diploid ES cells, MEF cells and round sperm cells and found that gene expression pattern of ahES cells was highly similar with ES cells but was distinct from MEF cells and round sperms.

DESIGN
Androgenetic haploid ES cells were FACS sorted to harvest the G0/G1 phase haploid cells. Total RNA were extracted from three ahES cell lines (AH129-5, AH129-N1, AH129-NC1, all 129Sv genetic background), two ES cell lines ( CS1-1, R1, 129Sv background), MEF cells and round sperm and hybridized with Affymetrix GeneChip 430 2.0 array. Data were collected and analyzed to compare their gene expression pattern.
