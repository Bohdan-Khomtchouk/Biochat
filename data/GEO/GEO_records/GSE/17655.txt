TITLE
Experiment 1: Developmental time curve in wild-type and MZspg embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Developmental curve of zebrafish MZ spg mutants compared to WT, 10 timepoints from 0 to 8 hours post fertilization transcriptome changes by microarray analysis at ten distinct time-points during development, from ovaries to late gastrulation, in MZ spg and WT zebrafish

DESIGN
Experiments were performed in biological triplicates, except  at 1 hr timepoint, which was performed in duplicate. Cy3 and Cy5 channels were splitted in the Genedata software and  normalized using quantile normalization (Genedata) and used for comparison  betwen MZspg and WT gene expression levels at each stage(Stage specific gene sets), as well as for comparison of expresion levels of the same genotype at different timepoints ( temporal profiles)
