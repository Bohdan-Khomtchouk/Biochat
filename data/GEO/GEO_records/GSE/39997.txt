TITLE
Dnmt2-dependent methylomes lack biologically relevant DNA methylation patterns [Schistosoma mansoni]

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
Dnmt2 is a widely conserved protein, which is closely related to eukaryotic DNA methyltransferases. However, Dnmt2 shows a robust tRNA methyltransferase activity and only limited activity towards DNA. Interestingly, a recent study has provided evidence for a biologically important function of Dnmt2-dependent DNA methylation in the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni, which seemed to contradict the weak activity of the enzyme in other organisms. We now used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to comprehensively analyze the methylome of adult worms and could not detect any evidence for biologically relevant DNA methylation patterns. We also characterized the methylome of Drosophila melanogaster embryos and did not find any evidence for DNA methylation. Unconverted cytosine residues were detectable only at very low levels and shared many attributes with bisulfite deamination artifacts. Our results thus strongly argue against a DNA methyltransferase activity of Dnmt2 and suggest that Dnmt2-dependent phenotypes are caused by reduced tRNA methylation.

DESIGN
Whole genome methylation analysis of S. mansoni. One sample was analyzed, containing DNA from adult male worms.
