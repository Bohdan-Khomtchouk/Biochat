TITLE
Disruption of gul-1 decreased the culture viscosity and improved protein secretion in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
In this study, we screened morphological mutants in the filamentous fungus N. crassa. Of the 90 morphological mutants screened, 14 mutants exhibited considerably higher viscosity compared with that of the wild type strain, and only 2 mutants showed low-viscosity morphologies in submerged culture. We observed that disruption of gul-1 (NCU01197), which encodes an mRNA binding protein involved in cell wall remodeling, caused pellet formation as the fermentation progressed, and resulted in the most significant decrease in viscosity of culture broth. Moreover, over-expression of gul-1 caused dramatically increased viscosity, suggesting that the gul-1 had an important function in mycelial morphology during submerged cultivation. Additionally, the deletion of gul-1 caused increased protein secretion, probably due to a defect in cell wall integrity, suggesting this as an alternative strategy of strain improvement for enzyme production. To confirm practical application, deleting gul-1 in the hyper-cellulase producing strain (∆ncw-1∆Ncap3m) significantly reduced the viscosity of culture broth.

DESIGN
Conidia of △gul-1 and wild-type (WT) strains were separately inoculated into Avicel medium (1×Vogel's salt, 2% w/v crystalline cellulose, 0.75% w/v yeast extract and 0.2% v/v Tween 80) and batch cultured for 3 days. Total RNA from frozen samples was extracted and treated.

PLATFORM
