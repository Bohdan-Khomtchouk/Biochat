TITLE
Transcriptomes of transgenic rice expressing a constitutively active phytochrome OsPHYB-Y283H (OsYHB) allele

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
The present study quantifies the transcriptomes of wild-type and transgenic Ubi::OsYHB rice seedlings (in the genetic background of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica CV Nipponbare) grown in the dark or under continous red light (Rc, at 50 µmol m-2 s-1) conditions.

DESIGN
WT (Nipponbare cultivar; Nip) and Ubi::OsYHB/Nip transgenic seedlings were grown at 28°C for 5 days in darkness or under continuous red light at 50 µmol m-2 s-1 (Rc50). Seedlings were harvested in subjective morning, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and strored at -80°C until RNA extraction. The expression of OsYHB is driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter. Two biological replicates for each treatment. Two independent, genetically single-insertion, homozygous Ubi::OsYHB/Nip lines (#1 and # 9, with determined 41- and 23-fold overexpression levels of OsYHB in comparison to the wild-type control, respectively) were used. GeneChip 3' IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix) was used to synthesize and label aRNA.
