TITLE
Activity of the Bacillus anthracis 20 kDa protective antigen component

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Edema factor of anthrax binds to the protective antigen (PA83) which cleaves to PA63 and PA20. The role of PA20 was examined using highthroughput gene expression analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) exposed to PA20. Keywords: Toxicity determination

DESIGN
PBMC obtained from  different individuals over 6 monthes were incubated with and without rPA20

PLATFORM
