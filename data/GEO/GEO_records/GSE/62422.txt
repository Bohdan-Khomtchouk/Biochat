TITLE
Gene expression in invaded cells and the flanking cells of rice in response to the inoculation with rice blast fungus

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rice blast fungus was inoculated to susceptible and resistant lines of rice leaves and the invaded cells and their adjacent cells were collected by Laser Microdissection method.  The extracted RNA was amplified and analyzed by two color microarray.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, incompatible (resistant) and compatible (susceptible) combination by using two isogenic lines of rice cv Nipponbare. Biological replicates: 3 replicates. Time course: 4 points.

PLATFORM
GPL6864 Agilent-015241 Rice Gene Expression 4x44K Microarray (Feature Number version)
