TITLE
RNA sequencing of Aedes mosquitoes infected with Zika virus (ZIKV) or Dengue virus (DENV)

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
Zika virus (ZIKV), a pathogen of global health concern, is transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes. However, the molecular interactions between the vector and the virus remain largely unexplored. We demonstrated that ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV) have similar tropism and infection kinetics in two mosquito strains with different degrees of susceptibility to infection. Comparison of Aedes aegypti’s molecular responses to ZIKV and DENV infection indicated that around 40% of the mosquito’s infection-responsive transcriptome is virus-specific. Regulated genes also included key factors of the mosquito’s anti-viral immunity, pointing to the possible involvement of the Toll innate immune pathway. Comparison of ZIKV and DENV infection-responsive transcriptome data to those for yellow fever virus and West Nile virus identified 26 genes likely to play key roles in virus infection of Aedes mosquitoes. Through reverse genetic analyses, we showed that the Toll and the Jak/Stat innate immune pathways mediate increased resistance to ZIKV infection, and the virus use vATPase and inosine-5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase as mosquito’s host factors.

DESIGN
Mosquito's midguts were collected 7 days post-infection with ZIKV or DENV, mosquitoes fed on a naïve blood meal were used as the control group.  Each group had three replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL22030 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Aedes aegypti)
