TITLE
Mature B cell versus Plasma Cell Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparing the gene expression of primary human B cell populations using human Lymphochip cDNA spotted arrays. Primary samples (Cy5) were compared to a reference pool of polyA+ RNA (Cy3). Keywords: cell type comparison design

DESIGN
PolyA+ RNA was extracted from primary B cell populations (Cy5) and compared to a reference pool of polyA+ RNA (Cy3) on human Lymphochip cDNA spotted arrays. Each population was labelled and hybridized in duplicate.
