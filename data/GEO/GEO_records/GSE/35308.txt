TITLE
Transcriptional response of FZF1 alleles from S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus to the addition of sulfite

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of four different yeast FZF1 alleles: S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus and two reciprocal chimeras with the coding and 5' noncoding region from opposite species of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus, both before and 15 minutes after sulfite addition.  FZF1 is a transcription factor that is known to be turned on in response to sulfite.  Here we determine whether the FZF1 allele from two species leads to different transcriptional responses and the effect of the individual noncoding and coding regions on the transcriptional response.

DESIGN
Two-color experiment,  4 Strains x 2 Timepoints each compared to a reference pool made up of all samples.  3 Biologic replicates. With dye-swaps

PLATFORM
GPL9825 Agilent-016322 Yeast (V2) Gene Expression 8x15K Microarray (Feature Number version)
