TITLE
Identification of Direct Targets of RPX a NAC transcription factor of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To determine the role of RPX on cell proliferation and organ development, we performed microarray experiments in search of RPX target genes by using an estradiol-inducible RPX∆C protein.

DESIGN
Estradiol-treatment allows for the nuclear translocation of the constitutively expressed chimeric transcription factor XVE and subsequent expression of RPX∆C from the LexA promoter. Stable trangenic T3 seedlings were either treated with 10 uM estradiol or ethanol (mock) for 2 hours. Three mock and three estradiol treated samples were used for RNA isolation and hybridization.
