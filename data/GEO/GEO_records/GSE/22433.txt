TITLE
Imatinib Treatment of GIST882

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor frequently harbor mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase and depend on its activity for growth. This underlies the efficacy of imatinib, a inhibitor of KIT activity, in GIST management. GIST882 is a patient derived GIST cell line that harbor a K640E exon 13 KIT mutation and is sensitive to imatinib treatment. To analyze the downstream effect of KIT inhibition, GIST882 cells were treated for 8 hours with  1μM Imatinib.

DESIGN
GIST882 cells were treated in triplicate with 0.1% DMSO or 1μM Imatinib for 8 hours. RNA was isolated and analyzed by Illumina Human HT-12 beadarray.
