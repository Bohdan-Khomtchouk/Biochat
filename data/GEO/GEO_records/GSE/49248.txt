TITLE
KrasG12D partially compensates for the loss of beta-catenin in MLL-AF9 AML

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is required for the development of leukemia stem cells in MLL-AF9 AML. We evaluated the dependance on beta-catenin for KrasG12DMLL-AF9 leukemia.

DESIGN
Lin-Kit+ bone marrow cells obtained from mice transplanted with primary MLL-AF9 leukemia cells and KRasG12DMLL-AF9 leukemia cells were assessed for gene expression in the presence or absence of beta-catenin
