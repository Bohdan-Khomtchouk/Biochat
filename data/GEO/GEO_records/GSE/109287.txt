TITLE
Expression data from bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) in Wild Type and NICcA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Notch pathway plays a critical role in regulating the development and polarization of macrophages during tumor progression. Therefore, we used BMDMs isolated and cultured from control mice and NICcA mice to compare the gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
BM cells harvested from Ctrl or NICcA mice were stimulated with 25 ng/ml M-CSF (SinoBio) for 7 days to obtain BMDMs. RNA samples of above cells were extracted and sequencing was performed at RiboBio Co., Ltd (Guangzhou, China) with the Illumina HiSeq 3000. Please note that the mRNA_PROCESSED_DATA.txt file contains both the sequence reads count and processed RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase per Million) data, while the N2_N3--W1_W2_W3.all.transcript.txt file only contains the processed RPKM data.

PLATFORM
GPL21493 Illumina HiSeq 3000 (Mus musculus)
