TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of yeast RNA polymerase II termination

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Using a modification of the yeast anchor away and PAR-CLIP protocols, we have mapped the position of Pol II genome-wide in living yeast cells after depletion of components of either the polyadenylation (pA) or non-pA termination complexes. Depletion of Ysh1 from the nucleus does not lead to readthrough transcription. In contrast, depletion of the termination factor Nrd1 leads to widespread runaway elongation of non-pA transcripts. Depletion of Sen1 also leads to readthrough at non-pA terminators but in contrast to Nrd1 this readthrough appears less processive.

DESIGN
Examination of PAR-CLIP sequencing data of Pol II after removal of different transcriptional termination factors.
