TITLE
Comparison of primary neuroblastoma tumors and derivative early-passage cell lines using genome-wide SNP array analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stromal contamination is one of the major confounding factors in the analysis of primary solid tumor samples by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. As we propose to employ genome-wide SNP microarray analysis as a diagnostic platform for neuroblastoma, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of these studies must be optimized. In order to investigate the effects of stroma, we derived early passage cell lines from nine primary tumors and compared their genomic signature with that of the primary tumors by 100K SNP array analysis. The average concordance between tumor and cell line for raw LOH (loss of heterozygosity) calls was 96% (range 91%-99%) and for raw copy number alterations (CNA), 71% (range 43%-87%). In general, there were a larger number of LOH events identified in the cell lines compared to the matched tumor samples (mean increase 3.2% Â± 1.9%). We have developed an algorithm that shows that the presence of stroma contributes to under-reporting of LOH and copy number loss (CNL). Notable findings in this sample set were uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome arms 11p, 1q, 14q, and 15q and a novel area of amplification on chromosome band 11p15. Our analysis demonstrates that LOH was identified significantly more often in derived cell lines compared to the original tumor samples. While these may in part be due to clonal selection during adaptation to tissue culture, our study indicates contamination by normal stromal elements may be a major contributing factor in underestimation of LOH and CNL events. Keywords: genome wide SNP analysis
