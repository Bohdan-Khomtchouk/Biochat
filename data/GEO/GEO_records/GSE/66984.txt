TITLE
Expression analysis of Candida glabrata CBS138 delta-vph2 mutant

ORGANISM
Candida glabrata CBS 138

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Candida glabrata CBS138 delta-vph2 mutant, compared to the wild-type strain in SC broth (pH5.0 and pH7.4).  VPH2 gene encodes a protein that is the assembly factor of a functional V-ATPase. Loss of Vph2p leads to loss of a functional V-ATPase enzyme complex.

DESIGN
A eight chip study using total RNA recovered from two separate wild-type cultures of Candida glabrata CBS138 and two separate cultures of Candida glabrata CBS138 delta-vph2 mutant in SC broth (pH5.0 and pH7.4), in order to confirm whether alkalization of the media affects the gene expression level of vph2 mutant.  Each chip measures the expression level of 5,217 genes from Candida glabrata CBS138 with six 60-mer probe pairs per gene, with two-fold technical redundancy.
