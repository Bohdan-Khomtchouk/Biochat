TITLE
Expression analysis of Candida glabrata CBS138 delta-vph2 mutant

ORGANISM
[Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Candida glabrata CBS138 delta-vph2 mutant, compared to the wild-type strain in SC broth (pH5.0 and pH7.4).  VPH2 gene encodes a protein that is the assembly factor of a functional V-ATPase. Loss of Vph2p leads to loss of a functional V-ATPase enzyme complex.
