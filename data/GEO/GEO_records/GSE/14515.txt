TITLE
Comparative transcriptomics analysis of Populus leaves under nitrogen limitation: clone 1979

ORGANISM
Populus fremontii x Populus angustifolia

SUMMARY
Gene expression response of Populus plants subjected to hydroponic nitrogen manipulation was analyzed using the Affymetrix poplar genome microarrays. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Populus fremontii x angustifolia genotypes were grown hydroponically with either 5 mM (N+) or 0.125 mM (N-) nitrogen. Young leaves at Leaf Plastchron Index (LPI) 2 were sampled 4 weeks after the start of low N feeding. Mature leaves at Leaf Plastchron Index (LPI) 5 were sampled 4 or 8 weeks after the start of low N feeding. Two biological replicates were obtained for each condition.
