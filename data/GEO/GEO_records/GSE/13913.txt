TITLE
WT and php mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling for wild-type and php mutants Expression of > 22,600 genes was analyzed in aerial tissues from 14 day old soil grown wild type and php mutant plants using Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip, and two independent biological replicates. Data from CEL files were adjusted for background and normalized using the Bioconductor GCRMA package ( ).
