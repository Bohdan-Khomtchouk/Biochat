TITLE
Expression data from mice overexpressing Tcfeb specifically in P0 kidney

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the effects of Tcfeb overexpression on the kidney transcriptome, we performed Affymetrix Gene-Chip hybridization experiments for the double heterozygous KSP_CRE/KSP_Tcfeb mice as compared to control KSP_CRE mice Transcriptome analysis of mice overexpressing Tcfeb specifically in kidney

DESIGN
For the analysis on mice overexpressing Tcfeb, total RNA was extracted from the kidney of three mice; RNA extracted from the kidney of two mice was used as control.
