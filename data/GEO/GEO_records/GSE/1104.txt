TITLE
Effect of LPS and LPS-binding protein treatment for 48 hours on RAW 264.4 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
All samples were gathered from mouse RAW 264.7 cells (macrophages). Control total RNA was extracted from untreated RAW 264.7 cells cultured for 48 hours. Test total RNA was extracted from lipopolysaccharide (100ng/ml) and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (100pM) treated RAW 264.4 cells cultured for 48 hours. Experiment design included three control vs test arrays and three dye swap arrays. Keywords: other
