TITLE
C. elegans daf2 mutant adults

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in long-lived daf-2 mutants for the insulin/IGF-1 receptor. daf-2(e1370) and daf-2(m577) alleles each examined as single and as double mutations with the daf-16(df50) allele. DAF-2 regulates DAF-16, a transcription factor. Results provide insight into longevity. Keywords: other
