TITLE
High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing of Arabidopsis thaliana endogenous small RNAs by 454 pyrosequencing. Keywords: high-throughput sequencing

DESIGN
Small RNA cDNA libraries from wildtype Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia accession) were constructed by fractionation of total RNA using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by adaptor ligation and reverse transcription.  Pyrosequencing from these libraries was performed.  Detailed library preparation protocol can be found in Axtell, M.J., Jan, C., Rajagopalan, R., and Bartel, D.P. (2006) A two-hit trigger for siRNA biogensis in plants.  Cell 127:565-577.
