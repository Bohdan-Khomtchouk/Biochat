TITLE
Identification of transcripts regulated by CEBPA protein and its P30 isoform in K562

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effect of CEBPA and its mutant isoform P30 on the expression of mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), we utilized the K562 AML cell line carrying a stable and Tet-on inducible CEBPA  or P30 allele.

DESIGN
Based on the expression of known CEBPA transcriptional targets, we selected RNA extracted from 48 hours of induction (CEBPA or P30)  together with RNA extracted from control-induced cells (CTR).  2 biological replicates for each sample have been utilized.
