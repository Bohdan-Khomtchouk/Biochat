TITLE
Mouse primary T-ALL microRNA microarray

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Primary mouse cells (CD4-CD8- (DN) and CD4+CD8+ (DP) thymus and T-ALL (early-stage - ES and late-stage - LS) and mouse T-ALL cell line M295 were assessed for microRNA expression

DESIGN
For DN, DP, ES_T-ALL and LS_T-ALL cells, n=3 biological replicates were used. M295 is one 1 replicate

PLATFORM
