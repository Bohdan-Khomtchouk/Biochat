TITLE
Zfp281 Coordinates Opposite Functions of Tet1 and Tet2 for Alternative Pluripotent States [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pluripotent cell identity comprises a spectrum of cell states including naive and primed states, which are typified by mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and epiblast-derived stem cells (EpiSCs), respectively. Here we define a pluripotent cell fate (PCF) gene signature based on RNA-seq analysis associated with naive and primed pluripotency acquisition, and identify Zfp281 as a key transcriptional regulator for primed pluripotency and also as a barrier to achieve the naive pluripotency of both mouse and human ESCs.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing analysis was performed in WT and Zfp281 null mouse embryonic stem cells under different pluripotent culture conditions. RNA-seq Experiments were carry out in two biological replciates. Genome binding/occupancy profiling of Zfp281 was performed in mouse embryonic stem cells by ChIP sequencing.
