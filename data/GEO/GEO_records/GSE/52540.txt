TITLE
A microarray analysis highlights the role of tetrapyrrole pathways in grapevine responses to stolbur phytoplasma, phloem virus infections and recovered status

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Several systemic diseases affect Vitis vinifera worldwide with important consequent management costs. Phytoplasma and viruses represent the most detrimental pathogens inducing symptoms and metabolic alterations that modify quantitatively the crop production. In the aim to investigate the plant/pathogen interactions, different grapevine samples, naturally affected (in mixed or single infections) by Stolbur phytoplasma (agent of Bois Noir disease) and viruses, in comparison to healthy and recovered controls, to identify the plant response to systemic pathogen infection. The preliminary results showed that expression levels of thousands of genes were altered in infected plants, involving various metabolic pathways.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from central leaf midribs and petioles from different V. vinifera cultivars in different conditions (healthy, infected and recovered). Microarray analyses were conducted using different biological replicates for treatment. The submitter of this dataset can no longer locate the raw data
