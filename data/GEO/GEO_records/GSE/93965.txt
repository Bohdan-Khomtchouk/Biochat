TITLE
Transcriptomic analyses of Kras induced zebrafish liver cancer

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The krasV12-induced tumor progression was conducted on 100 transgenic fishes maintained in water containing 2ÂµM mifepristone. Gross morphological and histological analyses were weekly performed on 15 randomly selected fishes to monitor tumor development. These analyses showed robust development of hepatocellular adenoma within 4 weeks of induction. Observation of tumor development and staging of tumorigenesis was conducted as described. For tumor regression the group of 15 fishes with HCC was transferred to mifepristone-free water. Histological examination revealed tumor shrinkage showing extensive scarring at the peripheral and focal tumor regions. Notably, complete tumor regression with scarred fibrosis of the former tumor tissue was observed after 4 weeks of mifepristone withdrawal.

DESIGN
Liver tumors from mifipristone induced transgenic fishes with hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma, livers of  transgenic fishes after mifepristone withdrawal and normal livers from non-induced and induced transgenic fishes were pooled separately and collected for RNA isolation and sequencing.
