High temporal resolution profiling of U2OS fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High-temporal resolution profiling was performed on U2OS fibroblasts to detect rhythmic transcripts Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Samples were collected every hour for 48 hours from dexamethasone-synchronized U2OS cells.  Cells synchronized with dexamethasone for 24 hours, and harvested from the 24th to 71st hour.  Samples were analyzed using Affymetrix arrays.
