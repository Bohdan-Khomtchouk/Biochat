TITLE
ChIPseq measurement of transcriptional engagement and replication stress at the Drosophila Mid-blastula Transition

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
These experiments measure genome-wide RNA Pol II binding in precisely staged wild-type embryos at five time points spanning the maternal to zygotic transition (nuclear cycles 12 through 14) of Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, RNA Pol II binding at nuclear cycle 13 is measured in embryos mutant for either mei-41/ATR or zelda. To correlate RNA Pol II binding with replication stress, genome-wide profiles of Replication protein A (70kDa subunit, RpA-70 EGFP) were generated in parallel with RNA Pol II for both wild-type and zelda at nuclear cycle 13.

DESIGN
Two replicates each for 5 time points for wild type RNA Pol II. Two replicates for mei-41 RNA Pol II, nuclear cycle 13. Two replicates for zelda RNA Pol II, nuclear cycle 13. Two replicates each for Rpa70-EGFP in wild-type or zelda, nuclear cycle 13, matched to the corresponding RNA Pol II sample.
