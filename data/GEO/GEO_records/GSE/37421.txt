TITLE
Genes differentially expressed Haloferax mediterranei strains: control wild-type strain vs ΔphaEC strain

ORGANISM
Haloferax mediterranei

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Haloferax mediterranei comparing control wild-type strain with ΔphaEC strain, in which PHA synthase genes are knockouted. ΔphaEC strain is deficient in PHBV accumulation. Goal was to explore the PHBV biosynthetic pathway and to determine their impact on primary metabolism in H. mediterranei.

DESIGN
Total RNA from the control Haloferax mediterranei and its ΔphaEC strain were used to generate target cDNA, and then hybridized to 8*15K Haloferax mediterranei genome array genechips, representing about 3800 genes.
