TITLE
Discovery of a splicing regulator required for cell cycle progression

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
Toxoplasma gondii temperature sensitive mutant 12-109C6 conditionally arrests in the G1 phase due to a single point mutation in a novel protein containing a single RNA-recognition-motif (TgRRM1).  The resulting tyrosine to asparagine amino acid change in TgRRM1 causes severe temperature instability that generates an effective null phenotype for this protein when the mutant is shifted to the restrictive temperature.  Orthologs of TgRRM1 are widely conserved in diverse eukaryote lineages, and the human counterpart (RBM42) can functionally replace the missing Toxoplasma factor. The interaction of TgRRM1 with factors of the tri-SNP complex (U4/U6 & U5 snRNPs) indicate this factor may be required to assemble an active spliceosome.  Thus, the TgRRM1 family of proteins is an unrecognized and evolutionarily conserved class of splicing regulators. We describe transcriptome of the temperature sensitive mutant 12-109C6. Transcriptome studies demonstrated that gene expression is largely downregulated in the mutant at the restrictive temperature 40oC and is accompanied by a severe defect in splicing that affects both cell cycle and constitutively expressed mRNAs.

DESIGN
RNA samples were isolated in duplicate from mutant 12-109C6 parasites grown for 24h at permissive (34oC) and 6h and 24h at non-permissive temperatures (40oC). Samples were hybridized to the Toxoplasma gondii Affymetrix microarray (ToxoGeneChip: http://ancillary.toxodb.org/docs/Array-Tutorial.html ). Hybridization data was preprocessed with Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) and normalized using per chip and per gene median polishing and analyzed using the software package GeneSpring GX (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara CA).
