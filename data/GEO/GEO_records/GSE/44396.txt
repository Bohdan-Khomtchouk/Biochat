TITLE
RNA expression analysis in a multigeneration feeding study of OF1 outbred mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze the effect of different aliments, male OF1 mice were fed ad libitum with a custom-made diet containing 33% maize derived from three cultivars containing comparable nutritional values for multiple generations. To evaluate possible effects on the gene expression in the small intestine,  the jejunum of nine randomly chosen males of the F3 was sampled at the age of 7 weeks. Note that the lack of information on the time of sampling or its randomization between the experimental groups limited the value of the internal microarray data set for the context originally addressed (diet).

DESIGN
3 feed groups, 3 replicates per group
