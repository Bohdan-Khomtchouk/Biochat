TITLE
SIRT1-Dependent Gene Regulation Through Promoter-Directed Recruitment of a Nuclear NAD+ Synthase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In mammals, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT-1) constitute a nuclear NAD+ salvage pathway, regulating cellular functions of the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1.  However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which NAD+ biosynthesis controls gene transcription in the nucleus.  In this study, we show that stable knockdown of NAMPT or NMNAT-1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells significantly reduced total cellular NAD+ levels.  Expression microarray analyses demonstrate that both enzymes have broad and overlapping functions in gene regulation.  SIRT1 is a key mediator of NAMPT- and NMNAT-1-dependent gene regulation, and is found at promoters of many of the target genes.  Furthermore, SIRT1 deacetylase activity at these promoters is regulated by NAMPT and NMNAT-1.  Most significantly, NMNAT-1 interacts with SIRT1 and is recruited to target gene promoters by SIRT1.  Our results reveal an unexpected mechanism for the direct control of SIRT1 deacetylase activity at target gene promoters by NMNAT-1.  Interactions between NMNAT-1 and SIRT1 at gene promoters may provide a platform for integration of multiple signaling pathways that regulate transcription.
