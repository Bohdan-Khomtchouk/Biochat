TITLE
Functional assessment of CTCF sites at cytokine-sensing mammary enhancers in mammary gland [4C-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In mammary gland, deletion of the border CTCF site separating the Csn1s1 mammary enhancer from neighboring genes resulted in the activation of Sult1d1 at a distance of more than 95 kb but not the more proximal and silent Sult1e1 gene. Loss of this CTCF site led to de novo interactions between the Sult1d1 promoter and several enhancers in the casein locus.

DESIGN
Examination of chromatin interactions of Sult1d1 promoter in wild-type and CTCF site mutant mammary gland

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
