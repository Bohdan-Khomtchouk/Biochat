TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells during mucosal differentiation and IgE-mediated activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate microRNA expression pattern and its functional relevance on the commitment toward mucosal differentiation and on IgE-mediated activation of mast cells. To identify microRNA genes the expression of which change during the differentiation and activation of murine primary mast cells in vitro, the putative committed progenitors (c-kit+ cells isolated on day 6 from differentiating cultures), immature mast cells (BMMC), mucosal-type mast cells (MMC), and IgE-activated mast cells were compared by Agilent microRNA array.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated by miRNeasy (Qiagen) from:   1) c-kit+ cells, isolated from differentiating cultures (in the presence of IL3 and SCF) derived from the bone marrow using MACS column purification,   2) immature BMMCs obtained by cultivation of bone marrow cells in the presence of IL3 and SCF for 4 weeks,   3) mucosal-type mast cells by additional differentiation of immature BMMCs for 5 days by supplementation of IL9 and TGFbeta, and  4) activated mast cells by presensitization with anti-DNP IgE followed by IgE-crosslinking by DNP-antigen challenge for 2 hours.   Agilent microRNA microarray was run on these experimental groups. Four biological replicates were included in every experimental group.
