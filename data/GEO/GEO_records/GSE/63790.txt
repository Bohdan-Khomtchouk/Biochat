Braf inhibitors reverse the unique molecular signature and phenotype of hairy cell leukemia, and exert anti-leukemic activity

SUMMARY
Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) shows unique clinico-pathological and biological features. HCL responds well to purine analogues but relapses are frequent and novel therapies are required. BRAF-V600E is the key driver mutation in HCL and distinguishes it from other B-cell lymphomas, including HCL-like leukemias/lymphomas (HCL-variant and splenic marginal zone lymphoma). The kinase-activating BRAF-V600E mutation also represents an ideal therapeutic target in HCL. Here, we investigated the biological and therapeutic importance of the activated BRAF-MEK-ERK pathway in HCL by exposing in vitro primary leukemic cells purified from  26 patients to clinically available BRAF (Vemurafenib; Dabrafenib) or MEK (Trametinib) inhibitors. Results were  validated in vivo in samples from Vemurafenib-treated HCL patients within a phase-2 clinical trial. BRAF and MEK inhibitors caused, specifically in HCL (but not HCL-like) cells, marked MEK/ERK dephosphorylation, silencing of the BRAF-MEK-ERK pathway transcriptional output, loss of the HCL-specific gene expression signature, downregulation of the HCL markers CD25, TRAP and cyclin-D1, smoothening of leukemic cells' hairy surface, and, eventually, apoptosis. Apoptosis was partially blunted by co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells antagonizing MEK-ERK dephosphorylation. This protective effect could be counteracted by combined BRAF and MEK inhibition. Our results strongly support and inform the clinical use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in HCL.

DESIGN
Analysis of  differential gene expression in primary leukemic cells purified from peripheral blood of 6 HCL patients (from A to F), treated with Vemurafenib 1000 nM, in comparison  with vehicle-treated (DMSO) HCL cells, for 48 hours or/and 72 hours. 24 gene expression profiles were analysed.
