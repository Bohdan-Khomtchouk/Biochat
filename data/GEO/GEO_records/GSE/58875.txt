TITLE
Influence of dietary sucrose and copper content in a rat model of non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Nutrigenomics analysis was used to investigate the molecular responses to dietary Cu deficiency independently and in combination with 30% (w/w) sucrose in a mature rat model of NAFLD. Low Cu significantly decreased hepatic and serum Cu, and induced NAFLD-like histopathology, mild steatosis, up-regulated transcripts in inflammation and hepatic stellate cell activation, and significantly increased oxidative stress. Rats fed low Cu together with 30% sucrose also developed insulin resistance, increased ATP citrate lyase and FASN expression, and greater oxidative stress. High sucrose with adequate Cu also promoted inflammation and fibrosis, but not steatosis. This study indicates that low dietary Cu and sucrose consumption are singular and synergistic dietary factors in promotion of NAFLD and NASH that act independently of obesity or severe steatosis, likely by promoting oxidative stress and activation of inflammation and fibrosis.

DESIGN
Mature (6 months old) male Wistar Rats that had been allowed ad libitum access to Mazuri rodent pellets were used in the study. Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups and fed for 12 weeks with diets based on the Purified AIN76A formulation, modified for target sucrose and Cu content (Custom Animal Diets, Bangor, NJ). Sucrose and copper content in diets were as follows: ‘A’ CuD/30%- Cu deficient ( < 0.3 mg Cu/kg)/30% sucrose, ‘B’ CuA/30%- Cu adequate (125 mg/kg)/30% sucrose, ‘C’ CuD/10%- < 0.3 mg/kg Cu/10% sucrose, and ‘D’ CuA (125 mg/kg Cu)/10% sucrose (control). Starch and dextrin were used to equalize carbohydrates.
