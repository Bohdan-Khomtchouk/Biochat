TITLE
Expression variation in the mouse retina

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression analysis of multiple mouse strains across two developmental timepoints to determine both strain specific and temporal expression of genes in the mouse retina

DESIGN
A total of 29 retinas were collected from 15 mice of each strain at similar time points during the day. Equimolar amounts of RNA isolated from ten retinas were pooled into three separate pools from each strain and time point, then hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse 420A 2.0 GeneChip arrays.
