TITLE
Expression data from mutant of RSC chromatin-remodeling complex in respiratory growth

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
RSC is a growth essential ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nps1/Sth1 is the ATPase subunit of the complex. A temperature-sensitive mutant allele of NPS1, nps1-13 and the null mutation of the RSC2 or RSC7 gene showed growth defect on a medium containing non fermentable carbon source, such as lactate or ethanol-glycerol (YPEG), suggested a possibility that RSC plays a role on mitochondria function. We used microarrays to compare the global gene expression profiles between the wild type and nps1-13 mutant under respiratory condition.

DESIGN
WT (BY4743) and nps1-13 strains pre-grown in YPD medium were inoculated in YPEG medium for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. In order to obtain more global insights into the role of RSC under respiratory conditions, we perfomed the genome-wide expression analysis of nps1-13 in YPEG medium.
