TITLE
Responses to ethanol in haploid and diploid strain

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Diploid and haploid strains often exhibit different tolerance to variety of stresses. Transcriptome  of acclimation to ethanol stress in diploid and haploid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was analyzed. We analyzed transcriptome profiles of diploid and haploid strains in the presence of ethanol.

DESIGN
Haploid and diploid strains were cultured in YEPD media with 0%, 3% and 7% ethanol(v/v) in fermentors. The samples were collected at the growth stage for each strain under different conditions.
