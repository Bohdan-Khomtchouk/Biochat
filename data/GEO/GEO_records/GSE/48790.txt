TITLE
Expression data from GTF2i mutated ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Data present the expression analysis of different mouse ES cell line with altered expression of GTF2I.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying altered expression of GTF2I and identified distinct classes of deregulated genes
