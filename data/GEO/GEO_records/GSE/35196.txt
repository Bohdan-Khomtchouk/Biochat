TITLE
Transcriptional profiling comparing MiaPaCa2 pancreatic cancer cells transfected with S100PBP siRNA to MiaPaCa2 cells transfected with non-targeting control siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
S100PBP is significantly down-regulated in pancreatic cancer compared to normal samples. The functional roles of S100PBP are unknown, and therefore, profiling cells after silencing of this gene may lead to further understanding of its functional mechanisms.

DESIGN
We have performed microarray gene expression analysis of MiaPaCa2 cells treated with S100PBP siRNA compared to the same cells transfected with non-targeting control siRNA.
