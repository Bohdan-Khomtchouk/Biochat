TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of human breast and prostate cancer cell lines on lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LPA is a natural bioactive lipid with growth factor-like functions due to activation of series of six G protein-coupled receptors (LPA1-6). In this study we determine the LPA induced early-gene expression profile in three unrelated human cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MCF7, PC3) with an objective to identify potential biomarker/s specifically upregulated through the activation of LPA receptor type 1 (LPA1)

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231, MCF7, PC3 cells were serum starved for 24h and then stimulated with LPA (1ÂµM) for 45min. The controls were the serum starved unstimulated cells. Two replicates for each sample were included in this study. Microarray analysis was performed using a high-density oligonucleotide array (GeneChip Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 array, Affymetrix)
