TITLE
Mouse mammary tumor cell line exon arrays

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study presents exon array expression data for multiple mammary tumor cell lines derived from various genetically-engineered mouse models of mammary cancer as well as from cell lines derived from spontaneously arising mouse mammary tumors.

DESIGN
Cell lines were harvested during growth phase in culture, RNA extracted and exon array analyses performed.  One sample per cell line was analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL6096 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
