TITLE
Evaluation of gene expression profiling in mouse selected populations of bone metastatasis derivatives

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For many breast cancer (BCa) patients, symptomatic bone metastases appear after years or even decades of latency. How metastatic cells disseminate, and how micromet­astatic lesions remain dormant and undetectable, are major questions in cancer research. Here we identify and func­tionally analyse a molecular mechanism involved in the bone metastatic latency of estrogen receptor (ER)+ BCa.

DESIGN
Comparison of cells before and after residing in the mouse for 170 days. Gene expression was analyzed using Affymetrix Human Genome 133PM strip.

PLATFORM
GPL13158 [HT_HG-U133_Plus_PM] Affymetrix HT HG-U133+ PM Array Plate
