TITLE
Differentially expressed genes in certinib-resistant NB-1 xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to elucidate the molecular mechanism that allowed NB-1 xenograft tumors to grow out in the presence of continued ALK inhibition.  Poly(A)-selected RNA was extracted from tissues of NB-1 tumors that progressed on ceritinib treatment and those treated with a vehicle to identify differentially expressed genes between these two groups.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of NB-1 xenograft tumors that progressed on ceritinib treatment and those treated with a vehicle were generated by RNA sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500.

PLATFORM
