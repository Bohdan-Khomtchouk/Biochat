TITLE
Budding yeast ATM/ATR contribute to meiotic double-strand-break (DSB) homeostasis by down-regulating Rec114, an essential component of the DSB-machinery

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In most organisms, meiotic recombination begins with programmed DNA double strand  break (DSB) formation by Spo11. Here, we present evidence that Tel1/Mec1, the  budding yeast ATM/ATR, regulate DSB formation by phosphorylating Rec114, an  essential Spo11-accessory protein. Analyses of a non-phosphorylatable- or phosphomimetic-  alleles of rec114 revealed that DSB-dependent phosphorylation of Rec114  limited its association with DSB-hotspots resulting in reduction in DSB formation. Also  observed were the impact of Rec114 phosphorylation on its homolog synapsis-associated  removal from chromosomes and NDT80-dependent turnover. Specifically, we found that  the synapsis- and NDT80-dependent Rec114 downregulation occurred later in the rec114  mutant with a reduced Spo11-catalysis, but earlier in the other with an enhanced  catalysis, strongly implicating the existence of a feedback mechanism coupling the extent  of Spo11-catalysis to Rec114 activity. Taken together, these observations suggest that  three different mechanisms of down regulating Rec114 contribute to meiotic DSB  homeostasis, a feedback mechanism to maintain the number of meiotic DSBs at the  developmentally programmed level.

DESIGN
6 genome wide ChIPchip sets: 3 for meiotic DSB formation (Spo11-ChIP) and 3 for protein-DNA association (Rec114-ChIP), each for wild type and two mutants during meiosis (corresponding to the main Figure 3, as well as to Figures S3, S4, S5).
