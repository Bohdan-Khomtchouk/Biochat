TITLE
MicroRNA expression profile of PBMCs in OAD mice and control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression profiling was performed in PBMCs collected from 12 C57B/6 mice at 7 and 15 days after administration of H2Kb and Isotype antibody. Results: there was a substantial proportion of microRNAs changed over time in OAD mice compared to control mice. Dysregulated microRNA expression in murine obliterative airway disease induced by anti-MHC I antibodies

DESIGN
MicroRNA expression profiling was performed in PBMCs collected from 12 C57B/6 mice at 7 and 15 days after administration of H2Kb and Isotype antibody.
