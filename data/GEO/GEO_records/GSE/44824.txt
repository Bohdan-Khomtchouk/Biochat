TITLE
MyoD and myogenin ChIP-seq in differentiated C2C12 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The submitted files contain ChIP-seq data for the MyoD and myogenin muscle regulatory factors in diffrentiated C2C12 cells as well as two different sonicated input samples (one from a regular 1% formaldehyde fixation and one from a dual 1%FA + 1.5 mM EGS fix).

DESIGN
Characterization of genome-wide MyoD and myogenin binding in C2C12 cells

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
