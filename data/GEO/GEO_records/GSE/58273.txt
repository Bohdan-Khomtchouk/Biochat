TITLE
Stem cells respond to triiodothytonine (T3) treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of T3 response in KCL034, iKCL004 and BJ cells at gene expression level. Results provide information of the T3 response in different lines.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from KCL034, iKCL004 and BJ cells treated with T3 for 0 and 6 h. T3 response in each cell line was analyzed.
