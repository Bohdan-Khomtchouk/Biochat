TITLE
DNA methylation analysis of Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney, Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney and Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney, Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors and non-neoplastic kidney. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 27 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27000 CpGs  . Samples included 3 Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney, 3 Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, 3 Ewing's sarcoma family of tumor and 3 non-neoplastic kidney.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 12 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 Beadchip.
