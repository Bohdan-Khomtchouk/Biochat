SUMMARY
Host cells harbor various intrinsic mechanisms to restrict viral infections as a first line of antiviral defense. Viruses have evolved various countermeasures against these antiviral mechanisms. Here we show that N-Myc Downstream-Reguated Gene 1 (NDRG1) limits productive HCV infection by inhibiting viral assembly. Interestingly, HCV infection down-regulates NDRG1 protein and mRNA expression. Loss of NDRG1 increases the size and number of lipid droplets, which are the sites of HCV assembly. HCV suppresses NDRG1 expression by up-regulating MYC, which directly inhibits the transcription of NDRG1. Up-regulation of MYC also leads to reduced expression of NDRG1-specific kinase SGK1, resulting in markedly diminished phosphorylation of NDRG1. Knockdown of MYC during HCV infection rescues NDRG1 expression and phosphorylation, suggesting that MYC regulates NDRG1 at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. Overall, our results suggest that NDRG1 restricts HCV assembly by limiting lipid droplet formation. HCV counteracts this intrinsic antiviral mechanism by down-regulating NDRG1 via a MYC-dependent mechanism.

DESIGN
We knocked down NDRG1 by transfecting cells in triplicate with siNDRG1 or siNT as control, we then analyzed the results to determine differential gene expression and differentially regulated pathways.
