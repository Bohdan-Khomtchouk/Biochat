TITLE
Realtime quantitative PCR array of miRNAs expressed in E15 - E18 mouse male and female fetal lungs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
qPCR profiling of miRNAs in mouse fetal lungs was done. Lungs were dissected and RNA was extracted using miRVANA extraction kit (Applied Biosystems).

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from 2 separate lungs (labeled as A or B) for each time point and 2 technical replicates were run for each sample (labeled as 1 or 2).
