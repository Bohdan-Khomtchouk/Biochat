TITLE
H3K4me3 ChIP in multiple myeloma MM1S cells in the presence and absence of KDM5-C70

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this experiment we demonstrate the use of an inhibitor of the KDM5 family of histone demethylases, KDM5-C70, on H3K4me3 marks in the multiple myeloma cell line MM1S.  KDM5-C70 increases H3K4me3 in a global fashion across the genome.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K4me3 mark across MM1S cells treated with either KDM5-C70 or vehicle control
