TITLE
Expression data from mouse hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a specialized group of cells with the ability to self-renew and differentiate into distinct lineages of the entire hematopoietic system throughout lifetime. The maintenance of a quiescent state is essential for sustaining the normal function of HSCs. Many regulatory factors involved in HSC quiescence maintenance have been found. However the role steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) in the regulation of HSC maintenance remains unexplored. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in lineage- Sca1+ c-Kit+ cells (LSKs) from wild-type (WT) and SRC-3 knockout (KO) mice and identified distinct classes of altered genes after SRC-3 knockout.

DESIGN
To obtain differentially expressed genes in LSKs after SRC-3 knockout. Total RNA was extracted from sorted WT or SRC-3-deficient LSKs. Then, cDNA was generated and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays in duplicate.
