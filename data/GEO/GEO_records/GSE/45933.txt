TITLE
Expression data from Bacillus subtilis 168 during growth

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
The gene expression of Bacillus subtilis 168 showed 3 major patterns including early expression, transition expression and late expression We monitored Bacillus subtilis gene expression by using microarray at differernt time points

DESIGN
Bacillus subtilis 168 was choosed as model for gram-positive to study gene expression at different stages
