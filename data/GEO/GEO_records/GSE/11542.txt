TITLE
Expression data from rat mixed tissues samples

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To evaluate gene expression changes in mixed tissue samples used as process controls in male Sprague Dawley rats over time. Keywords: process control

DESIGN
This study is designed to evaluate gene expression changes in mixed tissue samples MT1 (Liver:kidney:testes:brain = 3:2:1:4 ) and MT2 (Liver:kidney:testes:brain = 2:2:4:2) over time.  These samples are used as process controls in rat microarray experiments.
