STAT5 antagonism of B cell enhancer networks drives leukemia and poor patient surviva

SUMMARY
The transcription factor STAT5 plays a critical role in B cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL).  How STAT5 mediates this effect is unclear.  Here we demonstrate that STAT5 activation cooperates with defects in the pre-BCR signaling components Blnk, Btk, Prkcb, Nfkb1, and Ikzf1 to initiate B-ALL.  STAT5 antagonizes NFkB and IKAROS by opposing regulation of shared target genes.  STAT5 binding was enriched at super-enhancers, which were associated with an opposing network of transcription factors, including PAX5, EBF1, PU.1, IRF4, and IKAROS.  Patients with high ratios of active STAT5 to NFÎºB or IKAROS have more aggressive disease.  Our studies illustrate that an imbalance of two opposing transcriptional programs drive B-ALL, and suggest that restoring the balance of these pathways may inhibit B-ALL.
