TITLE
Global mRNA expression profiling of murine primary PDAC cells following JQ1 or SAHA monotherapy as well as JQ1-SAHA combination therapy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global mRNA expression profiles of murine primary PDAC cells following JQ1 or SAHA monotherapy as well as JQ1-SAHA combination therapy were collected using Affymetix mouse whole genome array (Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array) . Primary PDAC cells isolated from Ptf1aCre/+;Kras+/LSL-G12D;p53lox/lox (Kras;p53) mice were treated either with JQ1 (100 nM) or SAHA (2000 nM) or vehicle 10% (2-Hydroxypropyl)-Î²-cyclodextrin (Sigma-Aldrich) or as combination therapy with the indicated dosage for monotherapy. Total RNA isolation was performed after 6 hours of treatment.

DESIGN
Primary PDAC cells from Ptf1aCre/+;Kras+/LSL-G12D;p53lox/lox (Kras;p53) mice treated either with JQ1, SAHA, vehicle or JQ1-SAHA combination were analyzed by global gene expression analysis.
