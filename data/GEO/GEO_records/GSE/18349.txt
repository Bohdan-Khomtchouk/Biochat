TITLE
Expression data from +7 hNPCs and diploid hNPCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human Neural progenitor cells have been found to have karyotypic abnormalities.  In this study we explored the gene changes between hNPCs that are karyotypically normal and hNPCs with a trisomy of chromosome 7. We used Affymetrix GeneChips to study gene expression changes between karyotypically normal hNPCs and trisomy 7 hNPCs.

DESIGN
Cells grown in culture for ~20 passages from diploid and + 7 hNPCs were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
