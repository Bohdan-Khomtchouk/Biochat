TITLE
Glomerular Transcriptome Profiling Comparing DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparing glomerular gene expression level between mice with different susceptibilities to diabetic nephropathy, DBA/2 (susceptible) and C57BL/6 (resistant) mice, respectively. The hypothesis is that differential expression of glomerular genes regulate susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy. The results show immune related genes. Thus, glomerular inflammation may increase susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in mice.

DESIGN
RNA isolated from kidney glomeruli of DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice, with or without 4 weeks diabetes induced by streptozotocin.

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
