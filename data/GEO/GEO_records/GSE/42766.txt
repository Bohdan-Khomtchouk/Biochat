TITLE
Effect of 17 β-estradiol on developing zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Estrogen signaling is important for vertebrate embryonic development. Here we have used zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a vertebrate model to identify estrogen regulated genes during the first 4 days of development. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 1 µM 17β-estradiol from 3 hours post fertilization to 4 days post fertilization, harvested daily and subjected to RNA extraction for transcriptome analysis using microarrays. Estrogen responsive genes were analyzed with hierarchical clustering followed by gene function and tissue expression analysis. Markedly distinct sets of genes were up and down-regulated by estrogen treatment at different time points. Among these genes, only the well-known estrogenic marker vtg1 was co-regulated at all time points. Despite this, the biological functional categories targeted by estrogen were similar throughout zebrafish development. Estrogen responsive genes were enriched mainly in the liver, pancreas and brain. In conclusion, our data shows that in zebrafish distinct cohorts of E2 responsive genes are expressed in a tissue specific manner at different developmental stages. However, the biological pathways that are affected are conserved.

DESIGN
30 embryos were pooled as one sample and exposed to 1 μM E2 or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) at approximately 3 hours post fertilization (hpf). At different time points, 1 dpf (24 hpf), 2 dpf (48 hpf), 3 dpf (72 hpf) and 4 dpf (104 hpf), embryos were collected for total RNA extractions. Time points 1 and 2 dpf were performed in biological triplicates of independent pools of RNA while time points 3 and 4 dpf were performed in quadruplicates.
