TITLE
Transcriptional profile of thermophilic bacteriophage GVE2 genes

ORGANISM
Geobacillus virus E2

SUMMARY
To investigate the transcriptional profile of GVE2 genes, the viral genes were identified by DNA microarray with Cy5- or Cy3-dUTP-labeled cDNAs prepared from uninfected and GVE2-infected Geobacillus sp. E263 at 4 h p.i.. After hybridization with the Cy3-dUTP-labeled cDNAs from GVE2-infected Geobacillus sp. E263 at 4 h p.i., Cy5-dUTP-labeled cDNAs from uninfected Geobacillus sp. E263 as well as Cy3- dUTP-labeled yeast cDNAs and Hex DNA, many spots produced positive signals significantly above the background, while no signal appeared for the Cy5-dUTP-labeled cDNAs from uninfected Geobacillus sp. E263., indicating that the positive signals represented the GVE2 gene transcripts detectable by DNA microarray. The DNA fragments, detected to be positive in the reverse transcripts at 4 h p.i., contained 74.2% of the presumptive GVE2 ORFs. Keywords: Transcriptional profile of thermophilic bacteriophage at 4 h p.i.
