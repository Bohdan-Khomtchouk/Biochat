TITLE
Identification of TNFα-induced genes that are IRAK1BP1 dependent

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNFα) is a potent inducer of NF-κB dependent gene expression and IRAK1BP1 is required for TNFα-induced NF-κB activity.  Microarrays were used to identify the subset of TNFα-induced genes that are also IRAK1BP1 dependent.

DESIGN
Wild type and KO plus and minus treatment

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
