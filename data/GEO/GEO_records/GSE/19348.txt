TITLE
expression data from pediatric primary intracranial germ cell tumor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intracranial pediatric germ cell tumors (GCTs) have different histological differentiations, prognosis and clinical behaviors. Prognosis of patients with germinoma and mature teratoma is good, while patients with other types of GCTs, termed as nongerminomatous malignant germ cell tumors (NGMGCTs), require more extensive drug and irradiation treatment regimen. The mechanisms underlying different prognosis of various GCT subgroups remain elusive. We presented a distinct mRNA profile correlating with GCT histological differentiation and prognosis.

DESIGN
13 central nervous system GCT cases with different histological subtypes are subjected to transcriptome analysis. The histological subtypes are germinoma, mixed GCT of germinoma and mature teratoma , immature teratoma , mixed GCTs of NGMGCTs category,  yolk sac tumor, immature teratoma, and embryonal carcinoma.
