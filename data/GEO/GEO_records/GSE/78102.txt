TITLE
RNA-seq of HL60 cells treated with epigenetic therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was performed after HL60 cells were treated with S2101, UNC0638, GSK343, depsipeptide alone or in combination with decitabine

DESIGN
Biological triplicates were performed for a total of 30 samples. Fold change of each gene was calculated by comparing change in expression after inhibitor treatment to expression in the control samples
