TITLE
The nucleosomal barrier to promoter escape by RNA Polymerase II is overcome by the chromatin remodeler Chd1 [NimbleGen]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We use a metabolic labeling strategy for directly measuring nucleosome turnover to determine the role of chromatin remodeler Chd1 on chromatin dynamics in mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing with wildtype-Chd1 and dominant negative K510R-Chd1. We find that expression of K510R-Chd1 decreases nucleosome turnover at the promoter and increases turnover within the gene body.
