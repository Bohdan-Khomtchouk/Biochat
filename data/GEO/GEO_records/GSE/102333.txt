TITLE
Gene expression profiling of MEFs with and without Mitf induction compared to wild type MEF and primaryt melanocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed a global mRNA expression profiling via RNA-seq. Genes differentially expressed in Mitf knock-in MEFs compared to vehicle-treated knock-in MEFs were clustered and compared to expression in untreated wild-type MEFs and primary mouse melanocytes. This clustering demonstrates a gradual transition in the expression profile of Dox-treated Mitf knock-in MEFs toward the melanocyte expression profile

DESIGN
Cells were grown in monolayer on 10cm plates. Mitf knock-in MEFs were treated with Dox for 6 days Mitf induction. RNA was extracted from Trizol pellets of wild type MEFs, Dox treated Mitf knock-in MEFs for 6 days, untreated Mitf knock-in MEFs and primary mouse melanocytes, and utilized for RNA-seq by TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina) according to manufacturerâ€™s instruction.
