TITLE
Expression profiles from mouse prostate progenitor/stem cells treated with ethanol or 100nM 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A major goal in prostate stem cell biology is to identify genes, pathways, or networks that control self-renewal and multilineage differentiation.  We hypothesize that 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 can induce differentiation of prostatic progenitor/stem cells, thus serving as an in vitro model with which to study the molecular mechanisms of stem cell differentiation by 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3.  1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 elicits its effects primarily through transcriptional regulation of genes, so microarray studies were used to gain insight into the cellular response to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression changes that occur upon 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment of prostatic progenitor/stem cells.

DESIGN
Adult mouse prostate progenitor/stem cells were plated at 1 x 10^5 cells per 10 cm culture dish and grown to 70% confluency before treatment with vehicle (0.1% ethanol) or 100 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 in cell culture media (n = 3 or 4).  Cells were treated with control or experimental media for 6 hrs or 48 hrs before RNA isolation.  The RNA from 6 hrs and 48 hrs was used to probe Affymetrix 430A oligonucleotide arrays (GPL339).
