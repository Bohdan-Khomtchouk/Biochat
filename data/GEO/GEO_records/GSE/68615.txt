TITLE
An autoregulatory RelB:p50 NF-κB pathway perpetuates pro-survival TNF response in multiple myeloma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pro-inflammatory cytokines were shown to promote growth and survival of cancerous cells.  TNF induced RelA:p50 NF-κB dimer via the canonical pathway is thought to link inflammation with cancer.  Integrating biochemical and computational studies we identify that deficiency of non-canonical signal transducer p100 triggers a positive autoregulatory loop, which instead perpetuates an alternate RelB:p50 containing NF-κB activity upon TNF treatment.  TNF stimulated RelB:p50 dimer is sufficient for mediating NF-κB target gene-expressions and suppressing apoptotic cellular death independent of principal NF-κB subunit RelA.  We further demonstrate that activating mutations in non-canonical NF-κB module deplete multiple myeloma cells of p100, thereby, provoking autoregulatory RelB:p50 activation.  Finally, autoregulatory control reinforces protracted pro-survival NF-κB response, albeit comprising of RelB:p50, upon TNF priming that protects myeloma cells with dysfunctional p100 from subsequent apoptotic insults.  In sum, we present evidence for positive autoregulation mediated through the NF-κB system and its potential involvement in human neoplasm.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from biological replicate samples comprising of untreated and 6h TNF (10ng/ml) treated WT, Rela-/-Nfkb2-/- and Rela-/-Relb-/-Rel-/- MEFs were analyzed for global gene expression levels
