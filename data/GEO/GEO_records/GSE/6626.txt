TITLE
Sir2-family of histone deacetylase regulated gene expression in Candida glabrata

ORGANISM
[Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
Sir2-family of NAD-dependent histone deacetylases are involved in gene transcription repression in yeast. The C. glabrata genes encoding members of this family are SIR2 (CAGL0K01463g), HST1 (CAGL0C05357g), HST2 (CAGL0L08668g), HST3 (CAGL0H08239g) and HST4 (CAGL0F05621g). SIR4 (CAGL0K11396g) encodes a factor that forms a functional complex with Sir2. In this experiment, the transcription profile of C. glabrata HST1 null, HST2 null, SIR2 null or SIR4 null strain individually comparing with that of wild type strain was determined. All strains were grown in YPD liquid medium in Log phase at 30 C. Keywords: transcriptional profiling by microarray
