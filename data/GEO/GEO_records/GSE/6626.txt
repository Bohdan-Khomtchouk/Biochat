TITLE
Sir2-family of histone deacetylase regulated gene expression in Candida glabrata

ORGANISM
[Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
Sir2-family of NAD-dependent histone deacetylases are involved in gene transcription repression in yeast. The C. glabrata genes encoding members of this family are SIR2 (CAGL0K01463g), HST1 (CAGL0C05357g), HST2 (CAGL0L08668g), HST3 (CAGL0H08239g) and HST4 (CAGL0F05621g). SIR4 (CAGL0K11396g) encodes a factor that forms a functional complex with Sir2. In this experiment, the transcription profile of C. glabrata HST1 null, HST2 null, SIR2 null or SIR4 null strain individually comparing with that of wild type strain was determined. All strains were grown in YPD liquid medium in Log phase at 30 C. Keywords: transcriptional profiling by microarray

DESIGN
For HST1, GSM152133, GSM153296 are dye-swap experiment #1; GSM153702, GSM153703 are dye-swap experiment #2; and GSM153704, GSM153705 are dye-swap experiment #3. For HST2, GSM153706, GSM153708 are dye-swap experiment #1 and GSM153713, GSM153715 are dye-swap experiment #2. For SIR2, GSM153742, GSM153743 are dye-swap experiment #1 and GSM153744, GSM153749 are dye-swap experiment #2. For SIR4, GSM153750, GSM153752 are dye-swap experiment #1 and GSM153753, GSM153754 are dye-swap experiment #2.
