TITLE
Altered mRNA expression profile of GW4064 treated mouse livers compared to vehicle control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a ligand activated nuclear receptor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. Bile acids (BAs) are the endogenous ligand for FXR. FXR is a master regulator of BA homestasis, including BA synthesis, metabolism, transport, and enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, FXR is involved in regulating diverse physioligical function in both humans and mice. GW4064 is a synthetic FXR agonist which selectively activates FXR and induce the transcription of FXR target genes.

DESIGN
In this study, we treated wild type C57BL/6J mice with GW4064 at 100mg per kg body weight or vehicle control. Mice were treated three times, first dose at 8 am, second dose at 6 pm, third dose at 8 am the second day. Mice were sacrificed 2 hours after the last dose, and liver tissues were harvested for analysis. Animal protocols and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Total RNA from livers was prepared with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, CA), and the whole transcription expression levels were determined using Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array system manufactured by Affymetrix, Inc..
