TITLE
Chronic haloperidol effects on open chromatin accessibility in mouse [DNase-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We evaluate the effects of chronic administration of antipsychotic haloperidol versus placebo in male, 8-week old, C57BL/6J mice.

DESIGN
We used DNase-seq to study chromatin landscape changes after haloperidol treatment in striatum samples of 7 mice (3 haloperidol-treated mice, 4 placebo-treated mice).
