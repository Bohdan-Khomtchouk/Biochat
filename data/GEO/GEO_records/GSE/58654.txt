TITLE
cDNA microarray analysis of sulforaphane effect on mouse acute lung injury caused by hyperoxia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Protective roles of Nrf2, a key transcription factor for antioxidant and defense genes, have been determined in oxidative lung injury, and health benefits of Nrf2 agonists including sulforaphane have been demonstrated. The current study was designed to investigate the effect of sulforaphane on model acute lung injury and sulforaphane-mediated transcriptome changes in mouse lungs. Adult mice genetically deficient in Nrf2 (Nrf2-/-) and wild-type controls (Nrf2+/+, ICR) received oral sulforaphane (9 mmol/daily) or vehicle before (-5, -3, -1 days) hyperoxia or air exposure (3 days), and lung injury and gene expression changes were assessed. Sulforaphane significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced airway injury, inflammation, and mucus hypersecretion in Nrf2+/+ mice while relatively marginal treatment effect was found in Nrf2-/- mice. Sulforaphane significantly altered expression of lung genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction (Atp2a2, Cox7a1, Ndufa1) basally and cell function/cycle and protein metabolism (Actr1a, Wasf2, Ccne1, Gtpbp4) after hyperoxia in Nrf2+/+ mice. Nrf2-dependently modulated lung genes by sulforaphane and hyperoxia were associated with tissue development and hereditary disorders (Slc25a3, Pccb, Psmc3ip). Results demonstrate preventive roles of sulforaphane against oxidant lung injury in mice, and reveal potential downstream mechanisms. Our observations also suggest Nrf2-independent mechanisms of sulforaphane in prevention of acute lung injury.

DESIGN
Nrf 2 knockout and wild-type mice were dosed with 9 uM R-Sulforaphane before their continuous exposure to air (21% O2) or hyperoxia (100% O2) for 3 days in a whole-body inhalation chamber
