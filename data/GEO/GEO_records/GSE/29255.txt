TITLE
Transcriptional profiling from young, old, healthy, or injured rat iliac arteries.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling from young, old, healthy, or injured rat iliac arteries.

DESIGN
We studied the gene expression profile in a model of mechanical vascular injury in the iliac artery of aging (22 months old) and young rats (4 months old). We investigated aging-related variations in gene expression at 30 min, 3d and 7d post injury.
