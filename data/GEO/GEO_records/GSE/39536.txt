TITLE
C.elegans exposed to P. aeurigonsa: Colonized vs Non colonized animals

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of adult C.elegans exposed to E.coli or to GFP-expressing P. aeruginosa (strain PA14). For P. aeruginosa exposure, worms were separated into 2 groups - fully colonized (green) or non-colonized (dark).

DESIGN
Three conditions (E.coli, P. aeurginosa colonized, and P. aeurginosa non-colonized). 2-color arrrays, each sample co-hybridized with the same reference RNA sample from mixed stage C.elegans cultures Each condition includes 3 biological replicates - 2 using the wormsorter (WS) to separate colonized from non-colonized and one hand picked (HP) under a fluorescent stereoscope
