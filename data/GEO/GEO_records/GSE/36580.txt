TITLE
AcceSssIble: an array-based assay for the study of chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation using the CpG methyltransferase SssI

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of nucleosome positioning and chromatin state by using CpG methyltransferase M.SssI to methylate nuclei. Unmethylated regions that gain methylation (low to high beta value) are known to be accessible and nucleosome depleted.

DESIGN
Intact nuclei are harvested from cells and treated with M.SssI. DNA is then extracted, bisulfite converted and run on an Infinium methylation array, along with a no-enzyme control. Background subtracted beta values (listed below) are used to determine regions that have gained methylation on enzyme treatment compared to the control - and these are used to infer chromatin state
