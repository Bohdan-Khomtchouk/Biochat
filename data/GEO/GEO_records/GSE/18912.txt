TITLE
Expression profiling of breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MCF-7R4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 is usually sensitive to chemotherapy drug BMS-554417, an insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) inhibitor. However, through step-wise increase in BMS-554417 doses in culture media, we were able able to screen and select a single MCF-7 clone that is BMS-554417 resistant.  It is cross resistant to BMS-536924. This new line of MCF-7 cells was named as MCF-7R4. The transcriptome profiling of both MCF-7 and MCF-7R4 was performed using Affymetrix HG-U133 plus2.0 GeneChip arrays.

DESIGN
Five replicates of MCF-7 and five replicates of MCF-7R4 were profiled.
