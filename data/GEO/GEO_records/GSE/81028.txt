TITLE
Nucleosome occupancy as a novel chromatin parameter for replication origin functions

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
This study defines nucleosome occupancy as a novel parameter for regulating origin activities. Nucleosome occupancy at origins was assessed using histone H3 ChIP-seq during G1 and G2M. Origin activity was determined using BrdU ChIP-seq.

DESIGN
Nucleosome occupancy at origins was assessed using histone H3 ChIP-seq during G1 and G2M.
