TITLE
Gene expression profiling of liver from regulatar chow (RC) fed-mice, high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice with vehicle or nobiletin (NOB) treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of liver transcriptome between RC-fed mice, HFD-fed mice with vehicle or nobiletin treatment provides the possibility to identify the effects of nobiletin on gene expression altered by HFD relative to RC.   We used Illumina microarrays to analyze liver transcriptome of different treatment groups following exposure to RC, HFD.Veh (denoted as the HFD group) and  HFD.NOB (denoted as the NOB group).

DESIGN
The microarray experiment was performed to investigate effects of HFD and NOB on mouse liver transcriptome. Liver tissues were collected at ZT2 and ZT14 (corresponding to 2 hours after light on and light off, respectively).    The pooled RNA samples, 4 mice each group, were used for the microarray.
