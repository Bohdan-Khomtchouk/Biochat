TITLE
cDNA expression profiling of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells upon β-hydroxybutyrate treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigating the gene expression profile changes upon β-hydroxybutyrate treatment in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells w/ or w/o MCT2 expression

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 shLacZ and MCT2-depleted cells were cultured in the presence of 10 mM β-hydroxybutyrate. The total RNAs were extracted and subjected to microarray analyses.
