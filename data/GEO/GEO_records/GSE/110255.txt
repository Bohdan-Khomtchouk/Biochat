TITLE
Sulfamethoxazole – Trimethoprim represses csgD but 2 maintains virulence genes at 30°C in a clinical 3 Escherichia coli O157:H7 isolate

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The high frequency of prophage insertions in the mlrA gene of clinical serotype O157:H7  isolates renders such strains deficient in csgD-dependent biofilm formation but prophage  induction may restore certain mlrA properties. In this study we used transcriptomics to  study the effect of high and low sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim (SMX-TM)  concentrations on prophage induction, biofilm regulation, and virulence gene expression  in strain PA20 under environmental conditions following five-hour and 12-hour  exposures. SMX-TM at a sub-lethal concentration induced strong RecA expression  resulting in concentration- and time-dependent major transcriptional shifts with emphasis  on up-regulation of genes within horizontally-transferred chromosomal regions (HTR).  Neither high or low levels of SMX-TM stimulated csgD expression at either time point,  but both levels resulted in slight suppression. Full expression of Ler-dependent genes  paralleled expression of group 1 pch homologues in the presence of high glrA. Finally,  stx2 expression, which is strongly dependent on prophage induction, was enhanced at 12  hours but suppressed at five hours, in spite of early SOS initiation by the high SMX-TM  concentration. Our findings indicate that, similar to host conditions, exposure to  environmental conditions increased the expression of virulence genes in a clinical isolate  but genes involved in the protective biofilm response were suppressed.

DESIGN
We evaluated mRNA expression profile of 2 time points and 3 sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim (SMX-TM) concentrations
