TITLE
Karyotype analysis of S. cerevisiae chromosome replacement lines - alpha-type cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces bayanus ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The S. cerevisiae hybrid karyotypes were analyzed by array-CGH to identify small regions of duplication or homeologous chromosomal exchange occurring during the strain construction.

DESIGN
alpha-type cells. S. cerevisiae vs. Chromosome replacement lines. Biological replicates: 1 control (S. bayanus), 11 Chromosome replacement lines, independently grown and harvested. Two replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL7305 IMB yeast 7K operon oligo array
