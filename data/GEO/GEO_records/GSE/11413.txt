TITLE
Me-DIP-chip data from osteosarcoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Malignant cells show major disruptions in DNA methylation profiles which manifest as aberrant hypermethylation and hypomethylation of gene promoters as well as global genomic hypomethylation. To date, many genes with aberrant promoter hypermethylation have been identified in essentially all forms of cancer including cell cycle regulators, DNA repair genes, genes associated with apoptosis, hormonal regulation, detoxification, metastasis, angiogenesis, and many others We developed an effective high-resolution approach for mapping genome-wide, and cancer-specific DNA methylation profiles. We have used this approach to provide first genomic DNA methylation profiling in osteosarcoma cells Keywords: comparative profiling

DESIGN
We utilized this platform in combination with the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (Me-DIP) to develop a comprehensive approach for detection of hypo- and hypermethylation changes at high resolution, and used it to detect such changes in human osteosarcoma cells in relation to the normal human osteoblasts.
