TITLE
CpG island methylation data from maternal venous blood and infant cord blood samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The biological mechanism of cadmium's effects is poorly characterized. This data was generated in order to help better understand the epigenetic role that Cadmium plays. We used the MIRA assay and the Affymetrix Human Promoter 1.0R Array in order to measure methylation levels in promoter regions.

DESIGN
34 samples corresponding to 17 mother-infant pairs were selected based upon measured levels of cadmium in the blood. Methylated DNA fragments were then isolated, amplified, and run on the Affymetrix Human Promoter 1.0R Array. Results were then summarized to CpG islands for each sample.
