TITLE
Host cell gene expression in Influenza A/duck/Malaysia/F118/08/2004 (H5N2) infected CEF cells at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours post infection

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We used the microarray data to analyze host cells response on CEF cells infected with A/duck/Malaysia/F118/08/2004(H5N2)

DESIGN
A/duck/Malaysia/F118/08/2004(H5N2) infected CEF cells were harvested at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 hpi and RNA extraction was performed using standard protocol as described by Affymetrix. The aim of this experiment is to analyze host response to Influenza A/duck/Malaysia/F118/08/2004(H5N2) infection.
