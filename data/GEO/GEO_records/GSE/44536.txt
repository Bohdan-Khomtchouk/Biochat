TITLE
A global differential transcriptomic profiling of Mycobacterium gilvum PYR-GCK during pyrene and glucose metabolism, using RNA seq.

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium gilvum PYR-GCK

SUMMARY
We report the differential expression of a PAH degrading bacterium in different states of substrate induction.

DESIGN
Separate substrate cultivation of the same batch of bacterial isolates; total RNA extraction, processing and sequencing; gene expression analysis using bioinformatics softwares and experimental validation using qRT-PCR.

PLATFORM
