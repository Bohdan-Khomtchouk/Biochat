Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to survey gene expression of potato (solanum tuberosum gilroy) in a variety of tissues and life cycle timepoints.  Potato plants were grown from true seeds, planted in either soil or MS media, and grown in growth chambers.  Four biological replicates each of twenty different tissue samples were collected at the appropriate timepoints.  The samples were immediately frozen at -80.  The tissues were then ground into a powder in liquid nitrogen, and RNA was extracted using Qiagen's QiaShredder columns and Qiagen's Rneasy MinElute Kit.  The RNA was amplified using Arcturus' RiboAmp RNA Amplification Kit.  1ug of amplified RNA was used in TIGR's indirect labelleling procedure.  All hybridaztions were applied to TIGR's 10kV4 potato array. Keywords: Loop design
