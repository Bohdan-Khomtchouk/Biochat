TITLE
Gene expression profiling of peripheral T-cell lymphoma including gamma delta T-cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression profiling in 34 peripheral T-cell lymphoma, including 7 cases of gamma delta T-cell lymphoma to identify a unique T-cell receptor signature gene set for classification of gamma delta T-cell lymphoma and alpha beta T-cell lymphoma.
