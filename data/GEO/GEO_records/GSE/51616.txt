TITLE
Ghd7 is a central regulator for growth, development, adaptation and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Ghd7 regulates a range of functions in growth and development in response to environmental cues to maximize the reproductive success of the rice plant. We used microarrays to detail the regulated genes in OX-Ghd7HJ19 transgenic plants.

DESIGN
To gain clues to downstream genes regulated by Ghd7, we performed a microarray analysis using Affimetrix rice gene chips. Young leaves in vegetative stage (35-days old) and developing panicles (0.1cm) from field-grown OX-Ghd7HJ19 transgenic and wild-type plants with two biological replicates were used to isolate RNA for chip analysis.
