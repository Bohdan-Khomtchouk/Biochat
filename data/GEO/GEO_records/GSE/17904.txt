TITLE
Whole genome analysis of Sertoli cell gene expression by retinoblastoma-1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the regulation of gene expression profiles by retinoblastoma-1 in Sertoli cells. Conditional knockout of Rb1 in Sertoli cells led to progressive infertiliy in male mice that occured between 10 and 14 weeks of age. Results of gene expression studies performed on 6 week-old purified Sertoli cells helped elucidate the key role of RB1 in mature, differentiated Sertoli cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from 6 week-old Sox9-GFP labeled Sertoli cells that were fluorescently sorted (FACSAriaII cell sorter, BD)
