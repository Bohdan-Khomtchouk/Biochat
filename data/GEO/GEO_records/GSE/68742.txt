TITLE
Gene expression signatures in GIST-T1 cells transfected with a miR-335 mimic molecule

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify the effect of miRNAs, we carried out a gene expression microarray analysis using GIST-T1 cells transfected with a miR-335 mimic or a negative control.  We found that 1,095 probe sets (853 unique genes) were downregulated ( > 1.5-fold) by ectopic miR-335 expression.

DESIGN
GIST-T1 cells were transfected with a mirVana miR-335 mimic  (Ambion) or a mirVana miRNA mimic Negative Control #1 (Ambion). Forty-eight hours after transfection, total RNA extraction was carried out, and gene expression signatures were analyzed.
