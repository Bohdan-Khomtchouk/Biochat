TITLE
Expression data from hESCs expressing RB7LP or T121

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray analysis to study the expression differences between controls and hESCs expressing RB7LP for 3 days, and controls and hESCs expressing T121 for 3 days. RB7LP is the large pocket fragment of the retinoblastoma protein (RB) fused to GFP, in which seven phosphorylation sites for Cdk have been mutated (Angus, SP et al. Mol Cell Biol 23, 8172 (Nov, 2003). T121 is a truncated form of the SV40 Large T (LT) viral oncoprotein that inactivates the function of the three members of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein family (RB, p107, p130).

DESIGN
We plated hESCs that had been infected with inducible lentiviruses to express either RB7LP or T121. The day after plating, one well from each virus was treated with doxycyline to induce expression of either RB7LP or T121 and after 3 days were harvested for microrarray analysis.
