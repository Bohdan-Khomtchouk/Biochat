TITLE
Addiction of t(8;21) and inv(16) AML to native RUNX1 [ChIP-Seq data]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cancer cells maintain a sensitive balance between growth-promoting oncogenes and apoptosis inhibitors. We show that WT RUNX1 is required for survival of t(8;21)-Kasumi-1 and inv(16)-ME-1 AML cell lines. The malignant AML phenotype is sustained by a delicate AML1-ETO/RUNX1 balance that involves competition for common DNA binding sites regulating a subset of AML1-ETO/RUNX1 targets.

DESIGN
Genomewide sequencing data is included herein: Transcription factors RUNX1  c-terminus and n-terminus which is shared with AML1-ETO were profiled independently), AML1-ETO and AP4 were profiled using ChIP-Seq in Kasumi-1 cells, as well as control ChIP-Seq experiments of non immune serum. Two replicates were performed for each transcription factor profiling and control experiment.
