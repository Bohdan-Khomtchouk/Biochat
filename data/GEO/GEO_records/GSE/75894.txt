TITLE
Modulation of tissue repair by regeneration enhancer elements.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We compared transcriptional and chromatin profiles of regenerating zebrafish hearts following genetic ablation with profiles from uninjured zebrafish hearts.

DESIGN
Examination of whole heart transcriptional profiles from ablated hearts (2 pools of 10 hearts) and uninjured hearts (2 pools of 10 hearts). Examination of differential H3K27Ac marks following genetic ablation of cardiomyocytes (regenerating hearts) and uninjured hearts.

PLATFORM
