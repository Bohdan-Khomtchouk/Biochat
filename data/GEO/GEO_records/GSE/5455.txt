TITLE
Gene expression profiling of CD11b purified from mouse spleen (tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Active suppression of tumor-specific T lymphocytes can limit the immune-surveillance and immunotherapy efficacy. While tumor-recruited CD11b+ myeloid cells are known mediators of tumor-associated immune dysfunction, the true nature of these suppressive cells and the fine biochemical pathways governing their immunosuppressive activity remain elusive. Here we describe a population of circulating CD11b+/IL-4Rα+, inflammatory-type monocytes that is elicited by growing tumors and activated by IFN-γ released from T lymphocytes. CD11b+/IL-4Rα+ cells produce IL-13 and IFN-γ and integrate the downstream signals of these cytokines to trigger the molecular pathways suppressing antigen-activated CD8+ T lymphocytes. Analogous immunosuppressive circuits are active in CD11b+ cells present within the tumor microenvironment. These suppressor cells challenge the current idea that tumor-conditioned immunosuppressive monocytes/macrophages are alternatively activated. Moreover, our data show how the inflammatory response elicited by tumors has detrimental effects on the adaptive immune system and suggest novel approaches for the treatment of tumorinduced immune dysfunctions. Keywords: Analysis of Cd11b cells from tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice

DESIGN
Labeled cRNA extracted from a a total of 9 samples was hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip MG-U74Av2 which contains 12,488 probe sets . The 3 control samples represented 3 replicates of RNA extracted from Cd11b cells purified from the spleen of tumor-free mice. The 6 samples obtained from tumor-bearing mice represented 3 replicates each of RNA extracted from Cd11b cells purified from the spleen of tumor-bearing mice. Three out of six samples were incubated for 24 hours in complete medium.
