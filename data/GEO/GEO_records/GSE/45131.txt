TITLE
Enterococcus faecalis reconfigure the activation of its transcriptional regulatory networks under different copper exposure levels

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF

SUMMARY
The microarrays experiments was performed with the purpose of identify transcriptional networks activated by copper. This experiment correspond the work tituled Enterococcus faecalis reconfigure the activation of its transcriptional regulatory networks under different copper exposure levels (work in preparation).Mauricio Latorrea,b, Jessica Galloway-Peñac,d,e, Jung Hyeo Rhoc,d, Marko Budinichf,  Barbara E.

DESIGN
A eight chip study (two technical replicates) using total RNA recovered from four separate cultures of: Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF (N medium growth),  Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF copΔ mutant strain (N medium growth), Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF copΔ mutant low copper treatment (N medium growth + 0.05 mM CuSO4) and Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF copΔ mutant low copper treatment (N medium growth + 0.5 mM CuSO4). Each chip measures the expression level of 3,114 genome genes from Enterococcus faecalis strain V583 (A7980-00-01).
