TITLE
Expression data of epithelial brushing from Unbiased BIOmarkers in Prediction of REspiratory Disease outcomes (U-BIOPRED) Project

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Asthma is a heterogeneous disease requiring understandings at molecular level that characterizes subgroups of patients with specific biomarkers to facilitate the development of targeted thearpies. We used Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 PM only arrays to explore the gene expression profile from epithelial brushing of 99 moderate/severe asthmatic patients.

DESIGN
A cross-sectional study of 99 participants with moderate-to-severe asthma from the U-BIOPRED underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy for epithelial brushing contributors: U-BIOPRED Consortium Project Team members
