TITLE
Expression data from the human whole blood samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray expression profiling approach was used to identify age-related mRNA markers. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from whole venous blood samples collected from ERF (Erasmus Rucphen Family study) donors of different age. Two age groups - young (~25 y.o.) and old (~ 60 y.o.) were analyzed using Partek GS software.

DESIGN
A total of 47 samples, representing two age categories were compared to each other (young vs old).

PLATFORM
GPL5175 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
