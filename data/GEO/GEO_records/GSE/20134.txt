TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of time course in response to HY-PDT on human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE-2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of photodynamic therapy with hypericin of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells CNE-2 in different time-points at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that HY-PDT could induce apoptosis on CNE-2 cells via intrinsic pathways. Results provide important information of the response of apoptosis, such as specific oxidative stress genes, mitochondrial related genes, cell cycle related genes, etc.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from the cultured cells treatment with 20 μg/ml HY and irradiation then cultured in dark for 0, 2, 6, 12, 20 h respectively compared to cells treatment with 20 μg/ml HY only then cultured in dark for 20 h.
