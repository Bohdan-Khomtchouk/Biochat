TITLE
Uromodulin-retention in thick ascending limb affects SCD1 in neighboring S3 proximal tubule in males: transcriptome studies in mouse models of Uromodulin-associated kidney disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Uromodulin-associated kidney disease (UAKD) summarizes different clinical features of an autosomal dominant heritable disease syndrome in humans with a proven uromodulin (UMOD) mutation involved. It is often characterized by hyperuricemia, gout, alteration of urine concentrating ability, as well as a variable rate of disease progression inconstantly leading to renal failure and histological alterations of the kidneys. We recently established the two Umod mutant mouse lines UmodC93F and UmodA227T on the C3H inbred genetic background both showing kidney defects analogous to those found in human UAKD patients. The aim of this study was the further analysis of the phenotypic alterations by examining the kidneys as primarily affected organs. Transcriptome and quantitative PCR analyses as well as IHC analyses found significant changes related to the phenotyping changes.

DESIGN
4 male mice of each mutant cohort (Umod C93F & Umod A227T) and the corresponding wildtype controls, each mutant mouse was compared to the mean of the corresponding wildtype including a technical replicate (dye swap)

PLATFORM
GPL4937 GSF/IEG mouse 21K array (+RZPD)
