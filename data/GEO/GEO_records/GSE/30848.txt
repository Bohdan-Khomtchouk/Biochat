TITLE
Muscle wasting and the temporal gene expresion pattern in a novel rat ICU model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Acute quadriplegic myopathy (AQM) or critical illness myopathy (CIM) is frequently observed in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. In order to elucidate duration-dependent effects of the ICU intervention on molecular and functional networks that control the muscle wasting and weakness in AQM, gene expression profile was analyzed at time points varying from 6 hours to 14 days in a unique experimental rat model mimicking ICU conditions, i.e., post-synaptically paralyzed, mechanically ventilated and extensively monitored animals.

DESIGN
A total of five sham operated controls and 23 experimental female Sprague-Dawley rats were included in this study. The experimental rats were anaesthetized, treated with the neuromuscular blocker (NMBA), α-cobrotoxin, mechanically ventilated and monitored for durations varying from 6h to 4 days (n=13), from 5 to 9 days (n=4), and from 9 to 14 days (n=6). Muscle biopsies were obtained from gastrocnemius muscle (proximal part) immediately after euthanasia and were quickly frozen in liquid propane cooled by liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C.RNA was extracted.
