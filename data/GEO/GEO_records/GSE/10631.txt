TITLE
Molecular profiling of LGL leukemia reveals role of sphingolipid signaling of cytotoxic lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to expression profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from LGL leukemia patients and control subjects to identify survival pathways that render leukemic LGL resistant to activation induced cell death. Keywords: granular lymphocyte leukemia, PBMC
