TITLE
Gene expression profiling and secretome analysis differentiate Adult-Derived Human Liver Stem/progenitor Cells and human hepatic stellate cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adult-derived human liver stem/progenitor cells (ADHLSC) are obtained after primary culture of the liver parenchymal fraction. The cells are of fibroblastic morphology and exhibit a hepato-mesenchymal phenotype. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) derived from the liver non-parenchymal fraction present a comparable morphology as ADHLSC. Because both ADHLSC and HSC are described as liver stem/progenitor cells, we strived to extensively compare both cell populations at different levels and to propose tools demonstrating their singularity.

DESIGN
The database include full expression (HGU-219)  measurements samples from 7 Adult-Derived Human Liver Stem/progenitor (n=7) and  human hepatic stellate samples (n=7)
