TITLE
Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of primary urothelial cells at early passage 2 and late passage 8

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In vitro propagated urothelial cell could be ideal material in regenerative medicine.  The fine characterization of the laboratory produced cells before transplantation is important. Here we aimed to characterize changes in gene expression and cell proliferation in urothelial cells expanded in vitro. Gene expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2 microarrays. We identified distinct classes of down- and up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Human primary urothelial cells were isolated from bladder washes,  and propadated in vitro for several passages. RNA was collected from cells at early passage 2 and late passage 8.  In total samples from 3 different donors were analyzed using the Afimetrix, human Genome U133 set (HG-U133) plus 2.
