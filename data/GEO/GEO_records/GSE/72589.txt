TITLE
Transcriptome-wide Quantitative Analysis of XLPDR-derived human dermal fibroblasts with POLA1 deficiency

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to analyzed transcriptome changes caused by POLA1 deficiency. Our data represents the first detailed analysis of molecular basis of XLPDR syndrome. We report than POLA1 deficiency leads to over-activation of IRF and NF-kB pathways with overexpression of typical markers of autoimmune syndromes.

DESIGN
Wild type and XLPDR-derived dermal fibroblasts are analyzed under non-stimulated (basal) conditions, after TNF treatment (2 and 12 h, 1000 U/mL), and poly(dA:dT) stimulation (16h, 1 mkg/mL). Obtained data were confirmed using the cellular model of XLPDR - normal dermal fibroblasts pretreated with control or anti-POLA1 siRNA and stimulated in analogous way.
