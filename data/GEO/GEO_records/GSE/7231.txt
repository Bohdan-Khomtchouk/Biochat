TITLE
Ribosomal protein S3: a functional component of NF-kB p65 binding complexes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the effects on the NF-kB transcriptome after knockdown of RPS3 in stimulated T cells, we performed microarray assays comparing RPS3-silenced versus NS-treated samples on the same chip. p65-silenced versus NS-treated samples were used as a control. Keywords: time series design

DESIGN
Jurkat cells transfected with control siRNA versus RPS3 or p65-siRNA were stimuated with TCR for 1, 3, or 6 hours for a total of 6 arrays.
