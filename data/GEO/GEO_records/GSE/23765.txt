TITLE
Detection of de novo and homozygous copy number variants in 99 autism simplex trios

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of whole genome exome array CGH to a commercial SNP array for detection of de novo and homozygous copy number variants in 99 autism simplex trios. Will update once manuscript is prepared.

DESIGN
Agilent custom designed array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was performed on 100 samples with a diagnosis of autism. Unaffected parents of the 100 probands were also tested.  A common male reference was used for all samples and parents.  Samples  were obtained from the Simons Simplex Collection. Three samples (11154_P1, 11154_Mo, 11154_Fa) were removed from the final analysis for quality control.
