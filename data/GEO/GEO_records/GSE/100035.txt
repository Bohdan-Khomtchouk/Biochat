TITLE
Sex differences in peripheral not central immune responses to pain-inducing injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Women suffer chronic pain more frequently than men. It is not clear whether this is due to differences in higher level cognitive processes or basic nociceptive responses. This study used a mouse model to dissociate these factors and found no differences in peripheral afferent neurons or in the spinal cord immune response to neuropathic injury. However, it did identify potential sexual dimorphisms in peripheral adaptive immune responses.
