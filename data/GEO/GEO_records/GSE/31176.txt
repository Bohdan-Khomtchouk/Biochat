TITLE
Expression data from yeast (wild type, rlm1 and swi3 mutants) exposed to Congo Red

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We did transcription profiling on the effect of rlm1 (MAPK Slt2 transcription factor) deletion and swi3 (component of SWI/SNF complex involved in chromatin remodeling) deletion in genes involved in cell wall stress (Congo Red) response.
