Cell Specific Expression & Pathway Analyses Reveal Novel Alterations in Trauma-Related Human T-Cell & Monocyte Pathways

SUMMARY
Monitoring genome-wide, cell-specific responses to human disease, although challenging, holds great promise for medicineâ€™s future.  Patients with injury severe enough to develop multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) are known to have multiple immune derangements, including T-cell apoptosis and anergy combined with depressed monocyte antigen presentation.  Genome-wide expression analysis of highly-enriched circulating leukocyte subpopulations, combined with cell-specific pathway analyses, offers a previously unavailable opportunity to discover novel leukocyte regulatory networks in critically injured patients.  Severe injury induced significant changes in the T-cell, monocyte, and total leukocyte transcriptome, with only 12% of these genomic changes common to all three cell populations.  T-cell-specific pathway analyses identified increased gene expression of several novel inhibitory receptors (PD-1, CD152, NRP-1, Lag3), and concomitant decreases in stimulatory receptors  (CD28, CD4, IL-2Ralpha).  Functional analysis of T-cells and monocytes confirmed reduced T-cell proliferation and increased cell surface expression of negative signaling receptors paired with decreased monocyte costimulation ligands. Thus, genome-wide expression from highly-enriched cell populations combined with knowledge-based pathway analyses leads to the identification of novel regulatory networks differentially expressed in injured patients.  Importantly, application of cell separation, genome-wide expression, and cell specific pathway analyses can be used to discover novel pathway alterations in human disease. Keywords: Gene expression profiling of circulating total blood leukocytes, T-Cells, and Monocytes in severe trauma patients and healthy subjects.

DESIGN
Type of experiment: Gene expression profiling of circulating total blood leukocytes, T-Cells, and Monocytes in severe trauma patients and healthy subjects. Experimental factors: Healthy subjects, 7 severely traumatized patients and 7 healthy subjects for transcriptome analysis. Venous blood samples were collected. Total blood leukocytes were isolated, and T-cell and monocyte populations were obtained from two subsequent aliquots of the leukocytes. Total leukocytes, enriched T-cells, and enriched monocytes were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. Number of hybridizations: 42 Human U133A GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix)
