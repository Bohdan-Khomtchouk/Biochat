TITLE
Integration of genomic and proteomic data to identify candidate genes in HT-29 cells after incubation with Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identify candidate different expression genes in HT-29 cells after incubation with Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521.  The results of microarray provide importment information for different genes expression in HT-29 cell after incubation withBifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521, up or down-regulated.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from HT-29 cell which incubation with Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521 compared to unincubation.
