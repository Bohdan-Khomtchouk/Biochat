TITLE
Microarray assay of the genetic response of Picea abies to Heterobasidion annosum infection - Loop1

ORGANISM
Picea abies

SUMMARY
The hypothesis of the experiment is that infected trees of high resistance express a wider variety of resistance genes than infected trees of low resistance, and that the level of expression of these resistance genes differs between infected and healthy branches. Also, some genes highly expressed in the infected state not expressed in the healthy state may be in response to the wounding rather than the actual infection. By comparing these expressions to that of wounded, uninfected branches, this could also be clarified. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Three different Picea abies clones, of increasing resistance to fungal attack, have been infected. For all clones, three rametes have been infected with Heterobasidion of 1 month, by means of cutting the cambium and inoculating a piece of fungus growing in agar in the wound. For the low and medium resistant clone, a fourth ramete has been cut and inoculated with agar not containing any fungal material.
