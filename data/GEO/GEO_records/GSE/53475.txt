TITLE
Ethylene and jasmonic acid act as negative modulators during mutualistic symbiosis between Laccaria bicolor and Populus roots

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides ; Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
The Poplar transcriptome was analyzed in mycorrhizal root tips in contact with Laccaria bicolor for 2 weeks. During mycorrhization the roots were treated with either 250µm ACC, 10nM JA or 500µM SA and compared to untreated mycorrhiza or control roots without contact to L. bicolor. In addition the poplar mutants 35S::PttACO1 and 35S::Atetr1 were used

DESIGN
We performed 27 hybridizations (NimbleGen) with samples derived from Populus tremula x Populus alba clone 717-1B4 control roots, untreated mycorrhiza, SA-treated mycorrhiza, ACC-treated mycorrhiza and JA-treated mycorrhiza (3 biological replicates each) as well as Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides T89 control roots, mycorrhiza, 35S::PttACO1 mycorrhiza and 35S::Atetr1-1 mycorrhiza (3 biological replicates). All samples were labeled with Cy3.
