TITLE
Epigenetic and molecular signatures of cord blood CD34(+) cells treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of primary cord blood hematopoietic stem cell (day 0, CD34+ cells), enriched control  (untreated), Scriptaid and Valproic acid expanded CD34+ cells after a week in culture. Cord blood CD34+ cells were processed individually and equal number of  PC and reisolated CD34+ cells from 3-4 samples were pooled after expansion to avoid sample variations.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of primary  human cord blood  CD34+ cells (day0), primary cells (PC)  expanded in the presence or absence of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) in serum containing cultures supplemented with a combination of cytokines (SCF, FLT3, IL3 and TPO) for 7 days.
