Human ILC2 cells stimulated with IL-25, IL-33, or TSLP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ILC2 cells are a newly described cell type whose biology and contribution to disease are poorly understood. ILC2 cells are activated by allergens, viral infection, and/or epithelial damage via IL-33 and IL-25. ILC2 cells require IL-2, IL-7, IL-25 and IL-33 for their survival and expansion. In mice, ILC2s produce multiple mediators primarily associated with type 2 inflammation (IL-13, IL-5, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, GM-CSF, amphiregulin). ILC2 cells may contribute to the pathology of asthma through multiple mediators that include IL-13-independent pathways. Our goal is to compare transcriptional profiles of IL-33- or IL-25-activated ILC2 cells from blood to characterize these cells and to identify marker(s) that can be utilized to detect them in human tissue.

DESIGN
ILC2 cells (Lineage negative, CRTH2+, CD161+, CD127+) were purified from human blood of 5 different donors by flow cytometry. The ILC2 yield ranged from 20,000 to 165,000 cells per donor (0.001-0.008% WBC). Purified ILC2s were expanded in vitro in the presence of IL-2, IL-7, IL-33 and IL-25 (each at 50 ng/ml) for 7-10 days. Expanded cells maintained the ILC2 phenotype (Lineage negative, CRTH2+, CD161+, CD127+). The cells were rested for 2 days in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-2 and IL-7 and then treated in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-2 and IL-7 with either media control, IL-25 (50 ng/ml), IL-33 (50 ng/ml), and/or TSLP (50 ng/ml) in combination, for 6 or 24 hours. Whole RNA was isolated via the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Stratagene Universal Human Reference RNA was used as the reference.
