TITLE
Expression profiles of human primary keratinocytes differentiated with TPA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human primary keratinocytes were left untreated or treated for 48 hr with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and expression profiles were compared to find long ncRNAs expressed and differentially regulated upon differentiation.
