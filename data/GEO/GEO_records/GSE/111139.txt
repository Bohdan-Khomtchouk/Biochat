TITLE
Expression data from mir-429 transfected HEY cells in a time-point series (0hr-HEY, 24hrs, 48hrs and 144hrs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HEY cells display a mesenchymal phenotype (elongated). After a 48hr transfection with mir-429 their phenotype changes to an epithelial-like (cuboidal)

DESIGN
We transfected HEY cells with mir-429 or negative control miRNA and analyzed global changes at the mRNA level in a time-course experiment (HEY-0hrs, 24hrs, 48hrs and 144hrs)
