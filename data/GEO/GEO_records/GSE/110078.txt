TITLE
Distinct gene expression profile between ARID1Ahigh and good prognosis and ARID1Alow and poor prognosis groups

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cancer tissue specimens from ARID1Ahigh and good prognosis and ARID1Alow and poor prognosis of patients with advanced gastric cancer were extracted and analyzed.

DESIGN
We first immunohistochemically evaluated the ARID1A protein expression in advanced gastric cancer. We scored ARID1A immunoreactivity based on the sum of the percentage score in invasive cancer cells (on a scale of 0 to 5) and the intensity score (on a scale of 0 to 3), for a possible total score of 0 to 8. mRNAs extracted from two specimens, Low ARID1A expression, less that total score 2, with poor prognosis and two patients with ARID1Ahigh and good prognosis was analyzed.
