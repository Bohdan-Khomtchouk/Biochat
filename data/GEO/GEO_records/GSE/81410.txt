TITLE
Expression of protein-coding genes and lncRNAs in brain and other human tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray expression profiling to assess protein-coding and non-coding gene expression across 8 brain samples and 7 other human tissues.

DESIGN
We measured commercial human cDNA samples from 15 tissues: cerebellum, brain stem, frontal cortex, occipital cortex, parietal cortex, fetal brain, whole adult brain, colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung, breast and adrenal gland

PLATFORM
GPL20604 Agilent-041648 LincRNA 60K Microarray PVD version 2 (probe name version)
