TITLE
Gene expression analysis in 13 patients with mitochondrial ATP synthase deficiency (MitoArray)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Defects of mitochondrial functions lead in humans to vast array of usually multisystemic pathologies and several hundreds of diseases resulting from various defects of mitochondria biogenesis and maintenance, defects of respiratory chain complexes (OXPHOS) or defects of individual mitochondrial proteins are known. To strengthen diagnostic work-up for various mitopathies we designed focused oligonucleotide microarray which allows expression profiling of 1632 human mitochondria related genes and tested its performance in analysis of genetically heterogeneous group of 13 patients with biochemically proven ATP synthase deficiency. Gene expression data analysis allowed classification of patients into several distinct groups, provided information on subgroup and patient specific gene expression profiles, defined candidate disease causing genes and gave basic information on pathogenic mechanisms associated with ATP synthase deficiency. Keywords: ATP synthase, mitochondrial biogenesis, ROS, gene expression, microarray, human

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, patients vs. controls cells. Biological replicates: 9 control, 13 patients, independently grown and harvested. Two replicates per array.
