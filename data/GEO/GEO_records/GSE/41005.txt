TITLE
HSF1 mediated Gene regulation in T cells at normal (37C) and febrile (40C) temperatures

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HSF1 is a major transcriptional regulator of heat shock responses. Many cells activate HSF1 in response to heat shock temperatures ( > 42oC) and other cellular stress causing agents. Unlike other cell types, T cells activate HSF1 in response to T cell activation or when exposed to febrile (40oC) temperatures, suggesting a role for HSF1 beyond the heat-shock response. We used microarray analysis and HSF1 knock-out mice to study the HSF1 mediated gene regulation in activated T cells under normal and fever temperatures.

DESIGN
T cells were purifed from spleen and lymphnodes using miltenyi anti-CD3 magnetic beads and were activated for 5 hr with plate bound anti-CD3 at  normal (37oC) and febrile( 40oC) temperatures in triplicate cultures. Total RNA from triplicate cultures were extracted, pooled and processed for hybridization on to whole mouse genome 430 2.0 affymetrix microarray chips.
