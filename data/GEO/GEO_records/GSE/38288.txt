TITLE
The effects of progesterone on the fathead minnow testis

ORGANISM
Pimephales promelas

SUMMARY
The objectives of the study were to determine the effects of progesterone in the male testis. Reproductive fathead minnows were used in the study. Testis at stage 2 and 3 were dissected and testis explants were treated progesterone or no progesterone (10^-6M and 10^-8M) for 12 hours. Androgens were measured and there was a significant increase in testosterone, but not 11-tetotetosterone. Gene expression analysis was performed in the testis which genes were differentially regulated by progesterone.

DESIGN
testis explants were treated with 10^-6M progesterone for 12 hours; 6 control and 4 treatment samples
