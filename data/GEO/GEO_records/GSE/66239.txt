TITLE
MicroRNA and gene expression changes in human cerebral aneurysms [expression array]

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Cerebral Aneurysm tissues and superficial temporal arteries were compared through RNA-Seq to identify differentially expressed genes, and through microRNA microarray to identify differentially expressed microRNAs. Significant miR:gene pairs were identified for potential microRNA silencing regualtory effects.
