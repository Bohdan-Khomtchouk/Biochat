TITLE
Expression data from early and late born Atoh1 lineages within the E14.5 rhombomere 1 and isthmus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Following neural tube closure at around E9.5, the rhombic lip within the rhombomere 1/isthmus region ( " upper rhombic lip " ) produces a sequence of neuronal lineages that populate the brainstem and cerebellum. The transcription factor Atoh1 (Math1) is required for this specialized neurogenesis, although the genetic programs that delineate the temporal cell fate changes downstream of Atoh1 are not well characterized. We examined the gene expresion changes that take place within Atoh1 lineages

DESIGN
We purified early (E10.5) and late (E13.5) born Atoh1 expressing cells from E14.5 embryos using a transgenic labeling strategy, and analyzed differences in gene expression across the two populations using the microarray data shown below.
