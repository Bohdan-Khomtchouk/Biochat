TITLE
Expression data in whole Arabidopsis seedlings after treatment with Rhizoctonia solani AG8 and AG2-1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Rhizoctonia solani is an economically important soil-borne necrotrophic fungal pathogen, with a broad host range and for which little effective resistance exists in crop plants.  Arabidopsis is resistant to the R. solani AG8 isolate but susceptible to R. solani AG2-1.  Affymetrix microarray analysis was performed to determine genes that are affected in common and specifically by AG8 and AG2-1.

DESIGN
3 biological samples were taken from 3 treatments: non-infected control, R. solani AG8 infection and R. solani AG2-1 infection.
