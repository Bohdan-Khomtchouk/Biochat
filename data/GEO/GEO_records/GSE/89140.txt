TITLE
RBM25 is a global splicing factor promoting inclusion of alternatively spliced exons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine the role of RBM25 in pre-mRNA splicing and examine whether lysine 77 contributes to this function.

DESIGN
We examined mRNA transcript level and splicing events in 293T cells in two experiments. First is CRISPR/Cas9 depletion of RBM25 vs control sgRNA. Second is over-expression of GFP, RBM25 or RBM25 K77R mutant.
