TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling reveals putative target genes of the mating type loci (MAT1-1 and MAT1-2)  in Fusarium graminearum during sexual devleopment

ORGANISM
Fusarium graminearum

SUMMARY
Using a 3â€²-tiling microarray covering the whole F. graminearum genome, we carried out genome-wide expression analyses of F. graminearum strains deleted for MAT1-1 or MAT1-2 locus, or overexpression the MAT1-2-1 gene during the sexual devleopment Our study is the first report which elucidated the putative target genes of the mating type genes in Fusarium graminearum during sexual development

DESIGN
A total of 12 chips were used for microarray. At 48 h after the removal of aerial mycelia grown on carrot agar for 7 days, total RNAs were extracted from the F. graminearum wild-type strain Z3643 and the F. graminearum strains deleted for MAT loci or overexpressin MAT1-2-1 with two or three biological replicates.

PLATFORM
