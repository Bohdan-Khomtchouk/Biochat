TITLE
Differential Gene Expression in Daphnia magna Suggests Distinct Modes of Action and Bioavailability for ZnO nanoparticles and Zn ions

ORGANISM
Daphnia magna

SUMMARY
Zinc Oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are being rapidly developed for use in consumer products, wastewater treatment and chemotherapy providing several possible routes for ZnO NP exposure to humans and aquatic organisms.  Recent studies have shown that ZnO NPs undergo rapid dissolution to Zn+2, but the relative contribution of Zn+2 to ZnO NP bioavailability and toxicity is not clear.  Gene expression profiling of D.  magna exposed to ZnO NPs or ZnSO4 at equitoxic concentrations demonstrated that the particles cause toxicity through a distinct mechanism compared with Zn+2.  D. magna were also exposed to a SiO NPs as a particle control at equimolar concentrations.  The SiO NPs resulted in few differentially expressed genes and there was very little overlap between the genes affected by the ZnO NPs and the SiO NPs, suggesting that ZnO NPs cause a distinct pattern of differentially expressed genes. In the ZnO NP exposures, effects were observed to genes involved in cytoskeletal transport, cellular respiration and reproduction.  Three biomarker genes including a multi-cystatin, ferritin and a C1q containing gene were confirmed as differentially expressed in a specific pattern by ZnO NP and provide a suite of biomarkers for identifying environmental exposure to ZnO NP and differentiating between NP and ionic exposure.

DESIGN
We exposed Daphnia magna to the 1/10 LC50 and LC25 of ZnO nanoparticles and Zn++ as ZnSO4 for 24-h.  For each exposure condition, we performed 3 exposures and 2 technical replicates (as dye swap) for each exposure (6 microarrays total).  All exposures were compared to a unexposed laboratory control
