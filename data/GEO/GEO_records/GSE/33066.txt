TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of primary adult human skin cells that express stage-specific embryonic antigen 3 (SSEA-3)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary human skin cells were gated based on expression of stage-specific embryonic antigen 3 (SSEA3) with the high SSEA3 expressing cells (top 10%, categorized as SSEA3-positive or SSEA3-high) and negative SSEA3 expressing cells (bottom 10%, categorized as SSEA3-negative) purified into two different subpopulations.  Sorted cells were allowed to adhere overnight under DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS culture conditions before total RNA was collected and global transcriptional analysis was performed.

DESIGN
We isolated primary adult human skin cells with either high SSEA3 expression or negative SSEA3 expression via FACS and analyzed via Affymetrix microarray analysis.
