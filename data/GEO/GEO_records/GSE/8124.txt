TITLE
Gene expression profiles of 25 normal human tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microarray experiments to identify genes specifically expressed in human tissues and investigated association of recombination rates with the tissue-specific genes. Keywords: Human tissue comparison

DESIGN
Microarray was used to produce a transcriptional profile of normal human tissues representing 25 distinct tissue types. A reference sample (universal tissue mix) was prepared by mixing an equal amount of aRNA from each tissue. All samples used pooled RNA from at least 3 people.  Two independent replicates were obtained using dye-swap. Normalization was performed with LOWESS method.
