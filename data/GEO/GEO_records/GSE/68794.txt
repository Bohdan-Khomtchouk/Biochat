TITLE
A large germline alteration affecting MAX and FUT8, causing familial bilateral malignant pheochromocytoma and renal oncocytoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Familial pheochromocytoma (PCC) has been associated with germline mutations in 14 genes. Here we investigated three siblings, who presented with (metastatic) bilateral pheochromocytomas, renal oncocytoma, and erythrocytosis. By SNP-array on one patientâ€™s germline DNA a large complex genomic alteration was identified  encompassing the intragenic and promoter regions of Myc-Associated Factor X (MAX) and alpha-(1,6)-fucosyltransferase (FUT8). The alteration was confirmed in all patients, as well as loss of the wild type MAX and FUT8 alleles and corresponding loss of protein expression. Uniparental disomy of chromosome 14q, previously demonstrated as a hallmark for MAX-related PCC, was also shown in the index patient by SNP-array. Our results indicate that large genomic deletions of MAX should be considered in familial and bilateral PCC with prior negative testing for gene mutations. In addition, MAX appears to be a new tumor suppressor gene for renal oncocytomas.

DESIGN
SNP array was performed for 2 samples: 1 tumor DNA sample and 1 corresponding germline DNA sample
