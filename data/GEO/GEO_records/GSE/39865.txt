TITLE
The gene expression analysis of the spinal cord of SBMA (Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy) model mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the gene expression changes that are specific to SBMA, we prepared total mRNA samples from the spinal cords of transgenic mice carrying a full-length human AR with 97 CAGs (AR-97Q), transgenic mice bearing a wild-type allele of AR with 24 CAGs (AR-24Q), and the wild-type littermates of the AR-97Q mice (C57BL/6). We used AR-97Q (Line #7-8) male mice because they show progressive muscular atrophy and weakness as well as SBMA-like pathology such as the accumulation of the pathogenic androgen receptor in the nucleus of motor neurons. Using microarray analysis, we identified the genes with significantly altered expression among the three types of mice.

DESIGN
For each group, we examined the male mice at 7-9, 10-12, and 13-15 weeks of age. These stages were chosen because the AR-97Q mice are generally asymptomatic at 7-9 weeks of age (before-onset stage), present with mild motor impairment at 10-12 weeks (early stage), and are severely weakened with profound muscle atrophy at 13-15 weeks (advanced stage). RNA from the total spinal cord, excluding the dorsal root ganglia, was isolated from three mice of each genotype at each stage. For wild-type, pooled sample for three mice were used in each stage.
