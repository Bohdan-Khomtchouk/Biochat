TITLE
Expression data from TGRL lipolysis products treated normal human astrocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lipotoxicity is a metabolic disorder that results from accumulation of lipids, particularly fatty acids, in non-adipose tissue leading to cellular dysfunction, lipid droplet formation, activate the ATF3 stress pathway, induce secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and increase APP. Our observations are consistent with neurovascular lipotoxicity that could play a role in cognitive decline with aging. We used microarrays to determine the TGRL lipolysis products induced gene expression and to understand the mechanism underline the vascular inflammation.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from normal human astrocytes cells treated with media (M), Lipoprotein lipase (L), triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TGRL or T), or  TGRL lipolysis products (TL) treatment. Affymetrix microarrays analyses of the pooled total RNA samples (n = 3 per group for Media, LpL, TGRL, and TGRL lipolysis products treatments) were performed.
