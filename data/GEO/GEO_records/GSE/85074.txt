TITLE
Side population phenotype in quiescent human/murine tissue resident memory (TRM) T cells: Role of ABC transporters and NR4A1 in TRM biology

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The ability to detect and isolate human CD8 TSP (Side population), Naïve, Effector memory (EM), Central memory (CM) cells allowed us to compare the global gene expression profiles of these cells. Human TSP cells comprise of distinct gene expression profile specifically enriched for genes overexpressed in TRM cells.

DESIGN
RNA samples from CD8 TSP (Side population), Naïve, Effector memory (EM), Central memory (CM) cells were amplified, labeled, and hybridized on the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarray chips. The data were analyzed with GeneSpring GX 12.5 (Agilent Technologies)
