TITLE
Effects of ischemia reperfusion injury or nephrectomy on mouse lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Experiments in rodents have shown that kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) facilitates lung injury and inflammation. To identify potential ischemia-specific lung molecular pathways involved, we conducted global gene expression profiling of lung 6 or 36 hours following 1) bilateral kidney IRI, 2) bilateral nephrectomy (BNx), and 3) sham laparotomy in C57BL/6J mice. Total RNA from whole lung was isolated and hybridized to 430MOEA (22,626 genes) GeneChips (n=3/group). Keywords: different time points after different treatments
