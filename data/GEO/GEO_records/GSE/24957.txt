TITLE
Mouse Interferon α, β RT² Profiler PCR

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Infection of mouse bone marrow Flts3L-derived dendritic cells (FL-DCs) with chimeric human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) results in the upregulation as well as selective downregulation of various interferon-stimulated genes.

DESIGN
Mouse bone marrow Flt3L-derived dendritic cells were infected with chimeric HTLV-1 and analyzed for the expression of type 1 interferon-stimulated genes after 4 hours. The expression of various genes was compared to the control (non-infected) cells.
