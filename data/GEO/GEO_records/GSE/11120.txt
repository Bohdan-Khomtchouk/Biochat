TITLE
Assessment of Thermotolerance in preshocked hsp70(-/-) and (+/+) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
From preliminary experiments, HSP70 deficient MEF cells display moderate thermotolerance to a severe heatshock of 45.5 degrees after a mild preshock at 43 degrees, even in the absence of hsp70 protein. We would like to determine which genes in these cells are being activated to account for this thermotolerance. Keywords: thermal stress, heat shock response, knockout, cell culture, hsp70

DESIGN
Two cell lines are analyzed - hsp70 knockout and hsp70 rescue cells. 6 microarrays from the (-/-)knockout cells are analyzed (3 Pretreated vs 3 unheated controls). For the (+/+) rescue cells, 4 microarrays are used (2 pretreated and 2 unheated controls). Cells were plated at 3k/well in a 96 well plate, covered with a gas permeable sealer and heat shocked at 43degrees for 30 minutes at the 20 hr time point. The RNA was harvested at 3hrs after heat treatment.
