TITLE
Assessment of Thermotolerance in preshocked hsp70(-/-) and (+/+) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
From preliminary experiments, HSP70 deficient MEF cells display moderate thermotolerance to a severe heatshock of 45.5 degrees after a mild preshock at 43 degrees, even in the absence of hsp70 protein. We would like to determine which genes in these cells are being activated to account for this thermotolerance. Keywords: thermal stress, heat shock response, knockout, cell culture, hsp70
