TITLE
Gene expression profiling of hepatocarcinogenesis initiation in Fischer-344 rats.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Diethylnitrosamine is used as initiator carcinogen in the modiffied resistan model but is not known its effect on gene expression profile on this stage. In other way, CAPE is compound with anticarcinogenic propertie when is administered 12 h before DEN and with the aim to characterize its effect on gene expression profile when is administered alone and in combination with diethylnitrosamine, these analysis were made. Male Fischer-344 rats were we used 4 animal per each treatment and all treatments are compared with not treated rats. Were identified groups of genes related with Carcinogens metabolism, oxidative stress and cell regulation with important differences between treatments.

DESIGN
RT-PCR, enzyme activities, wester blots, metabolism assays were performed to validate these results.
