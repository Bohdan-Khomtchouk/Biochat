TITLE
Genetic and epigenetic variation among inbred littermates: identification of metastable epialleles in the mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genomic DNA was extracted from the livers of 5 22week old male mice, bisulfite converted and sequenced to ~30x coverage. The mice were obtained from two litters from an inbred agouti viable yellow colony. The individuals were isogenic but differed in their coat phenotype with one having a yellow coat, one a psuedoagouti coat and the remaining were phenotypically C57/BL6. The resulting DNA metylation profiles were investigated for individual differences in DNA methylation, including the identificaiton of novel metastable epialleles.

DESIGN
Whole genome bisulfite sequencing of liver DNA from five inbred male mice

PLATFORM
