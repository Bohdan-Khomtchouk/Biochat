TITLE
Host plant peptides elicit a transcriptional response to control the Sinorhizobium meliloti cell cycle during symbiosis

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021

SUMMARY
We profiled gene expression in synchronized cultures of Sinorhizobium meliloti treated with or without the nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptide 247. We compared gene expression between the two conditions at 5 timepoints (15, 30, 60, 90, 120) following the addition of the peptide

DESIGN
A population of synchronized Sinorhizobium meliloti was subjected to two treatments (no treatment and treated with sublethal levels of the NCR247 peptide). A series of timepoints was taken to profile the gene expression in both populations.
