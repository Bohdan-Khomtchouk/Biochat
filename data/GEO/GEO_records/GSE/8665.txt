TITLE
The effects of chimeric EWS/ETS protein in human mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have examined the biological effect of EWS/ETS in human MPCs using UET-13 cells that are obtained by prolonging the lifespan of human bone marrow stromal cells using the retroviral transgenes hTERT and E7.  By exploiting tetracycline-inducible systems for expressing EWS/ETS (EWS/FLI1 and EWS/ERG), we investigated candidates for genes whose expression is regulated by EWS/ETS in human MPCs. Keywords: Time course
