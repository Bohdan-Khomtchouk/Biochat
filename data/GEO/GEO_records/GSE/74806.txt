TITLE
Verification of the quality of the retroviral cDNA library composed of 176 proto-oncogenes and HOX genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We constructed retroviral cDNA library of 176 proto-oncogenes and HOX genes to screen for the leukemia initiating gene combinations. The present submission is the NGS data of the PCR products of the whole inserts from the library itself and the bone marrow cells infected with retroviral library

DESIGN
The cDNA inserts were amplified from the plasmid library and also from the genomic DNA of the bone marrow cells transduced with the retroviral cDNA library. The usage of the individual cDNA was scored by the read numbers (FPKM value).
