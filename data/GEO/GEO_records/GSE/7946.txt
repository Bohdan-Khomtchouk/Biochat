TITLE
SNP array analysis of chromosomal instability patterns discriminates rectal adenomas from carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total mesorectal excision (TME) is the standard treatment for rectal cancer, while transanal  endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) is a recently introduced surgical approach for the treatment  of rectal adenomas. Incorrect preoperative staging before TEM is a problem. To identify  genetic changes that might correlate with tumour stage and could lead to optimized  treatment selection we performed a genome-wide chromosomal instability search in a  homogeneous, clinical cohort of rectal tumours. 78 rectal tumours during different clinical  stages were analysed with 10K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Logistic  regression was performed to build a quantitative model of specific chromosomal aberrations.  Overall, most cases (95%) had one or more chromosomal aberrations. We observed a  clear correlation between the total number of aberrations and the different tumour stages.  Specifically, the chromosomal events: gain of 8q22–24, 13q and 20q, and loss of 17p and  18q12–22, were far more abundant in carcinoma than in adenoma. In adenoma fractions  from cases with a carcinoma (infiltrating at least in the submucosa), twice the amount of such  ‘malignant aberrations’ was observed, compared to pure adenomas. Furthermore, combined  aberrations such as gain of 13q and loss of 18q were only found in adenomatous fractions  of carcinomas and not in benign lesions. Based on these five genomic events associated with  carcinoma, a clear distinction between adenoma and carcinoma tissue could be made. These  data should be validated further in order that they may be used in preoperative staging of  rectal tumours. Keywords: SNP array copy number and LOH study
