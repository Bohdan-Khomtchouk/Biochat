TITLE
Dietary intake influences fertility and offspring development in zebrafish.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We report that increased nutrient availability increases breeding success and egg production. RNA-seq analysis revealed that parental diet altered the expression of metabolic genes in the unfertilized eggs. Offspring from the differentially fed parents showed altered survival and energy expenditure as adults.

DESIGN
RNA from unfertilized eggs after two parental diets.
