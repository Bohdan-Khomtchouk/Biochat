TITLE
Identification of differentially-expressed genes between FoxH1 morpholino and control in zebrafish embryos.

Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The Forkhead Box H1 (FoxH1) protein is a co-transcription factor recruited by phosphorylated Smad2 downstream of several TGFbetas, including Nodal-related proteins.  We have reassessed the function of zebrafish FoxH1 using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) ( 5’ TGCTTTGTCATGCTGATGTAGTGGG  3’) as compared with a control morpholino (MO) with no specific target (5’ TAGTTAAGCCTAGCTCTCATAAACT  3’). Probing FoxH1 morphant RNA by microarray, we identified a cohort of five keratin genes – cyt1, cyt2, krt4, krt8 and krt18 - that are normally transcribed in the embryo’s enveloping layer (EVL) and which have significantly reduced expression in FoxH1-depleted embryos. Keywords: 40% epiboly-stage embryos, injected with either 8 ng of a 25mer morpholino (MO) with no specific target or 8 ng of a 25mer MO with reverse complementary to the 5’ untranslated region of the zebrafish foxH1 gene.
