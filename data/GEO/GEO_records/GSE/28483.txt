TITLE
FGF-dependent regulation of VEGF signaling via transcriptional control of VEGF receptor 2 expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Numerous studies have suggested a link between fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathways; however the nature of this link has not been established. To evaluate this relationship we investigated VEGF signaling in endothelial cells with disrupted FGF signaling in vitro and in vivo. We find that endothelial cells lacking FGF signaling become unresponsive to VEGF due to down regulation of VEGFR2 expression caused by reduced Vegfr2 enhancer activation, which is in turn caused by reduced activation of Ets family transcription factors. In vivo this manifests in the loss of vascular integrity and morphogenesis. Thus, basal FGF stimulation of the endothelium is required for maintenance of VEGFR2 expression and the ability to respond to VEGF stimulation and accounts for the hierarchic control of vascular formation by FGFs and VEGF.

DESIGN
Primary mouse lung endothelial cells were transduced with either Adeno-Null (empty) or Adeno- dominant negative FGF receptor 1 and harvested 24 hours after transduction. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to the analysis using SuperArray GEArray Q Series Mouse Angiogenesis Gene Array.  Comparisons were made between treatments.
