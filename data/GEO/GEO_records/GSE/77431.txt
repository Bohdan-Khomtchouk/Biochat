TITLE
Alterations in the hepatic gene expression in mice exposed to a maternal high fat diet in utero [Microarray]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exposure to a high fat (HF) diet in utero is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome later in life. However, the molecular basis of this enhanced susceptibility for metabolic disease is poorly understood. We used gene expression microarray to examine mRNA expression patterns in liver of offspring exposed to a Control or HF maternal diet. WT mice were fed a Control (9.5% fat, 3.59 kcal/g) or HF (35.5% fat, 5.29 kcal/g) diet for 2 wk before mating, throughout pregnancy and lactation. Offspring were weaned to a low fat (5.6% fat, 3.4 kcal/g) diet and were sacrificed at 5wks of age. Exposure to a maternal HF milieu activated genes of immune response, inflammation, and hepatic dysfunction. Conversely genes of lipid metabolism and biogenesis were down regulated especially in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. In summary, exposure to a maternal HF diet significantly alters the gene expression patterns in the liver of exposed offspring and contributes to development of metabolic disease later in life.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 6 control and 7 HF, then pooled.  First and double strand cDNA was generated using SuperScript Double-Stranded cDNA synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). Two chip study was performed.
