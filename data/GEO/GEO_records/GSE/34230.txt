TITLE
Transcription profiles of cumulus cells from GnRH agonists and GnRH antagonists treated oocytes at different maturity stages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix gene expression profiling in cumulus cells (CC) retrieved from patients undergoing GnRH agonists and GnRH antagonists IVF treatment. Oocytes from three different maturity stages were considered: metaphase I oocytes (MI), nonfertilized metaphase II (MII) oocytes (MII-NF) and MII oocytes developed to blactocyst stage embryo (MII-BL).

DESIGN
From 4 GnRH agonist treated patients, CC MI, CC MII-NF and CC MII-BL samples were collected; from 5 GnRH agonist and 6 GnRH antagonist treated patients, CC MII-NF and CC MII-BL samples were collected; and from 2 GnRH agonist and 4 GnRH antagonist treated patients, CC MI and CC MII-BL were collected. Altogether, 10 CC MI, 15 CC MII-NF and 21 CC MII-BL were collected and considered for transcriptome analysis.
