SUMMARY
Mice used were in a mixed background between 129/SvEv and C57BL/6. They were wildtype littermates of Rp1-/- mice used in parallel experiments. Triplicates of RNA samples from Rp1+/+ neural retinas for hybridization were collected at P7. Each RNA sample included a pool of neural retinas from 3-4 mice. Retinas were all collected at 1-2 pm of the day. Keywords: repeat sample
