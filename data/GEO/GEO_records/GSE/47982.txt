TITLE
Early transcriptional changes in Zea mays seedlings exposed to Z-3-hexenol

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Z-3-Hexenol and other green leaf volatiles have been known to induce defense-related gene expression. Here we investigated the early transcriptional changes in response to Z-3-hexenol.

DESIGN
3-week-old Zea mays seedling (inbred line B73) was exposed to pure Z-3-hexenol (1.5 μM) in a glass cylinder. Controls were treated likewise without the addition of Z-3-hexenol. Plants were exposed for 20 min and 60 min. The second leaf was then cut and shock-frozen in liquid N2 and then stored at -85°prior to RNA extraction. 3 individual leaves were pooled for 1 biological replicate. 3 biological replicates were performed for each treatment, with one dye swap (second sample).
