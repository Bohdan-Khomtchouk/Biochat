TITLE
p38a-dependent gene expression in the colonic mucosa

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in the colonic mucosa of wild-type and p38a-knockout intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) were compared. C57BL/6 wild-type mice, and intestinal epithelial cell-specific p38a-knockout mice on a C57BL/6 background were used for isolation of colonic mucosa

DESIGN
Gene expression in each genotype was analyzed in triplicate.
