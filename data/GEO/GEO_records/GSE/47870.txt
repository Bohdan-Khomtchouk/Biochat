TITLE
Characterization of the molecular interplay between Moraxella catarrhalis and human respiratory tract epithelial cells: Expression Moraxella catarrhalis strain BBH18 during adherence to human phanryngeal epithelial Detroit 562 cells

ORGANISM
Moraxella catarrhalis

SUMMARY
During the course of infection, respiratory pathogens like Moraxella catarrhalis needs to adhere to epithelial cells of different host niches such as the nasopharynx and lungs. Consequently, efficient adhesion to epithelial cells is considered an important virulence trait of M. catarrhalis.  We examined the interaction between human pharyngeal epithelial Detroit 562 cells and M. catarrhalis BBH18 during adherence using a combination of Tn-seq, a genome-wide negative selection screenings technology, and expression profiling of both host and pathogen. The results described in this study are further discussed in Stefan P.W. de Vries, Marc J. Eleveld, Peter W.M. Hermans, Hester J. Bootsma: Characterization of the molecular interplay between Moraxella catarrhalis and human respiratory tract epithelial cells, submitted.

DESIGN
After 1 hour adherence to Detroit 562 cells, RNA was isolated from adherent (n = 4) and non-adherent (planktonic) (n = 4) M. catarrhalis BBH18 as well as from bacteria incubated in the infection medium alone (n = 3). RNA obtained from the adherent fraction was enriched for bacterial RNA using the MICROBEnrich kit (Ambion). Total RNA was labeled according to standard Nimblegen gene expression array protocols and hybridized to a 4x72K Nimblegen M. catarrhalis expression array for read-out.
