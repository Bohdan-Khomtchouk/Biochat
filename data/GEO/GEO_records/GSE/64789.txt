TITLE
Distinct gene expression patterns of ‘multipotent' versus ‘unipotent' single colony-derived strains (SCDSs) of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an inherited multi-system disorder, characterized by oral leukoplakia, nail dystrophy, and abnormal skin pigmentation, as well as high rates of bone marrow failure, solid tumors, and other medical problems such as osteopenia.  DC and telomere biology disorders (collectively referred to as TBD here) are caused by germline mutations in telomere biology genes leading to very short telomeres and limited proliferative potential of hematopoietic stem cells.  We found that skeletal stem cells (SSCs) within the bone marrow stromal cell population (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells), may contribute to the hematological phenotype.

DESIGN
At least 5x105 cells from each SCDS were homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen) for RNA extraction. RNA was purified by using a combination of chloroform phase separation and RNeasy Mini Kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was quantified and 5ug was processed for microarray analysis (LMT, NCI, Frederick, MD). RNA was reverse transcribed to form cDNA, and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Three independent replicates for each of the experimental conditions were carried out and analyzed to control for intra-sample variation.
