TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of skin biopsies during the mucocutaneous HSV-2 reactivation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of host response at the gene expression level during the genital HSV-2 reactivation. We would like to get a comprehensive overview on host gene expression and correlate them with the infiltrated immune cell types during HSV-2 reactivation. The hypothesis is that HSV-2 may evade some aspects of host immune response during the recurrent infection.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from lesion and post healing skin biopsies as compared to contralateral control skin biopsies

PLATFORM
GPL6255 Illumina humanRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
