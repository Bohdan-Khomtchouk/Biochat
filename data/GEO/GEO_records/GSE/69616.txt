TITLE
Metabolic Regulation of Gene Expression by Histone Lysine ß-hydroxybutyrylation [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified a new type of histone mark-lysine ß-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb). This ketone body derived histone mark (Kbhb) was dramatically induced in livers during starvation. To charactize histopne Kbhb: 1) We mapped genomic distributions of histone Kbhb marks (H3K9bhb, H3K4bhb and H4K8bhb) by ChIP-seq in mouse liver. 2) We examined the response of histone Kbhb mark to starvation by carrying out ChIP-seq experiments for H3K9bhb in both " starved " and " fed " mouse liver. 3) We also examined differentially-expressed genes during starvation by carrying out RNA-seq experiments in both " starved " and " fed " mouse liver. By integrating analyses of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data, we tried to get a correlation between H3K9bhb mark and gene expression in response to starvation. Sequencing was performed on the HiSeq2000 (Illumina).

DESIGN
RNA-seq of mouse liver cells both in " starved " and " fed " conditions.
