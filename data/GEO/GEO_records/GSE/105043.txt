TITLE
IL-1R8 is a checkpoint in NK cells regulating anti-tumor and anti-viral activity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We reported that IL-1R8 serves as a checkpoint for NK cell maturation and effector functions. Its genetic blockade unleashes NK-cell mediated resistance to hepatic carcinogenesis, hematogenous liver and lung metastasis and cytomegalovirus infection.

DESIGN
RNA profile from splenic NK cells isolated by FACS sorting from wild-type and Il1r8-/- mice. NK cells were stimulated or not with murine IL-18 (20 ng/ml) for 4 hrs.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
