TITLE
Prox1 (Prosper-related homeobox  1)  transcription factor depletion effect on CGTH-W-1  cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of CGTH-W-1  follicular thyroid carcinoma cells transcriptome following  48 hrs siRNA-mediated depletion of PROX1. PROX1 is a homeobox transcription factor. PROX1  depletion decreases  migratory ability, motility and invasivness and induces profound cytoskeleton changes of CGTH-W-1  cells.  Results provide insight into the role of PROX1 in the thyroid cancer.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates for a given condition

PLATFORM
GPL17303 Ion Torrent Proton (Homo sapiens)
