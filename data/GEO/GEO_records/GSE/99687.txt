TITLE
Smad5 acts as an intracellular pH messenger and maintains bioenergetic homoeostasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we report here that Smad5 acts as a pHi messenger and maintains bioenergetic homeostasis of a cell by regulating cytoplasmic metabolic machinery

DESIGN
Reads Per Kilobase of exon per Megabase of library size (RPKM) were calculated using a protocol from Chepelev et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2009. In short, exons from all isoforms of a gene were merged to create one meta-transcript. The number of reads falling in the exons of this meta-transcript were counted and normalized by the size of the meta-transcript and by the size of the library.
