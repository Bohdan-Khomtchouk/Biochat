TITLE
Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling in proliferating human T98G cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Continuous PI 3-kinase signaling is required for cell proliferation and survival, but the gene expression program controlled by PI 3-kinase in proliferating cells has not been elucidated.  We used microarray analyses to characterize the changes in gene expression resulting from inhibition of PI 3-kinase in actively proliferating cells.  Following 2 and 4 hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition, the time around which apoptosis initiated, 32 genes were significantly up-regulated and 53 down-regulated.  After 8 hours of inhibition, the total number of expression changes increased to over 200.  The genes regulated by inhibition of PI 3-kinase in proliferating cells were distinct from genes induced by growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells and included key regulators of cell proliferation and programmed cell death. Keywords: time course
