TITLE
Gene expression analysis of prefrontal cortex in mice exposed to chronic mild stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common disorder and is responsible for considerable disability in global functioning, anorexia, and severer medical comorbidity. Recently, some reports showed the relationship between MDD and the metabolic disorders such as diabetes. We examined gene expression profiles in the mice prefrontal cortex using genome-wide microarray technology, and determined gene expression profiles with and without chronic mild stress(CMS) for 4 weeks which was often used to make models of depression. To analyze the candidate genes involved in not only depression but dysfunction of physiological homeostasis like diabetes, we campared the gene expression levels between with and without CMS, then we isolated 494 genes showing a more than 2-fold increase or a less than 1/2-fold decrease, in addition, we chose the isolated genes transcriptional products of both samples were confirmed clearly.

DESIGN
The prefrontal cortex of C57Bl/6 N sea mice with and without CMS. We mixed tatal RNA from 7 mice prefrontal cortex per each.
