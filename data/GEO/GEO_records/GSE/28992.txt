SUMMARY
Analysis of the effects of a dual specificity PI3K/mTOR inhibitor on two human ovarian cell lines, OV2008 and MCAS.  Results provide insight into the adaptive response to PI3K/mTOR inhibition in matrix attached ovarian cancer cells. The PI3K/mTOR-pathway is the most commonly deregulated pathway in epithelial cancers and thus represents an important target for cancer therapeutics. Here we show that dual inhibition of PI3K/mTOR in ovarian cancer 3D-spheroids leads to death of the inner matrix-deprived cells, whereas matrix-attached cells are resistant. Resistance is associated with up-regulation of a cellular survival program that involves both FOXO-regulated transcription and a novel translational resistance mechanism resulting in specific up-regulation of IRES-mediated, cap-independent translation. Inhibition of any of several up-regulated proteins, including Bcl-2, EGFR, or IGF1R, abrogates resistance to dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition. These results demonstrate that acute adaptive response to PI3K/mTOR inhibition resembles well-conserved adaptive response to nutrient and growth factor deprivation and how development of rational drug combinations can bypass resistance mechanisms.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated 6h and 24h after treatment with 1 Î¼M NVP-BEZ235 or DMSO vehicle control from 3D grown structures
