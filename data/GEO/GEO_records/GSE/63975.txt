TITLE
DNAse-Seq of Cultured Mouse Podocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of DNAse Hypersensitivity changes in podocytes cultured under normal or high glucose conditions transfected with a miR-93 mimic or a nontargeting mimic.

DESIGN
Examination of the changes in hypersensitivity induced by high glucose culture conditions compared to normal glucose conditions to mimic the diabetic millieu. Further, to see if miR-93 overexpression can reverse these changes.

PLATFORM
