TITLE
The effect of SPARCL1 overexpression on osteosarcoma MNNG-HOS cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the altered gene expression levels in SPARCL1 overexpressed cells and vector cells. Each group had a biological repeat (n=3). Results provide insight into the role of SPARCL1 in the progression of osteosarcoma.

DESIGN
Three SPARCL1 overexpressed MNNG-HOS cells and three vector MNNG-HOS cells were a comparative group.
