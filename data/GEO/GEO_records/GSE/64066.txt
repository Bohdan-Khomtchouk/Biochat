TITLE
Gene expression in porcine induced pluripotent stell (iPS) cell lines and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of porcine induced pluripotent cell lines and comparison with fibroblasts. Transcriptional profiling of mouse ES cell lines and comparison with fibroblasts as a control for an experiment of porcine induced pluripotent stem cells.

DESIGN
[Ss] Gene expression of two newly established porcine iPS clones was compared with a parental embryonic fibroblast cell line of the iPS clones. [Mm] Gene expression of mouse ES cells was compared with embryonic fibroblasts.
