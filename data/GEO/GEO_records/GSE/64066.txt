TITLE
Gene expression in porcine induced pluripotent stell (iPS) cell lines and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of porcine induced pluripotent cell lines and comparison with fibroblasts. Transcriptional profiling of mouse ES cell lines and comparison with fibroblasts as a control for an experiment of porcine induced pluripotent stem cells.

DESIGN
[Ss] Gene expression of two newly established porcine iPS clones was compared with a parental embryonic fibroblast cell line of the iPS clones. [Mm] Gene expression of mouse ES cells was compared with embryonic fibroblasts.
