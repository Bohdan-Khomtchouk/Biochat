TITLE
Expression profile of cuticular genes of silkworm, Bombyx mori

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
Insect cuticle plays essential roles in multiple physiological functions. During molting and metamorphosis, tremendous changes occur in silkworm cuticles. Silkworm is a model of Lepidoptera insects; however, little is known about the stage expression profiles of genes in cuticles of silkworm. In the present study, we selected 16 developmental stages, ranging from day 1 of the first instar larvae to day 8 of pupae, to perform microarray-based expression profiles. The data told us that various functions and physiological pathways were activated in the cuticle. Moreover, the expression profiles of cuticular protein genes, as the important components of cuticle, were investigated. The current study provides important insights for the functional study of insect cuticle and the regulation of insect cuticular protein genes.

DESIGN
Transcription profiling experiments, 16 developmental stages (samples) were analyzed. Dual-channel experiments, with test samples labeled by Cy5 and common reference samples labeled by Cy3. Common reference sample was used for data normalization. One biological replicate. No dye-swaps.

PLATFORM
GPL9527 Silkworm 23K oligo array version 2.0
