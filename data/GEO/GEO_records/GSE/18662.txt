TITLE
Expression data of human perirenal adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells cultured under various conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from perirenal adipose tissue (PV) of living kidney donors were cultured under various conditions, namely (1) control (medium+foetal bovine serum(FBS)) or (2) control (medium+heat-inactivated FBS); (3) with mixed-lympohocyte reactions (MLR) in transwell culture systems for 4 days; (4) with mixed-lympohocyte reactions (MLR) in transwell culture systems for 7 days; or (5)with pro-inflammatory cytokines(IFNgamma, TNFalpha and interleukin 6). We used microarrays to detail the effect of the various culture conditions on MSC.

DESIGN
MSC were cultured under control conditions (n=4 in FBS and n=3 in heat-inactivated FBS), with MLR in transwell culture systems for 4 days (n=3) and 7 days (n=4), and with pro-inflammatory cytokines(IFNgamma, TNFalpha and interleukin 6)(n=4) and collected for gene analysis
