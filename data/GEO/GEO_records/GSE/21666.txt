TITLE
Vibrio parahaemolyticus gene expression affected by 0.04% bile

ORGANISM
Vibrio parahaemolyticus

SUMMARY
Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative marine bacterium. Strain RIMD 2210633, the wild type strain of the organism, causes acute gastroenteritis in humans. Human intestinal factor bile often affects the global gene regulation in some species of enteropathogenic bacteria. To determine the genes in V. parahaemolyticus that respond to bile, we investigated the differences in the transcriptomes of the wild type strain and the vtrA-null strain grown in Luria-Bertani medium cultivated with or without 0.04% crude bile. The vtrA gene encodes the previously identified T3SS2 regulator. Our goal is to demonstrate bile regulon controlled by VtrA in V. parahaemolyticus.

DESIGN
Total RNA from WT and vtrA-null strains in response to 0.04% crude bile or no bile were analyzed. Samples grown with or without bile were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively, and cohybridized on a single array. Labeling and hybridization were performed three times independently in wild type and vtrA-null samples.
