TITLE
Pilot open label clinical trial of oral ruxolitinib in patients with alopecia areata

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This goal of these studies were to examine gene expression profiles of skin from patients with alopecia areata undergoing treatment with oral ruxoltinib. Microarray analysis was performed to assess changes in gene expression in affected scalp skin.

DESIGN
Twelve patients were recruited for this study.  Scalp skin biopsies were performed at baseline and at twelve weeks following the initiation of 20 mg BID ruxolitinib PO.  In addition, biopsies were taken prior to twelve weeks of treatment in some cases.  Biopsies from three healthy controls were also included in the dataset.
