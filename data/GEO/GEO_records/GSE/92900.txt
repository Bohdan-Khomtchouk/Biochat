TITLE
Distinct Sets Of Genes Representing Overlapping Biological Functions Are Altered By Intrinsic Properties Of Carbon Nanomaterials In Vitro And In Vivo [mouse]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Six different carbon nanomaterials (CNM) administered by oropharyngeal aspiration to C57BL/6 mice (on 4 consecutive days with 10ug of CNM per day in PBS, sacrificed on 5th day)  and to differentiated THP-1 cells in culture (6 hour and 24 hour, with 100ug of CNM /ml of medium)

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice were exposed to six different CNM by oropharyngeal aspiration (10 μg/day in 50μl of PBS) once per day for 4 consecutive days. Bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissue samples were collected, histological sections analyzed and mRNA expression profiles were determined by Agilent microarray. Vehicle treated (PBS) was used as Controls. Two mRNA samples from same group were pooled as one sample.
