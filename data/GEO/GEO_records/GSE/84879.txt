TITLE
Listeria monocytogenes J0161 shows altered resistance characteristics when grown at low temperature and under anaerobic conditions.

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen and the causative agent of listeriosis, an infection which typically arises through the consumption of contaminated foodstuffs. L. monocytogenes is a psychotrophic and facultatively anaerobic; properties which permit growth under refrigeration conditions and within modified atmosphere packaging. Through transcriptional changes L. monocytogenes is able to mount adaptive responses against stressors. Such responses typically cross protect against subsequent stresses.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were analysed in Listeria monocytogenes subjected to oxygen limitation and low temperature (7ÂºC) alone and in combination. Four independent experiments were conducted for each variation of condition.
