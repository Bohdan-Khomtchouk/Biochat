TITLE
MicroRNA profiling in Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus)

ORGANISM
Fundulus heteroclitus

SUMMARY
The Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) is an ideal model species to study physiological and toxicological adaptations to stressors. Killifish inhabiting the PCB-contaminated Superfund site in New Bedford Harbor, MA (NBH) have evolved resistance to toxicity and activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathway after exposure to PCBs and other AHR agonists. Until recently, a lack of genomic information has limited efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying environmental adaptation to stressors. The advent of high throughput sequencing has facilitated an unbiased assessment of coding as well as non-coding RNAs in any species of interest. Among non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression and play crucial roles in development and physiology. The objective of this study is to catalog the miRNAs in killifish and determine their expression patterns in the embryos from contaminated (NBH) and pristine (Scorton Creek, MA (SC)) sites. Embryos from NBH and SC were collected daily from 1 to 15 days post-fertilization and RNA from pooled samples from each site was sequenced using SOLiD sequencing. We obtained 7.5 and 11 million raw reads from pooled SC and NBH samples, respectively. Analysis of the sequencing data identified 216 conserved mature miRNA sequences that are expressed during development. Using the draft killifish genome, we retrieved the miRNA precursor sequences. Based on the capacity of these putative precursor sequences to form the characteristic hairpin loop (assessed using RNAfold), we identified 197 conserved miRNA sequences in the genome.

DESIGN
MicroRNA expression profiles from two populations of Atlantic killfish were conducted.
