TITLE
Transcriptional Responses in Livers of Adult and Newborn Mice to Aflatoxin B1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Susceptibility to the hepatocarcinogen Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) varies among species and with age.  Mice are refractory to carcinogenic and toxic effects of AFB1; however, B6C3F1 mice show transient sensitivity if dosed shortly after birth. We compared age-related differences in gene expression and transcriptional responses to AFB1 in livers of newborn (4-day-old) and adult mice. Keywords: Transcriptional response to  a carcinogen
