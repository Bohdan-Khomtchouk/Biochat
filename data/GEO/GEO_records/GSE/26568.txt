TITLE
Impact of KLF2 expression on T cell genetic program

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
On triggering of the T cell receptor CD8 T lymphocytes downregulate expression of the transcription factor KLF2.  KLF2 expression remains low as these cells differentiate to Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) but may be re-expressed depending on the local environmental signals. We used retroviral transduction to enforce KLF2 expression in CTL to determine the impact of it re-expression on the CTL genetic program.
