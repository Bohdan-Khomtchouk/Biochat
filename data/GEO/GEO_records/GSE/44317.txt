TITLE
Flutamide treated rat hepatocytes in microfluidic biochips

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of the flutamide (FLU) -induced liver injury in primary rat hepatocytes using our liver microfluidic biochips. Flutamide is used a non-steroidal anti-androgenic drug. Two flutamide concentrations, 10µM and 100µM, were used to expose the hepatocytes for 24h under perfusion.

DESIGN
Primary rat hepatocytes were cultivated in microfluidic biochips and treated with 10 and 100µM of flutamide for 24h
