TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of human malignant pleural mesothelioma tissue specimens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is difficult to distinguish from reactive mesothelial proliferations (RMPs). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA-strands (~22 nucleotides) that post-transcriptionally regulate gene-expression. Studies have shown that miRNAs are potential diagnostic markers in other cancers; however, it is uncertain whether miRNAs are useful biomarkers for differentiating MPM from RMP. OBJECTIVE: To identify differentially expressed microRNAs which can aid in the diagnostics of MPM. METHODS: We screened with a quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)-based platform the expression of 742 miRNAs in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) preoperative diagnostic biopsies, surgically resected MPM-specimens previously treated with chemotherapy, and corresponding non-neoplastic pleura (NNP) from 5 patients. RESULTS: By comparing the change in microRNA expression in patient-matched tissue samples, we identify 14 miRNAs which exhibit statistically significant deregulation between sample groups. CONCLUSION: Based on this initial screening of miRNA expression, we have identified 14 miRNAs which are potential diagnostic biomarkers and may aid in diffferentiating RMP from MPM.

DESIGN
qPCR microRNA expression profiling. MicroRNA expression in surgical tissue samples and presurgery diagnostic biopsies of malignant pleural mesotheliomas was compared to corresponding patient-matched non-neoplastic pleura. Patient-matched diagnostic biopsies from still chemotherapy-na√Øve patients were included to test for chemotherapy-induced changes in microRNA expression.
