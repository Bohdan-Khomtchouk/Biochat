TITLE
Gene expression profiling in MCF-7 cells overexpressing distal-less homeobox 2 (Dlx-2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of MCF-7 cells that transfected with Dlx-2

DESIGN
Gene expression levels were determined by comparing the gene expression of the experimental samples (transfected with Dlx-2) with that of the control sample (transfected with mock).
