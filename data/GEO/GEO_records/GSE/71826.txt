TITLE
Abnormal differentiation and activation of Pla2g2f-/- keratinocytes in primary culture

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Primary keratinocytes from Pla2g2f-/- mice were defective in proper differentiation and activation.

DESIGN
Pla2g2f+/+ and Pla2g2f-/- keratinocytes after culture for 48 h with (differentiated) or without (control) 1 mM CaCl2. Equal amounts of total RNA were pooled from keratinocytes from 6 mice for each genotype.
