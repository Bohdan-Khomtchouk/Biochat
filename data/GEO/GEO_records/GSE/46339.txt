TITLE
Genome-enabled studies of anaerobic, nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation in the chemolithoautotrophic bacterium Thiobacillus denitrificans

ORGANISM
Thiobacillus denitrificans ATCC 25259

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in anaerobic, nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation in the chemolithoautotrophic bacterium Thiobacillus denitrificans

DESIGN
Here we report on a study to identify genes associated with nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation by whole-genome transcriptional (microarray) assays including the use of FeCO3, Fe2+, and U(IV) oxides as electron donors under denitrifying conditions.  A 25 chip study using total RNA recovered from wild-type T. denitrificans was cultivated at 30oC under strictly anaerobic conditions with growth medium that contained 20 mM thiosulfate, 20 mM nitrate, and 30 mM bicarbonate (pH ~7) and exposed to 8 treatments.  Each chip measures the expression level of 2832 ORFs with N 24-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
