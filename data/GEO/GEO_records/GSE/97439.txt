TITLE
Transcriptomic data for splenic neutrophils isolated from female NZBWF1/J lupus mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent literature has shown that neutrophils exert significant influence on the course of disease progression in lupus, but there is currently controversy in the lupus field regarding a) whether neutrophils are predominantly protective or deleterious toward the propagation of auto-reactivity, b) the specific mechanism of neutrophil influence on adaptive immune dysregulation, and c) identity and origin of functionally abnormal neutrophil subsets in lupus. Here we used RNA sequencing of splenic neutrophils isolated from a murine lupus model (NZB/W) to characterize changes in the transcriptional program of neutrophils over the course of lupus progression. We find that the transcription of immunologically relevant genes change over the course of disease, and that lupus neutrophils early in disease show enrichment for transcripts associated with neutrophil precursors. These data provide the first detailed profile of the splenic neutrophil transcriptional program changes during the progression of lupus.

DESIGN
UltraLoInput RNA sequencing of neutrophils isolated from the spleens of female NZBWF1/J lupus mice at three stages of disease (Ages: 14 weeks, 20 weeks, 26 weeks).
