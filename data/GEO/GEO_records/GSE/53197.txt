TITLE
Multiple tissue RNA sequencing of 17 Arabidopsis thaliana MAGIC founder accessions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We produced RNA-Seq reads from messenger RNA isolated from seedling, root, and floral bud tissue for 17 MAGIC founder accessions (inbred strains) of Arabidopsis thaliana (see Gan et al. 2011. Nature, 477:419-23 for a description of the MAGIC genetic mapping resource). The resulting RNA-Seq data provide a resource to assess tissue-specific expression across different accessions of A. thaliana. Note that comparable read data for accessions Col-0 and Can-0, which are also founders of the MAGIC lines, has previously been released under GEO series GSE30795 (Gan et al. 2011. Nature, 477:419-23).

DESIGN
Examination of RNA expression across tissues (seedling, root, floral bud) for 17 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions (Bur-0, Ct-1, Edi-0, Hi-0, Kn-0, Ler-0, Mt-0, No-0, Oy-0, Po-0, Rsch-4, Sf-2, Tsu-0, Wil-2, Ws-0, Wu-0, Zu-0).

PLATFORM
GPL11221 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Arabidopsis thaliana)
