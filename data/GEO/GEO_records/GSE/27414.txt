TITLE
Human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells from 2 donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
screening of signature deterimes the individual variations in the therapeutic efficacy of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells There is paucity of information whether human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) from separate donors might have different effects on improving myocardial repair after myocardial infarction (MI).

DESIGN
We screened cell surface genes by the comparing the cells that showed the best and worst efficacy, respectively, in repairing the infarcted myocardium of rats.
