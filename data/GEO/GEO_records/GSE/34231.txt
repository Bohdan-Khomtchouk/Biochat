TITLE
Dynamics of mRNA abundance and translation in response to darkness and reillumination

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of 14d-old Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to 1h darkness and 10 min reillumination after 1 h darkness to evaluate the regulation of gene expression at the level of translation.

DESIGN
12 samples, 3 conditions (1h light control, 1 h darkness treatment, 1 h darkness plus 10 min reillumination), 2 RNA pools (Total mRNA and polysomal mRNA), 2 bioreplicates

PLATFORM
GPL198 [ATH1-121501] Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array
