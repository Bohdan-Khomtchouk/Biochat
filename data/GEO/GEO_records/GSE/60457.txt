TITLE
Copy number profiles of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Until now, it is nearly impossible to diagnose malignancy of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma with pathological examinations. The aim of the study is to find the genes which can be applied as a biomarker in the clinic to distinguish benign and malignant forms of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma.

DESIGN
We generated aCGH profiles of 9 samples of benign tumors and 3 samples of malignant tumors
