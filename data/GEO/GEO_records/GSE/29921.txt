TITLE
Global mRNA expression profiling of HCT116 cells overexpressing miR30a-5p

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global mRNA expression profiling of HCT116 cells overexpressing miR30a-5p were collected using Agilent human whole genome array (G4845A AMADID  026652, cRNA 4x44k V2) . Two different sources of RNA were analyzed: 1.) HCT116 colon cancer cells overexpressing human mir-30a-5p together with a sponge vector expressing binding sites for the antisense sequence of sh30a-5p vector construct to compete out possible miRNAs derived from the anti-guide strand of this vector. 2.) HCT116 colon cancer cells expressing control vector (pLKO.1-LV) and the sponge vector described above.

DESIGN
Two conditions (sponge-LV vs sponge-sh30a-5p), each condition is represented by 3 biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL10332 Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Feature Number version)
