TITLE
Gene expression in ATII cells transduced with adenovirus expressing constitutively active mutant HIF1a

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To determine HIF1a target genes in ATII cells, we transduced freshly isolated rat ATII cells with an adenoviral vector expressing either GFP or a constitutively active mutant HIF1a construct. After 24 hours, RNA was extracted and subjected to microarray.

DESIGN
There was one well transduced with AdGFP and one well transduced with AdHIF1a.  This was repeated four times, using four separate rats, on four separate dates. Therefore, there are 8 samples total, paired by extraction date.
