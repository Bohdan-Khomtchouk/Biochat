TITLE
Spo11-oligo mapping of DSBs in an SK1 x S288C F1 hybrid strain

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The Spo11-generated double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination are non-randomly distributed across the genome. Here, we use Spo11-oligonucleotide complexes, a byproduct of DSB formation, to map the distribution of meiotic DSBs in an SK1 x S88C F1 hybrid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

DESIGN
One sample, collected at 6 hr after transfer to sporulation medium

PLATFORM
GPL17342 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
