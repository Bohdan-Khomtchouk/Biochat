TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and CsDML OX Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
Purpose: we performed comparative RNA-seq analyses to identify differentially expressed genes between CsDML OX transgenic lines Wild Type Methods: Expression profiles were examined by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in SD-induced (for 28 days) shoot apices of CsDML over-expressor and wild-type hybrid poplars. For RNA extraction, 25 apices from 25 trees of each WT, CsDML OX1 and CsDML OX3 genotypes were dissected under a binocular loupe to remove leaflets surrounding the shoot apical meristem Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, 318 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified in CsDML OX, among which 79 were found upregulated and 239 downregulated
