TITLE
The p23 molecular chaperone and GCN5 acetylase jointly modulate protein-DNA dynamics and open chromatin status.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Dense mapping of individual DNase I cleavages from intact nuclei isolated from wild type, sba1Δ and gcn5Δ yeast using high-throughput sequencing.

DESIGN
Open chromatin status of wild type, sba1-/- and gcn5-/- yeast strains were generated by Dnase-seq.
