TITLE
Estradiol modulates gene expression in the monkey iliac artery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective:  To examine the effect of estradiol on gene expression in the monkey iliac arteries. Design:  Eight ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys were on a high fat diet for 6.5 years.  The left iliac artery was biopsied before randomization to estradiol (1 mg EstraceÂ® per day, n=4) or vehicle (n=4) for 8 months.  The right iliac artery was obtained at necropsy.  Gene expression in the iliac arteries in response to estradiol was determined by DNA microarray and confirmed by real time RT-PCR. Results:  Atherosclerotic lesions in the iliac arteries ranged in size from 0-0.61 mm2 in estrogen-treated animals and from of 0-0.873 mm2 in controls.  106 genes were shown to be down-regulated and 26 genes were up-regulated in the monkey iliac arteries in response to estradiol.  Among the genes shown to be up-regulated by DNA microarray and confirmed by real time RT-PCR were components of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, IGF-1, IGF binding protein 4 (IGFBP4) and IGFBP5.  Components of the Wnt signaling pathway were also up-regulated, including secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2), SFRP4, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), and Wnt 1 inducible signaling pathway protein 2 (WISP2). Conclusions:   The modest effect of estradiol on gene expression in monkey iliac arteries reported herein may reflect a reduction in response to estradiol as a result of the effect of the altered environment of the artery containing atherosclerotic plaque.
