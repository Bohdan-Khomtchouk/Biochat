TITLE
Gene expression analysis in differentiated day 3 cells from mouse ESC under the treatment of DMSO and histone deacetylase inhibitors (TSA) [expression array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Based on the cDNA microarrays performed with the RNAs prepared from the differentiated cells at day 3 with or without 24 hrs TSA treatment initiated at day 2, we reveal that the upregulated gene sets were highly enriched for biological functions related to mesoderm development, mesoderm morphogenesis and others.

DESIGN
Three independent experiments were performed at each treatment (DMSO or TSA).
