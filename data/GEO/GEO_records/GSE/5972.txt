TITLE
Gene expression profiling of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used cDNA microarrays to systematically analyze host responses in SARS-infected individuals from onset of symptoms to discharge from hospital or death.  We modeled gene expression in 60 datasets from 40 unique patients of varied clinical evolution with emphasis on correlating innate and adaptive immune responses with discrete clinical phases of the disease. Keywords: Comparative patient class comparision, SARS patients relative to healthy controls
