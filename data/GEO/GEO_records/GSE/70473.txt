TITLE
tRNA-Derived Small Non-Coding RNAs in Response to Ischemia Inhibit Angiogenesis

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Ischemic injuries will lead to necrotic tissue damage, and post-ischemia angiogenesis plays critical roles in blood flow restoration and tissue recovery. Recently, several types of small RNAs have been reported to be involved in this process. In this study, we first generated a rat brain ischemic model to investigate the involvement of new types of small RNAs in ischemia. We utilized deep sequencing and bioinformatics analyses to demonstrate that the level of small RNA fragments derived from tRNAs was strikingly up-regulated in the ischemic rat brain. Among these sequences, tRNAVal- and tRNAGly-derived small RNAs account for the most abundant segments. The up-regulation of tRNAVal- and tRNAGly-derived fragments was verified through northern blot and quantitative PCR analyses. The levels of these two fragments also increased in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model and cellular hypoxia model. Importantly, the overexpression of tRNAVal- and tRNAGly-derived fragments in endothelial cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration and tube formation. Our results indicate that tRNA-derived fragments are involved in tissue ischemia, and we demonstrate for the first time that tRNAVal- and tRNAGly-derived fragments inhibit angiogenesis by modulating the function of endothelial cells.
