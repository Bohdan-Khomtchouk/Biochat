TITLE
SNP genotyping analyses for the Chinese indigenous pig breeds and commercial pig breeds

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Genome-wide SNP genotyping array can genotyped SNP highthroughly. It can be used in many aspects, such as phylogeny relationships, genome-wide association studies, copy number identification.

DESIGN
9 Chinese indigenous pig, 4 commercial pigs and 1 wild pig were genotyped by PorcineSNP60 array (Illumina) for exploring the phylogeny relationships among them.
