TITLE
Arabidopsis buds: ahl16 vs. Col-0

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis buds comparing ahl16 mutants with wild type (Col-0 ecotype). Goal was to determine the differential expression genes between the buds of mutant and wild type.

DESIGN
Biological replicates: 3 replicates of mutant buds, 3 replicates of wildtype buds.
