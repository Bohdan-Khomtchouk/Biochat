TITLE
HAP5 Triple Mutant vs. Constans Mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Aims: To compare the transcriptional profiles of an AtHAP5 (AtNF-YC, AtCBF-C) triple mutant vs. a Constans mutant. Background Information on Mutants: AtHAP5 triple mutant created by cross between the following SALK TDNA inserts: SALK_034838, SALK_058903, SALK_032163; these correspond to At1G54830, At1G08970, At5G63470, respectively. co-SAIL TDNA insertion SAIL_24_H04 corresponds to AT5G15840. Tissue: Above-ground whole plants grown for 10 days, under 16 hr light 8 hrs dark at constant 22C. Tissue collected 14 hrs after lights on. RT-PCR analysis on test RNA confirmed FT levels reduced in mutants lines compared to wild-type.

DESIGN
9 samples were used in this experiment.
