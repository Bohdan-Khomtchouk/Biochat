TITLE
Establishment of objective criteria for selecting relevant intestinal cell-based models

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to make use of gene expression signatures and functional assays to delineate differences between various intestinal colon carcinoma cell lines and normal intestinal epithelium to assess their appropriateness as a tumor model or for drug absorption studies.

DESIGN
[Cell lines] Total RNA of biological replicate samples (i.e.different passages) from a  panel of cell lines was collected and resulting amplified cRNA hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Samples are labeled as follows: SampleNumber_CellLine. [Laser dissected tumor cells (LDM)] Total RNA of three different samples laser dissected tumor cells, normal colonocytes, and enterocytes of ileum and two samples of jejunum was collected and resulting amplified cRNA hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Samples are labeled as follows: SampleNumber_TissueType_Origin.
