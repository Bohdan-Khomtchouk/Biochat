TITLE
Expression data of cardiac and gastrocnemius muscles of tumor bearing C26 mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We surveyed the transcriptomes of the whole heart and whole gastrocnemius muscle taken from two different types of Balb/c-DBAj hybrid mice (10-11 weeks old). The colon cancer bearing mice are called C26. The NTB are the non-tumor bearing mice. This dataset includes Affymetrix expression data collected from the biological triplicates of heart and gastrocnemius from both C26 and NTB mice.

DESIGN
The experimental combinatorics is 3 biological replicates x 2 muscle types x 2 murine models
