TITLE
Expression data from CRL-5889 xenograft tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified a recurrent gene fusion TRA2B-DNAH5 in human lung squamous cell carcinoma. This gene fusion can promote tumor growth in CRL-5889 xenograft tumors. Microarary was performed to identify these differential genes which may mediate the tumor promotive function of TRA2B-DNAH5 fusion.

DESIGN
One human lung squamous carcinoma cell line CRL-5889 with or without TRA2B-DNAH5 fusion expression was used to do the xenograft assay in nude mice.  4 weeks later, we harvested the tumors and extract total RNAs for microarray analyses.
