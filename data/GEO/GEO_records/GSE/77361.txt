TITLE
Genome wide analysis of gene expression in conjunctiva whole tissue and primary conjunctival fibroblasts from patients with ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid and control patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of differentially expressed genes in conjunctiva and conjuntival fibroblasts from pemphigoid patients compared to control patients. Results indicate these differentially expressed genes, which could be further investigated as potential anti-fibrosis targets

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from whole conjunctival tissue samples and primary conjunctival fibroblasts from patients with ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid, and control patients
