TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Macrobrachium nipponense : genes and expression profile from hepatopancreas and muscle

ORGANISM
Macrobrachium nipponense

SUMMARY
To identify genes involved in nutrition metabolism of Macrobrachium nipponense, two independent cDNA libraries from hepatopancreas and muscle were constructed through high-throughput next-generation sequencing techniques. A total of 112,548,142 and 90,140,774 high quality reads were generated in the two cDNA libraries, respectively. Clustering and assembly of these reads produced a nonredundant set of 98,560 unique sequences, with an average unigene length of 793 bp. The unigene sequences were subjected to GO, COG and KEGG functional classification. A large number of differentially expressed genes were recovered by comparison of the two tissues. The differentially expressed and their functions were predicted by KEGG pathway mapping. Furthermore, 17,971SSRs and 32,935 high-confidence SNPs were identified in the two EST datasets. This study lays the foundation for further research on gene function analysis in nutrition metabolism of M. nipponense.
