TITLE
Inferring gene networks for strains of Dehalococcoides highlights conserved relationships between genes encoding core catabolic and cell-wall structural proteins

ORGANISM
Dehalococcoides mccartyi

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Dehalococcoides mccartyi in the commercially available KB-1â„¢ consortia comparing control standard TCE batch fed culture to treatments either introducing the culture to a standard batch feeding, stressful condition, or continous feed rate.

DESIGN
All experimental cultures were run in the red channel against the batch fed control in the green. Two dye swaps of the standard control were also run.

PLATFORM
