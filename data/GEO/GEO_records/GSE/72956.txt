TITLE
Transcriptomic and Epigenetic analysis of cell line derivatives from H2087 and HCC1954 cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled the transcriptomes of latency-competent cells derived from the human cancer cell lines H2087 (lung adenocarcinoma) and HCC1954 (breast adenocarcinoma) in mitogen-rich and mitogen-low media (MRM and MLM, respectively). In addition, we analyzed the epigenetic landscape of these cell lines under MLM conditions.

DESIGN
H2087 and HCC1954 parental and latency-competent cell derivatives (LCCs) were grown for 48hr in mitogen-rich or mitogen-low conditions in vitro, and whole RNA was extracted for RNA-seq profiling. Cell lines were also grown in MLM conditions and DNA extracted for ChIP-Seq experiments.
