TITLE
High miR-449b expression in prostate cancer is associated with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA profiling was performed using multiplex qPCR on laser micro dissected material from 36 PC patients to identify microRNAs associated with recurrence after radical prostatectomy

DESIGN
Biopsies from prostatectomy specimens were analyzed for tumor tissue and normal prostate glandular epithelium. Respective areas were laser micro dissected and the microRNA fraction was extracted. The microRNA was profilled using Taq-man Low Density Array Human microRNA A+B Cards v3.0.
