TITLE
Gene expression data from 1833 cells and 1833 cells depleted of BACH1 mRNA expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor BACH1 is a master regulator of human breast  cancer metastasis.  Here we use gene expression array analysis to identify and compare the genes regulated by BACH1 depletion in a metastatic human breast cancer cell line.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from vector control 1833 cells or 1833 cells with shBACH mRNA BACH1 depletion. Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays were performed to detail the gene expression and identify the genes regulated by BACH1in metastatic human breast cancer cells.
