TITLE
RNA-seq of major tissues and xylem cell types of Populus trichocarpa

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
We used the stem cross-sections of P. trichocarpa and our recently developed laser capture microdissection (LCM) to collect fibers, vessels, and a combination of 3 cell types (fibers + vessels + rays). Total RNA from the three samples was isolated, amplified, and analyzed by full-transcriptome RNA-sequencing. The sequencing reads were mapped to the P. trichocarpa genome.

DESIGN
Different major tissues (shoot tip, leaf, phloem, primary root, stem differentiating xylem) and xylem tissue cell types (fiber, vessel, ray cells) were analyzed by RNA-seq.
