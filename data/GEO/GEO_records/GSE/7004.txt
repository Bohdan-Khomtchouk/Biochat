TITLE
Oxygen-dependent transcriptome profiling in R.sphaeroides 2.4.1 in the dark

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides

SUMMARY
Wild type (2.4.1) strain, dark conditions, controlled oxtgen concentration in the growth medium (achieved by constant sparging with a gas mixture containing 1% CO2, variable - indicated for every sample - concentration O2 and balance N2). Keywords: dose response

DESIGN
Cells were harvested at OD 0.16-0.18 after rapid addition of rifampicin, spun down and frozen for subsequent RNA isolation. RNA was isolated using bead beater and RNeasy kit. Traces of DNA were removed by DNAse I treatment until level non-detectable by 33-36 cycles of real-time PCR. Further sample preparaton -according Affymetrix protocols. Data processing: MAS 5.0 values are deposited here (for compatability with other submitted samples), values used in the publications are obtained with RMA and may be recreated using the supplied CEL files.
