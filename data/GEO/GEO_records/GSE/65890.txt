TITLE
Gene expression in DCIS.COM and SUM225 MIND xenografts during transition from 2 to 6 to 10 weeks

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We utilized DCIS mouse intraductal (MIND) models with both SUM225 and DCIS.COM cell lines to characterize the sequential and temporal changes in mRNA expression over a time course of 2, 6, and 10 weeks during in vivo progression in the epithelial cells from DCIS to invasive cancer.

DESIGN
DCIS cell lines: DCIS.COM and SUM225 were injected intraductally into the MIND model as triplicates. At 2, 6, and 10 weeks post-injection, the mammary glands were collected and magnetically sorted for the epithelial cells. Affymetrix microarray was utilized to analyze gene expression profiles from RNA isolated from these cells.
