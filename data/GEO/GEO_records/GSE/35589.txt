TITLE
Macaca Fascicularis Differential Gene Expression Following Stroke: Control versus Tat-NR2B9c Treated Cortex at 1 hour and 6 hours following middle cerebral aretry occlusion (MCAO)

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression comparison between cortex of placebo and PSD-95 inhibitor (Tat-NR2B9c), treated cynomolgus macaques at 1 and 6 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion.  The purpose of this study was to identify changes in differential gene expression in the cortex of animals receiving strokes across the two time points and bewtwee the two treatment groups.  Differential gene expression was defined as the ratio of fluroescene detected for expressed sequence tags in the left, unoperated cortex versus the contralateral, right, ischemic cortex at each time point.  Two colour, Agilent, 4x44k whole genome macaca mulata microarrays with sample rna hybridized to Cy5 channel and universal macaca mulatta rna control on the Cy3 channel were obtained for each hemisphere.  Comparisons between treatment groups at each time point and within in each treatment group across each time point were made to detect differential gene expression.  Significant differential gene expression was defined as greater than 2-fold change and p < 0.05 by T-test.
