TITLE
Expression profile of micro-RNAs and functional annotation analysis of their targets in human chorionic villi from early recurrent miscarriage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was designed to investigate the miRNA expression profilein human chorionic villi from early recurrent miscarriage. We identified 155 miRNAs exhibiting over 2-fold change in expression levels (P < 0.05) by microarray,

DESIGN
Chorionic villi tissues collected from cases with  recurrent miscarriage and normal people were used to investigate the miRNA expression profile by microarray, which would be beneficial to understanding the etiology and pathophysiological mechanism of early recurrent miscarriage
