TITLE
Expression data in Arabidopsis wild type, ahg2-1 and ahg2-1ags1-1 mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We applied the tiling arrays to study the Arabidopsis whole-genome transcriptome in Arabidopsis wild type, ahg2-1 and ahg2-1ags1-1 mutants.

DESIGN
The total RNA was prepared from 15-day-old Arabidopsis plants grown on the agar plates and used for the microarray hybridization. Three replicative hybridization experiments for each strand array were carried out using the independent biological RNA samples.
