TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of human radioresistant breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We wanted to use an unbiased approach to identify miRNAs that regulate radiosensitivity. To this end, we performed a Human Apoptosis miRNA PCR Array analysis to identify miRNAs deregulated in radioresistant (SUM159-P2) compared to parental (SUM159-P0) cells.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling.  Parental and radioresistant breast cancer cell lines were used as indicated in the summary. Equal amount total RNA from each cell line was collected and reversely transcripted prior to gene expression analysis.
