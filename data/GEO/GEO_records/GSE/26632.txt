TITLE
Transcriptome profiles of the rice coleoptile of wild type and reduced adh activity (rad) mutant

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Normally, rice can elongate the coleoptile under submerged condition. However, reduced adh activity (rad) mutant cannot elongate the coleoptile under submergence. To investigate the change in gene expression,  we  performed microarray analysis. In this analysis, we used 1 day old seedling of rice. But  it is difficult to isolate only coleoptile from rice embryo without any contamination in this stage. Therefore, we applied laser microdissection (LM) technique to this microarray. By use of LM, we isolated coleoptile from rice embryo and use for microarray analysis. As the results, we found that the differences in the gene expression profiles of coleoptile between wild type and rad mutant.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis in coleoptile of wild type and mutant.
