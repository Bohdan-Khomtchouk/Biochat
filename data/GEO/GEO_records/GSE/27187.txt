TITLE
Expression profile of acute monocytic leukemia patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the pathogenesis of DNMT3A in acute monocytic leukemia (AML-M5), we identified genes that are expressed differently in leukemia cells from AML-M5 patients collected at diagnosis with DNMT3A mutations (6 cases) compared to those without the mutations (4 cases). Differences of expression level were observed in 889 out of 20,723 (4.3%) annotated genes by using Affymetrix microarray with 469 genes upregulated and 420 genes downregulated.

DESIGN
Leukemia cells in bone marrow of acute monocytic leukemia patients were collected at diagnosis for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. 6 cases of AML-M5 samples with DNMT3A mutations and 4 cases of AML-M5 samples wihtout DNMT3A mutations were used.
