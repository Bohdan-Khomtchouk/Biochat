TITLE
TRX-1 Regulates SKN-1 Nuclear Localization Cell Non-Autonomously in Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The Caenorhabditis elegans oxidative stress response transcription factor, SKN-1, is essential for the maintenance of redox homeostasis and is a functional ortholog of the Nrf family of transcription factors. The numerous levels of regulation that govern these transcription factors underscore their importance. Here, we add a thioredoxin, encoded by trx-1, to the expansive list of SKN-1 regulators. We report that loss of trx-1 promotes nuclear localization of intestinal SKN-1 in a redox-independent, cell non-autonomous fashion from the ASJ neurons. Furthermore, this regulation is not general to the thioredoxin family, as two other C. elegans thioredoxins TRX-2 and TRX-3 do not play a role in this process. Moreover, TRX-1-dependent regulation requires signaling from the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. However, while TRX-1 regulates SKN-1 nuclear localization, SKN-1 transcriptional activity remains largely unaffected. Interestingly, RNA-Seq revealed that loss of trx-1 elicits a general, organism-wide down-regulation of several classes of genes; those encoding for collagens and lipid transport and localization being most prevalent. However, one prominent lipase-related gene, lips-6, is highly up regulated upon loss of trx-1 in a skn-1-dependent manner. Together, these results uncover a novel role for a thioredoxin in regulating intestinal SKN-1 nuclear localization in a cell non-autonomous manner, thereby contributing to the understanding of the processes involved in maintaining redox homeostasis throughout an organism.
