TITLE
Granulosa cell gene expression in gonadotropin-treated ERbeta-het and ERbeta-null mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to determine the role of ERβ in the response of mouse granulosa cells to PMSG (an FSH analog) by comparing the gene expression profiles of ERβ-het and ERβ-null animals treated with this compound.

DESIGN
ERβ-het and ERβ-null mice were treated with PMSG for 48h and granulosa cells isolated and pooled according to gentoype, resulting in the production of two RNA samples (one biological replicate per gentoype). There were two hyb replicates for the comparison. Two slides were hybridized for the sample pairing to allow for dye reversals (technical replicates).
