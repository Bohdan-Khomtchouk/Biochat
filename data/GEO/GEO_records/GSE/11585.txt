TITLE
Granulosa cell gene expression in gonadotropin-treated ERbeta-het and ERbeta-null mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to determine the role of ERβ in the response of mouse granulosa cells to PMSG (an FSH analog) by comparing the gene expression profiles of ERβ-het and ERβ-null animals treated with this compound.
