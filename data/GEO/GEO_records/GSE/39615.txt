TITLE
Transcriptomic landscape of developing Presomitic Mesoderm (PSM) from Tailbud to somite in E9.5 mouse embryo and in in vitro differentiated Paraxial mesoderm derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stem cell-derived tissues have wide potential for modelling developmental and pathological processes as well as cell-based therapy. However, it has proven difficult to generate several key cell types in vitro, including skeletal muscle. In vertebrates, skeletal muscles derive during embryogenesis from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). Using PSM development as a guide to establish conditions for the differentiation of monolayer cultures of embryonic stem (ES) cells into PSM-like cells without the introduction of transgenes or cell sorting.
