TITLE
Regulation and role of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and ultimately fatal interstitial lung disease characterized by alveolar epithelial cell type II (AECII) injury and enhanced fibroblast/myofibroblast proliferation. Recent data show that maladaptive endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress leading to AECII apoptosis could play a key role in IPF, although it is still unclear how precisely such response is initiated and signalled. C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) has been suggested to contribute to a maladaptive ER-stress response in general and has been found to be induced and to be translocated into the nucleus of AECII in IPF in particular.  We here show for the first time a novel mechanism for the regulation of CHOP expression during ER-stress in AECII via AP-1 and c-Ets-1. We found these two transcription factors to be up-regulated in AECII under ER-stress conditions and to interact with each other to jointly bind to the CHOP promoter, thereby inducing CHOP gene expression. Moreover, we show for the first time that singular CHOP overexpression in vitro and in vivo is indeed capable of inducing apoptosis of AECII and, consequently, lung fibroblast proliferation and up-regulation of pro-fibrotic markers. We therefore believe that CHOP plays a key role in AEC injury and consecutive fibrosis.

DESIGN
