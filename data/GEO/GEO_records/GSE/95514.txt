TITLE
Structure-seq2: Sensitive and accurate genome-wide profiling of RNA structure in vivo

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
We present Structure-seq2, which provides nucleotide-resolution RNA structural information in vivo and genome-wide. This optimized version of our original Structure-seq method increases sensitivity and data quality by minimizing formation of a deleterious by-product, reducing ligation bias, and improving read coverage. Structure-seq2 can employ a biotinylated nucleotide to facilitate the protocol. We have benchmarked Structure-seq2 on both mRNA and rRNA structure in rice (Oryza sativa) and apply Structure-seq2 to provide evidence of hidden breaks in chloroplast rRNA and a previously unreported N1-methyladenosine (m1A) in a nuclear-encoded rRNA.

DESIGN
14 Structure-seq2 libraries are generated via MiSeq. Two replicates are included each of the standard Structure-seq2 protocol (both + and - DMS), and of the biotin variation.

PLATFORM
