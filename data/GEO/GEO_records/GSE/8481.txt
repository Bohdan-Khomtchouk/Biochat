SUMMARY
We performed the GeneChip analysis to identify multiple extracellular determinants such as cytokines, cell membrane-bound molecules, and matrix responsible for cardiomyogenic differentiation, and evaluated the statistical significance of differential gene expression by the NIA array analysis ( ) (Bioinformatics 21: 2548), a web-based tool for microarrays data analysis. Keywords: Grem1-induced cardiogenesis via Wnt
