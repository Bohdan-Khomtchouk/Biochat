Various human cell types

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed the GeneChip analysis to identify multiple extracellular determinants such as cytokines, cell membrane-bound molecules, and matrix responsible for cardiomyogenic differentiation, and evaluated the statistical significance of differential gene expression by the NIA array analysis ( http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/ANOVA/ ) (Bioinformatics 21: 2548), a web-based tool for microarrays data analysis. Keywords: Grem1-induced cardiogenesis via Wnt

DESIGN
To identify cytokines and transcription factors responsible for cardiomyogenic differentiation, 69 human cells were clustered into 30 groups, depending on gene expression levels, by GeneSpringGX software. Among 30 groups, 21 groups includes cells with a cardiomyogenic potential. To identify genes specific for these groups, hierarchical clustering was employed; and Grem1 was nominated as one of the cluster-specific cardiomyocyte-promoting genes by NIA array analysis.
