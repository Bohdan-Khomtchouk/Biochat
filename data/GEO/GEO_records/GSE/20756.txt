TITLE
Interactions between reactive oxygen species stress and brassinosteroid hormone signaling in Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We were interested in investigating the transcriptome responses to exogenous applications of brassinosteroid hormone when Arabidopsis seedlings are pre-stressed with a reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide. We were interested in seeing which subsets of BR-responsive gene transcripts were most affected and how BR-responsive gene transcripts responded to increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide both as a whole and individually.

DESIGN
Liquid culture Arabidopsis seedlings are grown under standard conditions. Hydrogen peroxide is added at various concentrations to pre-stress the seedlings. Following this pretreatment, the seedlings are then treated with brassinosteroid (BR) hormone (epi-brassinolide, BL). Following this treatment, seedlings are harvested and total RNA is extracted for genome-wide transcriptome analysis.
