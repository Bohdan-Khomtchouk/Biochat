TITLE
Gene expression profile after Dax1 deletion in ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the function of Dax1 in mouse ES cells, whole genome microarray expression profiling was employed to identify genes that are potentially affected by the deletion of Dax1.

DESIGN
An inducible knockout ES cell line of Dax1 with the Cre-loxP system was generated and gene expression was measured (i) without Dax1 deletion, (ii) after 4 days of Dax1 deletion, or (iii) after several passags of Dax1 deletion. Each sample was prepared in triplicate.
