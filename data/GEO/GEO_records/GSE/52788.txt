TITLE
DNA copy number changes in malignant mesothelioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an asbestos-related malignancy. Discrimination between MM and reactive mesothelial hyperplasia (RM) is often difficult. MM cells have a broad histological spectrum, and consist mainly of epithelioid, sarcomatoid, and biphasic cell types. The prognosis of MM is generally poor, but better prognosis has been reported with the epithelioid type of MM than the non-epithelioid type. We applied a genome-wide analysis to the identification of new markers that may aid in differentiating the epithelioid type of MM from other histological types and from RM cells.

DESIGN
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis was performed on malignant mesothelioma (MM) primary cell cultures, reactive mesothelial hyperplasia (RM) primary cell cultures; early passage of in vitro primary cell cultures to minimize acquisition of additional genomic changes. If available, matched peripheral blood was applied to analysis.
