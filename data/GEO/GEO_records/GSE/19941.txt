TITLE
Control of LPS induced gene expression in bone marrow derived macrophages by the p50/p105 subunit of NF-kB and IL-10

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow-derived macrophages were produced from mice lacking IL-10 alone (IL10-def) or mice lacking both IL-10 and the p50/p105 subunit of NF-kB (p50/IL10), and left unstimulated, stimulated with LPS (1 ng/ml) or stimulated with LPS and IL-10 (0.3 ng/ml).

DESIGN
There are 12 total samples, with 2 each from the groups described in the summary.  Pairwise comparisons between groups were evaluated.
