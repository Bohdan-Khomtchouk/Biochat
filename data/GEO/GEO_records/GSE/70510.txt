TITLE
Low and high dose TLR4 stimulation in bone-marrow derived mouse macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare gene expression in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated with high or low doses of the TLR4 ligand Kdo2-Lipid A.

DESIGN
Mouse bone marrow derived marcophages were exposed to 0.03 nM or 10 nM does of the TLR4 ligand KDO Lipid A, and RNA was harvested at 1 and 2 hours post-stimulation. Two independent experimental replicates were performed.
