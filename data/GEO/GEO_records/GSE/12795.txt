TITLE
Expression profiling of Muscle tissue from C57BL/6J X C3H/HeJ)F2 and (C3H/HeJ X C57BL/6J)F2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the expression traits in animals from F2 intercross of inbred strains C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ. (N=309, 164 males and 145 females).

DESIGN
Muscle from 285 F2 female and male mice were generated by intercrossing F1 mice. Mice were fed chow diet containing 4% fat (Ralston-Purina Co., St. Louis, MO) until 8 weeks of age and then were placed on a high-fat " Western " diet containing 42% fat and 0.15% cholesterol (Teklad 88137, Harlan Teklad, Madison WI) for 12 weeks. At 20 weeks mice were sacrificed, after a 12-hour fast Muscle tissues were dissected and flash frozen in LN2 and stored at -80Â°C.
