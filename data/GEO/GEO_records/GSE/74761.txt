TITLE
Extensive alopecia areata is reversed by IL-23 cytokine antagonism

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alopecia areata (AA) is a prevalent disease associated with major emotional distress, and lacks effective, safe therapeutics for patients with extensive hair loss. This is the first report of hair regrowth with specific cytokine antagonism, in three patients with extensive hair loss ranging from 40% scalp involvement to alopecia universalis. Ustekinumab, an IL-12/23p40 antagonist that is highly effective in psoriasis, showed impressive ability to induce hair regrowth, coupled with suppression of inflammatory pathways and upregulation of hair keratins. Our report suggests that extensive AA is reversible using targeted treatments, opening the door for specific cytokine antagonism for this debilitating disease.

DESIGN
We evaluated hair regrowth in three AA patients at 20 weeks after treatment with 3 subcutaneous doses of 90mg ustekinumab given at weeks 0, 4, and 16. Skin biopsies of lesional and non-lesional scalp (when available) were taken at baseline (week 0) and at week 20. We also obtained biopsies from three healthy individuals.
