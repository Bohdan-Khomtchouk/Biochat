TITLE
Microarray analysis of a hybrid weakness in the cross between rice cultivars

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
To study a hybrid weakness of rice, we have employed microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes increased or decreased their expression specifically in the hybrid. Expression profiles of ‘Nipponbare’, ‘Jamaica’, and F1 hybrid were analyzed with ‘Rice oligo microarray kit’ of Agilent Technologies.

DESIGN
‘Nipponbare’, ‘Jamaica’, and F1 hybrid were used for analysis. Plants were aseptically germinated and cultivated on MS medium at 25˚C. After two weeks cultivation, roots were frozen and used for measurement. Three or four independent experiments were performed at each cultivar using different plant individuals.

PLATFORM
GPL8852 Agilent-015241 Rice Gene Expression 4x44K Microarray (Probe name version)
