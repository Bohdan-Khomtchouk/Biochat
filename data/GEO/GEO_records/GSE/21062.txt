TITLE
DNA microarrays of three shRNA control iPS clones (Ctrl 2,3,4) and shECAD iPS clones (shECAD 4,8,9)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E-cadherin upregulation is an early event of reprogramming of fibroblasts to induce pluripotent stem cells (iPS). Knocking down of E-cadherin by shRNA impairs iPS generation, though some colonies with great morphorlogical difference to shRNA control colonies remain. To illustrate the molecular and functional difference between shECAD iPS clones and shRNA control iPS clones, three respective iPS clones (shECAD 4,8,9 and Ctrl 2,3,4) were derived and DNA microarrays were run to analyze the transcriptional profile of these clones.

DESIGN
OG2 MEFs were infected with Sox2, Klf4, Oct4 and c-Myc (SKOM) plus either Luciferase shRNA (shLUC) or E-cadherin shRNA (shECAD) retrovirus. At Day 6 post infection cells were split onto feeder cells. Several colonies from SKOM+shLuc and SKOM+shECAD were picked out at Day 14 post infection respectively and three cell lines were established, namely Ctrl 2,3,4 for SKOM+shLuc iPS and shECAD 4,8,9 for SKOM+shECAD iPS. All clones were maintained on feeder cells in mESC medium. RNA were extracted from these six cell lines and DNA microarrays were run to analyze the transcriptional profile.
