TITLE
Role of differentially expressed microRNA-139-5p in the regulation of phenotypic internal anal sphincter smooth muscle tone

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The present study focused on establishing the role of microRNA-139-5p (miRNA-139-5p) in the phenotypic expression of basal tone in rat internal anal sphincter (IAS) vs. lack of tone in truly phasic smooth muscle of anococcygeus (ASM), via RhoA-associated kinase (RhoA/ROCK2).

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiling of smooth muscle from internal anal sphincter (IAS), rectum (RSM), or anococcygeus (ASM).
