TITLE
Genomic Redistribution of GR Monomers and Dimers Mediates the Transcriptional Response to Exogenous Glucocorticoid In Vivo.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of GRdim mutant macrophages (mouse, bone-marrow derived) treated with LPS for 6 hrs or with LPS (6hrs) + Dex (O/N 1uM). Identification of GR-regulated genes in response to LPS.

DESIGN
3 Grdim mutant macrophages samples treated with LPS (6hrs) and 3 Grdim mutant macrophage samples treated with LPS (6hrs) and Dex (overnight).
