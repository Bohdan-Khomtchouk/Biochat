TITLE
Reprogramming by Sall4, Nanog, Esrrb and Lin28 produces high quality iPSCs with a molecular signature of developmental potency that resembles ESCs.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To reveal a gene expression signature associated with developmental competence, we selected the following groups of iPSC lines for microarray analysis. i) “Poor quality” iPSCs: This group included the three OSKM-iPSC lines Nanog-GFP OSKM#2, Oct4-GFP OSKM#2 and KH2 OSKM27, that either did not produce fully developed pups or produced very low number of pups;  ii) “Good quality” iPSCs: This group included BC_2 OSKM28 and Nanog-GFP SNEL#3, both of which gave rise to live, normal pups that survived only few hours; iii) “High quality” iPSCs consisting of Nanog-GFP SNEL#2 and Oct4-GFP SNEL#1, both of which generated live pups that survived postnatally (representative pups from each iPSC group are shown in Figure S5). iv) As controls we used Nanog-GFP, Oct4-GFP and KH229 ESCs.

DESIGN
Poor, good and high quality iPSC lines together with 3 embryonic stem cell lines were subjected to agilent microarray
