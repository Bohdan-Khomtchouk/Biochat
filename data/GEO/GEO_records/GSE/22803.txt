TITLE
Expression data from roots and first two leaves of tomato seedlings growing on regular MS medium or MS medium supplemented with multi-wall carbon nanotubes (0, 50, 100, 200 ug/ml) or activated carbon (50 mg/ml)

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
To investigate effects of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) om total expression profile of tomato plants we introduced CNTs in MS agar medium in concentrationd 0, 50, 100, 200 ug/ml Objectives for this study included the identification of genes that were up or down-regulated at the transcriptional level in tomato seedlings in response to carnom nanotubes (CNTs).

DESIGN
10 day old root tips and first two leaves of  wild type tomato seedlings (cv. Micro-Tom) growing on regular MS agar medium or MS medium supplemented with carbon nanotubes (50, 100, 200 ug/ml) or MS medium supplemented with activated carbon (50 ug/ml) were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
