TITLE
Transcriptome profile in human hepatoma HepG2 cells treated with antioxidant-rich Barringtonia racemosa leaf extract

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The water extract of the leaf of B. racemosa had been reported to posses high phenolic content and showed high antioxidant activities. However, scientific data on the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial properties of the leaf extract are still lacking. In this study, the effects of the leaf extract on the expression of genes in cultured HepG2 cells were investigated using microarray technology. The leaf extract significantly regulated the expression of genes involved with consequential impact on the glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and metabolism of xenobiotics.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were seeded and treated with an 50 Âµg/ml of the water leaf extract of B. racemosa for 24 h. Following this, cells were trypsinized and then preciptated by centrifugation. Cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) before total cellular RNA (tcRNA) were extracted from the cells. tcRNA from both untreated and B. racemosa leaf-treated HepG2 cells were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. All experiments were done in triplicate. The microarray analysis was performed on Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 S.T Array according to the manufacturer's protocol. The gene sets were then subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the Partek Genomics Suite software to determine significantly expressed genes which was set according to P value less than 0.05 and fold change difference of equal to or greater than 1.5.
