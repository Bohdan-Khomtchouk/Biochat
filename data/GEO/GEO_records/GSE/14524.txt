TITLE
Transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of the Plasmodium falciparum developmental cycle

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
In order to further our understanding of the metabolic network of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, we carried out a concurrent transcriptomic and metabolomic study of the parasite's intraerythrocytic developmental cycle.  These microarray data were generated to compare the expression levels of metabolic enzymes to the concentrations of their associated metabolites over the 48-hour life cycle.
