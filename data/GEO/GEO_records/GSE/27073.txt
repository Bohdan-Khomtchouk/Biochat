SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis in human skeletal myoblasts (undifferentiated mononucleated cells, cultured in growth medium - 15% FBS) and human skeletal myotubes (pre-formed myotubes, cultured in differentiation medium â€“ 2% horse serum) exposed to the HDACi TSA (50nM) for 24 hours

DESIGN
TSA treated undifferentiated human primary myoblasts and terminally differentiated human myotubes

PLATFORM
GPL6104 Illumina humanRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
