TITLE
Gene expression induced by TSA in undifferentiated human primary myoblasts versus terminally differentiated human myotubes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis in human skeletal myoblasts (undifferentiated mononucleated cells, cultured in growth medium - 15% FBS) and human skeletal myotubes (pre-formed myotubes, cultured in differentiation medium â€“ 2% horse serum) exposed to the HDACi TSA (50nM) for 24 hours

DESIGN
TSA treated undifferentiated human primary myoblasts and terminally differentiated human myotubes
