TITLE
Expression data from human CD8+ T cell subsets, defined using CD27 and CD45RA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD27 and CD45RA can be used to split T cells into 4 subsets, na√Øve cells, CD27+CD45RA+, central memory cells CD27+CD45RA-, effector memory cells CD27-CD45RA-, effector memory CD45RA re-expressing cell, CD27-CD45RA+. It is with in this final EMRA subset that it is belived the senenscent T cells reside. Cellular senescence is accompanied by a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), to date a SASP has not been demonstrated in T cells. We used microarray analysis to show primary human senescent CD8+ T cells also display a SASP comprising of chemokines, cytokines and extracellular matrix remodelling proteases. We also wanted to investigate whether p38MAPK regulated the SASP seen in EMRA T cells.

DESIGN
Heparinised peripheral blood samples were taken from healthy volunteers (age range: 32-55 n = 6). Healthy was taken as individuals who had not had an infection or immunisation within the last month, no known immunodeficiency or any history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and were not receiving systemic steroids within the last month or any other immunosuppressive medications within the last 6 months.
