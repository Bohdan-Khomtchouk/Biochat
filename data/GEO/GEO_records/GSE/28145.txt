TITLE
Effect of ECAT11 disruption in mouse ESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The principal factors that lead to proliferation and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been vigorously investigated. However, the global network of factors and their full signaling cascade is still unclear. In this study, we found that ECAT11 (L1td1) is one of the ESC-associated transcripts harboring a truncated fragment of ORF-1, a component of the L1 retrotransposable element. We generated an ECAT11 knock-in mouse by replacing its coding region with green fluorescent protein. DNA microarray analyses revealed that ECAT11EGFP/EGFP ESCs showed similar global gene expression profiles as the wild type ESCs

DESIGN
Samples from wild type ESCs and ECAT11EGFP/EGFP ESCs
