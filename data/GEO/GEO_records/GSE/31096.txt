TITLE
Genome-wide identification of Bcl11b gene targets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 11B (Bcl11b) is a transcription factor showing predominant expression in the striatum.  To date, there are no known gene targets of Bcl11b in the nervous system.  Here, we define targets for Bcl11b in striatal cells by performing genome-wide expression profiling.  Transcriptome-wide analysis revealed that 694 genes were significantly altered in striatal cells over-expressing Bcl11b, including genes showing striatal-enriched expression similar to Bcl11b.  Functional analysis on the gene target list identified significant association of Bcl11b to brain-derived neurotrophic factor/neurotrophin signaling.  These data implicate Bcl11b as a novel regulator of the BDNF signaling pathway, which is disrupted in many neurological disorders.
