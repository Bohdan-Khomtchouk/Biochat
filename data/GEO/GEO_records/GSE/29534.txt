TITLE
Transgenic expression of human PON1 in Drosophila melanogaster under the Tub driver

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Human paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is an enzyme with lactonase, esterase and phosphotriesterase activity that has been associated with multiple phenotypes. We expressed hPON1 ubiquitously in Drosophila melanogaster using the Gal4 system Tub driver.
