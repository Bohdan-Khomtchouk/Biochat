TITLE
Transgenic expression of human PON1 in Drosophila melanogaster under the Tub driver

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Human paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is an enzyme with lactonase, esterase and phosphotriesterase activity that has been associated with multiple phenotypes. We expressed hPON1 ubiquitously in Drosophila melanogaster using the Gal4 system Tub driver.

DESIGN
RNA from 30 flies from each of 3 genotypes was used to hybridize 4 arrays in a 12-plex array (4 technical replicates, 3 genotypes).
