TITLE
miRNA expression profile of human MALT lymphoma compared to gastritis and gDLBCL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To obtain global miRNA expression signatures of gDLBCL and its precursor lesions, total RNA isolated from 7-8 cases each of Helicobacter-associated reactive gastritis, low grade MALT lymphoma and high grade gDLBCL was hybridized to Agilent miRNA microarrays representing 795 human mature miRNAs. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed a clear segregation of the gDLBCL cases from the low grade MALT lymphomas and the gastritis samples; the segregation of the latter two disease entities was only incomplete (Figure 1A), reflecting the relative biological similarity of gastritis and low grade lymphomas. Statistical analysis of the dataset revealed only 26 differentially expressed miRNAs between these two groups (p < 0.05), whereas 57 miRNAs exhibited significant differences in expression between low and high grade lymphomas.

DESIGN
7 human gastritis, 8 lowgrade MALT lymphoma and 7 high grade MALT lymphoma samples were used in the microarray analysis
