TITLE
The gene expression difference in strain AT01, a mutant of Trichoderma reesei, with high ability of copper accumulation

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei QM6a

SUMMARY
The gene expression profile of AT01 was compared with a wild-type T. reesei strain in medium containing 0.7 mM Cu2+. A total of 627 genes were up-regulated and 305 genes were down-regulated under copper stress. The expression analysis showed that amino acid transport- and metabolism-related genes are up-regulated, which is associated with adenine metabolism. Furthermore, inorganic ion transport- and metabolism-associated genes, such as superoxide dismutase and copper transporters, were also up-regulated.

DESIGN
Strain AT01 and wild-type strain were inoculated into YPD medium containing 1 mM CuSO4, and cultured at 25 Â°C for 5 d. Each sample was carried out with two repetitions.
