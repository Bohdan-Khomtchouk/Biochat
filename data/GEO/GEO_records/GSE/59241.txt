TITLE
Expression data from mouse CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter and is capable of regulating various endogenous signaling pathways, inculding inflamation and immune response. In mammals, H2S is mainly generated by two pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes, termed cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE). CBS-deficient mice showed autoimmune disorders. H2S play important roles in T cell development and differentiation, especially Treg cells development and differentiation. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression of WT and CBS-deficient CD4+ T cells.

DESIGN
CD4+ T cells from WT and CBS-deficient mice were isolated for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the homogeneous populations of mice at 6 weeks in order to increase the temporal resolution of expression profiles.
