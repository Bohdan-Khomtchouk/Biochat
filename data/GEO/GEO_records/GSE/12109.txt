TITLE
Th17 cytokines interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 modulate distinct inflammatory and keratinocyte-response pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we shought to identify the cytokines produced by skin-resident T cells in normal skin, localize the receptors for these cytokines, and examine how these cytokines alter gene expression profiles of the cells bearing cognate receptors. Keywords: repeated measures experiment

DESIGN
In this study,  primary keratinocytes were treated with either IL-17, IL-22 or IFNg for 24 hours then harvested for RNA extraction and subsequent gene array analysis
