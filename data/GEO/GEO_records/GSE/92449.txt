TITLE
Histone lysine-to-methionine mutation reprograms the histone methylation landscape and contributes to pleiotropic development in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study investigated the effect of expressing transgenic H3 with K36M missense mutations. We uncovered pleiotropic phenotypic defects and a strong loss of endogenous H3K36 methylation in all forms (me1,me2,me3)

DESIGN
Arabidopsis WT (containing non-mutated transgenic H3) and K36M (containing transgenic H3 K36M) plants were subject to ChIP-sequecing analysis using the H3K36me3 antibody (ab 9050) upon noting global losses of endogenous H3K36me3. Similarly grown samples were also subject to RNA-seq to investigate transcriptional changes associated with H3K36 methylation loss
