TITLE
Requirements for different Tcf1 isoforms in T cell development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptome between control, Tcf1 long isoform (p45)-deficient, complete Tcf1-deficient DN3 thymoctyes

DESIGN
lineage-negative, CD4-, CD8-, CD44 low and CD25 high (DN3) thymocytes were sorted  from control mice or those are deficient for either Tcf1 long isoforms (p45) or all Tcf1 proteins. Lck-Cre was used to ablate all Tcf1 proteins
