TITLE
Leukocyte-adjusted epigenome-wide association studies of blood from solid tumor patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of blood samples from a case-control study of bladder cancer. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in peripheral blood. Samples included peripheral blood samples from 223 incident cases of bladder cancer and 205 control subjects.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 428 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
