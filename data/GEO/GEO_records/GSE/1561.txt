SUMMARY
EORTC 10994 is a phase III clinical trial comparing FEC with ET in patients with large operable, locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer (www.eortc.be). Frozen biopsies were taken at randomisation. RNA was extracted from 100um thickness of 14G core needle biopsies. Adjacent sections were tested by H & E to confirm > 20% tumour cell content. 100 ng total RNA per chip were amplified using the Affymetrix small sample protocol (IVT then Enzo). 49 tumours were tested on Affymetrix U133A chips. The CEL files were quantile normalised together using rma. Clinical response data are not available yet. Keywords = Apocrine carcinoma Keywords = breast cancer
