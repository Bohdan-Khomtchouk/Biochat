TITLE
Classification of three temporal kinetic transcripts of SGIV

ORGANISM
Iridovirus

SUMMARY
Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) is the major agent that causes severe iridovirus diseases in grouper maricluture. Based on the genomic information, a DNA microarray, containing probes corresponding to 162 putative SGIV open reading frames (ORFs) was constucted. The viral microarrays wereused to classify the majority of SGIV transcripts into three temporal kinetic classes (immediate-early, IE; early, E; late, L) during an in vitro infection by their dependence on de novo protein synthesis inhibitor and viral DNA replication. Keywords: drug response
