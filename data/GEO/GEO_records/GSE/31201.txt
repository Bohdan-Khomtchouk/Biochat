TITLE
Inter-species array between human, rat and mouse

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We propose a new microarray method, called an inter-species array, that can measure gene expression levels of multiple species at once. As the array operates simply by changing the probes on an Agilent commercial customized array, and conventional facilities and protocols can be used, the method is cost-efficient. We generated an array for humans, rats and mice that covers 6683 genes. The number of genes is larger than that of previous arrays. We measured the expression of genes in astrocyte cells for humans and rats, and in cortex cells for rats and mice.

DESIGN
Single array with multiple species samples.
