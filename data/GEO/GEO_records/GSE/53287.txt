TITLE
Gene expression of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae strain R2866 and R2866Δ0112 mutant grown in supplemented brain-heart infusion medium for 4 hours

ORGANISM
Haemophilus influenzae R2866

SUMMARY
Gene expresison profiles of the R2866 WT and  R2866Δ0112 mutant gorwn 4 hours in supplemented brain-heart infusion medium. This experiment was conducted  to determine the effects of R2866_0112 gene deletion on overall gene expression profile. The results from this study are further discussed in: Modified lipooligosaccharide structure protects nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae from IgM-mediated complement killing in experimental otitis media.

DESIGN
R2866 wild-type (n=4) and R2866Δ0112 mutant (n=4) were grown for 4 hours in supplemented brain-heart infusrion medium The 4hr and 7hr analyses were performed separately and, therefore, the background corrections are different between the two experiments.
