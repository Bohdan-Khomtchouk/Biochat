TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Wild Type and Mir-212/132ILN/ILN mouse mammary gland

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice deficient for miR-212/132 have been reported to show impaired mammary gland development. However, another miR-212/132-deficient line does not demonstrate any obvious defects in mammary gland organogenesis. The transcriptome analysis in the mammary gland of the previously reported miR-212/132-deficient line by deep RNA-seq revealed significantly deregulated expression of genes flanking Mir-212/132 locus, such as HIC1, implying that the mammary gland phenotype might not be only due to loss of miR-212/132

DESIGN
Mammary gland mRNA profiles of Wild Type and Mir-212/132ILN/ILN mice were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx.

PLATFORM
