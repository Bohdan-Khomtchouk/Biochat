TITLE
Gene expression imprinting of N2a sublines upon infection with the prion strain 22L

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cell culture models allow prion propagation studies ex vivo after contact with infectious brain homogenates. To date, among the neural cell lines, the mouse neuroblastoma-derived cell line N2a has been one of the most widely used model and has yet provided interesting insights into cell biology of prion propagation. Remarkably, persistently-infected N2a sublines have been set up and replicate prions without exhibiting any pathological changes. One further interesting feature of N2a is the possibility to establish by subcloning, sublines with a range of susceptibility to prions. Indeed, susceptible sublines propagate prions and accumulate the pathogenic isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc, at the opposite of resistant sublines. The aim of our study was to apply large-scale expression analysis using microarrays combined with quantitative real-time PCR to examine the gene expression profile in a persistently-infected N2a cell line, N2a58, infected with the mouse-adapted prion strain 22L, to seek for prion-specific gene transcription. We also questioned if we could observe identical variations of expression of these genes in three other 22L-infected N2a sublines. Finally, we examined the transcriptional state of a N2a subline considered as resistant when exposed to prions. Common pathways of gene transcription would disclose information on the molecular basis of the cell infection and help to identify potential therapeutic targets. Keywords: other
