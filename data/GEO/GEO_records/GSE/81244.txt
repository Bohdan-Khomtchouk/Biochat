TITLE
Rspo1 role in mammary gland during pregnancy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
R-spondin1 (Rspo1) is a member of a secreted protein family which has pleiotropic functions in development and stem cell growth. Rspo1 knock-out mice are sex-reversed, but some remain sub-fertile, so, they are unable to nurse their pups. A lack of Rspo1 expression in mammary epithelial cells results in an absence of duct side-branching development and defective alveolar formation. In this study we propose to characterize the molecular functions involved to mammary gland phenotype due to Rspo1 knock out. By transcriptional profiling, we have identified gene misregulated in mammary gland of Rspo1 knock-out mice during pregnancy. A stronger expression of genes characterising mesenchymal tissue was observed in the absence of alterations to the structure of mammary epithelial tissue. Mammary epithelial cell characterization, by immunohistochemistry approach, revealed a persistence of virgin markers which sign a delay in their differentiation. Moreover serial transplantation experiments show that Rspo1 is associated with a regenerative potential of mammary epithelial cell control. Our data have also highlighted that in mammary gland during pregnancy the expression of Rspo1’s partners, Lgr4 and RNF43, are negatively regulated and Tgf-β signaling is modified in the absence of Rspo1. Taken together, our results show an abrupt halt in mammary development at mid-pregnancy due to loss of further differentiated function.

DESIGN
Mammary glands of eight pregnancy day-12 mice (four wild-type (WT) and four Rspo1-/- samples) and of eight other mice at pregnancy day-16 (four WT and four Rspo1-/- samples)
