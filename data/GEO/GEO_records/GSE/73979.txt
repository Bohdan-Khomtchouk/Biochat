TITLE
3 cases of renal cell carcinomas with TFEB amplification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report here 3 cases of a very rare entity of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) that present an amplification of TFEB gene. This amplification, as well as translocation t(6;11) involving TFEB and MALAT1, leads to un overexpression of TFEB protein and seems to be a pejorative prognosis factor among TFEB RCCs

DESIGN
sample was analysed by arrayCGH method using Agilent recommendations. Sample was labeled in Cy5 and co-hybridized with control DNA cy3 labeled.

PLATFORM
GPL10123 Agilent-022060 SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray 4x180K (Feature Number version)
