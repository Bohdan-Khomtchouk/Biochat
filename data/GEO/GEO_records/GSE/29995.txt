TITLE
Expression data from the node and primitive streak (NPS) regions from WT and Wnt3a null embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this project was to elucidate the target genes and transcriptional networks activated by Wnt3a during gastrulation, a complex morphogenetic process in which the embryonic germ layers are formed and the vertebrate body plan is established.

DESIGN
To identify downstream targets of Wnt3a, transcriptional profiling was performed using Affymetrix GeneChips on both wildtype and Wnt3a null embryos at embryonic days (E) 7.75-8.  In order to maximize the likelihood of identifying direct target genes of Wnt3a, RNA was isolated from the node and primitive streak (NPS) region, an area where Wnt3a is highly expressed and at a time 12-18 hours before the morpholical phenotype of Wnt3a mutants becomes apparent.
