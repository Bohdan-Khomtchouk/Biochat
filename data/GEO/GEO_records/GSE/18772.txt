TITLE
Mouse ES cell neural differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of mouse ES cells (D0) and neural precusor cells (D6)

DESIGN
The mouse ES cell line R1 was grown on mitotically inactive fibroblast feeder layers in DMEM containing 15% FBS and LIF (1000 U/ml). Direct neural differentiation of ES cells was performed as described. (Watanabe et al., 2005)
