TITLE
Explosure of breast cancer cells promotes estrogen-dependent and -independent cell proliferation mechanisms tied to clinical outcomes identified in ER+ breast cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differentially expressed genes identified in MCF-7 cells treated to 0.1% ethanol concentration.

DESIGN
Total RNA was generated from MCF-7 breast cancer cells starved of estrogen in 5% charcoal filtered FBS. Cells were treated to either a 0.1% ethanol concentration or left untreated.
