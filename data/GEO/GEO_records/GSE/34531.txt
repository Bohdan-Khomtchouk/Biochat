TITLE
microRNA expression in various tissues of klotho-deficient and wild-type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The expression profiles of miRNAs in klotho-deficient and wild-type mice were examined by means of GenopalÂ®-MICM DNA chips. The data suggested that there was a difference in the expression of miRNAs between klotho-deficient and wild-type mice.

DESIGN
Small RNA samples prevared from 5-week-old klotho-deficient and wild-type mice were examined.
