TITLE
Gene expression profiles of germ cells, supporting cells, interstitial cells (including steroidogenic precursors), and endothelial cells in the developing testis and ovary at 11.5, 12.5, and 13.5 dpc. (GUDMAP Series ID: 43)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to determine the complete gene expression profile for each cell type of the developing gonad during the critical window in which it adopts the testis or ovarian fate.

DESIGN
Transgenic mice with cell type specific fluorescent markers were used to isolate germ cells, supporting cells, interstitial cells (including steroidogenic precursors), and endothelial cells in the developing testis and ovary.  The gonads were dissociated in trypsin, and the fluorescent cells were isolated by FACS.  The RNA was collected from the isolated cells and their gene expression profiles were determined by microarray analysis.
