TITLE
Non-telomeric role for Rap1 in regulating metabolism and protecting against obesity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mammalian telomere-binding protein Rap1 was found to have additional non-telomeric functions, acting as a transcriptional cofactor and a regulator of the NF-kB pathway. Here, we assess the effect of disrupting mouse Rap1 in vivo, and report on its unanticipated role in metabolic regulation and body weight homeostasis. Rap1 inhibition causes dysregulation in hepatic as well as adipose function. In addition, using a separation-of-function allele, we show that the metabolic function of Rap1 is independent of its recruitment to TTAGGG binding elements found at telomeres, and at other interstitial loci. We have utilized microarrays to outline gene expression changes resulting from Rap1-deficiency when compared to the wild-type controls.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the liver and intra-abdominal white adipose tissue of 3 female Rap1 deficient mice and 3 control littermates at 6-8 weeks of age. Rap1 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were isolated from 13.5 day embryos, immortalized with SV40LgT, and stably infected with vector, Rap1-wildtype, or Rap1 carrying an isoleucine to arginine mutation at amino acid 312. Total RNA was extracted from MEFs following a similar protocol. The samples were labeled, hybridized, and scanned using standard protocols by the Core Facility at NYU Langone Medical Center on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays.
