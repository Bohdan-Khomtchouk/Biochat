TITLE
Microarray-based Gene Expression Analysis of WA09 hESC  After Manipulation of Intracellular Potassium Content

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of intracellular inorganic element alterations to human pluripotent stem cells at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that changes in intracellular inorganic elements, like potassium, would change the pluripotent signaling network and influence differentiation cues. Results provide important information on the response of human pluripotent stem cells to tetraethylammonium-  and salinomycin-based changes to intracellular potassium, such as specific  up- or down-regulated genes governing cell proliferation, cell growth, differentiation, and development of specific cell lineages.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 48hr treatment with and without tetraethylammonium (TEA) and salinomycin (SAL), with and without changes in media by the addition of potassium chloride or sodium chloride. Study included 6 samples, repeated twice, for a total of 12 samples. Untreated samples in E8 TeSR media served as controls.
