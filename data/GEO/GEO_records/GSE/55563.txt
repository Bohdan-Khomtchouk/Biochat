TITLE
Identification of genes activated under CoCl2 treatment in an Sp1 dependent manner in an ovarian cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes activated under CoCl2 treatment of a cancer cell line in an Sp1 dependent manner, we performed cDNA microarray analysis with an ovarian cancer cell line, in which Sp1 is silenced via RNA interference.

DESIGN
Cells were transfected with scramble or Sp1 siRNA and cultured for 40 h. Cells were further cultured for 4 h under 0.5 mM CoCl2 exposure. Total RNA was isolated for cDNA microarray analysis.
