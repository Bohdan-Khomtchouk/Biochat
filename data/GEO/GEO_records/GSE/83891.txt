TITLE
Tunable regulation of CREB DNA binding activity couples genotoxic stress response and metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we show that, in embryonic fibroblasts from mice on a high fat diet and treated with Forskolin, ionizing radiation exposure or both, phosphorylation of CREB-binding protein (CREB) by ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated) and casein kinases 1 and 2 (CK1 and CK2) on a cluster of five phosphorylation sites (the ATM/CK cluster) within the unstructured kinase-inducible domain (KID) provides an additional level of regulation through dynamic modulation of CREB DNA binding activity. Stoichiometric phosphorylation of the ATM/CK cluster in response to DNA damage inhibited cAMP-induced CREB target gene expression, CREB DNA binding activity, and CREB-CRTC2-DNA ternary complex formation proportional to the number of phosphate residues modified. Substoichiometric phosphorylation of the ATM/CK cluster promoted cAMP/Ca2+-regulated transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs) recruitment and CREB activation via an ATM-independent, PKA-dependent pathway. Mice expressing a non-phosphorylatable CREBS111A allele exhibited phenotypes consistent with CREB deregulation, including fasting hyperglycemia, susceptibility to diet-induced obesity, and reduced expression of gluconeogenic genes.

DESIGN
Two genotypes: CREB+/+ (wild type) and CREBS111A (non-phosphorylatable CREB KID S111A mutant allele) each control treated, exposed to forskolin, ionizing radiation or both in triplicate and in two batches toataling 48 arrays
