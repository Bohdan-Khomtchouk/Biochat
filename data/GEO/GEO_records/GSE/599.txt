SUMMARY
Serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 (SGK1) activates the epithelial sodium channel (eNaC) in tubules. We examined renal SGK1 abundance in salt-adaptation and in salt-sensitive hypertension. Sprague-Dawley and Dahl salt-sensitive rats were placed on either 8% or 0.3% NaCl diets for 10 days. Plasma aldosterone levels were approximately 2.5-fold greater on 0.3% versus 8% NaCl diets in both rat strains. Both serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 transcript and protein abundance were less (P < 0.01) in Sprague-Dawley rats and greater (P < 0.01) in Dahl salt-sensitive rats on 8% versus 0.3% NaCl diets. The cDNA sequences of serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 in both strains of rat were the same. The present results provide evidence that the abundance of serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 in rat kidney may play a role in salt adaptation and the pathogenesis of hypertension and suggests that aldosterone is not the primary inducer of SGK1 in the Sprague-Dawley rat.
