TITLE
Comparative assessment of the transcriptome of pancreatic islets from Non-Obese Diabetic mice in the absence of immune infiltrate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of pancreatic islets from four mouse strains was compared - NODk.RagKO, B10k.RagKO, NODk.RagKO.insHEL and B10k.RagKO.insHEL. This comparison allows the assessment of altered transcriptome due to two factors - genetic background of NOD vs B10 strain, and the effect of the insHEL transgene. The use of the MHC k haplotype and the RagKO background remove contamination from infiltrating immune cells, in order to obtain a pure islet transcriptome.

DESIGN
Three mice of each gentoype were analyzed in this study.

PLATFORM
