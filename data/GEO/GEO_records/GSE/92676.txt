TITLE
Genome-wide methylation analysis of PCNSL using Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of primary CNS lymphomas. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,500 CpGs. Samples included 95 primary CNS lymphomas and 2 metastatic DLBCLs in CNS.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 95 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
