TITLE
Il13-stimulation of human paSMCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is characterized by medial hypertrophy due to pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (paSMC) hyperplasia. Interleukin (IL)-13 is a potent regulator of tissue fibrosis and remodelling, and its effects are dependent on the cell-type specific expression of the IL-13 receptor isotypes IL-4Rα, IL-13Rα1, and IL-13Rα2. In order to identify the possible mechanism how IL-13 can exert its antiproliferative effect on paSMC microarray analysis was performed. For this purpose paSMC were stimulated with IL-13(10ng/ml) for 2h and 6h, respectively and subjected to microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Comparison of stimulated versus unstimulated cells. 3 biological replicates, 2 time points
