TITLE
Transcriptome of the Nxnl1-/- mouse retina

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rod-derived Cone Viability Factor (RdCVF, alias nxnl1) is a retina-specific protein identified for its therapeutic potential in supporting cone survival during retinal degeneration. A nxnl1 knockout mouse model was created and the transcriptome used to demonstrate that the retina is compromised by the absence of nxnl1. Keywords: genetic modification, transcription-profile, retina
