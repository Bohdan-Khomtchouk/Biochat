TITLE
Genome-wide single-molecule sequencing of 6-methyladenine in eukaryotes

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
Mapping 6mA at single-base resolution across multiple eukaryotic genomes reveals its genomic distribution patterns, indicating a function in transcriptional regulation.

DESIGN
Using genome-wide methylation detection by single-molecule sequencing, we mapped 6mA at single-base resolution in seven eukaryotic species including the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the marine alga Nannochloropsis oceanica, and the wood-degrading fungus Auricularia delicata.  We also performed methylation mapping of publicly available raw SMRT sequencing data from two animal models, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, and budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
