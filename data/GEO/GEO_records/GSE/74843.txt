TITLE
Expression data of cultured organoids derived from human colorectal tumors and normal samples.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed gene expression of 58 line patinet-derived colorectal tumors and normal organoids.

DESIGN
mRNA from 58 cultured organoids were extracted and hybridized to GeneChip PrimeView Human Gene Expression Array, and scanned using GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.

PLATFORM
GPL16043 GeneChip® PrimeView™ Human Gene Expression Array (with External spike-in RNAs)
