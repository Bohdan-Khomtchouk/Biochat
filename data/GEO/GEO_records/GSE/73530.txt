SUMMARY
Psychological stress is highly prevalent in modern society. Both epidemiologic and experimental animal studies demonstrate that chronic psychological stress exerts adverse effects on the initiation and/or progression of many diseases. Here, using a mouse model of restraint stress, we report the discovery of a novel signaling pathway linking paternal stress exposure to the reprogram of hepatic gluconeogenesis in the offspring. Offspring fathered by stressed males (Stress-F1) exhibits hyperglycemia as a result of enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis, conpared to offspring from control fathers (Control-F1). Mechanistically, protein levels of PEPCK, a key gluconeogenic enzyme, were significantly increased, while its mRNA levels were unaffected in the stress-F1 mice, pointing to a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism. Because MicroRNAs often play an important role in regulating gene expression at the posttranscriptional level, we investigated the expression profile of MicroRNAs in livers from Control-F1 and Stress-F1 mice.
