TITLE
Study on the genomic changes in ColIa2 Cre x RBP-Jkappa loxp/loxp mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Skin tumor formed in the ColIa2 Cre x RBP-Jkappa loxp/loxp mice was analyzed for genomic changes by comparing with normal tissues from the same mice.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA were isolated from each individual tumor and compared with the DNA extracted from the brain tissue in the same mouse.
