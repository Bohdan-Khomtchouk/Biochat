TITLE
Psip1 ChIP using A300-847 antibody (Immunoprecipitates  mainly p52 isoform of Psip1) Chip-chip from Mouse MEFs cells with H3K36me3, H3K4me3, Psip1 ChIP using A300-847 antibody

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The p52 isoform of Psip1/Ledgf links histone H3K36 methylation and the regulation of alternative splicing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of Psip1 together with H3K36me3 and H3K4me3 and by ChIP-on-chip analysis demonstrated that, Like H3K36me3, Psip1 is enriched on exons of highly expressed genes,

DESIGN
Comparision of H3K36me3 and Psip1 binding sites on the expressed and non expressed genes.
