TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and FXRalpha-/- testicular Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to define the putatitve impacts of FXRalpha deficiency in testicular physiology

DESIGN
Testis  mRNA profiles of 10-day old wild type (WT) and FXralpha-/- mice were generated by deep sequencing, on 5 individual mice for each geneotype, sequence on flowcell HS168.
