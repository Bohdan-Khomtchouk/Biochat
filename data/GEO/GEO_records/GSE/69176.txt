TITLE
Epigenome analysis of DNA from umbilical cord blood (UCWBC) in CCCEH birth cohort

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of 152 umbilical cord blood samples from CCCEH birth cohort. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in cord blood samples

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 152 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
