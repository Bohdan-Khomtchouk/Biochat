TITLE
Expression data from osteoblastic lineage cells isolated from normal and leukemic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Multipotent stromal cells (MSC) and their osteoblastic lineage cell (OBC) derivatives are part of the bone marrow (BM) niche and contribute to hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. During myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) development, MSCs are stimulated to overproduce functtionally altered OBCs, which accumulate in the BM cavity as myelofibrotic cells. These MPN-expanded OBCs, in turn, impair the maintenance of normal HSCs but not of leukemic stem cells. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression changes in OBCs during BCR/ABL-induced MPN development, and understand the molecular deregulations contributing to their functional changes.

DESIGN
OBCs were isolated from diseased Scl-tTA::TRE-BCR/ABL (BA) mice and age-match controls around 5-6 weeks post-doxycycline withdrawal. Five independent biological replicate corresponding to single mice were used for each population. RNA was extracted, amplified and hybridized on Affymetrix Gene ST 1.0 microarrays.
