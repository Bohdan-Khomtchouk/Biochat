TITLE
Overexpression of UHRF1 drives DNA hypomethylation and hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
UHRF1 is an essential regulator of DNA methylation that is highly expressed in many cancers. Using transgenic zebrafish, cultured cells and human tumors, we demonstrate that UHRF1 is an oncogene. RNAseq was used to assess the variation in gene expression between control and experimental samples.

DESIGN
Total small RNA from 2 batches of Tg(fabp10:has.UHRF1-GFP)High and age matched Tg(fabp10:nls-mCherry) control 5 dpf zebrafish livers was purified for preparation of high-throughput sequencing libraries.

PLATFORM
GPL14875 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Danio rerio)
