TITLE
Interaction network of Talin-1 in promoting hepatocellular carcinoma progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Talin-1, a macromolecular cytoskeletal protein, promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. However the underlying mechanism of Talin-1 in HCC remains unclear. Analysis of the gene expression profiles of normal control HCC cell (MHCC-97L) and knockdown Talin-1 HCC cells (sh-Talin-1 MHCC-97L).

DESIGN
We analyzed the gene expression proﬁles of normal control HCC cells (MHCC-97L) and knockdown Talin-1 HCC cells (sh-Talin-1 MHCC-97L) using an oligonucleotide microarray, to identify changed genes in knockdown Talin-1 HCC cells comparing with those in normal control HCC cells (MHCC-97L cell).
