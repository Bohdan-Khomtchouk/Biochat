TITLE
Catalytically inactive Ring1B maintains near wildtype levels of gene expression in mESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to determine the extent of gene misregulation in mESCs containing catalytically dead Ring1B in comparison to mESCs lacking Ring1B.

DESIGN
Polyadenylated mRNA was prepared from wildtype mESCs (WT), mESCs deficient for Ring1B (KO) and mESCs cells containing catalytically dead Ring1B (I53A). Each sample is represented by 3 biological replicate hybridisations.
