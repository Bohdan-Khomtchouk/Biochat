TITLE
Expression Analysis of Bisphenol A (0.1 uM), 17beta-estradiol (0.1 uM), and GSK4716 (0.1 uM) Exposure in Embryonic Zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome expression pattern of 24 hours post fertilization Danio rerio embryos exposed to bisphenol A, 17beta-estradiol, GSK4716, or 0.1% DMSO vehicle control

DESIGN
Embryos were exposed to 0.1 uM BPA, 0.1 uM E2, 0.1 uM GSK4716, or control from 8 hpf to 24 hpf. Three biological replicates were collected for each treatment. 40 embryos were pooled to comprise a replicate.
