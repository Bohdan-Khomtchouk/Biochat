TITLE
Transcriptional responses of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) after NIK knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCL lines were treated with or without 100ng/ml doxycycline for 7 days This experiment is designed to see if shRNA-mediated knockdown of NIK downregulates NFKB signaling in MCL lines with mutations in upstream regulators of the alternative pathway (TRAF2 & TRAF3)

DESIGN
MCL cells carrying inducible non-targeting control (NTC) shRNA, NIKshRNA#1 (NIKsh#1), or NIKshRNA#2 (NIKsh#2) were seeded in 6well dishes and treated for 7 days with or without 100ng/ml doxycycline.
