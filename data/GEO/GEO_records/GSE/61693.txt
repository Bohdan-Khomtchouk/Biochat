TITLE
Treatment of MM cells with IMiDs or reducing the expression of EIF2C2 significantly affects steady-state levels of miRNAs

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lenalidomide is a therapeutically active compound that binds to E3 ubiquitin ligase recruiter cereblon (CRBN) and induces cytotoxicity. We have identified eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit C2 (EIF2C2) as a new member of CRBN-downstream binding protein that plays an important role in microRNA (miRNA) maturation and function. The treatment of immunomodulatory drug (IMiD)-sensitive multiple myeloma (MM) cells with lenalidomide altered the steady-state levels of CRBN, EIF2C2 and miRNAs and induced apoptosis. However, although the treatment of IMiD-resistant MM cells with lenalidomide altered the steady-state levels of CRBN, EIF2C2 and miRNAs, but did not massively induce apoptosis. In contrast, silencing of EIF2C2 with its small hairpin RNA significantly altered the levels of miRNAs and induced apoptosis regardless of whether those cells are sensitive or resistant to IMiDs. Therefore, EIF2C2 could be considered as a new drug target for overcoming IMiDs resistance in MM cells.

DESIGN
To find the role of EIF2C2 in MM cell growth, OCI-My5 cell lines My5/LV and My5/CRBN, with low and high CRBN expression, respectively, were treated 12 different ways. The steady-state levels of miRNAs between (1) My5/LV, EIF2C2-shRNA-treated My5/LV and EIF2C2-cDNA-treated My5/LV cells, (2) My5/CRBN, EIF2C2-shRNA-treated My5/CRBN and EIF2C2-cDNA-treated My5/CRBN cells, (3) My5/LV cells, My5/LV cells treated with 10 µM lenalidomide for 72 hours or 120 hours, and EIF2C2-cDNA-treated My5/LV cells treated with 10 µM lenalidomide for 72 hours, and (4) My5/CRBN cells, My5/CRBN cells treated with 10 µM lenalidomide for 72 hours or 120 hours, and EIF2C2-cDNA-treated My5/CRBN cells treated with 10 µM lenalidomide for 72 hours, were compared in this array.
