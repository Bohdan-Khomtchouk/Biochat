TITLE
Identification of the key genes related to oxidation stress tolerance in yeast using RNA-Seq DGE method

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The differentially expressed genes in mutation strain and control strain were analyzed using RNA-Seq DGE method to reveal the mechanism of the oxidation stress tolerance in yeast.

DESIGN
The mutation strain and control strain were grown in SC-Ura medium with or without H2O2. After entering mid-exponential phase, the total RNA were isolated for RNA-Seq to identify the differentially expressed genes. Then the identified genes were enriched to Gene Ontology Database to find the gene functions.Besides, KEGG pathway enrichment were also conducted in this study to explore the related metabolic pathway.
