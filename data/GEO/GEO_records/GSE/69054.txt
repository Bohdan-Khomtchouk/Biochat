TITLE
An Nfic-Hedgehog Signaling Cascade Regulates Tooth Root Development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to perform transcriptome profiling of Nfic-/- and corresponding control tooth germ at root initiation stage to identify differentially expressed for key regulators of root development. Coordination between the Hertwigâ€™s Epithelial Root Sheath (HERS) and apical papilla (AP) is crucial for proper root development process. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway and Nfic are both involved in tooth root development.

DESIGN
mRNA profiling of apical half of tooth germ from 6 pairs of 4-day-old Nfic-/- and littermate Nfic+/- control mice were generated using Illumina Next-Seq 500

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
