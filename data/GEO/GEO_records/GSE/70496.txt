TITLE
Whole genome transcritptional comparison of Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) serotype M1 pre-epidemic and epidemic isolates

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
This transcriptional analysis is a follow up to a population genomic investigation of 3615 Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M1 strains whch are responsible for an epidemic of human invasive infections (www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1403138111), The goal was to assess gene expression differences between predecessor pre-epidemic M1 strains and their descendent epidemic M1 strains to gain insights into the underlying genetic basis for the shift in the frequency and severity of human infections caused by these pathogenic bacteria

DESIGN
The transcriptomes of 7 GAS M1 strains, 4 pre-epidemic and 3 epidemic, were compared at two phases of growth, mid-exponential and early-stationary, using 3 biologial replicates, to identify genes differentially expressed between the pre-epidemic and epidemic isolates with the goal of to gaining insight into the underlying genetic basis for the evolutionary emergence, increased frequency and severity of the epidemic strains relative to the pre-epidemic strains

PLATFORM
GPL20656 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Streptococcus pyogenes)
