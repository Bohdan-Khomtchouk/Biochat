TITLE
Interaction of Wnt signaling with Smad signaling during myogenic differentiation in mouse myoblast cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is involved in various aspects of skeletal muscle development and regeneration. Using C2C12 cells, we examined intracellular signaling and gene transcription during myoblast proliferation and differentiation. The results of the present studies suggest that Wnt signaling is interacting with TGF-beta superfamily signaling through Smad activation.

DESIGN
Single analysis for each condition (proliferating C2C12 cells, differentiating C2C12 cells, proliferating Wnt4-overexpressing C2C12 subline cells).

PLATFORM
GPL5642 3D-Gene Mouse Oligo chip 24k
