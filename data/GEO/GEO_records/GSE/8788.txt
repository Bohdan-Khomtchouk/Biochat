ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to compare the gene expression pattern between wild-type and Trib1-deficient macrophages in response to LPS. Keywords: Comparison of gene expression pattern between Wild-type and Trib1-deficient mice

DESIGN
Two samples to define " LPS-inducible gene " and 4 samples (2 for wild-type and the rests for Trib1-deficient mice) for comparison.
