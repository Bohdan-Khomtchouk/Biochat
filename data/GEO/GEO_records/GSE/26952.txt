TITLE
Expression data for human epithelium from subjects with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and nonatopic controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression and function of tight junction genes, in particular claudin-1, was studied in order to further understanding of the biology underlying atopic dermatitis.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed on total RNA from nonlesional epidermal samples from 5 subjects with atopic dermatitis, 4 subjects with psoriasis, and 5 nonatopic controls using the Illumina Sentrix HumanRef-8 Expression BeadChip.  There were duplicate (technical replicate) arrays run for 2 of the nonatopic control samples (the normalized transformed expression values of replicate pairs were averaged before performing data analysis, also, for each probe, the combined value for replicate pairs of Detection Pvalues was taken to be their minimum - so a Present call for one of the replicate pair of expression values results in a Present call for the combined (average) expression value). Details of the design and the results found are given in the paper associated with this GEO Series.
