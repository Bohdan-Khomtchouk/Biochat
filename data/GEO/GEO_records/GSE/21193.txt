TITLE
The effects of subchronic arsenate exposure on gene expression in the mouse lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Eight week old female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to arsenate in drinking water (50 ppm) for a period of twelve weeks (n = 5).  Control animals received distilled deionized water (n = 5).  Lung tissue was dissected and used for RNA isolation and gene expression microarray analysis.
