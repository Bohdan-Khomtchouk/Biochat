TITLE
Identification of dysregulated genes in lymphocytes from children with Down syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to analyze global changes of gene expression in lymphocytes from children with trisomy 21 by means of the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) methodology. Comparison between DS and normal profiles revealed that most of the transcripts were expressed at similar levels. Among the 242 significantly differentially expressed SAGE tags, many of them corresponded to genes involved in transcription, RNA processing, signaling, immune response and lipid metabolism. Our results indicate that trisomy 21 induces a modest dysregulation of disomic genes that may be related to the immunological perturbations seen in DS. Keywords: SAGE analysis in normal and Down syndrome lymphocytes

DESIGN
Lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of normal and karyotypically confirmed full trisomy 21 children. Children included in the study, ranging in age from 1-4 years, were self reported as free of chronic or acute infections. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The SAGE libraries were constructed using pooled RNA from six DS children (DS library) and six normal children (control group) to eliminate any individual variation. SAGE was performed by means of the I-SAGE kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
