TITLE
Single-cell RNA-seq reveals hypothalamic cell diversity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed single-cell RNA-seq of mouse hypothalamus to reveal the cell diversity of this region.

DESIGN
Hypothalamus of mice (kept in normal condition or food deprivation) were dissected for single-cell RNA-seq through Drop-seq technique.
