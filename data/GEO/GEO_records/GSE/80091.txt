TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and dek10 mutant Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Analysis of  gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that dek10 mutant influences the expression of mitochondrial ETC associated genes. Results provide important information of the gene expression level regulation of mitochondrial envelop, proton transport,translation and genes associated with other biological processes.

DESIGN
Endosperm mRNA profiles of 15DAP wild type (WT) and dek10 mutant were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2500 (Zea mays).
