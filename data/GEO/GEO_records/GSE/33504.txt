TITLE
Role of adhesion receptors in mast cell disease-evolution

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is an incurable neoplasm characterized by abnormal accumulation of neoplastic mast cells (MC) in vascularized organs. In indolent SM, MC express several different adhesion-molecules including CD2 and CD58, and form focal tissue-aggregates, whereas in advanced SM, MC often lack CD2 and produce a more diffuse infiltration-pattern. To explore the functional role of CD2 in the pathology of SM, stable CD2+ and CD2− subclones of the human MC-leukemia cell line HMC-1 were generated and injected intraperitoneally into pfp/rag2 mice. CD2+ HMC-1 cells formed solid mastocytomas in the peritoneum and lungs, whereas CD2− cells produced diffuse infiltration. CD2+ and CD2− HMC-1 subclones all displayed the driver-mutant KIT D816V, exhibited the same growth-kinetics, and displayed identical adhesion-receptors including CD44 and selectin-ligands. To explore the mechanism of organ invasion, E- and P-selectin-deficient scid mice (scid-select) were employed. While massive HMC-1 infiltrates were detected in the lungs of control mice, infiltration was markedly reduced or absent in scid-select mice. The invasion-receptor CD44 was detectable in all MC infiltrates, with most abundant expression in the invasion-front. Together, our data show that selectins mediate organ-invasion of MC and CD2-CD58 interactions contribute to a more focal infiltration-pattern which is lost during progression to MC leukemia.

DESIGN
HMC1 cells were sorted by FACS for expression of CD2 surface expression. 2 subclones were obtained (CD2+ or CD2-) and compared by gene expression profiling using U133 plus 2.0 GeneChips
