TITLE
MafB enhances oncogenic Notch signaling in T-ALL [Microarray]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Notch dependent gene expression in T6E cell line Transcription profiles of Notch signaling active, inactive and recovered were compared

DESIGN
Expression profiling on a set of RNAs obtained from T6E T-ALL cells in which Notch signaling is inhibited (gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI)-treated), is unchanged (DMSO-treated cells) or recovered after being inhibited (GSI treatment was washed out).

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
