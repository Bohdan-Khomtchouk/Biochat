TITLE
MicroRNA-145 Regulates Human Corneal Epithelial Differentiation [Agilent-014850 array data]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the gene expression in human corneal epithelial overexpressing hsa-miR-145 by transfection , we have employed Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray (Agilent) as a screening platform to identify gene regulation. We discovered a differential gene expression in HCE cells transfected with hsa-mIR-145 against cells with scrambled sequences. Among them, genes related with corneal development, integrity, differentiation and inflammatory responses were found and this was validated by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
HCE cells transfected with hsa-miR-145 or scrambled sequences were collected at 24 hours after transfection.  Total RNA was extracted by Trizol/chloroform and purified with RNeasy mini spin column. RNA samples with 28S/18S ratios in the range of 1.4 to 1.8 were used for expression RNA profiling using Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray (Agilent).
