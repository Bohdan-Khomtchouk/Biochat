TITLE
Expression data from 10-days old dark grown Arabidopsis seedlings of wild type (Col-0), sps1 line and L17 line.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In the present work, experiments were carried out to understand the molecular mechanism underlying phyA’ silencing.The EMS-mutagenesis of phyA’ line, L17, generated suppressor mutations that activate phyA’ locus. Detailed study of one suppressor line, sps1, indicated that methylation of specific CG site within the phyA coding region is critical for maintaining phyA’ silencing. In order to study the possible genomic targets of the putative SPS1 factor, microarray analysis using ATH1 genome array chip was done on sps1, L17 and Col-0.

DESIGN
9 samples in total were analyzed. Each line (WT, sps1, L17) were analyzed in triplicate.
