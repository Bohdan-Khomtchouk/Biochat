SUMMARY
To screen the genes regulated by wt-Snail and non-acetylated Snail The successful development of cancer metastasis requires two major events: the reprogramming of cancer cells to increase their migration and tumor-initiation capabilities; and the remodeling of the tumor microenvironment to facilitate invasion and colonization of cancer cells. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial mechanism for reprogramming cancer cells to possess tumor initiation and migration capabilities1,2. However, the role of EMT in the interplay between tumor and host cells is largely unknown. The EMT regulator Snail is mainly known as a transcriptional repressor of the adhesion protein E-cadherin, whose repression is considered to be a key step in initiating metastasis3,4. We previously found that Snail can also act as an activator that induces the transcription of ERCC15 and IL86. Here we show that Snail is acetylated by CREB-binding protein (CBP) and that Snail and CBP co-occupy the promoters of target genes to activate transcription of the target genes. Furthermore, Snail activates the expression of a panel of cytokine genes, including TNFa (which forms a positive feedback loop with Snail to amplify the signal) and CCL2 and CCL5 (which facilitate the recruitment of macrophages by cancer cells). Our results demonstrate a novel function for Snail, providing new understanding of the recruitment of host cells to tumor sites during metastatic evolution.

DESIGN
Establish stable transfectants of pCDH-Snail and  pCDH-Snail2R in FaDu cells and analyze the mRNA expression level of  by cDNA microarray. FaDu transfected with pCDH vector was used as a control experiment.
