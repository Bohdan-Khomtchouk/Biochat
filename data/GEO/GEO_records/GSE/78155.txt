TITLE
Deciphering targets of CD271-dependent signaling processes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression profiling of stably NGFR transfected melanoma cells was used to identify genes driven by expression of the nerve growth factor receptor CD271 (NGFR).

DESIGN
Stable overexpression of NGFR (CD271): Generation of cell lines stably overexpressing CD271 (NGFR), melanoma cells were transfected with 2 µg of a plasmid expressing GFP-tagged human NGFR (RG207966, OriGene) and selected with G418 (100-300 µg/ml, PAA) over a period of two weeks followed by sub-cloning or FACS. Gene expression profiling: Whole genome expression profiling of T20/02 and A375 cells (NGFR) and control cells (Mock or GFP) was performed with three biological replicates. Illumina raw data of BeadChip HumanHT-12V4 platform were summarized via the BeadStudio without normalization and background correction. Follow-up processing was done via the R/Bioconductor environment employing packages lumi, limma and q-value. Data were normalized with quantile normalization. Genes were termed significantly differentially expressed when the average detection p-value of at least one case was < 0.05  the ratio was outside the interval [0.75,1.33], one of the p-values from limma test, Student's t-test, Welch test and Wilcoxon test was < 0.05. At least one of the q-values corresponding to one of these tests < 0.05.
