TITLE
polyA mRNA RNA-seq from SK-MEL-5 (ENCSR201WVA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from nuclear fractions of a malignant melonoma immortalized cell line SK-MEL-5 derived from a metastatic axillary node of a 24 year old female. They are stranded PE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted Poly-A+ RNA > 200 nucleotides in size.
