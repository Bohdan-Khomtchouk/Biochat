TITLE
Allele specific gene expression in tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This set of data was used to identify cis-regulatory SNPs by measuring allelic gene expression. From analyzing cis-regulatory SNPs from different tissues,  cis-regulatory SNPs common across tissues or the cell-type specific  were cataloged.

DESIGN
International Hapmap Project - Yoruba samples, genotypes and allele ratios were obtained using Illumina HumanOmni 1M Beadchips. CEU Samples, genotypes and allele ratios were obtained using Illumina Human1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChip (Human1M-Duov3_B)

PLATFORM
GPL6983 Illumina Human1Mv1 DNA Analysis BeadChip (Human1Mv1_C) GPL6984 Illumina Human1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChip (Human1M-Duov3_B)
