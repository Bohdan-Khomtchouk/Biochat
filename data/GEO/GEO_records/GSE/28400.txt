TITLE
MIR-204 target genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to discover genes regulated by miR-204. Differential gene expression in HEK-293 cells transfected with miR-204-mimic compared to HEK-293 cells transfected with control oligo (HEK-293 control) was analyzed using the Agilent Human Whole Genome 4x44K gene expression array (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
