TITLE
Affymetrix Oncoscan array data for aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC) samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancers with clinical features of small cell prostate carcinomas (SCPC) but diverse morphologies share chemotherapy responsiveness with SCPC. We prospectively collected tumor tissues from clinically defined, morphologically diverse, aggressive variant prostate cancers (AVPCa) to determine if they also share molecular features with SCPC

DESIGN
59 prostate cancer samples from 40 men (10 with SCPC) registered to clinical trial NCT00514540, and 8 PDX from 6 of them, were stained for RB, p53, AR, NKX3-1, ASCL1, AURKA, UBE2C and Ki67. We determined copy number alterations (CNA) by OncoscanÂ® using DNA from 36 of the 59 samples and 8 PDX lines.
