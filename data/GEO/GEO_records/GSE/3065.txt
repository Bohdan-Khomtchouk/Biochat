TITLE
Gene inductions in response to BCR-crosslinking in TAK1-deficient B cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BCR-induced gene expression profile in wild-type and B cell-specific TAK1-deficient B cells; to elucidate how TAK1 regulates BCR-mediated proliferative response Keywords: ordered

DESIGN
Purified splenic B cells (CD43 negative) were treated with or without anti-IgM (20 micloG/mL) for 4 h. Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen), double-stranded DNA was synthesized from 10 micloG of total RNA with the SuperScript Choice System (Invitrogen) primed with T7-(dT) 24 primer. These cDNAs were used to prepare biotin-labeled cRNA by an in vitro transcription reaction performed using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of biotinylated-ribonucleotides, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Enzo Diagnostics). The cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy kit, fragmented, and hybridized to Affymetrix mouse expression array A430.2 microarray chips, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Affymetrix). The hybridized chips were stained, washed, and scanned with a GeneArray Scanner (Affymetrix).
