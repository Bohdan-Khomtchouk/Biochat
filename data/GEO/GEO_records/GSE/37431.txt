TITLE
Endothelial cell-enriched genes expression in mouse embryo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The early blood vessels of the embryo and yolk sac in mammals develop by aggregation of de novo forming angioblasts into a primitive vascular plexus, which then undergoes a complex remodeling process. Angiogenesis is also important for disease progression in the adult. However, the precise molecular mechanism of vascular development remains unclear. It is therefore of great interest to determine which genes are specifically expressed in developing endothelial cells.Here, we utilized Flk1-deficient mouse embryos, which lack endothelial cells, to perform a genome-wide survey for genes related to vascular development.

DESIGN
Wild type (WT), Flk1+/GFP and Flk1 KO embryos proper (fetuses) were dissected out at 8.5 dpc. Total RNAs from these embryos were prepared using RNeasy kit. Gene expression analysis was performed by GeneSpring software.
