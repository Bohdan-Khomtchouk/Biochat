TITLE
TERTÂ  rearrangements are frequent in neuroblastoma and identify aggressive tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome sequencing detected structural rearrangements of TERT in 17/75 high stage neuroblastoma with 5 cases resulting from chromothripsis. Rearrangements were associated with increased TERT expression and targeted immediate up- and down-stream regions of TERT, placing in 7 cases a super-enhancer close to the breakpoints. TERT rearrangements (23%), ATRX deletions (11%) and MYCN amplifications (37%) identify three almost non-overlapping groups of high stage neuroblastoma, each associated with very poor prognosis

DESIGN
34 human Neuroblastoma samples were analyzed
