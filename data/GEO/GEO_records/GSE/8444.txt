TITLE
Genes in nonpermissive temperature-induced cell growth arrest and differentiation of tracheal epithelial RTEC11 cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We performed global scale microarray analysis to identify detailed mechanisms by which nonpermissive temperature induces cell growth arrest and differentiation in tracheal epithelial RTEC11 cells harboring temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen by using an Affymetrix GeneChip system. Tracheal epithelial RTEC11 cells used in this study were derived from transgenic rats harboring a temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen. Although the cells grew continuously at the permissive temperature, the nonpermissive temperature led to cell growth arrest and differentiation. Keywords: rat tracheal epithelial RTEC11; growth arrest; differentiation; gene expression
