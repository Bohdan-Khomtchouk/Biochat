TITLE
Transcription profiling of Brassica lines

ORGANISM
Brassica

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of Brassica rapa, Brassica oleracea and Brassica napus I and II The nuclear genomes of the resynthesised B. napus lines should be identical but, as one (B. napus I) involved a cross of B. oleracea onto B. rapa, and the other (B. napus II) involved a cross of B rapa onto B. oleracea, they differ in cytoplasm, and hence contain different chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes.
