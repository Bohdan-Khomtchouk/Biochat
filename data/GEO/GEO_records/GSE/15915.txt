TITLE
Transcription profiling of Brassica lines

ORGANISM
Brassica napus ; Brassica rapa ; Brassica oleracea

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of Brassica rapa, Brassica oleracea and Brassica napus I and II The nuclear genomes of the resynthesised B. napus lines should be identical but, as one (B. napus I) involved a cross of B. oleracea onto B. rapa, and the other (B. napus II) involved a cross of B rapa onto B. oleracea, they differ in cytoplasm, and hence contain different chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment, comparison of transcription profiles of the genomes. Four biological replicates were used, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
