TITLE
Evaluation of sub-culturing on whole genome expression of skeletal muscle-derived cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Today, cell therapy is considered as one of the most promising alternates to cure end-stage diseases. Using human cells for transplantation needs in vitro culture and passages which arises the concern of malignant transformation of cells. To evaluate the effect of sub-culturing on whole genome transcriptome of skeletal muscle-derived cells (SMDCs), microarray analysis was performed on passages 3, 6, 9 and 12 of SMDCs in three replicates.

DESIGN
There were 4 different passage samples (3, 6, 9, and 12) each stage with three replicates. Replicates for passage 3 were determined as control group and the data was analyzed compared to this passage.
