TITLE
Trancriptional profiling of Bacillus subtilis BsB1 and NCIB3610 rho-deletion mutant

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
With these experiments we investigate the impact of the deletion of the gene encoding transcription termination Rho on the transcriptomes of two different Bacillus subtilis strains, BsB1 and NCIB3610. The results confirm massive increase of antisense transcription initially observed with tiling arrays in B. subtilis strain 1012 (Nicolas et al. 2012; PMID:22383849; GSE27303).

DESIGN
The rho-deletion associated with a phelomycin resistance cassette  from Bacillus subtilis 1012 rho :phleo (described in Nicolas et al. 2012) was introduced into Bacillus subtilis BsB1 and NCIB3610 backgrounds by natural competence and SPP1-mediated transduction, respectively.  Mutant and parental backgrounds of these two strains were subjected to stranded RNA-Seq profiling. A total of 6 biological samples were examined (biological duplicates for NCIB3610).
