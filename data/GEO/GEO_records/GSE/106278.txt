TITLE
The genomic landscape of the fungal specific SWI/SNF complex subunit, Snf6, in Candida albicans

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
We have focused our investigation on the characterization of the role of the fungal specific SWI/SNF subunit, Snf6. Our data show that, although the C. albicans subunit has only limited sequence similarity to other fungal orthologs, Snf6 was copurified with SWI/SNF complex subunits including the catalytic ATPase subunit, Snf2. We show that Snf6 plays a critical role in biological processes that are essential for fungal pathogenesis including carbon metabolic flexibility, stress response and morphogenesis. The Snf6 regulon was determined by combining both genome-wide location (ChIP-chip) and transcriptional profiling (microarrays) to identify targets of the SWI/SNF complex under both yeast- and hyphal-promoting conditions.

DESIGN
We performed genome wide occupancy experiments (YPD, 30oC and YPD, 37oC ) with Snf6p  to determine their binding sites. To complement with genome wide occupancy experiments, we performed a transcription profile with an snf6 Grace strain under yeast and hyphae conditions (YPD+/- tet, 30oC and YPD+10%serum +/- tet , 37oC ).
