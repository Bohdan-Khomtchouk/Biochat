TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Vancomycin resistance in Stapyloccoccus aureus strains: PA, C1 and T8.

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
The study aims to identify genes associated with Vancomycin resistance. Wild type and a mutant cells line were treated with antibiotic at multiple concentrations and RNA samples  extracted over a two hour time course.Staphylococcus aureus strain PA is the reference for this series.

DESIGN
Wild type and a mutant cells line were treated with antibiotic at multiple concentrations and RNA samples  extracted over a two hour time course. Samples were hybridized on aminosilane coated slides with 70-mer oligos.

PLATFORM
GPL10597 JCVI PFGRC Staphylococcus aureus 16K v9 array designed primarily based on strain USA300
