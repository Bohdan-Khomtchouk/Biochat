TITLE
Tau promotes neurodegeneration through global chromatin relaxation

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We performed H3K9me2-based ChIP-seq to identify regions of the Drosophila genome that are H3K9me2-depleted due to transgenic neuronal expression of human mutant tau.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K9me2 histone methylation in 10 day old control and tau transgenic Drosophila heads.

PLATFORM
