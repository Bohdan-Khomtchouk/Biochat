TITLE
Role of coactivator SRC-1/NcoA-1 for IL-6 target gene induction in HepG2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment series addresses the role of coactivator SRC-1/NcoA-1 for the induction of interleukin-6 (IL-6) target genes in HepG2 cells. For that purpose, HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells were manipulated to stably express an shRNA that knocks down SRC-1 expression yielding the HepG2-∆Src1 cells. Either unmanipulated HepG2 or HepG2-∆Src1 cells were then treated for various periods with IL-6. Keywords: time course, genetic modification

DESIGN
HepG2 or HepG2-∆Src1 (with silenced SRC-1/NcoA-1 expression) cells were either left untreated or treated with 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 1 or 4 hours. Every experiment was carried out in replicate.
