ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective:To identify an accurate blood-based gene signature for early detection of Kashin-Beck disease (KBD). Methods: Gene expression analysis was conducted of peripheral blood samples from 100 patients with KBD and 100 controls randomly chosen from two KBD-endemic areas

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Control vs. KBD PBM cells. Biological replicates: 100 control replicates, 100 KBD replicates.
