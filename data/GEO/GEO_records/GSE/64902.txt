TITLE
Extra-coding RNAs regulate neuronal DNA methylation and long-term memory formation [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This dataset contains whole-genome RNA sequencing results from cortical neuronal cultures and serves as the basis for characterization of extra-coding RNA species from neuronal systems.

DESIGN
This experiment contains six biological samples, each of which underwent PolyA+ and PolyA- RNA-seq. Samples were either unstimulated (i.e., treated with media alone; samples V1 and V2), stimulated with 25mM potassium chloride for 1hr (K1, K2) or inactivated with tetrodotoxin for 1hr (T1, T2). Datasets were obtained using RNA-seq from PolyA+ fractions or PolyA- fractions of RNA. PolyA- fractions are denoted " ec " . Thus, 12 samples are listed here due to the difference in RNA library preparation.
