TITLE
ENCODE ChIP-chip for Tetra-acetylated Histone H4 on GM06990 Cells [unpublished]

ORGANISM
Pilot ENCODE

SUMMARY
Tetra-acetylated Histone H4 ChIP-chip performed on GM06990 cells for Nimblegen ENCODE arrays which comprise 50mer oligonucleotides spaces every 38bps (overlapping by 12nts). Goal was to identify acetylated Histone H4-binding regions. Use of this data requires permission from its producers. Keywords: ChIP-chip
