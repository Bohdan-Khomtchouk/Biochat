TITLE
ENCODE ChIP-chip for Tetra-acetylated Histone H4 on GM06990 Cells [unpublished]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tetra-acetylated Histone H4 ChIP-chip performed on GM06990 cells for Nimblegen ENCODE arrays which comprise 50mer oligonucleotides spaces every 38bps (overlapping by 12nts). Goal was to identify acetylated Histone H4-binding regions. Use of this data requires permission from its producers. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
DNA from immunoprecipitated chromatin using acetyl-Histone H4 antibody or normal rabbit IgG was hybridized to a Nimblegen ENCODE tiling array containing overlapping 50nt oligonucleotide probes. Samples are three biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL2533 Nimblegen ENCODE tiling array (HG17) with 50mer probe at 38bp interval for RenLab
