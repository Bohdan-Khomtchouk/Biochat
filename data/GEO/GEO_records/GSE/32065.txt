TITLE
Expression analysis of both total and polysomal mRNAs under drought, salt and cold stress conditions

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Using 3â€²-tiling microarray covering the rice genes, we carried out genome-wide expression analyses of total and polysome-fractionated samples treated with drought, salt and cold at 2-week-old rice leaves. compared to non-treated negative control (NC) samples. Our study is the first report which elucidated the global alternation of polysome association in response to abiotic stress.

DESIGN
A total of 24 chips were used for microarray. At 2h, total and polysomal RNAs were extracted from drought, salt and cold at 2-week-old rice leaves with three biological replicates.
