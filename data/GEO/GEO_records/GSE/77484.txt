TITLE
miR-seq to define mature miRNAs in human HEK293T cells that are targeted for degradation by the endonuclease Tudor-SN (i.e. by TumiD).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that human Tudor-SN degrades particular miRNAs that contain CA or UA dinucleotides located more than five nucleotides from miRNA ends.

DESIGN
We defined miRNAs that are degraded by Tudor-SN by performing miR-seq on RNA isolated from HEK293T cells transiently transfected with Tudor-SN siRNA or, as a control, Control (Ctl) siRNA.
