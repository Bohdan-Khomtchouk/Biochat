TITLE
MPA and NQO studies (Sevilla)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
RNA polymerases deal with obstacles during transcription elongation that need to be removed. One important type of hindrance consists of DNA lesions, which are removed by transcription-coupled repair (TCR). To improve our knowledge of transcription elongation and its coupling to TCR, we performed DNA microarray experiments and used the yeast library of nonessential knock-out mutations to screen for genes conferring resistance to the transcription-elongation inhibitor micophenolic acid and the DNA-damaging agent 4- nitroquinoline-N-oxide.

DESIGN
A single sample for each treatment was analyzed.
