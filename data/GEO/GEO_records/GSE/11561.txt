SUMMARY
RNA polymerases deal with obstacles during transcription elongation that need to be removed. One important type of hindrance consists of DNA lesions, which are removed by transcription-coupled repair (TCR). To improve our knowledge of transcription elongation and its coupling to TCR, we performed DNA microarray experiments and used the yeast library of nonessential knock-out mutations to screen for genes conferring resistance to the transcription-elongation inhibitor micophenolic acid and the DNA-damaging agent 4- nitroquinoline-N-oxide.
