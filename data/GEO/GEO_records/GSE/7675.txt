TITLE
Early transcriptional responses induced by benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide in human amnion epithelial FL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genotoxic agents cause cellular DNA damage and stress responses, including transcriptional changes. Here we focused on the early transcriptional responses of human cells to benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), which causes bulky DNA adduct damage. Human amnion epithelial FL cells were exposed to three doses of BPDE (5, 50, and 500 nM) and the vehicle control DMSO, and differential gene expression profiles were obtained 4 h after exposure using oligonucleotide microarrays followed by validation with quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Compared with a few genes affected by the low and medium-dose exposure, extensive and robust changes in gene expression were induced by the high-dose BPDE. We found that the expression of cell cycle-regulators, signaling molecules and transcription factors were significantly altered and important signaling pathways related to cell survival or apoptosis were affected by BPDE. Several genes and related regulatory pathways that were previously not known to be responsive to this genotoxic agent have now been implicated, which helps to draw the whole picture of how cells respond to environmental chemical exposure via transcriptional regulation. Keywords: Dose response

DESIGN
Human amnion epithelial FL cells were exposed to vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide) and increasing doses (5, 50, 500 nM) of anti-benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (anti-BPDE), respectively. The transcriptomes of the three treatments were compared to that of the control, respectively, to test the hypothesis that a characterized differential expression profile would be generated by exposure to various doses of this genotoxic agent.
