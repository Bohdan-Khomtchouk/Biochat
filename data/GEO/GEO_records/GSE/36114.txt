TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of histone modification, protein-DNA binding, cytosine methylation and transcriptome data in mouse and human ES cells and pig iPS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Sus scrofa ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of histone modification (H2AZ, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3 and H3K9me3), protein-DNA binding (TAF1, P300, Pou5f1  and Nanog), cytosine methylation and transcriptome data in mouse and human ES cells and pig iPS cells We generated histone modification data (H2AZ, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3 and H3K9me3) and protein-DNA binding data (TAF1, P300, Pou5f1  and Nanog) using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by short sequencing (ChIP-seq), cytosine methylation data using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and DNA digestion by methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes followed by sequencing (MRE-seq), transcriptome data with RNA short sequencing (RNA-seq) in human embryonic stem cells, mouse embryonic stem cells, pig induced pluripotent stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells under activin-A-induced-differentiation.

DESIGN
Examination of 8 histone modifications, 4 protein-DNA binding, cytosine methylation and transcriptome in human embryonic stem cells, mouse embryonic stem cells, pig induced pluripotent stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells under activin-A-induced-differentiation.
