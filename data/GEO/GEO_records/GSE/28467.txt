TITLE
Abrogation of WNT signaling by dominant-negative TCF4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess cellular changes upon abrogation of the WNT-signaling pathway, we induced expression of a dominant-negative T-cell factor 4 (TCF4). This showed a remarkable overlap with activation of the unfolded protein response (UTR) in the same colon cancer cell line.

DESIGN
500,000 cells were plated in a 10 cm2 plate, and the following day, treated for 20 hrs with doxycycline (Dox) or vehicle. Three independent biological replicates per treatment.
