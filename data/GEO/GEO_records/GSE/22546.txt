TITLE
Breast cancer MCF-7 Cells and MDA-MB-435 cells: pre-miR-125b Transfected cells vs. pre-control transfected cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of breast cancer cells comparing pre-control transfected cells with cells transfected with pre-miR-125b. We searched for miR-125b targets by systematic screening of mRNA profiling of pre-miR-125b transfected MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-435 cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, pre-miR-125b Transfected vs. pre-control Transfected MCF-7 cells. One replicate per array.
