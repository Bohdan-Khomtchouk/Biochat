TITLE
Expression data from thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from 129S6/SvEvTac and DBA2/J mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Strain differences influence susceptibility to atherosclerosis. Apolipoprotein E-null mice on a DBA/2J genetic background (DBA-apoE) are highly susceptible to atherosclerosis in the aortic root area compared with those on a 129S6/SvEvTac background (129-apoE). To explore strain-specific differences affecting the susceptibility to atherosclerosis, we performed microarray analysis of macrophages from wild type mice of each strains.

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from 3-month-old male and female 129S6/SvEvTac and DBA2/J mice after the intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate medium.
