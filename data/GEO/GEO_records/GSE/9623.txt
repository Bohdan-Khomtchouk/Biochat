TITLE
Profiling the asexual development transcriptome of the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans

ORGANISM
Phytophthora infestans

SUMMARY
Much of the pathogenic success of Phytophthora infestans, the potato and tomato late blight agent, relies on its ability to generate from mycelia large amounts of sporangia, which release zoospores that encyst and form infection structures. To better understand these critical stages, Affymetrix GeneChips based on 15,650 unigenes were designed and used to profile the life cycle, through an analysis of RNA from hyphae, sporangia, cleaving sporangia, motile zoospores, and germinated zoospore cysts. Keywords: Developmental study

DESIGN
Gene expression in non-sporulating hyphae, asexual sporangia, sporangia undergoing cleavage, swimming zoospores, and germinated cysts containing appressoria were characterized using isolate 88069. Several strategies controlled for experimental error. Firstly, two replicate hybridizations were used for each tissue type. Secondly, RNAs for the two replicates were prepared by research groups in North America and/or Europe. Thirdly, RNA for each hybridization was pooled from two or three independent cultures made by that group. Finally, before using an RNA sample in an experiment the expression of selected well-characterized genes was measured to ensure that the tissue was properly prepared.
