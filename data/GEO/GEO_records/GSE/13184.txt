TITLE
Effect of  SAICAR accumulation on global transcription

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of SAICAR accumulation on transcriptional regulation of purine biosynthesis and other metabolic pathways. These data were compared to those obtained in the ade16ade17 vs WT comparison to determine the effects associated to accumulation of SAICAR alone. In this work, global transcription analyses were combined to measurements of intracellular nucleotides pools by HPLC. Keywords: Comparative genomic transcription analysis on total RNA from cells accumulating or not SAICAR.
