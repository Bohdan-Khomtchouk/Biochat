TITLE
leaf transcriptome comparison between wt and pnm1dnls plants-CNRS12-07_PNM1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs12-07_pnm1 - leaf transcriptome comparison between wt and pnm1dnls plants - Identification of nuclear genes regulated by PNM1 (At5g60960) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mature rosettte leaf transcriptomes were compared between WT and PNM1DNLS mutants.

DESIGN
3 dye-swap - normal vs transgenic comparaison

PLATFORM
GPL15719 INRA-CNRS-UEVE Arabidopsis thaliana 73K CATMAv6-HD12 [100701_Athal_CATMA6_SB_exp]
