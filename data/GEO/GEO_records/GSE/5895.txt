TITLE
Pluripotency governed by Sox2 via regulation of Oct3/4 expression in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize the differentiation by Sox2 KO, we performed microarray analyses of mouse ES cell line 2TS22C during the time-course being induced of Sox2 KO Keywords: development or differentiation design,time series design

DESIGN
Inducible Sox2 KO cell line 2TS22C were assigned to eight experimental groups and cultured in GMEM medium (SIGMA) with LIF at 37Â°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 until the specified time point before the harvest: (1)for controls, cultured in the absence of Tc; (2) for 3h after the administration of Tc; (3) for 6h; (4) for 12h; (5) for 24h; (6) for 48h; (7) for 72h; (8) for 96h.
