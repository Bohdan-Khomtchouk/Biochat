TITLE
Small RNA profile in E18.5 fetal liver from wild type and Ago2 catalytically inactive mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Examination of miRNAs in fetal liver revealed a loss of miR-451, a small RNA important for erythropoiesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated and size-fractionated by PAGE into 19-30nt. These were processed and sequenced on Illumina GA2 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
