TITLE
Analysis of genes overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Six pairs of hepatocellular carcinoma and their corresponding non-tumrous liver parenchymas were analyzed to identify the genes differentially expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and nontumorous liver parenchyma.

DESIGN
We analyzed mRNA expression pattern of 6 primary hepatocellular carcinomas and their corresponding nontumourous liver parenchyma. The specimens were obtained from a tissue bank in our hospital. All the clinical informations were de-linked from the specimens.
