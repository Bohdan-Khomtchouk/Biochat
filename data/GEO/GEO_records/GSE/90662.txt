TITLE
ChIP-Seq of constitutively expressed Ndt80-Myc in K. lactis

ORGANISM
Kluyveromyces lactis

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to identify the genes bound by Ndt80 in K. lactis when constitutively expressed. Ndt80 was tagged with c-myc, the native Ndt80 promoter was replaced with the K. lactis Gal1 promoter and the protein was immunoprecipitated with a c-myc antibody.  Cells were grown overnight in SRaffinose until log-phase, then in SRaffinose + 1.7% Galactose for 5 hours.  Each experiment was repeated twice and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000.

DESIGN
K.lactis Ndt80-myc vs. untagged control, with two technical replicates for each
