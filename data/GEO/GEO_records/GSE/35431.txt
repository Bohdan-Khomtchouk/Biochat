TITLE
Caveolin-1 knockout liver and gonadal adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA expression was compared in between wild type and caveolin-1 knockout livers mRNA expression was compared in between wild type and caveolin-1 knockout gonadal adipose tissue

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from livers from male mice in at the light phase RNA was isolated from gonadal adipose tissues from male mice in at the light phase
