TITLE
RNA clamping by Vasa assembles a piRNA Amplifier complex on transposon transcripts

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
Germline-specific Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) protect the genome against selfish  genetic elements and are essential for fertility in animals. piRNAs targeting active  transposons are amplified by a feed-forward loop known as the Ping-pong cycle, which  links endonucleolytic slicing of target RNAs by Piwi proteins to biogenesis of new  piRNAs. However, the biochemical framework for this pathway remains elusive. Here,  we describe the identification of a transient Amplifier complex mediating the biogenesis  of secondary piRNAs in insect cells. This complex is nucleated by the RNA helicase  Vasa and contains the two Piwi proteins participating in the Ping-pong loop, the Tudor  protein Qin/Kumo and antisense piRNA guides. These components assemble on the  surface of Vasa's helicase domain, which functions as an RNA clamp to anchor  Amplifier onto transposon transcripts. We show that ATP-dependent RNP remodelling  by Vasa facilitates the transfer of 5'-sliced piRNA precursors between the Ping-pong  partners, and failure to achieve this results in Drosophila female sterility.

DESIGN
Immunoprecipitated small RNA were purified from untransfected or transfected Bmn4 cells for preparation of high-throughput sequencing libraries.
