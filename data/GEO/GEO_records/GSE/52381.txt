TITLE
Effect of mmu-miR-193b-3p and miR-365a-3p ectopic expression on the transcriptome of mouse cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mouse mSCC-20 cell line was transfected with 5nM of mmu-pre-miR-193b-3p, pre-miR-365a-3p or pre-miR-NC1. Total RNAs were extracted 30 h after transfection and hybridized on microarrays.

DESIGN
One color experiment with 3 experimental conditions : miR-NC1- (n=4), miR-193b-3p- (n=2) and miR-365-3p- (n=2) transfected cells, corresponding to a total of 8 samples.

PLATFORM
