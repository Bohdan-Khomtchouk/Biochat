TITLE
Molecular characterization of murine IFN producing killer dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IKDCs have been newly characterized in mouse and shared functional and phenotypic properties of NK cells and dendritic cells. To formaly distinguish them from NK cells, we have performed a gene expression profile analysis of splenic and LN cell sorted IKDC and compared them with CDC and NK.We are looking for gene or group of genes specifically expressed by IKDCs and which would allow us to specifically isolate and characterize them. Keywords: Freshly isolated cells

DESIGN
IKDC, NK and CDC were cell-sorted from spleen and lymph node (LN) of na√Øve BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks).
