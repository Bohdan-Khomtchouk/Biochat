TITLE
Effect of a myofiber-specific HIRA conditional knockout on gene expression in mouse skeletal muscle at 6 months of age

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression profiling by microarray using RNA extracted from the tibialis anterior of control and Hira myofiber-specific conditional knockout mice at 6 months of age.  Hira is a histone chaperone responsible for replication-independent incorporation of histone variant H3.3 at actively transcribed loci.  Conditional knockout of Hira in myofibers improved strength and endurance, caused hypertrophy and regeneration, and increased the percentage of type I fibers.  These results illustrate the physiological consequences of disrupting Hira-mediated chromatin assembly in myofibers.

DESIGN
4 animals per group (control and Hira conditional knockout) hybridized in triplicate.  RNA was extracted from the tibialis anterior muscle.
