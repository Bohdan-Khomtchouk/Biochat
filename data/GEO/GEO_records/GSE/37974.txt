TITLE
Expression analysis of Streptococcus pyogenes MGAS315 induced with XIP pheromone

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes MGAS315

SUMMARY
Whole genome expression profile comparing MGAS315 treated with XIP pheromone versus vehicle-treated cells Interpretations are described further in the manuscript to be submitted: authors Mashburn-Warren, Morrison, and Federle. Title: The Cryptic Competence Pathway in Streptococcus pyogenes is Controlled by a Peptide Pheromone.

DESIGN
A two chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate cultures of Streptococcus pyogenes MGAS315, each treated with either XIP pheromone or with vehicle; RNA preparation of cultures receiving same type of treatment were pooled using equivalent amounts of RNA from each culture. RNA pools were fluorescently labeled and hybridized to arrays designed to the S. pyogenes NZ131 genome.
