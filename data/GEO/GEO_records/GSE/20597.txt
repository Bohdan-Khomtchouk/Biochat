Gene expression profile of STAT3 in ovarian cancer cell (SKOV3ip1)

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA interference (RNAi) holds tremendous potential as a therapeutic approach, especially in the treatment of malignant tumors. However, efficient and biocompatible delivery methods are needed for systemic delivery of siRNA. To achieve this goal, we have established a novel formulation of siRNA by incorporating it into reconstituted high density lipoprotein (rHDL) nanoparticles. Here, we demonstrate that rHDL nanoparticles facilitate highly efficient systemic delivery of siRNA in vivo, mediated by the scavenger receptor type B1 (SR-B1). Moreover, in therapeutic proof-of-concept studies, these nanoparticles were effective in targeting either signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) or focal adhesion kinase (FAK) expression in orthotopic mouse models of ovarian and colorectal cancer. These data indicate that an rHDL nanoparticle is a novel and highly efficient siRNA carrier, and therefore this novel technology could serve as the foundation for new cancer therapeutic approaches.

DESIGN
To identify the role of STAT3 in ovarian cancer cell, we performed microarray after knocking down STAT3 in ovarican cancer cells (3 siCon and 3 siSTAT3).
