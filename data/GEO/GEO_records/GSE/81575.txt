TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of 23116 MT (low Arid1a expression) vs AB-C1 and AB-C2 (high Arid1a expression) Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify important genetic pathways that are altered in mammary tumor cells upon over-expression of the tumor suppressor gene Arid1a. The results of this experiment revealed that Arid1a helps regulate key cell-cycle checkpoint and growth regulatory pathways, either directly or indirectly. This helped explain in part the significant decrease in cell proliferation and tumor growth phenotypes observed both in vitro and in vivo, when comparing the same samples analyzed here by RNA-seq (untransduced replicates vs. add-back clonal lines).

DESIGN
Whole transcriptome comparison of mammary tumor cells derived from Chaos3 mouse model (23116 MT- control) vs. add-back clones overexpressing Arid1a (AB-C1 & AB-C2 - exp). Control and experimental samples were run in duplicate.
