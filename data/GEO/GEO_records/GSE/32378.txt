TITLE
Gene expression analysis of chickens (Gallus gallus) infected with recombinant influenza viruses

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
H5N1 subtype highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has been spreading to Asia, Eurasia and African coutries. An original or six of recombinant H5N1 subtype influenza viruses with varying survivability were infected to chickens for elucidating genes correlated with pathogenicity.

DESIGN
Two chickens were infected with each 10^6EID50/ head virus intranasally, and their lung was collected from infected chicken at 24 hours after infection.
