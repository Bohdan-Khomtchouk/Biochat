TITLE
Analysis of miR-143/145 wild-type and null mouse intestinal myofibroblasts before and after LPS stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In a series of mouse genetic studies, we concluded that miR-143/145 expression in intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) promotes epithelial regeneration after DSS-mediated injury in the colon. This experiment aims to identify miR-143/145 target genes that are involved in this function. We generated primary ISEMFs from wildtype and miR-143/145 null mouse colons and analyzed their gene expression profile. We further subjected ISEMFs to LPS treatment, in order to measure gene expression changes that are only revealed after inflammatory stress.

DESIGN
Three wild-type and three miR-143/145 null ISEMF cell lines were isolated from mouse colons. Cells were treated with or without 1 ug/mL LPS for 24 hours and total RNA was isolated.  Gene expression was profiled using Illumina microarrays.
