TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Cic binding sites in intestinal stem cells (ISCs)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Purpose: Cic is a transcription factor regulating intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation as downstream effector of EGFR signaling pathway. ISC-specific mRNA expression profiling and DNA binding mapping using DamID were performed to identify potential target of Cic. Methods: Total RNA was isolated from GFP+ FACS sorted cells and sent for sequencing after amplification. Conclusions: We identified potential target genes of Cic, which is differetially expressed in Cic depleted ISCs and also associated Cic binding peaks.

DESIGN
4 biological replicates were performed for RNA-Seq, and 2 biological replicates were performed for Cic DamID-Seq and Cic DamID-Seq after infection.
