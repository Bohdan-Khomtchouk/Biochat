TITLE
RAMPAGE from smooth muscle cell (ENCSR337VPD)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from H9-derived embryonic stem cells that were differentiated down a smooth muscle pathway. They are stranded PE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RAMPAGE libraries from rRNA-depleted Total RNA > 200 nucleotides in size.
