TITLE
Long noncoding RNAs/mRNAs expression profiling for 10 human HCC samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the lncRNA expression profile in HCC and matched non-tumor tissues, we used lncRNA microArray analysis form Arraystar to examine the expression of lncRNAs in HCC and matched non-tumor tissues. Goal was to determine the different gene expression between HCC and matched noncancerous tissue.

DESIGN
Tissue based experiment: 5 HCC tissue, 5 matched noncancerous tissue

PLATFORM
GPL21827 Agilent-079487 Arraystar Human LncRNA microarray V4 (Probe Name version)
