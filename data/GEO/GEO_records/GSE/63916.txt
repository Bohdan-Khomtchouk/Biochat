TITLE
The expression profile of Cetuximab resistance in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cetuximab (Erbitux) is an antibody drug against EGFR and commonly used in late stage HNSCC and metastatic colorectal cancer. The oncogenic mutation of certain genes are known to drive Cetuximab resistance such as K-RAS or b-RAF mutation. The aberrant activation of signaling pathways in the presence of Cetuximab treatment to overcome cellular stress contribute to acquired resistance to Cetuximab as well. To better understand the mechanisms and molecular patterns of Cetuximab resistant cells, the Cetuximab resistant cells are trained for examining the gene expression profile. The gene expression array is used for identify the molecular signature governing the Cetuximab resitance.

DESIGN
The OECM-1 cells were cultured in the presence of 300ug/ml to 1000ug/ml of Cetuximab (Erbitux) for more than 30 passages to establish the Cetuximab-resnstant clone, OER (OECM1-Erbitux resistance cells).  The cetuximab resistant genes are assessed by comparing the OER cells to its parental cells, OECM-1.
