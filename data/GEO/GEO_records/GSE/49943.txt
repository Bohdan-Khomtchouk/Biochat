TITLE
Identification of Smaug target mRNAs in the early Drosophila embryo using RIP-Chip

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To identify Smaugâ€™s target mRNAs on a genome-wide scale we used ribonucleoprotein (RNP) co-immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis of the co-purifying mRNAs (RIP-Chip). Extracts, prepared from wild-type embryos collected 0-3 hours post-egglaying, were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Smaug antibody (Smaug RIPs) while control immunoprecipitations using non-immune serum served as a negative control (control RIPs). Genome-wide transcript expression in wild-type embryos were also assessed and used as reference.

DESIGN
There are 11 array experiments presented here: 1. gene expression profiling of total mRNA sample extracted from wild-type 0-3 hour embryos (3 technical replicates performed using a pooled input reference sample); 2. RNA co-immunoprecipitations of endogenous Smaug (Smaug RIPs) from wild-type 0-3 hour embryos (3 biological replicates and 1 technical replicates); 3. control RNA co-immunoprecipitations (control RIPs) from wild-type 0-3 hour embryos (3 biological replicates and 1 technical replicates).
