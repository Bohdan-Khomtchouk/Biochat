TITLE
Expression Profiling of Inflammatory Breast Cancer Cells Treated with the Novel Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor, CG-1521 (Affymetrix HuGene-1_0)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Studies of gene expression profiles using the whole genome wide microarray analysis in SUM149PT cells (ER-, p53mut) and SUM190PT cells (ER-, p53mut) when treated with 5 or 7.5 µM CG-1521 alone and in combination with 10 nM 17β-Estradiol. Comparisons between each treatment group provides evidence for the dysregulation of genes associated with the spindle assembly checkpoint.

DESIGN
Three independent experiments were carried out in SUM149PT and SUM190PT cells, which were treated with vehicle (ethanol/DMSO), 10nM 17β-Estradiol, 5 or 7.5µM CG-1521, and the combination of 17β-Estradiol and CG-1521. Total RNA was extracted from cell lysates using QIAGEN RNeasy mini kit after 48h of treatment.
