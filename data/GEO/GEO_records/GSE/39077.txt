TITLE
Profiling of cell cycle-related or cancer-related genes dysregulated by knockdown of MYC or lncRNAs using Nanostring Gene Expression Assay

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of cell cycle-related or cancer-related genes dysregulated by knockdown of MYC or lncRNAs in colorectal cancer-derived HCT116 or prostate cancer-derived PC3.

DESIGN
Using siRNAs targeting MYCLos, the cells were transfected and RNA samples from the treated cells were subjected to Nanostring Gene Expression Assay.
