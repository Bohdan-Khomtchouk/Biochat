TITLE
Nuclear Receptor Corepressors are Required for the Histone Deacetylase Activity of HDAC3 In Vivo (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the genomic regions enriched in Histone Deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in mouse livers. We also report the change of HDAC3 occupancy upon DAD mutations in NCOR and SMRT.

DESIGN
HDAC3 enriched genomic regions in WT and NS-DADm mice livers using Illumina GAIIx.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
