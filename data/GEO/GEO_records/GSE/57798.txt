TITLE
Influence of DEN in mice liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and it is necessary to elucidate the mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high mortality rate and develops based on the chronic inflammatory hepatic disease. Therefore, novel prophylactic or therapeutic strategies are required to improve outcome. In this study, influence of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and retinoic acid (ATRA) on hepatocarcinogenesis was investigated in mouse. These results suggest that the control of NF-ÎºB signaling during the early stage of HCC development is important for the prevention of malignant transformation in hepatocytes.

DESIGN
Genes induced by the following treatments in mice liver were investigated at 2 days or 7 days after treatment; DEN: diethylnitrosamine (treatment of DEN (drinking water 80 mg/L)) ATRA: retinoic acid (treatment of ATRA (drinking water 30 mg/L)) G0s2 siRNA : G0s2 knockdown mouse liver (treatment of G0s2 siRNA) Control siRNA: treatment of scramble siRNA (negative control)

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
