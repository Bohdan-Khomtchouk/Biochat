TITLE
Allergen challenged CD4+ cells from allergic patients and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression (Npatients = 21, Ncontrols = 21) of CD4+ T-cells failed to seperate patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) and healthy controls in an in vitro model system in which purified PBMCs from patients and healthy controls were challenged with allergen for 7 days.

DESIGN
PBMCs from 21 patients (P) and 21 healthy controls (H) were challenged with grass pollen for 7 days. Diluent challenged control samples were obtained from all subjects. CD4+ cells were purified by MACS.
