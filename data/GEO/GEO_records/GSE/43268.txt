TITLE
48 apple trees from a segregating F1 population from a cross of 'Ottawa 3' x 'Robusta 5'

ORGANISM
Malus domestica

SUMMARY
48 apple trees from a segregating F1 population from a cross of 'Ottawa 3' x 'Robusta 5' were analyzed by microarray to identify gene expression differences between the individuals to correlate gene expression patterns with phenotypic traits segregating in the population

DESIGN
48 individual apple trees were assayed once each using RNA isolated from a single shoot tip from each tree.  There were no biological or technical replicates in the experiment. There was no control sample, since all 48 were compared to each other.
