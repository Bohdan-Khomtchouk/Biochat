TITLE
Murine bone marrow derived macrophages: wildtype Vs. CDK5R1 knockout

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse bone marrow derived macrophages comparing wildtype with CDK5R1 knockout. CDK5R1 is an activating parter for CDK5 and synthesized upon TLRs stimaultion. Activated CDK5 has various target substrates, and functions as a key singnaling regulator in macrophages.

DESIGN
Two condition experiments: basal state and LPS-stimulated macrophages for 6 hours. Two biological replicates.

PLATFORM
