TITLE
Expression data from the abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic aneurysm

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression information that can be used to identify pathways involved in the pathophysiology of disease. We used microarrays to identify which genes are expressed in either the abdominal aorta (control) or in abdominal aortic aneurysms (case), and also which genes may be differential between the two tissue states. Keywords: Characterization of expression in both diseased and non-diseased abdominal aortas.
