Prenatal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) exposure induces working memory and social recognition deficits by disrupting inhibitory synaptic networks in male mice

SUMMARY
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs in pregnant women.  Given that SSRIs can cross the placental and blood-brain barriers, these drugs potentially affect serotonergic neurotransmission and neurodevelopment in the fetus.  Although no gross SSRI-related teratogenic effect has been reported, infants born following prenatal exposure to SSRIs have a higher risk for various behavioral abnormalities.  Therefore, we examined the effects of prenatal fluoxetine, the most commonly prescribed SSRI, on social and cognitive behavior in mice.  Intriguingly, chronic in utero fluoxetine treatment impaired working memory and social novelty recognition in adult males with augmented spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission onto the layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).  Moreover, fast-spiking interneurons in the layer 5 mPFC exhibited enhanced basal intrinsic excitability, augmented serotonin-induced neuronal excitability, and increased inhibitory synaptic transmission onto the layer 5 pyramidal neurons due to augmented 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) signaling.  More importantly, the observed behavioral deficits of in utero fluoxetine-treated mice could be reversed by acute systemic application of 5-HT2AR antagonist.  Taken together, our findings support the notion that alterations in serotonin-mediated inhibitory neuronal modulation result in reduced cortical network activities and cognitive impairment following prenatal exposure to SSRIs.
