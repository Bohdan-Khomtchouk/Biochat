TITLE
Comparison of endogenous tRNA expression levels from cells expressing and sgRNA from either a U6 or tRNA promoter

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the endogenous tRNA expression levels from cells transduced with a lentiviral vector encopding Cas9 and an sgRNA from a U6 or a Glutamine tRNA promoter. Using high-throughput sequencing methods (Illumina Hi-Seq 2000) we show that endogenous tRNA expression levels are not perturbed by expression of an sgRNA from a human tRNA.

DESIGN
tRNA expression profiles were generated from 2 different transduced polyconal cell lines.
