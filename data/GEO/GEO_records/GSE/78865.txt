TITLE
Expression profiling in exosomal miRNAs secreted from human bone marrow stromal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aging of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) lead to decreased ability to maintain hematopoiesis, however, effects of aging on BMSC-derived exosomes in bone marrow microenvironment remain unclear. The aim of this study is therefore to determine the age-related change of BMSC-derived exosomal miRNAs.

DESIGN
Human BMSCs of young (yBMSC s, age of donors: 19 and 20 years) and elderly (eBMSC s, age of donors: 68 and 72 years) donors were purchased from Lonza. BM samples were obtained from MM patients (age of donors:  62 and 77 years) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and using protocols approved by the research Ethics Committee of Tokyo Medical University (IRB No. 2648), and BMSCs derived from MM patients (mmBMSCs) were isolated using the classical plastic adhesion method. The exosomes from culture medium of BM-MSCs were isolated by Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (Invitrogen). Exosomal miRNA profiling was done using a TaqMan low-density array (ABI), and Studentâ€™s t-test was used to determine statistical significance for comparisons between young and old groups using R software.
