TITLE
Expression data from HeLa cells upon interferon-gamma or interferon-beta treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Immune interferon beta and gamma are essential for mammalian host defence against intracellular pathogens. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression upon interferon-gamma or interferon-beta treatment and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were unstimulated or stimulated with interferons for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
