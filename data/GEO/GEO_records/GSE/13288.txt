TITLE
miR-309-dependent unstable maternal mRNAs are stabilized in smaug mutants

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The behavior of 410 miR-309-dependent maternal mRNAs (from Bushati et al., 2008) in embryos from wild type and smg-mutant females relative to wild-type stage 14 oocyte reference RNA. All are unstable in wild-type while almost 85% are stabilized in smg mutants
