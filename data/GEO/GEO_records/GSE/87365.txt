TITLE
ERBB3 and NGFR mark distinct skeletal muscle progenitor cells in human development enabling enrichment and maturation of hPSC muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Abstract: Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be directed to differentiate into skeletal muscle progenitor cells (SMPCs). However, the myogenic potential of hPSC-SMPCs compared to human fetal or adult satellite cells (Scs) remains unclear.  This study demonstrates hPSC-SMPCs derived by commonly used protocols are functionally less mature than freshly-isolated human fetal or adult Scs.  We utilized RNA-SEQ of human fetal Scs to identify differentially expressed genes including NGFR, ERBB3, which enriched for MYOD+ or PAX7+ cells.  Furthermore, inhibition of TGFβ (TGFβi) improved hPSC-muscle maturation in three independent lines as measured by TEM and expression of myosins. Engraftment of CRISPR/Cas9-corrected Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) hiPSC-SMPC subpopulations treated with TGFβi in vivo, increased dystrophin-positive fibers to levels of engrafted cultured fetal Scs in mdx mouse models of DMD.  This work provides the first characterization of the developmental status of hPSC-SMPCs and identifies candidates to enable robust myogenic activity in vitro and in vivo.

DESIGN
Profiled transcriptomes of uncultured fetal Scs, cultured fetal muscle cells, and differentiated fetal myotubes in comparison to day 50 NCAM+ hPSC-SMPCs and SMPC-derived myotubes by RNA-SEQ.
