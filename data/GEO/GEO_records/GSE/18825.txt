TITLE
The TDRD9-MIWI2 complex is essential for piRNA-mediated retrotransposon silencing in the mouse male germline

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identify small RNA partners of Mili from 14 dpp testes of Tdrd9-/- and Tdrd9+/- mice. Two technical replicates of the same library are indicated as replicate 1 and 2.

DESIGN
Examination of differences in Mili-associated RNAs in 14 dpp testes of Tdrd9-/- and Tdrd9+/- mice
