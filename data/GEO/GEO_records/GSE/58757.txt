TITLE
Extensive crosstalk between lncRNAs and mRNAs in mouse stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the temporal variation of mRNA levels, we collected and sequenced poly-adenylated RNA from all cell extracts, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of a conditional Dicer mutant [DTCM23/49 XY (Nesterova et al. 2008)] mouse Embryonic Stem Cells before induction of Dicer excision (day 0) and at days 4, 8, 10 and 12 following Dicer loss of function. coverage.

DESIGN
RNA from whole cell extracts was collected at days 0, 4, 8, 10 and 12 following loss of Dicer function and from the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of cell at day 0 and 12. Three biological replicates were obtained for all samples. Poly-adenylated directional 100 base paired-end sequencing libraries were prepared for all extracts and sequenced by BGI solutions (Hong Kong).
