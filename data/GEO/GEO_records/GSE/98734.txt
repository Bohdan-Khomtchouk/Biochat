TITLE
A practical solution for preserving single cells for RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We present a method for histological tissue fixation using dithio-bis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP), or Lomant's Reagent, to stabilise cell samples for single-cell transcriptomic applications.

DESIGN
Single-cell RNAseq from 2,3 and 7 day old DSP fixed cells were compared with RNAseq from fresh cells
