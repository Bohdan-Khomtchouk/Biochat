TITLE
Effect of Chromomethylase-2 and Dicer-like-3 knockouts on DNA methylation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was performed on Chromomethylase-2 and Dicer-like-3 knockout mutants in order to confirm the results from genome wide association mapping and to identify the respective genomic regions that they target.

DESIGN
Bisulfite sequencing of knockout mutants and WT controls

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
