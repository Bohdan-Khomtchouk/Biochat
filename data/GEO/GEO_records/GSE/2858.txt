TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in Peg1 wild type and null murine telencephalons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
single E12.5 Peg1 mutant cortices were directely compared to single E12.5 wild type cortices. Keywords: mutant analysis

DESIGN
Six mutant cortices (M1,3,4,5,6,7) were compared to three wild type cortices (WT2,8,9). As Mest is an imprinted gene that is only expressed from the paternal allele, mutants were generated by crossing males carrying a LacZ-targeted allele in which exons 3-8 were removed to wild-type females, as described (Lefebvre, L., Viville, S., Barton, S. C., Ishino, F., Keverne, E. B. and Surani, M. A. (1998). Abnormal maternal behaviour and growth retardation associated with loss of the imprinted gene Mest. Nat Genet 20, 163-9.)
