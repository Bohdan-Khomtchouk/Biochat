TITLE
Mycobacterium smegmatis: CarD depletion (mgm1703) vs Control (mgm1701)

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Mycobacterium smegmatis comparing the effects of wild type levels of CarD expression with CarD depletion. Transcriptional profile of the mgm1701 control strain was compared with that of mgm1703, a strain where CarD transcription is regulated by a Tet-On system. Both strains were grown in the absence of anhydrotetracline for 13 hours in nutrient rich broth to allow for depletion of CarD transcription in mgm1703.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, control (mgm1701) vs CarD depletion (mgm1703). 3 biological replicates of each strain.

PLATFORM
GPL8356 JVCI Mycobacterium smegmatis microarray version 4
