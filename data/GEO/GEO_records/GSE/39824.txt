TITLE
Expression data from Chicken duodenum

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to decipher the molecular basis of feed efficiency in meat-type chicken using duodenum tissues from a chicken population divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI). Residual feed intake is the deviation of expected feed intake from actual feed intake. Chickens that consume less feed than expected are efficient (LRFI) and chickens that consume more feed than expected are inefficient (HRFI). A divergent selection for RFI was undertaken using an unselected random bred chicken population. RFI at day 35-42 was used as a criterion for selecting low (LRFI) and high (HRFI) RFI. Duodenum tissues were collected from 16 male chickens under sterile conditions experimentation. Tissues were collected from 4 males at days 35 and 42 in each line.

DESIGN
Duodenum at 35 and 42 days from a chicken population divergently selected for residual feed intake were utilized for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
