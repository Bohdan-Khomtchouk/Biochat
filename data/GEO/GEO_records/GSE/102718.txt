TITLE
RNA-seq Analysis of Tfcp2l1ΔCP2-regulated Genes in Human ESCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose:The goal of this study is to analyze the candidate genes motified by Tfcp2l1ΔCP2 to regulate the human embryonic stem cell (ESC) fate through RNA-seq approach.

DESIGN
HES2 human ESCs expressing PB or PB-Tfcp2l1ΔCP2 were cultured in 10% KSR basal media supplemented with 10 ng/ml FGF2 and 10 ng/ml Activin A for two passages and then were collected by using Trizol. These samples were sent to BGI (China) company to do deep sequencing by using BGISEQ-500.

PLATFORM
GPL23227 BGISEQ-500 (Homo sapiens)
