TITLE
Microarray data obtained from control, cbtRNAi and cbtOE flies

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Microarray data obtained from control, cbtRNAi (cabut RNAi), and cbtOE (cabut overexpression) flies. From each strain, fly heads at two different time points during the dayâ€“night cycle (ZT3 and ZT153) were collected. Fly heads  were collected and RNA was extracted. RNA  was then used to prepare a probe that was hybridized to Drosophila 2.0 gene expression arrays (Affymetrix).

DESIGN
Two  samples of cbtRNAi, two samples of cbtOE and two samples of the control flies (cyo).
