TITLE
Development of gene expression signature for defining the cell potency of muscle derived stem cells (MDSC) from mice of diffferent genotypes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to determine the cell potency, by identification of genes responsible for pluri/multi potency, we performed a global gene expression profiling of MDSC isolated from five week old male wild type(WT), C57Bl6J  and  another hypertrophied musculature mouse genotype called myostatin null (Mstn-/-) mice using microarray analysis and compared this gene expression to that of a standard mouse ES cell line W4. Muscle derived stem cells (MDSC) were isolated from WT and Mstn null mice using an established preplate technique and compared with  the gene expression signature of standard mouse ES cell line W4

DESIGN
Entire hindlimb muscles of five week old WT and Mstn null male mice were subjected to primary cultures using the well established preplate technique based on adhesion properties of cells for sequential isolation of preplate6(PP6) cells on day4. The PP6 cells are called so because they are slowest adhering and attach to the matrigel coated dishes on day4. PP6 have stem cell like qualities as established by previous workers and are hence also known as MDSC. We expanded the MDSCs from the our isolation sources mentioned above for a fortnight in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum,1% chcken embryo extract,1% Penstep and 0.1µM βmercaptoethanol.RNA was extracted by RNeasy minit kit from Qiagen as per manufacturer's instructions and subjected to RNA integreity check by RIN score followed by microarray analysis for global gene expression using Agilent platform. Also, in parallel we cultured a standard mouse ES cell line from the company Taconic named W4 on feeder free conditions, extraced RNA and performed microarray analysis.
