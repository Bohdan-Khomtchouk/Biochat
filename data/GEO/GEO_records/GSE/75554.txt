TITLE
Conserved functional antagonism between CELF and MBNL proteins regulates stem cell-specific alternative splicing and regeneration in planarians (dataset 2)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Here, we analyze the RNA-binding preferences of the planarian smed-mbnl-like-2, smed-mbnl-1 (isoform X1), smed-bruli, smed-mbnl-1 (isoform Xins), and smed-mbnl-like-1 protein using RNAcompete.

DESIGN
In the RNAcompete assay, a purified GST-tagged protein is incubated with an excess of RNA pool and bound RNA from individual pulldown experiments are directly labeled and hybridized to a custom Agilent 244K microarray.
