TITLE
High-throughput sequencing of pluripotent cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report HERV-K rec iCLIP-seq binding data, ribosome profiling data, and RNA-seq from ELF1 naïve hESC and RNA-seq from NCCIT cells.

DESIGN
HERV-K Rec iCLIP-seq: 2 replicates in NCCIT. Ribosome profiling: 4 replicates each of Rec-overexpressing NCCIT vs. control NCCIT; RNAseq: 3 replicates each of HERV-K Rec siRNA vs. control siRNA in NCCIT; RNA-seq: 3 replicates each of ELF1 naïve hESC vs. primed hESC.
