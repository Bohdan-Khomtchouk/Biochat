TITLE
Expression analysis of eu-miR-155 transgenic mice B-cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miR-155 transgenic mice develop pre-B cell leukemia/lymphoma. Though some targets of miR-155 are known, understanding of the mechanism by which miR-155 overexpression drives malignant transformation is not known. MicroRNAs regulate multiple genes.

DESIGN
3 transgenic and 4 wild type mice B-cells were analyzed
