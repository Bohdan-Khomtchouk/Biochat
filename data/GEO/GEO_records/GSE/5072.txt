TITLE
Sex-dependent and STAT5b-dependent Liver Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A series of dual-channel gene expression profiles obtained using Rosetta/Merck Mouse TOE 75k microarrays was used to examine the sex-dependent and STAT5b-dependent differences in gene expression in adult mouse liver. This series is comprised of 4 pools of 3 randomly chosen independent wildtype male and female mouse liver cDNA samples and 4 pools of 3 randomly chosen independent STAT5b-deficient male and female mouse liver cDNA samples, totaling 16 pools. The pools were paired randomly to generate 4 comparisons of M-WT:F-WT, M-WT:M-KO, F-KO:F-WT, and F-KO:M-KO.  Comparison of the set of sex-dependent genes with the set of genes responsive to the loss of STAT5b in males shows that 75% of the sex-specific genes were also regulated by STAT5b in males.  Only 20% of the sex-specific genes retained sex-specificity in the absence of STAT5b, indicating a large role for STAT5b in sex-specific liver gene expression. Keywords: genetic knockout and sex response
