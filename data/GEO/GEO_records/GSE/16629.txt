TITLE
Gene expression of RonTK-/- mammary glands compared to RonTK+/+ controls during development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RON WT and RON KO at 5, 6, 7 week virgin mammary glands In the study, we demonstrated that RON regulates mammary gland branching morphogenesis in pubertal development associated with changes in gene expression. Keywords: Pubertal mammary glands

DESIGN
In the study, we hybridized RNA from 5, 6, 7 week old virgin female RON WT and KO mammary glands to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
