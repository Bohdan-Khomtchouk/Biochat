TITLE
Temperature dependent Transcriptome of L. monocytogenes EGDe in minimal medium

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptome of L. monocytogenes EGDe at 24°C and 37°C L. monocytogenes EGDe cells used in this study were grown either at 24°C or 37°C  to an OD600 = 0.82-0.87 and the transcriptome of these two conditions was compared

DESIGN
Six biologically independent cultures of each at 24°C and 37°C grown L. monocytogenes EGDe were used for total RNA isolation (six RNA sets). Three array experiments were performed with Cy5-labelled cDNA derived from at 24°C grown Listeria and Cy3-labelled cDNA derived from at 37°C grown cells. For the three other RNA sets a dye swap was performed, that means the three other array experiments were performed with Cy3-labelled cDNA derived form at 24°C grown Listeria and Cy5-labelled cDNA from at 37°C grown cells. As all oligonuceotides are spotted twice on an array, technical duplicates were performed for each experiment. The overall design results in 12 data points for the expression of each gene.
