TITLE
A sumoylation-dependent transcriptional subprogram is required for Myc-driven tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Myc is an oncogenic transcription factor frequently dysregulated in human cancer. To identify pathways supporting the Myc oncogenic program, we employed a genome-wide RNAi screen for Myc-synthetic-lethal (MySL) genes and uncovered a role for the SUMO-activating-enzyme (SAE1/2). Loss of SAE1/2 enzymatic activity drives synthetic lethality with Myc.  Mechanistically, SAE2 inhibition switches a transcriptional subprogram of Myc from activated to repressed. A subset of these SUMOylation-dependent Myc-switchers (SMS genes) governs mitotic spindle function and is required to support the Myc oncogenic program.
