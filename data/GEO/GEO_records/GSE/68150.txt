TITLE
Transcriptome comparison of oocytes obtained from in vitro culture and in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The comparison of trancriptomes was part of the study by Pfender, Kuznetsov, Pasternak et al, titled: " Live imaging RNAi screen reveals genes essential for meiosis in mammalian oocytes " . The goal was to check if the oocytes cultured in vitro in follicles (for RNAi studies) correspond to real gametes obtained directly from mice (in vivo). Apart from functional experiments showing that they can be fertilized and develop into an embryo, we also compared transcriptomes of those oocytes.

DESIGN
3 samples of 50 oocytes were collected for both groups of in vitro and in vivo grown oocytes.
