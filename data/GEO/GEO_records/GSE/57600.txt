TITLE
Gene expression profile in NNV infected ZF-4 cells

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of ZF-4 cells comparing mock infection cells with cells infected with NNV. This assay is used for determination of gene expression profiling at 6 hpi under NNV infection.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Mock infection vs. NNV infection (5 MOI).

PLATFORM
GPL6457 Agilent-019161 D. rerio (Zebrafish) Oligo Microarray (V2) G2519F (Feature Number version)
