TITLE
Gene expression profiling of endothelial cell apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the regulatory relationships among EC transcripts during apoptosis using serum withdrawal time series microarray data and use this to identify master regulators of endothelial cell apoptosis.

DESIGN
In the study presenty here, HUVEC isolates from 10 different individuals were pooled. The extracted RNA was hybridised onto the microarray at different timepoints following treatment with serum withdrawal. The time course was replicated 3 times using three different pools of 10 HUVEC isolates.
