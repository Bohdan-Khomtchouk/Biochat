TITLE
Transcriptional programs that regulate brain cortical development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dynamic changes of histone epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure represent an universal mechanism by which cells adapt their transcriptional response to rapidly changing environmental conditions.  During neuronal development, extensive chromatin remodelling takes place allowing the transition of pluripotent cells into differentiated neurons. Here we investigate the transcriptional programs that are differentially regulated during cortical development in vivo.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis was performed in the mouse embryonic cortex at three developmental stages: E12.5, E15.5 and E18.5 using total RNA obtained from four embryos for each time point.
