TITLE
Comparison of the transcriptomes of mESCs, E14.5 dental Sox2+ cell and P30 dental Sox2+ cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the transcriptome of the Sox2+ cells in forming incisor (E14.5) to the Sox2+ cells in renewing incisor (P30), using the MTA Affymetrix array. We used mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) as na√Øve cell reference.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were used for each of the samples (mESCs, E14.5 Sox2+ dental cells and P30 Sox2+ dental cells). The mESCs were purchased. For the Sox2+ cells, each sample was composed of cells from multiple individuals (embryos or postnatal mice); embryonic incisors and postnatal labial cervical loops were dissected out from Sox2-GFP+ mice, digested into a single cell suspension and Sox2-GFP+ alive cells (AAD-) were collected using fluorescence-activated flow cytometry.
