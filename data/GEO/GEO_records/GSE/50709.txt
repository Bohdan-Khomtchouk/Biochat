TITLE
Cardiac aldosterone regulated genes in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aldosterone excess is involved in cardiac diseases. The mechanisms are still unclears.  Mice  were treated for 7 days with aldosterone and a whole genome microarray analysis was performed.

DESIGN
Two-group experiment: Untreated mice (Ctrl), mice + aldosterone treatment (Aldo). One comparisons: Ctrl vs Aldo

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
