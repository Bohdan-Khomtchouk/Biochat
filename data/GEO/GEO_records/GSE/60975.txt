TITLE
Root and rosette leaves transcriptome of Arabidopsis Col-0 and nrt1.5 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Differentially regulated genes in rosette leaves and roots of hydroponically grown Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and nrt1.5-5 mutant plants were identified by microarray analyses.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 wild type and nrt1.5-5 (GABI_347B03) mutant plants were grown hydroponically under short day conditions (10 h/14 h light/dark) in nitrogen limiting conditions. From nine weeks old plants rosette leaves no. 13 and younger and roots were separately harvested for transcriptome analysis.
