TITLE
Deficiency of multidrug resistance 2 contributes to cell transformation through oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mdr2 is the transporter of phosphatidylcholine, which is an essential component of bile. Deficiency of mdr2 causes hepatic inflammation, liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Mdr2-/- MEFs show increased proliferation, spontaneous transformation and tumorigenesis. We used microarray to obtain genome-wide profiling of gene expression underlying the changes in mdr2-/- MEFs.

DESIGN
MEFs derived from wt and mdr2-/- littermate embyos were subjected to passage according to 3T3 protocols. RNA was extracted from cells on passage 40 and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
