TITLE
Expression data from 12-day old Arabidopsis germinants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Seed germination of a terrestrial plant constitute dynamic changes in various physiological processes related to growth and development. These physiological processes can be affected by various abiotic and biotic stressors. Here we looked at how the two commonly used nanoparticles, nano-titania (TiO2) and nano-ceria (CeO2) can impact the underlying mechanisms associated with germination at genome level. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying various physiological processes associated with growth and development, and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
12 day old Arabidopsis germinants were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Arabidopsis seeds were individually exposed to 500mg/L concentration of nano-titania and nano-ceria for 12 days, followed by extraction of RNA for Microarray analysis. 0.1mM KCl was used as control for nano-titania, whereas sterilized millipore water was used as control for nano-ceria.
