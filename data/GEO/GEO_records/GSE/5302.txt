TITLE
O1- > O139 serogroup conversion / phage selected

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
These experiments were performed to show a serogroup conversion of Vibrio cholerae from O1 to O139. For this purpose, V. cholerae O1 El Tor (A1552) was grown on crab shell fragments to induce natural competence for transformation. Purified DNA (4 ug each) from strain MO10, an O139 serogroup strain, was added after 24h and the cells were further grown for 24h. After detachment from the crab shell fragments, bacteria were poured into soft-agar and overlaid onto LB plates. Mukerjee's El Tor phage V (a gift of Dr. M.S. Islam) was dropped onto the surface of the bacteria containing soft-agar. The plaques formed by killing non-transformed A1552 cells possessed resistant clones which were picked and further selected for opaque morphotype and agglutination by O139-specific antiserum. Four clones were selected from each independent experiment and analyzed by microarray hybridization (BioPrime. Array CGH Genomic Labeling from Invitrogen). Two microarray replicates were done per clone. Strain Names: ApO139#2 / ApO139#4 / ApO139#6 / ApO139#8 are four clones analyzed after the first experiment; AIIpO139#3 / AIIpO139#4 / AIIpO139#5 / AIIpO139#6 are four clones analyzed after the second independent experiment. Two MA replicates for each clone were done. CGHs of A1552 versus MO10 are provided as control. Keywords: array CGH
