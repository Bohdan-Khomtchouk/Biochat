TITLE
Characterization of the Drosophila genome at the nuclear lamina

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The nuclear lamina (NL) binds chromatin in vitro and is thought to function in its organisation, but genes that interact with the NL are unknown. Using an in vivo approach we identified 474 Drosophila genes that interact with Bâ€“type lamin, Lam. These genes are transcriptionally silent, late replicating, lack active histone marks, and are widely spaced. These factors collectively predict Lamin binding behavior, indicating the NL integrates variant and invariant chromatin features. Consistently, NE proximity is partly conserved between cell types and induction of gene expression or active histone marks reduces Lam binding. Lam target genes cluster in the genome, and these clusters are coordinately expressed during development. This genome-wide analysis gives clear insight into the nature and dynamic behavior of the genome at the NL. Keywords: DamID and expression profiling
