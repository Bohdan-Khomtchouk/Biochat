TITLE
Effect of progerin on p53-deficient vascular smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of p53-deficient (E6-expressing) human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) that express progerin, a mutated form of lamin A resposible for Hutchinson- Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). p53 pathway is associated with HGPS. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying vascular dysfunction of HGPS caused by other than p53 pathway.

DESIGN
The gene expression of VSMCs induced to express E6 and either lamin A or progerin by retroviral vectors.
