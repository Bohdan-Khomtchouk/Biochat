TITLE
Quantitative profiling of BATF family proteins/JUNB/IRF hetero-trimers using Spec-seq

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Spec-seq directly mesaures specificity by sequencing. We run an EMSA experiment on TF of interest with a library of DNA targets. Then we extract and sequence the bound and unbound portion of the DNA separately. Finally we count the occurences of each varient in the library and calculate the ratio and the relative binding energy.

DESIGN
15 independent Spec-seq experiments

PLATFORM
GPL17769 Illumina MiSeq (synthetic construct)
