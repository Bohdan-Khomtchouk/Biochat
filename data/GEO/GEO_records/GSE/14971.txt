ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of Cux2 ko cortex was compared to the profile of WT cortex. Keywords: tissue comparison

DESIGN
Cerebral cortex of WT and Cux2 ko animals were dissected and total RNA was obtained. Gene expression profiles were obtained for each sample and compared.
