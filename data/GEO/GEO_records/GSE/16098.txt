TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of genes regulated transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally by HTLV-I p30

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Human T-cell Leukemia Virus (HTLV)-type-I non-structural protein p30 plays an important role in virus transmission and gene regulation. p30 has been documented to inhibit the export of certain viral mRNA transcripts from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This nuclear retainment of RNA molecules essentially results in gene silencing, where protein products are not produced. Considering this unique function of p30, we used microarray analysis to assess the ability of p30 to inhibit not only the regulation of transcription of cellular genes, but also the ability of p30 to regulate the export of cellular transcripts to the cytoplasm.

DESIGN
Total or cytoplamsic RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells expressing HTLV-I p30 was isolated and analyzed by microarray analysis, in comparison with mock-transcuced cells.
