TITLE
Identification of microRNA profiling of human ovary in PCOS with insulin resistance (pilot study)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. It has become increasingly evident that insulin resistance plays a significant role both as a cause and result of the syndrome. In an effort to investigate further the observed insulin resistance in the ovarian tissue of women with PCOS, we conducted array-based, global miRNA profiling.
