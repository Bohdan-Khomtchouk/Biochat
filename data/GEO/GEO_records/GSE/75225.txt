TITLE
Bone marrow-derived monocytes give rise to self-renewing and fully differentiated Kupffer cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Self-renewing tissue-resident macrophages are thought to be exclusively derived from embryonic progenitors. However, whether circulating monocytes can also give rise to such macrophages has not been formally investigated. Here we use a new model of diphtheria toxin-mediated depletion of liver-resident Kupffer cells to generate niche availability and show that circulating monocytes engrafted in the liver, gradually adopt the transcriptional profile of their depleted counterparts and become long-lived self-renewing cells. Underlining the physiological relevance of our findings, circulating monocytes also contribute to the expanding pool of macrophages in the liver shortly after birth, when macrophage niches become available during normal organ growth. Thus, like embryonic precursors, monocytes can and do give rise to self-renewing tissue-resident macrophages if the niche is available to them.

DESIGN
Clec4F+ Kupffer cells were isolated and sorted from livers from adult WT mice or KC-DTR or KC-DTR littermate control mice +/- 50ng DT at indicated timepoints. 19 samples (arrays) in total. RNA was isolated, amplified with Nugene pico kit, converted to cDNA and then hybridised on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
