TITLE
Long noncoding RNAs are spatially correlated with transcription factors and regulate lung development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify potential biological functions for three lncRNAs (NANCI, LL12, and LL34) we used shRNAs to knockdown expression of lncRNAs in MLE12 cells, a cell resembling type two lung epithelial cells. This data set contains the microarrays looking at gene expression.

DESIGN
We used biological triplicate for each shRNA treatment and each treatment group was compared to a biological triplicate of MLE12 cells treated with a scrambled shRNA.
