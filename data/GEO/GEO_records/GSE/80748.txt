TITLE
Transcriptomes of a xylose-utilizing industrial flocculating Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain cultured in media containing different sugar sources

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The molecular basis for glucose and xylose fermentation by industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae is of interest to promote bioethanol production We used microarrays to investigate the transcriptional difference of a industrial strain cultured in both single sugar media and a mixed sugar medium of glucose and xylose

DESIGN
In this study, microaerobic batch fermentations of KF7M-16 were carried out in both single sugar medium (either glucose or xylose) and mixed sugar medium (including the glucose fermentation phase and the xylose fermentation phase). RNA was extracted at 2h for glucose-fermenting cells and an 7h for xylose-fermenting cells. The global transcriptomes were analyzed to identify the molecular response to different fermentation states.
