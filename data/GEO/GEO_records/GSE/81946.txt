TITLE
Difference in circulating microRNAs between grazing and grain-fed Japanese Black cattle

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We aimed to elucidate the effects of feeding condition (indoor grain-feeding vs. grazing on pasture) on c-miRNAs in Japanese Black (JB) cattle (Wagyu). The cattle at 18 months old were divided into pasture feeding and conventional indoor grain feeding for 5 months. Microarray analysis of c-miRNAs from the plasma extracellular vesicles led to the detection of a total of 202 bovine miRNAs in the plasma, including 15 miRNAs that differed between the feeding conditions.

DESIGN
miRNA expression in plasma extracellular vesicles (Evs) of the cattle was measured after 5 months of grazing or grain feeding. Plasma EV samples prepared from three cattle for each treatment were collected for microarray analysis .
