TITLE
The microbial functional diversity in response to altered precipitation on Tibet Plateau as characterized by GeoChip

ORGANISM
uncultured soil microorganism

SUMMARY
Global warming substantially changes precipitation patterns in the Tibetan plateau, with projection of increased precipitation in southern and northern Tibet but decreased precipitation in the center. Understanding mechanisms of such changes in greenhouse gas emissions is of vital importance in predicting ecosystem feedbacks to climate changes. Nonetheless, it has been hampered by limited knowledge in soil microbial communities, one of the major drivers of greenhouse gas emission. Here, we report a field experiment simulating drying and wetting conditions in the Tibetan grassland. Our field site is located at the Haibei Alpine Grassland Ecosystem Research Station in the northeast of Tibet Plateau, China, and we employed GeoChip 5.0 180K to analyze microbial responses.

DESIGN
18 samples were collected from 3 plots in Haibei Station, with 6 replicates in each plot

PLATFORM
GPL21961 GeoChip 5.0 180K
