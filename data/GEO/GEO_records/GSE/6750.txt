TITLE
Complex interactions of stress-associated regulons in an mprAB deletion mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Using a deletion mutant lacking portions of the response regulator, MprA, and the histidine kinase, MprB, we demonstrated by DNA microarrays that MprAB activates sigE and sigB under SDS stress and during logarithmic growth. Keywords: effects of 0.05% SDS on Mtb gene expression
