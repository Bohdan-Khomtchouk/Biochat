TITLE
Transcriptomics in cardiac surgery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Anesthetic gases elicit organ protection in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.  This study aimed at identifying myocardial transcriptional phenotypes and anesthetic-induced changes in gene expression to predict cardiovascular biomarkers and cardiac function after off-pump CABG. Keywords: cardiac surgery, anesthetics

DESIGN
Patients scheduled for off-pump CABG were randomized into a group with the anesthetic gas sevoflurane (n=10) or the intravenous anesthetic propofol (n=10). Atrial samples were collected at the beginning and end of bypass surgery to determine gene expression profiles.
