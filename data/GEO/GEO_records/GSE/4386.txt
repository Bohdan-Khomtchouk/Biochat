Transcriptomics in cardiac surgery

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Anesthetic gases elicit organ protection in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.  This study aimed at identifying myocardial transcriptional phenotypes and anesthetic-induced changes in gene expression to predict cardiovascular biomarkers and cardiac function after off-pump CABG. Keywords: cardiac surgery, anesthetics
