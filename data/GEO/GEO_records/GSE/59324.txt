TITLE
Molecular profiling of activated olfactory neurons identifies odorant receptors for odors in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We present a high-throughput in vivo method to identify odorant receptors responding to odorants, using phosphorylated ribosome immunoprecipitation of mRNA from olfactory epithelium of odor-stimulated mice followed by RNA-Seq.

DESIGN
pS6-IP RNA-Seq in odor stimulated vs control mice olfactory epithelium

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus) GPL16417 Illumina MiSeq (Mus musculus)
