TITLE
CNV anlysis of human parthenogenetic haploid ESCs (hPGES)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The genomic DNA sample of hPGES were compared to UCSC Human genome19 by CNV data. The data confirmed that the human parthenogenetic haploid ESCs sustained normal genome integrity

DESIGN
The analysis was performed on Affymetrix CytoHD to check the chromosome number variations in hPGES, and the CNV data of UCSC Human genome 19 was used as control.
