TITLE
Transcriptome of a malO deletion mutant of Clostridium perfringens during stationary phase growth.

ORGANISM
Clostridium perfringens str. 13

SUMMARY
The MalNO is a putative two-component signal transduction system, previously known as the VirJI sytem.  MalO is the putative cognate response regulator of the MalN sensor histidine kinase.  Based on previous evidence that suggested the plc gene, encoding Î±-toxin, was upregulated during stationary phase in the malO mutant, microarrays were used to analyse the transcriptome of a malO mutant during stationary phase growth.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from stationary phase cells of the malO mutant and the wild-type control.  Gene expression levels were compared between the malO mutant and wild-type strain 13
