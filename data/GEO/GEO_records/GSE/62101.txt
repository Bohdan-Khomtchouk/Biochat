TITLE
aCGH data of Rb/p53 deficient mammary tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the impact of combined Rb and p53 loss in mammary tumorigenesis, we used transgenic  and viral approaches to delete Rb and p53 floxed alleles specifically in the mouse mammary epithelium.  Although MMTV-Cre (NLST) targets stem/bi-potent progenitors in the mammary gland, a subset of MMTV-Cre:Rbf/f;p53f/f mice developed non-mammary tumors. Thus, freshly isolated primary mammary epithelial cells from these animals were transplanted into the mammary fat pads of immunodeficient mice and monitored for tumor formation. In addition, primary MECs were isolated from Cre-negative Rbf/f;p53f/f mice, infected with Ad-Cre followed by orthotopic transplantation.  In all these cases, resulting tumors shared similar spindle-shape histology, expressed high levels of vimentin, a mesenchymal marker, but not E-cadherin, a luminal marker, and were classified as adeno-sacrcomatoid/spindle-cell/mesenchymal-like breast cancer. We used aCGH to detect copy number alterations associated with Rb/p53 deletion.

DESIGN
Tumor DNAs from MMTV-Cre: Rbf/f;p53f/f and Ad-Cre: Rbf/f;p53f/f  conditional mutant mice are being compared to pooled tail DNAs in order to identify common alterations associated with Rb/p53 deficient tumorigenesis
