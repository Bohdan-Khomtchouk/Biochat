TITLE
Extracellular Vesicles in Luminal Fluid of the Ovine Uterus

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Exosomes/microvesicles (hereafter referred to as extracellular vesicles) were isolated from the ULF of day 14 cyclic and pregnant ewes using ExoQuick-TC. Extracellular vesicle RNA was pooled (n=4 per status) and analyzed for small RNAs by sequencing on the Ion Torrent PGM platform and analysis with CLC Genomics Workbench small RNA workflow based on the miRBase (Release 19) Bos taurus  database.

DESIGN
Small RNA analysis of day 14 uterine luminal fluid extracellular vesicles isolated from pregnant and cyclic ewes.

PLATFORM
