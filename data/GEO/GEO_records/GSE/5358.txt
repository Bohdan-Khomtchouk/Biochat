TITLE
p400/mDomino-deficient mouse embryo proper

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The SWI2/SNF2 family ATPase, p400/mDomino, is a core subunit of a large chromatin-remodeling complex. The mDomino-deficient (mDom-/-) mice died by embryonic day 11.5, and displayed an anemic appearance and slight deformity of the neural tube. We examined the gene expression in the wild-type (GSM121658) and mDom-/- (GSM121659) E8.5 embryo proper, and found that all of the embryonic globin genes and a globin chaperone gene (AHSP) were poorly expressed in the mDom-/- embryo on embryonic day 8.5. Keywords: Comparative gene expression analysis of wild-type and gene-targeted mice
