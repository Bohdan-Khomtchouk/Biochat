TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of granulosa cells after conventional vs long FSH-induced superstimulation in cattle

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Conventional Superstimulation (group 1) vs. Long Superstimulation (group 3) A genome-wide bovine oligo-microarray was used to compare the gene expression of granulosa cells collected from ovarian follicles after differing durations of the growing phase induced by exogenous FSH treatment. Cows were given a conventional (4-day) or long (7-day) superstimulatory treatment (25mg FSH im at 12-h intervals; n=6 per group), followed by prostaglandin treatment with last FSH and LH treatment 24 hr later. Granulosa cells were harvested 24 h after LH treatment. The expression of 416 genes was down-regulated and 615 genes was up-regulated in the long FSH group compared to the conventional FSH group. Quantification by RT-PCR of 7 genes (NTS, PTGS2, PTX3, RGS2, INHBA, CCND2 and LRP8) followed the same trend as in microarrays. Compared to the conventional group, the long FSH group responded to exogenous LH with down-regulation of mRNA for cyclinD2, lipoprotein receptorP8, CYP51A1, CYP19A1, CJA1, INHBA, SRPINE1, and up-regulation of Vannin, POSTN, GTPAse, Cysteine. Markers of fertility and follicle maturity were up-regulated in the long FSH group. We conclude that a prolonged FSH-induced growing phase is associated with transcriptomic characteristics of greater follicular maturity and may therefore be more appropriate for optimizing the superovulatory response and developmental competence of oocytes in cattle.

DESIGN
straight comparison of Short Superstimulation group (the reference; group 1) versus a Long Superstimulation protocol ( the treatment; group 3) using 3 different animals (biological replicates) in each group and performed dye swap. For example on array 1: group 1 cow 1 versus group 3 cow 1 (cy3 vs cy5) and on array 4 is the dye swap group 3 cow 1 versus group 1 cow 1 (cy3 vs cy5).
