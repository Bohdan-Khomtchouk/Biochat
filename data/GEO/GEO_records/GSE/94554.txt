TITLE
Functional activity of RNA-binding protein binding sites drives 3’ UTR evolution

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Protein bound segments of mammalian 3′ UTRs are GC rich, folded in vivo, rapidly evolving, and reduce gene expression in a genome-wide massively parallel reporter assay.

DESIGN
Protein bound segments of mammalian mRNAs were sequenced by capture of crosslinked, biotinylated RBPs and compared to RNAseq
