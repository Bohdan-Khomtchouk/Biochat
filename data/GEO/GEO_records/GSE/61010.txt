TITLE
Expression of genes in E17 p57-/-  and p57+/+ hepatic mesothelial and submesothelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze p57 function in mouse fetal liver, we surgically isolated mesothelial and submesothelial cells from E17 p57-/- and p57+/+ livers.

DESIGN
Compared gene expression in E17 p57-/- and p57+/+ hepatic mesothelial and submesothelial cells.
