TITLE
MicroRNA-198 an inhibitor of keratinocyte migration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study identifies miR-198 as a potential inhibitor of keratinocyte migration in skin This study identifies genes differentially expressed during the early phases of wound healing using an ex vivo organ culture model of human skin

DESIGN
Total RNA from N/TERT-1 keratinocytes transfected with a negative control miRNA or miR-198  were subjected to microarray analysis Skin from elective plastic surgery were subjected to wounding using ex vivo organ culture model. Total RNA from skin biopsies were isolated at 0hr and 24hr post injury and subjected to mircoarray analysis
