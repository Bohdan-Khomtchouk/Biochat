TITLE
Expression data from primary breast tumors (NUH)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Frozen tissue specimens from primary breast tumors were collected under approved protocols and profiled using Affymetrix U133 series expression microarrays. This cohort was assembled at the National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore in 2003, and profiled at the Genome Institute of Singapore, Microarray and Expression Genomics Lab. Dr. Lance D. Miller (Wake Forest University School of medicine) directed the profiling work. A publication describing the generation of these data is not yet available. However, these data can be used alongside other Affymetrix breast tumour data sets to form large meta-cohorts for breast cancer research, as was done in Lasham et. al. J Natl Cancer Inst. 2012 Jan 18;104(2):133-146.

DESIGN
Frozen tumor tissues comprising of > 60% tumor cellularity were extracted for total RNA and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Clinical data was requested, but not provided by submitter

PLATFORM
GPL96 [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array
