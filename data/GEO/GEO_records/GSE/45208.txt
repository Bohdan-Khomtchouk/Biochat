TITLE
Expression data from Zebrafinch

ORGANISM
Taeniopygia guttata

SUMMARY
The quality of vocal learning is influenced by the tutoring from conspecifics. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying differential tutoring condition during the development.

DESIGN
Six zebrafinches were reared with or without male tutor form 30-60 days post hatch (dph). At 60 dph, total RNA was extracted from the right forebrain.
