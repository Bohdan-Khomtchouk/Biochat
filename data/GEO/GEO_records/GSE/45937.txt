TITLE
transcriptomic analysis of phosphatin effect-Phosphatin effect on Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
cea11-02_phosphatin - transcriptomic analysis of phosphatin effect - Identification of transcriptomic modifications promoted by phosphatin (AC6) (a molecule mimicking Pi addition effects on Pi starved plants). - 40 µM Phosphatin was added to MS (diluted 10 times) containing 20µM phosphate medium and controls were grown on MS (diluted 10 times) containing 20µM phosphate or supplemented with 500 µM of Pi. For each ARN extraction their was 3 plates containing each 10 seedlings grown 13 days in vertical petri dishes.

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison

PLATFORM
GPL15719 INRA-CNRS-UEVE Arabidopsis thaliana 73K CATMAv6-HD12 [100701_Athal_CATMA6_SB_exp]
