TITLE
Rescue of alpha-synuclein toxicity in a yeast model of Parkinson's disease

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Cellular toxicities of alpha-synuclein manifest through multiple pathways, including mitochondrial dysfunction and the inhibition of vesicle trafficking. Several defects can be ameliorated by small molecule suppressors that antagonize toxicity in model systems ranging from yeast to neurons. Connections between these distinct pathologies may be central to Parkinson Disease and to therapeutic strategies.  First, yeast cultures with 1 or 2 copies of human alpha-synuclein were profiled during a time series of 0 to 6 hours.  Second, to investigate any potential rescue of alpha-synuclein toxicity, one of a series of six compounds: compound 1 ((4-(3-iodophenyl)-3,4-dihydrobenzo[h]quinolin-2(1H)-one); compound 2 (4-(3-bromophenyl)-3,4-dihydrobenzo[h]quinolin-2(1H)-one); compound 3 (4-(5-bromo-2-fluorophenyl)-6,7-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone); compound 4 (4-(3-bromo-4-fluorophenyl)-6,7-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone); compound 5 (4-(4-ethyl)-6,7-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone); compound 6 ((4R)-6-bromo-4-(4-ethylphenyl)-3,4-dihydrobenzo[h]quinolin-2(1H)-one); was introduced and the expression profile assayed at 4 hours.
