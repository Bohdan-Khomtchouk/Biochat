SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to define the molecular signatures of prednisolone and BMS-791826 in normal healthy volunteers. IM125001 (NCT03198013) is a phase I, placebo-controlled, double-blind, ascending single and multiple oral dose study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bms-791826 and to assess its marker specific pharmacodynamics in relation to prednisolone in healthy males, sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb.

DESIGN
Total RNA from normal healthy volunteers taking prednisolone, BMS-791826 or placebo over time were collected.
