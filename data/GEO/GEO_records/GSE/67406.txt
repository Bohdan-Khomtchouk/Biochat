TITLE
The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Mist1 overexpression in mouse fetal hepatoblast culture

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the molecular mechanism of Mist1 during hepatoblasts differentiation, we performed gene expression analysis in Mist1 over-expressed cells. Dlk+ hepatoblasts derived from E13 fetal livers were purified. Purification of Dlk+ cells were performed using anti-Dlk antibody after hematopoietic cells were removed. Cells were infected with mock or Mist1-overexpressing retroviruses and cultured for 3days with oncostatin M.

DESIGN
Virus infection was performed at the day primary culture was began (day0). Oncostatin M was added at day 1 and the cells were collected at day3. Two independent experiments were performed.
