TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from H1N1 influenza virus infected mouse lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Influenza A virus is a kind of single negative-stranded RNA virus which belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family. It can cause localized outbreak or worldwide epidemic in a short time for its great contagiosity, fast spread speed and a wide range of host, and H1N1 influenza virus is a strong pathogenic subtype of influenza A virus. Influenza A virus infection has been shown to alter miRNA expression both in cultured cells and in animal models. We used microRNA microarrays to detail the programme of microRNA expression and identified distinct classes of differentially regulated microRNAs during this process.

DESIGN
Mice lungs infected with PR8 H1N1 influenza virus were separately selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microRNA microarrays. We sought to obtain microRNAs expression level in different stages of infection. To that end, we selected two time-points: 2 days and 5 days.
