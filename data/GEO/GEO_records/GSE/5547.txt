TITLE
Host Susceptibility to H. ducreyi Infection is Associated with Unique Transcript Profiles in Tissue and Dendritic Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression from subjects who resolved or formed pustules to H.ducreyi. In human inoculation experiments, the cutaneous immune response to Haemophilus ducreyi consists of serum, PMN, macrophages, T cells and myeloid DC.  In reinfection experiments, some subjects form pustules twice (PP group) or resolve infection twice (RR group).  Although pustule formation is associated with serum resistance and phagocytic failure, there are no differences in the ability of isolated phagocytes or serum obtained from PP and RR subjects to ingest or kill H. ducreyi.  To identify the basis for differential host susceptibility to H. ducreyi, we used microarrays to profile gene expression in infected and uninfected tissue and monocyte-derived DC obtained from PP and RR subjects.  In infected tissue, both groups had a core response to H. ducreyi.  Many additional transcripts that signify active immune function were upregulated exclusively in RR tissue, while PP tissue exclusively contained differentially regulated transcripts consistent with immune dysregulation.  The core response of infected DC from both groups was typical of a DC1 response.  RR DC exclusively expressed many additional transcripts indicative of DC1 function, while PP DC uniquely expressed differentially regulated transcripts characteristic of both DC1 and DCreg.  The data suggest that DC from PP and RR subjects are prewired to respond differentially to H. ducreyi. Keywords: comparison of two phenotypes, resolver and pustule former
