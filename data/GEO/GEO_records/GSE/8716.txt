TITLE
A ChIP-chip analysis of E2F family in normal and tumor cells reveals interchangeable roles of E2F family members

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using ChIP-chip assays, we examined the binding patterns of three members of E2F family in five different cell types. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
We used ENCODE arrays to determine the loaction of E2F family, then identify their binding motifs in vivo. We used promoter arrays to assess the relationship of E2F family in five different cells including tumor and normal cells.
