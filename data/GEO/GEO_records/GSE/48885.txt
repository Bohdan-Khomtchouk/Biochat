TITLE
Expression profiling of long noncoding RNAs and mRNAs in mouse heart, whole blood (WB), and plasma.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNA profile in the heart, whole blood, and plasma before and heart failure (HF).

DESIGN
In the study presented here, we mixed the five pairs of mouse hearts, whole blood, and plasma before and after HF and identified the genome-wide expression level of lncRNAs.
