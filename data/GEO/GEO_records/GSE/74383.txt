TITLE
Targets of ROR2 overexpression in MCF-7 cells revealed a differentially regulated module of non-canonical WNT signaling pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq profiling of estrogen-receptor-positive MCF-7 cell lines with different perturbations of non-canonical WNT signaling . The MCF-7 cells were either transfected with an empty vector (pcDNA) or with a ROR2 overexpression construct, in parallel with or without stimulation with recombinant WNT5A. The objective was to find expression-responsive targets of these perturbations as potential drivers of increased cell invasiveness.

DESIGN
Four conditions of MCF-7 cells each in 3 replicates:  1. empty vector (pcDNA),  2. empty vector (pcDNA) with WNT5A stimulation, 3. ROR2 overexpression construct, 4. ROR2 overexpression construct with WNT5A stimulation

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
