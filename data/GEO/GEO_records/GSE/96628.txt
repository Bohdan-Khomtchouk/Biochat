TITLE
Expression data from C57BL/6 wild type and MK2-deleted lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine splenic dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Upon toll-like receptor (TLR) ligation, dendritic cells (DCs) undergo an activation process referred to as maturation. Over the course of maturation, global DC gene expression is severely altered, resulting in phenotypic changes including DC morphology, migration, immune stimulatory and inhibitory receptor expression, cytokine production, etc. We performed microarray analysis to investigate changes in gene expression patterns between wild type and MK2-deleted murine splenic DCs over time (0 - 24 hours) following TLR stimulation by LPS.

DESIGN
CD11c+ DCs were isolated from whole spleens of C57BL/6 WT and CD11cCre-MK2fl/fl mice via magnetic beads, and stimulated in vitro by LPS. Cells at time points 0, 4 hours and 24 hours post-stimulation were harvested and subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix 2.0 ST arrays.
