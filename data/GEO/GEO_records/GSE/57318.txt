TITLE
Novel culture conditions facilitating the induction of na√Øve pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a novel culture condition inducing naive pluripotency in hESCs in a rapid, robust and reproducible way. These naive hESCs were similar to mESCs exhibiting domed colony morphology, increased single survival, reduced doubling time, upregulation of naive pluripotency-specific genes, unbiased lineage-specific differentiation, hypomethylation, separate clustering profile from parental primed hESCs and were dependent on signalling pathways similar to naive mESCs.

DESIGN
Global DNA methylation analysis of naive hESCs and their parental primed hESC counterparts.
