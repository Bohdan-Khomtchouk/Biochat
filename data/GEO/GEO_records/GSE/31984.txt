TITLE
Genome-wide copy number analysis for occult lymph node metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using Affymetrix Mapping 250K array, we studied copy number aberrations in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) to identified biomarkers associated with occult lymph node metastasis. We used frozen specimens from 60 OSCC patients.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis was performed using homogenized samples of 60 oral squamous cell carcinoma patients by GeneChip Human Mapping 250k Sty arrays. As a reference, SNP array data set of 50 normal Asians (Japanese & Chinese) from HapMap database was used.
