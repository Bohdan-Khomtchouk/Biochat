TITLE
Cysteine deprivation in liver cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
First experiment: Cells were cultured in sulfur amino acid-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1 mM methionine + 0.1 mM cysteine (complete) or supplemented only with 0.1 mM methionine (cysteine-free).  Cells were cultured in either medium for 42 h (Long + Cys; Long -Cys) or in cysteine-free medium for 36 h followed by 6 h in complete medium (Short +Cys) Second experiment: C3A/HepG2 cells were cultured in sulfur amino acid-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1 mM Met and 0.1 mM Cys (complete) or supplemented only with 0.1 mM Met (cysteine-devoid).  Cells were cultured in complete medium for 42 h (Long +Cys) or in complete medium for 36 h followed by cysteine-devoid medium for 6 h (Short -Cys). Keywords: amino acid deprivation

DESIGN
First experiment: Three plates of cells were cultured under each condition.  Cells were cultured in sulfur amino acid-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1 mM methionine + 0.1 mM cysteine (complete) or supplemented only with 0.1 mM methionine (cysteine-free).  Cells were cultured in either medium for 42 h (Long + Cys; Long -Cys) or in cysteine-free medium for 36 h followed by 6 h in complete medium (Short +Cys). Second experiment: C3A/HepG2 cells were cultured in sulfur amino acid-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1 mM Met and 0.1 mM Cys (complete) or supplemented only with 0.1 mM Met (cysteine-devoid).  Cells were cultured in complete medium for 42 h (Long +Cys) or in complete medium for 36 h followed by cysteine-devoid medium for 6 h (Short -Cys).
