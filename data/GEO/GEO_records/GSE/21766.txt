TITLE
Replacement diets in gilthead sea bream

ORGANISM
Sparus aurata

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of adipose tissue comparing three diets with different levels of replacement of fish oil for vegetable oils.

DESIGN
Juvenile gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) of 16 g initial mean body weight were distributed into 9 fibreglass tanks (500 l) in groups of 60 fish at the research experimental facilities of IATS. Each group received (from May 23rd to September 19th) one of the three experimental diets nominally CTRL, 66VO and VO. All diets were based on plant proteins and dietary oil was either Scandinavian FO (CTRL diet) or a blend of vegetable oils, replacing the 66% (66VO diet) and 100% (VO diet) of FO. Four samples, using a control diet (CTRL) as reference and double color hybridization and dye swap with the other two (66VO, VO)
