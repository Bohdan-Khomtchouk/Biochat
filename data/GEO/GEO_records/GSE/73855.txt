TITLE
Loss of BAF (mSWI/SNF) complexes causes global transcriptional and chromatin state changes in forebrain development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the genome-wide increase in H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in murine embryonic cortices as a result of conditional double knock-out (dcKO) of BAF155/BAF170 complex.

DESIGN
1) Comparison of H3K27me3 levels in murine cortical tissues from embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) in Emx1-Cre BAF155/BAF170 dcKO and controls. 2) Comparison of H3K27me3 levels in murine cortical tissues from postnatal day 1 (P1) in Nex-Cre BAF155/BAF170 dcKO and controls.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
