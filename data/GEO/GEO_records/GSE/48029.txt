TITLE
Expression data of Jurkat cells stably expressing HBZ with or without stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) encodes HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), which is thought to be crucial for neoplastic and inflammatory diseases caused by HTLV-1. So, we analyzed the transcriptional profile of HBZ expressing cells and how HBZ affect the expression of apoptosis-related genes. We used microarrays to detail the effect of HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), which is encoded in the minus strand of HTLV-1 genome on gene expression. Especially how HBZ affect the expression of apoptosis-related genes.

DESIGN
Jurkat cells stably expressing HBZ were stimulated with or without PMA and ionomycin for 9hours. Then  RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays were performed.
