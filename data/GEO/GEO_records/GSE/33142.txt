TITLE
ICL002: Time course of Calu-3 cells infected with Influenza A/VN/1203/04

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose of experiment was to perform transcriptomics on Calu- 3 cells infected with Influenza A/VN/1203/04.

DESIGN
Calu-3 cells were infected with Influenza A/VN/1203/04, at MOI of 1.0.  Cells samples were collected at 0, 3, 7, 12, 18, and 24 h post infection. Each infected sample was done in duplicate. (Duplicates are defined as 2 different wells, plated at the same time using the same cell stock for all replicates.)There is one time-matched mock for each time point from the same cell stock as rest of samples. Culture medium (the same as what the virus stock is in) was used for the mock infections. The NIAID Systems Virology Center
