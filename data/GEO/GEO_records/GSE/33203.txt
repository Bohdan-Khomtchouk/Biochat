TITLE
DNA microarray data from transgenic rice KMD and its parent XS11

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
KMD is genetically engenered to be highly resistant to lepidopteran pests through expressing a synthetic cry1Ab gene and its parent non-transgenic rice is Xiushui 11 (XS11). Many unintended effects have been discovered in KMD. We used microarrays to study the molecular basis  for unintended effects of KMD rice.

DESIGN
Samples were collected from both KMD and XS11 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We selected differentially expressed genes hoping to clarify the molecular basis for unintended effects in KMD.

PLATFORM
GPL2025 [Rice] Affymetrix Rice Genome Array
