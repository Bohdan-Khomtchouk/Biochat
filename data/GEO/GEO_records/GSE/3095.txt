TITLE
Analysis of SCOTS effect on transcript population

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
The cDNA obtained before and after each round of SCOTS (first, second and third) from 2 h post-infection were hybridized to analyse the effect of SCOTS round on transcripts population. The number of detected genes increase with the numer of round of SCOTS. Because the cDNA prepared by 3 round of SCOTS gave the best results, three round of SCOTS were used in the preparation of the other samples. Keywords: Evaluation of SCOTS round
