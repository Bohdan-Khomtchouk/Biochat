TITLE
High-resolution custom array spanning Xq28 region to study patients carrying MECP2 copy number gain (part 1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to determine the size, genomic extent and gene content of each Xq28 rearrangement.

DESIGN
We designed a tiling-path oligonucleotide microarray spanning 4.6 Mb surrounding the MECP2 region on Xq28. The custom 4x44k Agilent Technologies microarray was designed using the Agilent earray website. We selected 22,000 probes covering ChrX: 150,000,000-154,600,000 (NCBI build 36), including the MECP2 gene, which represents an average distribution of 1 probe per 209 bp. Each patient sample was run once using this array; hybridization was done using a gender-matched reference sample.
