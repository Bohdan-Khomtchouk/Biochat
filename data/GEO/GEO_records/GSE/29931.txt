TITLE
Analysis of the enzymes involved in PEN5 carbohydrate metabolism

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dr. Eric Vivier's lab would like to tackle the enzymes involved in PEN5 carbohydrate metabolism. We have generated these cell lines by repeated cell sorting and cell cloning of the parental HSB-2 T cell line and the parental JY B cell line. H+ are PEN5+ HSB-2 cells, H- are PEN5- HSB-2 cells; JY+ are PEN5+ HSB-2 cells, JY- are PEN5- HSB-2 cells.

DESIGN
We have originally described a cell surface molecule called PEN5, as a sulfated lactosamine, that is selectively expressed on a mature subset of human NK cells (Vivier, J. Exp. Med. 1993). Later, we have shown that the PEN5 carbohydrate decorates PSGL-1, confering L-selectin binding properties (Andr√© et al. PNAS, 2000). We have recently performed a Glycan Array Screening via Core H (Glycomics 917). These studies indeed reveal a very nice binding of the anti-PEN5 mAb to a subset of sulfated lactosamines. We would like to tackle the enzymes involved in PEN5 carbohydrate metabolism. We thus requesting a Gene microarray analysis performed using RNA extracted from PEN5+ and PEN5- NK cells, as well from the H+, H-, JY+ and JY- stable cell lines. We have generated these cell lines by repeated cell sorting and cell cloning of the parental HSB-2 T cell line and the parental JY B cell line. H+ are PEN5+ HSB-2 cells, H- are PEN5- HSB-2 cells; JY+ are PEN5+ HSB-2 cells, JY- are PEN5- HSB-2 cells. RNA preparations from variants of the HSB-2 (human T leukemia) and JY (human B lymphoma) cell lines, which were express or not PEN5 were sent to Microarray Core (E).  These stable variants are referred to as H+ (HSB-2 cells expressing PEN5), H- (HSB-2 cells NOT expressing PEN5), JY+ (JY cells expressing PEN5), and JY- (JY cells NOT expressing PEN5).  Samples were prepared at 3 different time points.  The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays.  Data was sent to Dr. Eric Vivier for analysis.
