TITLE
Expression data from FACS purified nociceptor neurons from peripheral sensory ganglia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to analyze global gene expression in specific populations of nociceptor sensory neurons, the neurons that detect damaging/noxious stimuli. The dorsal root ganglia (DRG), trigeminal ganglia, and nodose ganglia are anatomically distinct peripheral sensory ganglia that contain nociceptors which innervate skin, gut, lungs, and other distinct organ tissues.  We used flow cytometry to purify nociceptors from these ganglia and profiled their global gene expression signatures to compare gene expression between these different anatomically distinct nociceptors.

DESIGN
Nav1.8-Cre were bred with Rosa26-TdTomato to generate Nav1.8-Cre/R26-TdTomato reporter progeny, where all peripheral nociceptor neurons are genetically marked with red fluroescence due to specific expression of the TTX- resistant sodium channel Nav1.8.  Lumbar region dorsal root ganglia (DRG), trigeminal ganglia, and nodose ganglia were dissected from mice (3 mice were pooled/sample).  Highly red fluorescent neurons were Facs purified, RNA extracted, and processed for microarray analysis.
