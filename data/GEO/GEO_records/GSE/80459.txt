TITLE
Dual role of the adaptive immune system in liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma  development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify pro-tumorigenic signaling cascades in livers of Fah-/- mice, gene expression patterns were compared between tumor prone Fah-/- mice and immunocompromised mice in which tumor development was found to be reduced

DESIGN
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) comparing hepatic Fah(-/-) cells  [tumor:Fah_off, Fah_2xoff/on] vs FCR (normal, inflamed liver: FCR_100%, FCR_2xoff/on)

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
