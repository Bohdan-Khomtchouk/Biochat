SUMMARY
Gene expression of peripheral regions and central regions from HT-29 tumors

DESIGN
Sample tissues were immediately frozen by liquid nitrogen after isolation. Total RNAs were extracted from samples with a PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Life Technologies). The integrity of total RNAs was evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit, one-color (Agilent Technologies) was used to prepare Cy3-labelled target cRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled cRNAs were hybridized with a SurePrint G3 Human GE 8×60K Microarrays (Agilent Technologies). Three separate hybridizations were performed for each sample. Array images were captured using a DNA Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies), and data were analyzed using Feature Extraction Software (Agilent Technologies) to obtain background-corrected signal intensities. Data were further analyzed with GeneSpring GX Software (Version 11.0, Agilent Technologies). After data filtering, mRNAs differentially expressed in target cells versus controls were assessed by Fisher’s exact test, followed by multiple corrections using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method. Gene sets with a FDR q-value < 0.05 were considered to be significant.
