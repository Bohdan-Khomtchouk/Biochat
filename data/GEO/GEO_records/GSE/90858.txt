TITLE
M.tuberculosis H37Rv: Control vs. anti-TB compound treated

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
To monitor the anti-tuberculosis compound IMB-YH-8 induced gene response profile at an early stage, we treated logarithmically growing M. tuberculosis with IMB-YH-8 at the concentration of 2.5 μg/ml throughout the first 4 hr.

DESIGN
There four samples are analyzed and two replicates are included. The drug-treated (2.5 μg/ml IMB-YH-8), together with control (DMSO) mycobacterial cultures, were incubated at 37℃for 4 h.
