TITLE
Chip-SIP analysis of Monterey Bay surface waters incubated with organic carbon substrates

ORGANISM
marine metagenome

SUMMARY
October 2013 surface seawater collected from Monterey Bay was incubated with 1 micromolar 13C labeled glucose, starch, acetate, lipids, protein, or amino acids for 12 hours. Community RNA was extracted and hybridized to a Roche Nimblegen microarray and analyzed by NanoSIMS to obtain isotope ratio data for all probe spots.

DESIGN
Two Chips for fluorescence, and 15 Chips for different substrates from samples incubated for 12 or 36 hours.

PLATFORM
GPL20727 NimbleGen marine metagenome array [XM_Nov2012_RMB]
