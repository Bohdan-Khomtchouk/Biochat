TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of Drosophila melanogaster testes and seminal vesicles/testes terminal epithelium.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Testes and testes terminal epithelium/seminal vesicles were dissected and separated from 4-5 day old Oregon-R-modENCODE Drosophila melanogaster males.  RNA-sequencing was then performed on these two distinct biological structures.

DESIGN
Testes and testes terminal epithelium/seminal vesicles were dissected and separated from 4-5 day old Oregon-R-modENCODE Drosophila melanogaster males on two consecutive days resulting in two biological replicates.  Total RNA was immediately extracted and used to prepare poly-A RNA-seq libraries.  Single-end 50 bp sequencing was performed on all four samples and mapped to the Flybase Drosophila melanogaster release 6.06 genome.

PLATFORM
