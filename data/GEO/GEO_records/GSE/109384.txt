TITLE
Roles of the Brca2 and Wapl complexes with Pds5 in sister chromatid cohesion, cohesin localization, and gene expression [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The Pds5, Wapl and Brca2 proteins were mapped by ChIP-seq, and the effects of their depletion on the binding of cohesin subunits and the Nipped-B cohesin loader were examined by ChIP-seq

DESIGN
Comparison of sister chromatid cohesion protein binding in control ML=DmBG3-c2 cells and cells depleted for proteins regulating sister chromatid cohesion proteins This series includes input samples re-used from GSE83959 and GSE100548

PLATFORM
GPL19528 Ion Torrent Proton (Drosophila melanogaster)
