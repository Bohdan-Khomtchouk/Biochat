TITLE
Gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) and heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression patterns of the iCMs shift from a MEF state toward a cardiac-like phenotype by Gata4/Mef2c/Tbx5 (GMT) or GMT/miR-133 transduction at 3, 7 and 18 days after transduction (D3, D7 and D18) MiR-133 silenced fibroblast signatures in parallel with cardiac gene activation, and Snai1 overexpression inhibited the effects of miR-133-mediated cardiac reprogramming.

DESIGN
MEFs were used for negative control, mouse heart tissue for positive control. Gene expression profiles were compared among MEFs, iCMs and heart. 23474 probes were analyzed in each experiment.
