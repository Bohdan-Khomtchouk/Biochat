TITLE
The genome and development-dependent transcriptomes of Pyronema confluens: a window into fungal evolution

ORGANISM
Pyronema omphalodes

SUMMARY
This transcriptome analysis accompanies the genome sequencing of Pyronema confluens for purposes of annotation and gene expression quantification. P. confluens is a basal filamentous ascomycete that forms primitive fruiting bodies (apothecia) to generate its sexual spores. We have performed RNA-seq for two growth conditions allowing only vegetative growth and one condition allowing sexual development to identify genes that are differentially regulated during fruiting body formation.

DESIGN
The samples sex (sexual development), DD (growth in darkness, no sexual development), and vegmix (pool of several conditions, no sexual development) were sequenced as paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000, two independent biological replicates for each sample, two technical replicates for each biological replicate (each library was sequenced twice in two independent flow cells).
