TITLE
MicroRNA Expression Profiles identify genes of apoptosis, anabolism and catabolism in patients with Intervertebral Disc Degeneration different from Spinal Trauma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The pathogenesis of IDD is still unclear, and microRNA has been reported playing an important role in occurrence and development of many diseases. But to date, the research about the role of microRNA in IDD is rare.

DESIGN
To compare the differences of microRNA expression profiles between intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and spinal trauma, and to screen the changed microRNA for further pathogenesis research of IDD.The microRNAs expression of 3 degenerative intervertebral disc (IVD) specimens and 3 traumatic intervertebral disc specimens were individually analyzed using microarray technique
