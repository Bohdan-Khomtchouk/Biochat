TITLE
Interaction between bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell and neuroblastoma cells leads to a VEGFA-mediated increase in osteoblastogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify signature genes associated with increased osteoblastic phenotype in response to co-culture of  mesenchymal  and neuroblastoma cells

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from co-cultured mesenchymal and neuroblastoma cells. In parallel RNA from Doxycycline treated cells was used as control. Gene expression profiling was performed using Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 BeadChipTM

PLATFORM
