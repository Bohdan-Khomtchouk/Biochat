TITLE
Expression data from E12.5 embryonic kidneys isolated from wild-type and Ret-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To better understand the signaling and transcriptional events involved in the GDNF-independent emergence of the ureteric bud from the Wolffian duct, microarray expression analysis was performed on embryonic kidneys from wild-type and Ret-deficient mice.  Microarray data was used to identify genes and gene networks involved in the GDNF-independent outgrowth of the ureteric bud.

DESIGN
Whole embryonic kidneys from E12.5 Ret mutant and wild-type mice were isolated.  Isolated kidneys were lysed and RNA was extracted with the Qiagen RNEasy Micro kit.  The RNA was amplified using the NuGEn Ovation kit and hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Whole Genome 430 2.0 microarray.  Three biological replicates for Ret-knockout and wild-type kidneys were performed.
