TITLE
Comparison of Bradyrhizobium japonicum parent strain LO with irr mutant strain LODTM5

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium japonicum

SUMMARY
The purpose of the study is to identify Irr-responsive genes in the bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Parent strain LO was compared to irr mutant strain LODTM5 by whole genome microarray analysis. Both cell types were grown in iron-limited media. Keywords: Comparison of B. japonicum wild type and mutant cells

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from three biological replicates for each cell type, and prepared for microarray analysis using Affymetrix chips. A complete description of these experiments are found in Yang et al., (2006) Mol. Microbiol. 60:427-437.
