TITLE
The maize pericarp color1 gene is regulated by RdDM and non-RdDM types of chromatin silencing

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
This study compared the molecular basis underlying the differential regulation of p1 alleles/epialleles by mop1 to understand molecular mechanism maintaining the tissue specific silencing.

DESIGN
Genome-wide small RNA profiling was done by Illumina TruSeq sample preparation followed by high-throughput sequencing with Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL15463 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Zea mays)
