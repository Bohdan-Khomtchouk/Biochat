TITLE
Role of S. cerevisiae Hap1 in oxygen-regulation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Expression microarray experiments were performed to identify all of the aerobic and hypoxic transcripts in wild-type cells.  The role of Hap1 in the regulation of transcription was examined by monitoring gene expression in hap1 deletion cells. Keywords: gene expression, strain comparison, response to hypoxic conditions

DESIGN
Three replicates were performed for wild-type cells, and three replicates for hap1 deletion cells.  Biological replicates were performed in each case, with separate cultures grown on different days.  For each microarray, an aerobic sample was compared to a hypoxic sample.
