TITLE
Role of S. cerevisiae Hap1 in oxygen-regulation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Expression microarray experiments were performed to identify all of the aerobic and hypoxic transcripts in wild-type cells.  The role of Hap1 in the regulation of transcription was examined by monitoring gene expression in hap1 deletion cells. Keywords: gene expression, strain comparison, response to hypoxic conditions
