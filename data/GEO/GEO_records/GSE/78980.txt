SUMMARY
Prolonged skeletal unloading through bedrest results in bone loss similar to that observed in elderly osteoporotic patients, but with an accelerated timeframe.  This rapid effect on weight-bearing bones is also observed in astronauts who lose up to 2% of their bone mass per month spent in Space. Despite important implications for Spaceflight travellers and bedridden patients on Earth, the exact mechanisms involved in disuse osteoporosis have not been elucidated.  Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulates many physiological processes including skeletal development, and has been proposed as a gravisensor.  To investigate the role of PTHrP in microgravity-induced bone loss, trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) from Pthrp+/+ and -/- mice were exposed to simulated microgravity for 6 days.  Viability of TOs decreased in inverse proportion to PTHrP expression levels. Microarray analysis of Pthrp+/+ TOs after 6 days at 0g revealed expression changes in genes encoding prolactins,apoptosis and survival molecules, bone metabolism and extra-cellular matrix composition proteins, chemokines, IGF family and Wnt-related signalling molecules.  Importantly, 88% of 0g-induced expression changes in Pthrp+/+ cells overlap those observed in Pthrp-/- cells in normal gravity.  Pulsatile treatment with PTHrP1-36 peptide during microgravity exposure reversed a large proportion of 0g-induced changes in Pthrp+/+ TOs.  Our results confirm PTHrP efficacy as an anabolic agent to prevent microgravity-induced cell death in TOs.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples extracted from Pthrp+/+and -/- trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) exposed for 6 days to simulated 0g in Synthecon rotating cell, or left 6 days in culture at 1g.  Cells had either been treated with a pulsatile treatment (2 h/day) of PTHrP1-36 peptide (10-8M) or received a change in growth medium.  In total: 8 different conditions with 2 replicates each, i.e. Pthrp+/+ TOs at 0g or 1g with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment, and Pthrp-/- TOs at  0g or 1 g,with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment.
