TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae Met30 temperature-sensitive strain

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The target of rapamycin (TOR) plays a central role in eukaryotic cell growth control. With prevalent hyper-activation of the mTOR pathway in human cancers, novel strategies to enhance TOR pathway inhibition are highly desirable. We used a yeast-based high-throughput chemical genetic screen to identify small-molecule enhancers of rapamycin (SMERs) and used whole genome expression analysis to identify their mechanisms of action.

DESIGN
We incubated Met30 temperature-sensitive yeast strain at either the permissive (room temperature) or non-permissive (35Â°C) temperature for 1 hour prior to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  Comparison of expression profiles enabled identification of gene-signature characteristic of Met30 inhibition.
