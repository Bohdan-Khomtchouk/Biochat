TITLE
DNA methylome profiling at single-base resolution through bisulfite sequencing of 5mC-immunoprecipitated DNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we have developed MB-seq, a novel DNA methylome profiling technology combining MeDIP-seq with bisulfite conversion, which can precisely detect the 5mC sites and determine their DNA methylation level at single-base resolution in a cost-effective way. In addition, we have developed a new alternative method, MRB-seq (MeDIP-repetitive elements removal-bisulfite sequencing), which interrogates 5mCs in functional regions by depleting nearly half of repeat fragments enriched by MeDIP. Comparing MB-seq and MRB-seq to whole-genome BS-seq using the same batch of DNA from YH peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We found that the sequencing data of MB-seq and MRB-seq almost reaches saturation after generating 7-8 Gbp data, whereas BS-seq requires about 100 Gbp data to achieve the same effect. In comparison to MeDIP-seq and BS-seq, MB-seq offers several key advantages, including single-base resolution, discriminating the methylated sites within a CpG and non-CpG pattern and overcoming the false positive of MeDIP-seq due to the non-specific binding of 5-methylcytidine antibody to genomic fragments.
