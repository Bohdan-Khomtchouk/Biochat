TITLE
PolyA RNAseq from HCT116 cells in normoxia and hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the effects of depleting TIP60, CDK8, or HIF1A on the transcriptional response to hypoxia, we performed RNAseq analysis of four HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell lines (shNT, HIF1A-/-, shTIP60 and shCDK8) in normoxic and hypoxic (24hrs, 1% O2) conditions.

DESIGN
PolyA RNA for two independent biological replicates was purified from HCT116 cells stably expressing an shRNA against a non-targeting control (shNT), TIP60 (shTIP60) or CDK8 (shCDK8), or genetically deleted HIF1A (HIF1A-/-) subjected to 24hrs 1% O2 (hypoxia) or maintained under ambient oxygen (21%; normoxia) was sequenced on the Ion Torrent platform. Reads were aligned to the human genome and gene-level counts were used for differential expression analysis.
