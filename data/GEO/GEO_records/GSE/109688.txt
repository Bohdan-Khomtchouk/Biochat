TITLE
Ovarian cancer cell line response to Snail depletion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of mouse ovarian cancer cell line HM-1 transfected with shRNA targeting Snail, an EMT inducer. Anti-tumor immuty in state of EMT remains unclear. We focused on Snail, a major EMT inducer, and explored the influence of Snail on immune ivasion into ovarian tumors by generating Snail knockdown cell line. Elucidating the mechanisms of Snail-induced immune evasion will lead to the development of novel treatment strategies for tumor undergoing EMT.

DESIGN
HM-1 mouse ovarian cancer cells were transfected with GIPZ Lentivial Mouse Snai1 shRNA sh1, sh2 and non-silencing control.
