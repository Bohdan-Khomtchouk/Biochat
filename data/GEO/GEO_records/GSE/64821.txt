TITLE
Novel HDAC inhibitors exhibit pre-clinical efficacy in lymphoma models and point to the importance of CDKN1A expression levels in mediating their anti-tumor response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
investigate the pre-clinical activities of two novel histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), ITF-A and ITF-B, in a large panel of pre-clinical lymphoma models

DESIGN
GEP analysis of 2 lymphoma cell lines with and without treatment
