TITLE
Expression data from amiEBBB1 poplar apices

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
We study gene expression Populus amiEBB1  lines affecting dormancy. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying morphological and developmental changes droved by expression of artifical micro RNA (ami) targeting EBB1 gene. By screening activation tagging population we identified the EARLY BUD-BREAK1 (EBB1) mutant. We positioned the tag, localized a putative candidate gene and verified transcription activation. The activated gene encodes an AP2/ERF  transcription factor similar to a small B1 gene-subfamily in Arabidopsis encoding strong regulators of meristem function and lateral organ outgrowth.  We fully recapitulated the phenotype by overexpression of the gene into the same genotype under strong constitutive promoter (P35S::EBB1).  We also found that EBB1 transcript abundance in wild type plants increases during the period prior to bud-break, and in response to the hormone cytokinin.  Down-regualtion of EBB1 influence negatively bud break. Our data indicates that EBB1 plays a important role in the process of bud-break.

DESIGN
Poplar apex was selected  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We used apices tissue from amiEBB1 grown greenhouse healthy plants.
