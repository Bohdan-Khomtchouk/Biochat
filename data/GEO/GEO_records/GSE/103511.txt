TITLE
Gene expression profiling of experimental-induced pulmonary fibrosis in subcutaneous bleomycin-treated mice vs EXT-treated mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole genome gene expression levels in distal lung tissue from mice with systemically bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The hypothesis is that bleomycin promotes a specific genotype associated with development of pulmonary fibrosis and that treatment with compound EXT reduces the induction of genes related to the early progression of fibrosis.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from distal lung tissue after 2 weeks s.c. treatment with bleomycin, with or without p.o. treament with EXT5 or EXT9. Comparisons of gene expression levels were made with healthy controls vs bleomycin-treated mice, with or without EXT-treatment. 6 mice (biological replicates) per treatment group were analyzed. Data were presented from two Ilumina microarray analyses with samples 1-7 and 8-14 included in first run. Second run contained samples 22-27 and 36-42, along with samples 3, 5, 7, 12 and 14 (re-analyzed) for the verification of non existing interassay variation. Data were presented as combined data from two seperate arrays. The arrays and analysis were performed by SCIBLU Genomics facility, Lund University (Lund, Sweden) and NBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden).
