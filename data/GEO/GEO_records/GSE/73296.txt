TITLE
Effect of Cnot7 expression on 4T1 mammary tumor cell line transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine what the effect of modulating Cnot7 expression levels would have on the steady state transcription program of the 4T1 mammary tumor cell line.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates for over expression compared to vector control. Three biological replicates for two different shRNAs versus shScramble control
