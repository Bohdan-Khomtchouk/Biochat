TITLE
Whole genome bisulfite sequencing of idm1, rdd, ros1 mutants and Col-0 WT

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing to provide single-base resolution of DNA methylation status in ros1, idm1, and rdd mutants and identify hypermethylated regions comparing to wild type Arabidopsis plants.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different mutants' methylome. 8 samples (3 mutants, 1 WT, each has two biological replicates)

PLATFORM
GPL11221 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Arabidopsis thaliana) GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
