TITLE
Phase II trial melphalan ILI plus ADH-1 for treatment of in-transit extremity melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An evaluation of biopsies from patients with in-transit extremity melanoma who have been treated with ADH-1 followed by melphalan in the setting of isolated limb infusion Gene expression profiles were obtained from 28 lesions across 15 patients and evaluated for expression values that correlated with ADH-1 treatment given 4-8hrs prior to melphalan isolated limb infusion

DESIGN
Chemotherapy response analysis:  complete response - CR; partial response - PR; stable disease - SD; progressive disease - PD; lost to follow-up - LTU/F ADH-1 treatment classification:  'pre' - lesions obtained prior to any treatment with ADH-1; 'post' - lesions obtained just prior to ILI with melphalan after 1 treatment with ADH-1; '2nd' - lesions obtained after a 2nd dose of ADH-1 given 8 days after melphalan ILI
