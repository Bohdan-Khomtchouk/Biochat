SUMMARY
Gene expression profile of Pafah2-deficient bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) treated with w3 epoxides or GW9662

DESIGN
To investigate gene expression changes induced by w3 epoxides (a mixture of 17,18-EpETE and 19,20-EpDPE) or PPARg antagonist (GW9662) treatment in mast cells,  we performed microarray gene profiling of Pafah2-deficient BMMCs treated with them. Pafah2-deficient BMMCs were treated with a mixture of the synthetic w3 epoxides (17,18-EpETE/19,20-EpDPE = 2/3; 300 nM), whose compositions mimicked those detected in the conditioned medium of wild-type BMMCs, or GW9662 (0.5 μM) for 12h. DMSO was used as a vehicle.  We found that several hundreds of genes were up- or down-regulated by w3 epoxides or GW9662 treatment, and hundreds of genes down-regulated by  ω3 epoxides or GW9662 were intriguingly overlapped.
