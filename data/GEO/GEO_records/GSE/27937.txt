TITLE
Long non-coding RNAs detected in Plasmodium falciparum malaria using high-resolution DNA tiling microarray technology.

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum 3D7

SUMMARY
Survey of transcriptional activity across 22.6% of the P. falciparum strain 3D7 genome. 872 protein coding genes and 60 putative P. falciparum lncRNAs identified under developmental regulation during the parasite's pathogenic human blood stage.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from synchronous in vitro parasite cultures at 18, 24, 30, and 36 hours post invasion (hpi) of red blood cells. 1 Î¼g of total RNA was then subjected to poly-A selective amplification using Message Amp II (Ambion), substituting biased dNTP/NTP mixes (2A/T/U:1C/G). The resulting aRNA was labeled with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), using random hexamers, and either Cy3- or Cy5-dUTPs (Amersham).
