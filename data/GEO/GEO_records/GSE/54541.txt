TITLE
Field of Cancerization in Peripheral Airway Epithelium: miRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Field of cancerization in the airway epithelium has been increasing examined to understand early pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer. This study uses microarray high-throughput technologies to characterize the molecular aberrations in the terminal airway and bronchoalveolar cells in the context of field cancerization in high-risk smokers and lung cancer patients.

DESIGN
We collected peripheral airway brushings from the contral-lateral lung of the tumor from cancer patients (n=17) and smoker controls (n=13); Total RNA were obtained from the peripheral airway epithelium.
