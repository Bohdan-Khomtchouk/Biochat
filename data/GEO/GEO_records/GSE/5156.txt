TITLE
Impact of intestinal colonization on Paneth cell gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study delineated how small intestinal resident microflora impact gene expression in Paneth cells. Keywords: functional genomics; transcriptional profiling

DESIGN
Paneth cells were isolated by laser capture microdissection from the small intestines of germ-free and conventionalized (10 day) mice. RNAs from 3 mice per group were pooled, and duplicate RNAs from each group were amplified and hybridized to Affymetrix arrays.
