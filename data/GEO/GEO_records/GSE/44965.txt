TITLE
Human cholangiocarcinoma (CC), ECC (extrahepatic CC) and ICC (intrahepatic CC) cases versus control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CpG island methylation profiling of human cholangiocarcinoma, ECC and ICC, cases compared to matched normal controls or to pools of corresponding normal controls. Goal was to identify cholangiocarcinoma-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs).

DESIGN
Highly methylated DNA from cases and controls was enriched by methyl CpG-immunoprecipitation (MCIp) and co-hybridized. DMRs were defined by stepwise stringent criteria such as selecting top 5% vicinal array probes only. ECC- and ICC-specific and common DMRs were identified.
