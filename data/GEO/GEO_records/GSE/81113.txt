TITLE
A comparison of microRNA expression profiles from splenic hemangiosarcoma, splenic nodular hyperplasia, and normal spleens of dogs

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Splenic masses are common in older dogs and may be malignant, benign, or non-neoplastic; yet diagnosis preceding splenectomy and histopathology remains elusive.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 18-25 nucleotide, single stranded, non-coding RNAs that play a role in post-transcriptional regulation. MicroRNAs in tumor samples have been used to diagnose tumors, provide prognostic information, and aid in targeted treatments in human medicine, but have not been extensively evaluated in veterinary medicine. The objective of this study was to determine differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) between canine splenic hemangiosarcoma, canine splenic nodular hyperplasia, and normal canine spleens by use of RNA-sequencing. Eighteen miRNAs were found to be significantly differentially expressed between hemangiosarcoma and nodular hyperplasia only.  The five of these with the largest fold change were mir-193a, mir-450a, mir-503, mir-542, and mir-876.  Four miRNA were significantly differentially expressed between hemangiosarcoma and nodular hyperplasia and also hemangiosarcoma and normal spleen (mir-126, mir-150, mir-203, and mir-452). Findings of this study show that miRNA expression profiles are different between canine splenic hemangiosarcoma, nodular hyperplasia, and normal spleens.  This is a preliminary study with findings of clinical relevance, as masses of the spleen cannot be diagnosed pre-operatively in most cases.  Canine splenic masses are relatively common, and validation these findings is warranted for potential use as a diagnostic test.

DESIGN
A total of fifteen samples total were analyzed for miRNA expression. There were 3 experimental condition with 5 replicates in each group.
