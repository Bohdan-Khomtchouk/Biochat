TITLE
Arraystar circRNA array data for foam cells formation in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced macrophages model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The phagocytosis of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) by monocyte-derived macrophages and the subsequent differentiation of  macrophages into foam cells are the key steps in atherogenesis. Our study provides a potential new therapeutic strategy to alleviate oxLDL accumulation and foam cell formation.

DESIGN
The THP-1 were pretreated with 100 nM PMA for 48 h, stimulated with oxLDL (50 mg/ml) for 24h and then collected for detection.The cells in control group were only treated with PMA for 48h. Three independent experiments were performed at each group.
