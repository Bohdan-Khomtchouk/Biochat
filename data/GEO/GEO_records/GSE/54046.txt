TITLE
Insm1 cooperates with Neurod1 and Foxa2 to maintain mature pancreatic β-cell function (Insm1, Neurod1 and Foxa2 ChipSeq data from pancreatic beta cell)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide Insm1 binding sites analysis revealed an overrepresentation of sequences predicted to bind bHLH and/or forkhead factors, and further analyses demonstrated that most Insm1 sites in the genome are co-occupied by Neurod1 and Foxa2. Binding regions co-occupied by all three factors but not single Insm1 sites explained a significant fraction of gene expression changes in Insm1 mutant β-cells. Together, our data provide evidence that an Insm1, Neurod1 and Foxa2 network maintains a mature gene expression program in β-cells.

DESIGN
6 samples include, replicates of Insm1 and Foxa2, IgG pull down as a control

PLATFORM
