TITLE
Functional genomic analysis of the impact of camelina (Camelina sativa) meal on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) distal intestine gene expression and physiology

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
Fish were fed a standard fish meal (FM) diet or a diet with partial replacement of FM with solvent extracted camelina meal (CM) (8%, 16% or 24% CM inclusion) during a 16-week feeding trial. A significant decrease in growth performance was seen in fish fed the CM inclusion diets. A 44k oligonucleotide array experiment was used to identify any differentially expressed transcripts in the distal intestine of the fish fed the 24% CM diet compared to the control. The expression level of these genes was validated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, which was also used to measure transcript expression in the fish fed the 8% CM and 16% CM diets. Histopathological analysis was used to quantify any physical signs in inflammation in the distal intestine of the Atlantic salmon fed the CM-containing diets.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, 0% CM vs 24% CM, Biological replicates: 9 control replicates, 9 expermiental replicates
