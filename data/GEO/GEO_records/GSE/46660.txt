TITLE
All Differentially Expressed miRNA in burned murine skin tissue compared to normal skin tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Interactions between stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) and its cognate receptor CXCR4 are crucial for the recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow (BM) reservoirs to damaged tissues for repair during alarm situations. MicroRNAs are differentially expressed in stem cell niches, suggesting a specialized role in stem cell regulation. Here, we gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating SDF-1α. Individualized outcome prediction classifiers were successfully constructed through expression profiling of microRNAs (in all organisms as annotated in Sanger miRBase Release 11.0 ( http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk ))in one burned murine skin tissue compared to normal skin tissue,which had 57 upregulated microRNAs and 28  down-regulated microRNAs

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a consecutively operated, well-defined cohort of 2  cases, was used to acquire expression profiles of microRNAs(in all organisms as annotated in Sanger miRBase Release 11.0 ( http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk )), leading to the successful construction of supervised .
