SUMMARY
Comparative RNA-Seq study of expression in Gossypium hirsutum nectaries

DESIGN
Tissue types and stages: RNA was isolated from four types of nectaries (foliar, bracteal, circumbracteal, floral) at two or three different stages for each (pre-secretory, secretory and/or post-secretory). In parallel, RNA was also isolated from control samples from tissues adjacent to each nectary type. A total of 51 RNA samples were isolated as described below. Foliar nectary stages included: pre-secretory ('FO_pre_x'; lack of visible nectar and midvein length of 5 to 6 cm on main stem leaf; 2 replicates), secretory ['FO_S_x'; fully mature main stem leaf (midvein length 12 to 15 cm) with visible nectar, 1 replicate], and post-secretory ('FO_P_x'; lack of visible nectar on fully mature main stem leaf; 3 replicates). In parallel, RNA was also isolated from control samples from tissues adjacent to the foliar nectaries (labeled 'FO_pre_xC', 'FO_S_xC' and 'FO_P_xC' where 'x' refers to a sample number). Bracteal nectary stages included: pre-secretory ('B_pre_x'; matchhead square, 2 replicates) and post-secretory ('B_post_x'; 19 to 24 days after anthesis; 3 replicates). In parallel, RNA was also isolated from control samples from tissues adjacent to the bracteal nectaries (labeled 'B_pre_xC' and 'FO_post_xC' where 'x' refers to a sample number). Circumbracteal nectary stages included: pre-secretory ('C_pre_x'; matchhead square; 3 replicates) and post-secretory ('C_post_x'; 19 to 24 days after anthesis; 3 replicates). In parallel, RNA was also isolated from control samples from tissues adjacent to the circumbracteal nectaries (labeled 'B_pre_xC' and 'FO_post_xC' where 'x' refers to a sample number). Floral nectary stages included: pre-secretory ('FL_pre_x'; Candle, 24 hours pre-anthesis), secretory ('FL_sec_x'; anthesis), and post-secretory ('FL_post_x'; 24 hours post-anthesis). In parallel, RNA was also isolated from control samples from tissues adjacent to the floral nectaries (labeled 'FL_pre_xC', 'FL_S_xC' and 'FL_P_xC' where 'x' refers to a sample number.
