TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of human ependymal and ventral horn regions in adult control spinal cord

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adult human ependymal and ventral horn regions were obtained from postmortem frozen samples by Laser Capture Microdissection. Briefly, Cryostat 25 micron sections from were stained with toluidin blue and both regions microdissected and collected on eppendorf (n=4 for each region). Samples mRNA concentration and purity was assessed by electrophoresis (BioRad Experion HighSensitivity kit, USA). RQI values were lower than 6,5 in every case, so that purification was followed by 2 cycle amplification with a kit designed for highly degraded samples (ExpressArt® TRinucleotide mRNA Amplification Kit; #6299-A15, AmpTec, AMSBIO, UK). After amplification, mRNA concentration and purity was assessed both by electrophoresis (BioRad Experion StSens kit, USA) and by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop, Thermo Scientific, USA). We amplified 3.7-37 ng of total RNA, obtaining between 6 and 21 µg of mRNA after 2 rounds. After collecting samples and studying the RNA integrity and quantity, cDNA of samples was selected for gene expression assays using 384 wells Custom Taqman Low Density Arrays. We built arrays with genes belonging to a profile of stemness or ependymoma (see Garcia-Ovejero et al., 2015, BRAIN).

DESIGN
Taqman based qPCR gene expression profiling.  Ependymal and ventral horn regions obtained by LCMD from four different individuals each were used to establish genes involved in stem cell niches or in ependymoma phenotype that are enriched in control human ependyma using ventral horn as a non-ependymary, non-neurogenic region. Samples were treated as stated in the summary. Equal amount of amplified RNA (aRNA; 25ng, corresponding approximately to 500ng total RNA) from each donor was used in Custom Designed Taqman Low Density Arrays. Every value is the resultant of duplicates at least, but most of them have been assayed 4 times.
