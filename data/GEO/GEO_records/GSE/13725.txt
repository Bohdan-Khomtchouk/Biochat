TITLE
Peripheral WBC from Brahman and Holstein-Friesian cattle infested with the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
This trial was undertaken to examine the perhipheral cellular and antibody response of cattle following infestation with the cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus. The information from the Affymetrix gene expression data is used to complement other measurements of immune function such as cellular subset composition and antibody response in cattle of high (Brahman) and low (Holstein-Friesian) resistance to the cattle tick. Keywords: Disease state analysis
