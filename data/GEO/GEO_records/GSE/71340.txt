TITLE
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy modulates T cell responses in high-grade serous ovarian cancer metastases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our data suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy enhances anti-cancer responses of T cells in peritoneal metastases of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer but does not decrease levels of immune checkpoint molecules, providing a rationale for sequential chemo-immunotherapy.

DESIGN
tRNA was isolated from 35 omental tissue samples of HGSOC metastases either pre or post NACT treatment. RNASeq was performed on poly-A selected mRNA fragments, 100 b.p paired end, and strand specific, on average 40 million reads per sample.
