TITLE
Conditional liver NIPP1 KO micro array on total liver RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal is to investigate genes that are more or less expressed due to the removal of NIPP1 in mouse epithelial liver cells. In this way we hope to unravel the function of NIPP1 in vivo.

DESIGN
4 control and 4 conditional knockout mice were sacrificed. No replicates were performed. Samples were analyzed using the Mouse GE 4x44K v2 Microarray (gene expression microarray).

PLATFORM
GPL10333 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Feature Number version)
