TITLE
Transcriptome response to genistein in zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To test wether endocrine disruption is detectable in zebrafish at the transcriptome level, we exposed newly fertilized zebrafish embryos to low doses of genistein (EC10 and EC20) for 48 hours.

DESIGN
Newly fertilized embryos ( < 2hpf) were exposed to 2.2 mg/l (EC10) and 2.4 mg/l (EC20) genistein for 48 hours. Since aceton was used as a solvent for genistein, an acetone solvent control in addition to the water (ISO) control was included in the study. Overall, four replicates were performed per condition, each consisting of 24 pooled embryos.
