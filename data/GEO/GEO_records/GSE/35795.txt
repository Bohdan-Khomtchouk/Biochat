TITLE
Urinary bladder in constant darkness: time course

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of urinary bladder in wild-type C57BL/6 females sacrificed every 4 hours at six time points under constant darkness after acclimation for 2 weeks under 12-hour light and 12-hour dark conditions. Results provide insight into circadian gene expression patterns in normal urinary bladder.

DESIGN
Analysis of urinary bladder in wild-type C57BL/6 females sacrificed every 4 hours at six time points (n=2 for each time (CT 0, 4, 8, 12 and 20)) under constant darkness after acclimation for 2 weeks under 12-hour light and 12-hour dark conditions.
