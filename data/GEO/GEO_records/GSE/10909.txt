TITLE
NUP98/HHEX  a new oncogenic fusion with acute myeloid leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have cloned and characterized a fusion gene NUP98/HHEX1 resulting from t(7;10) from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). As NUP98/HHEX acts as an aberrant transcriptional activator, putative targets were searched upon transient expression of the fusion in primary murine bone marrow cells. Keywords: Comparative analysis of NUP98/HHEX, NUP98/HOX vs. MIG (empty virus) in primary bone marrow cells

DESIGN
Murine bone marrow cells were transduced with a retrovirus (MSCV-IRES-GFP, MIG) expressing either NUP98/HHEX or NUP98/HOXA9  (or the empty vector), mRNA was isolated after 72h. Each experiment was performed in triplicates.
