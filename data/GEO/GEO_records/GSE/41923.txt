TITLE
Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of two distinct interconvertible DNA methylomes of mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study describes the DNA methylation profiling using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of mouse ES cells, either derived and maintained in 2i serum-free NDiff medium, or in the presence of serum and LIF, or maintained and derived in the presence of serum and LIF and subsequently adapted to 2i serum-free NDiff medium, or maintained and derived in the presence of 2i and LIF and subsequently adapted to 2i serum.

DESIGN
DNA methylation profiling using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of 14 samples, 3 different lines (E14, XT67E1, Rex/GFP-2i)  of pluripotent mouse ES cells as well during conversion from 2i to serum and vice versa.
