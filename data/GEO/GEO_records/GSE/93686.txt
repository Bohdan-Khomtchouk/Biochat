TITLE
Transcriptomic study of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi biofilm

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi

SUMMARY
Six sequencing libraries was prepared from S. Typhi planktonic cells and biofilm cells using Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing to investigate differential gene expression between the two conditions. The transcriptome was processed using Cufflinks and there were a total of 35 up-regulated genes and 29 down-regulated genes log2-fold change values of greater than 2 and less than negative 2. The differentially expressed genes were identified using BLAST and the functions was analysed. This study provides an overview of the genes that are differentially expressed in S. Typhi when it transitions from the planktonic to the biofilm phenotype. The data will provide a basis for further study is necessary to uncover the mechanisms of biofilm formation in S. Typhi and discovery of novel gene functions or pathways associated with the development of the typhoid carrier state. This data may also be used to elucidate the effect of biofilm on the virulence and pathogenicity of S. Typhi in chronic carriers.

DESIGN
Examination of two sequencing libraries from planktonic and biofilm cells of S. Typhi
