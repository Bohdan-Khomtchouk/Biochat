TITLE
Diabetes Impairs Wound-Healing by let-7d-3p-dependent DNMT1 Upregulation in Hematopoietic Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify microRNAs which differentially expressed in hematopoietic stem cells from wt mice and db/db mice We used microRNA microarrays to identify miroRNAs which can directly regulate dnmt1 expression in hematopoietic stem cells

DESIGN
The microRNAs expression in hematopoietic stem cells from wt mice and DB/DB mice were measured
