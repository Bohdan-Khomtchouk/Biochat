TITLE
Identification of candidate adherent-invasive E. coli signature transcripts by genomic/transcriptomic analysis

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli HS ; Escherichia coli LF82

SUMMARY
Our aim was to identify candidate transcripts that distinguish AIEC from non-invasive E. coli (NIEC) strains and might be useful for rapid and accurate identification of AIEC by culture-independent technology.  We performed comparative RNA-Sequence (RNASeq) analysis using AIEC strain LF82 and NIEC strain HS during exponential and stationary growth.

DESIGN
Triplicate Luria broth cultures (37o C) of LF82 and HS were grown with continuous shaking for 2 hours (exponential phase) and 24 h without shaking (stationary phase).
