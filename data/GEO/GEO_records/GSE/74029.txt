TITLE
Quadruplex ligand Tetra-Pt(bpy) Induces the Death of Human ALT Cancer Cells by Inhibiting Homologue Recombination-Mediated Telomere Elongation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The RNA-seq results reveal Tetra-Pt(bpy) has no effect on gene expression.

DESIGN
Examination of the gene expression of the following cells: MRC5-untreated and Tetra-Pt(bpy)-treated HeLa-untreated and Tetra-Pt(bpy)-treated U2OS-untreated and Tetra-Pt(bpy)-treated
