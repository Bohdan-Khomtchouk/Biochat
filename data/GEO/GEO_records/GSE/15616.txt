TITLE
Increased antigen cross-presentation but impaired cross-priming after activation of PPARγ

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Increased antigen cross-presentation but impaired cross-priming after activation of PPARγ is mediated by up-regulation of B7H1 Dendritic cells (DCs) are able to take up exogenous antigens and present antigen-derived peptides on MHC class I molecules, a process termed cross-presentation. The mannose receptor (MR), an endocytic receptor expressed on a variety of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), has been demonstrated to target soluble antigens exclusively towards cross-presentation. In this study, we investigated the role of the murine nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a ligand-activated transcription factor with immunomodulatory properties, in MR-mediated endocytosis and cross-presentation of the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA). We could demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that activation of PPARγ resulted in increased MR expression, which in consequence led to enhanced MR-mediated endocytosis and elevated cross-presentation of soluble OVA. Concomitantly, activation of PPARγ in DCs induced up-regulation of the co-inhibitory molecule B7H1, which, despite enhanced cross-presentation, caused an impaired activation of naive OVA-specific CD8+ T cells and the induction of T cell tolerance. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the immunomodulatory action of PPARγ which might open new possibilities in development of therapeutical approaches aimed at the control of excessive immune responses, e.g. in T cell-mediated autoimmunity.
