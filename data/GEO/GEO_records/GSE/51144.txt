TITLE
Characterization of the genetic mouse model of non-small cells lung cancer p53R172H∆g/KrasG12D

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 81% of all cases of lung cancer and they are often fatal because 60% of the patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Besides the need for earlier diagnosis, there is a great need for additional effective therapies. In this work we investigated the feasibility of a lung cancer progression mouse model, mimicking features of human aggressive NSCLC cancer, as biological reservoir for potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Results:RNA-seq profiling was performed on total RNA extracted from lungs of 30 week-old p53R172H∆g/KrasG12D and wild type mice to detect fusion genes and gene/exon-level differential expression associated to the increase of tumor mass. Fusion events were not detected in p53R172H∆g/KrasG12D tumors. Differential expression at exon-level detected 33 genes with differential exon usage. The study provides a complete transcription overview of the p53R172H∆g/KrasG12D mouse NSCLC model

DESIGN
Lung mRNA profiles of 30-week old wild type (WT) and p53R172H∆g/KrasG12D mice were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate using Illumina HiSeq2000.
