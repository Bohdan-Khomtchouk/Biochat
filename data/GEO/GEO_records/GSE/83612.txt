TITLE
Gene expression profiling of neutrophils and whole lung tissue from wildtype and Nrf2 null (Nfe2l2-/-) mice during S. pneumoniae pneumonia [whole lung]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Nrf2 (gene symbol Nfe2l2) regulates the transcriptional response to oxidative stress and plays a critical protective role in the lungs. These studies tested the role of Nrf2 during pneumonia induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) at 24 hours in mice and identified Nrf2-dependent genes and pathways in lung tissue and in recruited neutrophils.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from whole lungs obtained from wildtype (WT) and Nrf2 null mice 24 hours after intratracheal instillation of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) or an equivalent volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  Gene expression was profiled using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.1 ST arrays (Santa Clara, CA, USA).
