TITLE
15.5dpc Ureteric tree cells Vs rest

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Triplicate pairwise comparsion of FACS sorted GFP+ve Vs GFP-ve cells from the kidneys of the HoxB7-GFP transgenic mice on compugen 22K mouse arrays. HoxB7-GFP mice express GFP in the ureteric tree and its derivatives while the metanephric mesenchyme, interstitium, developing vasculature etc do not. Keywords: repeat sample
