TITLE
Analysis by RNAseq of the transcriptome of different stage of skin carcinogenesis induced by topical application of DMBA/TPA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total RNA extracted from biopsies of healthy skin, papilloma, SCC Tumor and of 2 cell lines isolated from these tumors were purified using miRNeasy minikit (Qiagen). RNA libraries were then generated with the NEB next small library prep set for SOLID (New England Biolabs) and sequenced on the Applied Biosystems SOLiD 5500 wildfire system following the manufacturer's instructions.

DESIGN
1 sample of Healthy skin (S), two samples of 2 distinct papilloma (P1 and P2), 1 tumor sample (T), 1 sample of  non tumorigenic mSCC-20 cells and 1 sample highly tumlorigenic SCC cells  (mSCC-38)

PLATFORM
GPL16790 AB 5500 Genetic Analyzer (Mus musculus)
