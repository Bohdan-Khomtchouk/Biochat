TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in M. tuberculosis TrxB2-TetON-tetO-WT mutant treated or not with atc

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
M. tuberculosis thioredoxin reductase (TrxB2) is essential for Mtb physiology and pathogenesis. To gain insight into its biological functions, we generated the TrxB2-TetON-tetO mutants, in which TrxB2 is partially depleted in the absence of atc without impairing bacterial viability.

DESIGN
We grew TrxB2-TetON-tetO-WT in 7H9 medium with 400 ng/ml atc, until the OD reached 0.5~0.6. Then Mtb was washed with 7H9 medium 3 times and suspended in 7H9 medium with or without atc. Then samples were taken 24, 48, 72 and 120 hrs later.
