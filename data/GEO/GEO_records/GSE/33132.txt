TITLE
Expression data from purified control and BrdtÎ”BD1 round spermatids.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Brdt is a testis specific member of a family of chromatin interacting proteins. All of the family members have been shown to regulate transcription. Brdt is highly expressed in round spermatids, and may play a role in transcriptional regulation in these cells. We investigated transcriptional changes in mutant round spermatids that were homozygous for a mutation in which the first bromodomain of Brdt was removed.

DESIGN
Round spermatids were purified from seven adult animals of each genotype for each Affymetrix microarray. Purity of round spermatids was assessed by propidium iodide staining.
