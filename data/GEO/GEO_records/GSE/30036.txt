TITLE
Reshaping of the maize transcriptome by domestication

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Through domestication, humans have substantially altered the morphology of Zea mays ssp. parviglumis (teosinte) into the currently recognizable maize.  A wealth of archeological and population genetic data has established maize as a model system for studying domestication , genome evolution and the genetics and evolution of complex traits.  We used expression profiling of 18,242 genes for 38 diverse maize genotypes and 18 teosinte genotypes to examine how domestication has re-shaped the transcriptome of maize seedlings.  We detected evidence for more than 600 genes having significantly different expression levels in maize compared to teosinte as well as 800 genes with significantly altered co-expression profiles reflective of substantial rewiring of the transcriptome since domestication.  These genes likely include loci with altered expression due to domestication.  The genes with altered expression show a significant enrichment for genes located in regions that previous population genetic analyses have identified as having undergone a selective sweep during maize domestication; thirty-two genes previously identified as putative targets of selection also exhibit altered expression levels and co-expression relationships.    We also identified 45 genes with altered, primarily higher, expression in inbred relative to out-crossed teosinte.  These genes are over-represented for genes that function in response to biotic stress and may reflect responses to the effects of inbreeding.  This study not only documents alterations in the maize transcriptome following domestication and identifies several genes that may have contributed to the evolution of maize but also highlights the complementary information that can be gained by combining gene expression with population genetic analyses.
