TITLE
Distinct skeletal muscle gene regulation from active contraction, passive vibration, and whole body heat stress in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used a novel approach to study the acute effect of three physiologic stressors (active contractions, vibration, and systemic heat stress) in human skeletal muscle. Three hours after the completion of a dose of physiologic stress, we sampled the soleus (contraction and vibration) or vastus lateralis (heat) muscle and developed a unique gene expression signature for each stressor. We discovered repetitive active muscle contractions up regulated metabolic transcription factors NR4A3 (12.45 fold change), PGC-1α (5.46 fold change), and ABRA (5.98 fold change); and repressed MSTN (0.56 fold change).  Heat stress repressed PGC-1α (0.74 fold change); while vibration induced FOXK2 (2.36 fold change).  Vibration similarly caused a down regulation of MSTN (0.74 fold change), but to a lesser extent than active muscle contraction.  Vibration induced FOXK2 while heat stress repressed PGC-1α (0.74 fold change) and ANKRD1 genes (0.51 fold change).  These findings support a distinct gene regulation in response to heat stress, vibration, and muscle contractions.  Understanding these responses may assist in developing regenerative rehabilitation interventions to improve muscle cell development, growth, and repair.

DESIGN
We analyzed skeletal muscle using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Partek Genomic Suites.
