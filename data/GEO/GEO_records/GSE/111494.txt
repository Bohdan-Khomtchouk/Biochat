TITLE
Expression data of control and adult-induced Bcl11b mutant dentate gyrus granule cells 4 weeks after induction.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bcl11b plays an important role in postnatal dentate gyrus development and adult neurogenesis. To determine its role in adult neurogenesis independant from postnatal development the Bcl11b mutation was induced at the age of 2 months. Microarray analysis was performed on RNA isolated 4 weeks after the induction of the Bcl11b mutation to determine Bcl11b target genes.

DESIGN
Control and mutant dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells were isolated by laser capture microdisection and RNA isolated. Transcriptome analysis was performed by BRB-ArrayTools.

PLATFORM
