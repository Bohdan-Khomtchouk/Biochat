TITLE
Profiling of MCF-7 cell lines stably overexpressing (ca)Raf-1, (ca)MEK, (ca)erbB-2, or ligand-activatable EGFR.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Profiling of MCF-7 cell lines stably overexpressing constitutively active Raf-1, constitutively active MEK, constitutively active c-erbB-2, or ligand-activatable EGFR as models of overexpressed growth factor signaling, as well as control vector transfected cells (coMCF-7) and control vector transfected cells long-term adapted for estrogen-independent growth (coMCF-7/lt-E2). Keywords: Cell Line Comparison
