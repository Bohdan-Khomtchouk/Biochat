TITLE
Expression data from human THP-1 monocytes stimulated with increasing concentrations of arachidonic (AA) or oleic acid (OA).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previous data indicated tha AA and OA modify global DNA methylation. This study analyzes the impact of these fatty acids on expression as a complement to array-based DNA methylation data. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from THP-1 monocyte stimulated with 1, 10 or 100uM AA or OA for 24h.

DESIGN
RNA extracted from the same cells used for array-based DNA methylation analysis (see corresponding data in published article) was used to produce expression data by Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST v2 Array
