TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of PB-Oct4.2A.cherry iPS-/-, PB-Oct4.2A.cherry (low) iPS-/- and ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have generated iPS cell lines with constitutive Oct4 expression at ES-cell level or 3 times lower. The aim of the experiment was to compare the global gene expression profile between these two cell lines and also between each of them and wild type ES cells.

DESIGN
We have analysed two biological replicates of each cell line
