TITLE
Long noncoding RNA expression profiles in sub-lethal heat treated hepatoma carcinoma cells. (SMMC-7721 cells: sub-lethal heat treated vs. untreated)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of SMMC-7721 cells comparing control untreated with sub-lethal heat treated cells (50°C for 10 min). Differentially expressed lncRNA and mRNA were measured with an Agilent Human lncRNA+mRNA Array V4.0 (4 × 180 K format) containing 41,000 lncRNAs and 34,000 mRNAs. Goal was to determine the effects of sub-lethal heat treatment on global hepatoma carcinoma cells gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, sub-lethal heat treated vs. untreated cells. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 experimental replicates. Please note that experiments were carried out technically as dual channel (eg, Cy3 and Cy5-labeled samples hybridized to the same array) but the data was processed as though they are single channel (Cy3 and Cy5 signals are calculated insted of Cy3/Cy5 ratios).  Therefore three raw data files (for total 6 samples) are linked as Series supplementary files and the corresponding raw data file is indicated in the sample description field.

PLATFORM
GPL20115 Agilent-067406 Human CBC lncRNA + mRNA microarray V4.0 (Probe name version)
