TITLE
affy_petaldvt_lyon_rose: Flower/Petal initiation and development in roses

ORGANISM
Rosa hybrid cultivar

SUMMARY
affy_petaldvt_lyon_rose. The objective is to identify genes involved in petal development in rose. We aim at identifying genes whose expression correlates with flower opening and scent emission. In this study, we used a microarray approach to compare the transcriptome of a scented rose flower (PF) versus non-scented rose flower (RF). Samples (petal tissues) were collected at the same time early in the afternoon. Total RNA was extracted using the Plant RNA kit (Macherey Nagel), and then used to hybridize Rosa-Affymetrix microarrays. Keywords: scented vs non-scented flowers

DESIGN
4 arrays - rose. Scented and non-scented flowers, 2 replicates each.

PLATFORM
