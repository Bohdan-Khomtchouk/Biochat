TITLE
In silico analyses guides selection of BET inhibitors for triple negative breast cancer treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an incurable disease with poor prognosis. At this moment, therapeutic options are limited to chemotherapy and no targeted agent has reached the clinical setting. Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibitors are a new family of compounds that inhibit bromodomain containing proteins affecting the expression of transcription factors (TFs), therefore modifying the expression of relevant oncogenic genes. We decided to performed gene-set enrichment analyses to get insights into the mechanism of action of these compounds.

DESIGN
We treated cells with JQ1 and extracted RNA at 12 and 24 hours.
