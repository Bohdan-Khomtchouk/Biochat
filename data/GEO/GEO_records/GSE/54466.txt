TITLE
The plasma membrane NADPH oxidase OsRbohA plays a crucial role in developmental regulation and drought-stress response in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Plasma membrane NADPH oxidases (NOXs) are major producers of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells under normal growth and stress conditions. Rice NOXs have multiple homologs but their functional mechanisms are largely unknown. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression profiles in rice wild-type (WT, Dongjin) and a mutant osnox2 which loss the functions of OsNOX2 protein under drought and identified distinct classes of genes between the two type rice plants under both normal growth and drought stressed conditions.

DESIGN
The youngest fully expanded leaves from 2.5-month-old WT and osnox2 plants (three replicates each), grown under normal growth (soil moisture, 47.3%) and drought conditions (soil moisture, 8.5%), were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Control: normal growth condition; Drought: drought stress condition.
