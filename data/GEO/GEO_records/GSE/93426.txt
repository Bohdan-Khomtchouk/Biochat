TITLE
Global Gene Expression Profiles of Postnatal Myocardium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The present study was to investigate the differentially expressed genes in 24-hour-old (containing proliferative cardiomyocytes), 7-day-old (containing the burst of proliferative cardiomyocytes), and 10-week-old (containing growth-arrested cardiomyocytes) C57BL/6 mouse hearts using global gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
The transcriptomic profiles of the samples at the three time points (24-hour old, 7-day old , and 10-week old of postnatal stage) were analyzed by direct comparison of the transcriptional level between the three groups of heart on the same custom Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. There are three replicates at each timepoint.
