TITLE
4C-seq analysis of the BX-C in S2 cells and cells expressing wild type or SAM mutant Polyhomeotic

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
4C-seq analysis using three viewpoint sequences in the Drosophila Bithorax Complex of Hox genes. 4C contacts were compared among S2 cells and those expressing wild type or SAM mutant Ph.

DESIGN
Two replicates from each cell line for each of three viewpoints were carried out. 6 samples per lane were sequenced.
