TITLE
Expression data from prostate cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have investigated Perineural invasion (PNI) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related gene expression profiles of PC cell lines. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from laminin binding O-glycan high or low androgen-independent PC cells. These data are used to obtain 70 genes that are differentially expressed in response to cell migraton signal via laminin receptors.

DESIGN
4 Total samples were analyzed. We generated the following pairwise comparisons using GeneSpring Gx Version12.6:  PC3-H vs PC3-L; LNCaP vs LNCaP-AI. Genes with an FDR≤10% and a fold-change ≥2 were selected.
