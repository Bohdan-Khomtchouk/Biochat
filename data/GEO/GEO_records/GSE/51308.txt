TITLE
LncRNA/mRNA expression profiling for 10 human samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By using the method of “small samples for high throughput screening + large samples for validation”, to find the risk-related long non-coding RNAs and encoding-genes in gastric cancer. To improve the level of clinical diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer by studying the biological function and its molecular mechanism of these molecules

DESIGN
Identification of risk-related coding RNAs and lncRNAs that are diffrentially expressed in gastric cancer by comparing 5 gastric cancer tissues and 5 adjancent normal tissues.

PLATFORM
GPL15314 Arraystar Human LncRNA microarray V2.0 (Agilent_033010 Probe Name version)
