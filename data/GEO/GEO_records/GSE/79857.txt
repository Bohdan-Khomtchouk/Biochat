TITLE
Expression data from HHG affected and unaffected Vulpes vulpes gingival samples

ORGANISM
Vulpes vulpes

SUMMARY
Hereditary hyperplastic gingivitis (HHG) is a progressive growth of gingival tissues in foxes resulting in dental encapsulation. It is an autosomal recessive condition displaying a sex-biased penetrance, with an association with superior fur quality.  The goal of this study was to explore potential molecular or cellular mechanisms underlying HHG by analysis of global gene expression patterns from Affymetrix Canine 2.0 microarrays cross-referenced.

DESIGN
HHG affected and unaffected Vulpes vulpes gingival samples were collected either during pelting season or in the late spring after whelping season. Diagnosis of HHG was made based on early markers of the disease where red, raised, granular gingival tissue was present at the dental margins on the crowns of the teeth. RNA was extracted and hybridization on Affymetrix Canine 2 microarray.
