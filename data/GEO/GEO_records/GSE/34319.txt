TITLE
Transcriptome Sequencing of Life Stages and Tissues of the Yellow Fever Mosquito Ae. aegypti

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq was used for transcriptome sequencing of 11 samples covering various life stages and tissues from the yellow fever mosquito Ae. aegypti.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from described samples for RNA-Seq. Samples included four embryonic time points from 0-12 hr, larvae, pupae, adult males, 0-1 day old ovaries, ovaries from 24 post blood fed females, and 24 hr post blood fed female carcass (ovaries extirpated). Raw data not available for GSM847403, GSM847404, GSM847405, and GSM847406

PLATFORM
