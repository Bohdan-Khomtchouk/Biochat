TITLE
DNA methylation and copy number abnormalities (CNA) of malignant rhabdoid tumors originating within and outside the central nervous system

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multifocal synchronous or metachronous central nervous system (CNS) and extra-CNS malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) are rare and deadly cancers. To further understand these cancers, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation and CNA analysis in 27 tumors (16 of which were paired samples). 26 samples were newly generated and one sample was from a previously published cohort of MRTs. We compared our results with the previously published reference group of 150 atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors. We showed that that CNS and extra-CNS MRTs for the most part clustered in distinct methylation groups and had heterogeneous molecular characteristics.

DESIGN
Twenty-seven human MRTs (CNS [n=13] and extra-CNS [n=13]) were profiled using Illumina Infinium Human 450K (n=1, GSM1755246 [GSE70460] or 850k Bead Array (n=26). This series includes the re-analyzed data of 150 samples from GSE70460.  The entire data matrix with the average beta values for all 176 analyzed samples is available at the foot of this page.
