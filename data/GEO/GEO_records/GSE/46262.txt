TITLE
Studies on progenitor endothelial cells; exploring mechanisms for improvement of cardiovascular diseases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analysis of primary CD34+ cells. CD34+ cell were induced in vitro with hypoxia (3 hours), high glucose and high glucose plus hypoxia. Subsequently, the effect of metformin (anti-diabetic drug) on all conditions was studied to take advantage of transcriptomics to prospectively explore the mechanism of this drug to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases in type II diabetic patients.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from 20 samples; 10 different conditions each has 2 repeats; labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array.
