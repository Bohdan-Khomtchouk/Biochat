TITLE
Hormone induced repression of genes requires BRG1-mediated H1.2 deposition at target promoters

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this report we have discovered a new function of BRG1 during hormone-mediated gene repression. The ATPase BRG1 without the other subunits of the BAF complex is recruited by the hormone receptor to genomic sites marked by the pioneering factor FOXA1, where it remodels the target chromatin by interacting with linker histone H1.2 facilitating its deposition.

DESIGN
T47D human breast cancer cells were incubated with the progestin R5020 for different times and prepared for RNA-seq and ChIP-Seq according published protocols.
