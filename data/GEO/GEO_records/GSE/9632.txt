TITLE
Gene expression profiles of RAW264.7 macrophage cells treated with Paeony root-derived compounds

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Paeony root has long been used for its anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, the effects of albiflorin, paeoniflorin, and paeonol, compounds from paeony root, on gene expression profiles were examined in macrophages. The RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with LPS in the presence or absence of albiflorin, paeoniflorin, or paeonol. Global mRNA expression levels were detected by using an oligonucleotide microarray platform covering the mouse whole genome. Our results demonstrate that paeonol has extensive inhibitory effects on the regulation of inflammation-associated gene expression by LPS in macrophages. In addition, the predominant effect of paeonol among the tested compounds suggests that paeonol may be a major ingredient for the anti-inflammatory effect of paeony root. Keywords: RAW264.7; macrophage; inflammation; LPS; Paeony root components; dose response
