TITLE
HIF-1 dependent gene expression upon S. aureus infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIF-1 is an important transcription factor for immune responses to bacterial infection. We wanted to analyze the HIF-1 dependent gene expression upon S. aureus infection and analyzed the gene expression of HepG2 nt and HepG2 HIF-1-/- cells four hours upon infection using affymetrix human gene 1.0 st. gene arrays.

DESIGN
triplicates of HepG2 nt and HepG2 HIF-1-/- cells were infected with S. aureus 8325-4 (4 h, MOI: 20), triplicates of uninfected cells were used as control

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
