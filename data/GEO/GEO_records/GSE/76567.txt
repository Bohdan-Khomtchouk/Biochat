TITLE
Transcriptomic Analysis of the Hippocampus from Six Inbred Strains of Mice Suggests Basis for Sex-Specific Susceptibility and Severity of Neurological Disorders

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identifying sex differences in gene expression within the brain is critical for determining why multiple neurological and behavioral disorders differentially affect males and females. Several are more common or severe in males (e.g., autism and schizophrenia) or females (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease and depression). We analyzed transcriptomic data from the mouse hippocampus of six inbred strains (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C57BL/6J, DBA/1J, DBA/2J and PWD/Ph), to provide a perspective on differences between male and female gene expression. Our data show that: 1) significant gene expression differences in males versus females varies substantially across the strains, 2) 12 genes exist that are differentially expressed across the inbred strains (termed core genes), and 3) there are > 2,600 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the strains (termed non-core genes). We found that DBA/2J uniquely has a substantial majority (89%) of DEGs that are more highly expressed in females than males; 129/SvImJ is the most strongly male-biased with a majority (69%) of DEGs that are more highly expressed in males. To gain insight into the sex-biased DEGs, we examined gene ontology, pathway and phenotype enrichment and found significant enrichment in phenotypes related to abnormal nervous system morphology and physiology, among others. In addition, several pathways are enriched significantly, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with 32 genes implicated in AD, 8 of which are male-biased. Three of the male-biased genes have been implicated in a neuroprotective role in AD. Our transcriptomic data provide new insight into understanding the possible genetic bases for sex-specific susceptibility and severity of brain disorders.

DESIGN
Hippocampal mRNA from adult males and females of six inbred strains of mice were analyzed by RNA sequencing of 3 biological replicates using an Illumina HiSeq 2500
