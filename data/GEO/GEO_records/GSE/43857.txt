TITLE
Patterns of Population Epigenomic Diversity in Arabidopsis thaliana (Methyl-Seq)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Natural epigenetic variation provides a source for the generation of phenotypic diversity, but to understand its contribution to phenotypic diversity, its interaction with genetic variation requires further investigation.

DESIGN
MethylC-seq from naturally-occurring Arabidopsis accessions

PLATFORM
GPL11221 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Arabidopsis thaliana) GPL17639 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
