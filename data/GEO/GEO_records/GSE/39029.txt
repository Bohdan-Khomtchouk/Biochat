TITLE
Choriodecidual Infection Downregulates Angiogenesis and Morphogenesis Pathways in Fetal Lungs from Macaca Nemestrina

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Intrauterine exposure to amniotic fluid (AF) cytokines is thought to predispose to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).  We evaluated the effects of GBS exposure on RNA expression in fetal lung tissue to determine early molecular pathways associated with fetal lung injury that may progress to BPD.
