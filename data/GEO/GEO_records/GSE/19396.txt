TITLE
ETV1 knockdown in GIST cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ETV1 is highly expressed in GIST cells and required for their survival and growth. To identify genes and pathways regulated by ETV1 in GIST, we performed expression profiles of GIST cells after ETV1 knockdown.

DESIGN
Two GIST cell lines (GIST48 and GIST882) were infected in duplicate with three shRNA viruses (Scrambled, ETV1sh1-B11TRCN0000013923, ETV1sh2-TRCN0000013925). Four days after infection, RNA was harvested for expression profiling.
