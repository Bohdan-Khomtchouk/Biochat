TITLE
CD7 promotes extramedullary involvement of the B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia line Tanoue by enhancing integrin beta2-dependent cell adhesiveness

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Tanoue expressing firefly-luciferase gene, Luc-Tanoue, was transplanted into non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice, and cells infiltrated in the brain were cultured ex vivo. This process was repeated 4 times to obtain the highly invasive line Luc-Tanoue-F4. Comparison of the global gene expression signatures of Luc-Tanoue-F4 and Luc-Tanoue indicated that the CD7 gene showed the largest increase in expression among EMI-related genes in Luc-Tanoue-F4.
