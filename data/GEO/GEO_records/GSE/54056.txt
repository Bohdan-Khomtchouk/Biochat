TITLE
Expression data from adult mouse normal and damaged retina from B6 and 129 mouse strains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retinal damage causes proliferation of Muller glia, but the degree of proliferation depends on mouse strains. Muller glial proliferation was significantly promoted by the addition of GSK3 inhibitor in 129, but not in B6. We used retinal explant culture as a model for retinal damage which caused preferential photoreceptor death in a few days. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression regulating the proliferative potential of Muller glia after retinal damage.

DESIGN
Total RNA from intact whole retina, retinal tissue cultured for three days, and retinal tissue cultured with chir99021 for three days was used. Retinal tissues from 10 weeks old mice were used.
