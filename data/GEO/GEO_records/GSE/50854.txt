TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Bovine granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles at 30, 60, 90 and 120 days postpartum

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Cows in Negative Energy Balance (NEB) may preferentially divert nutrients away from reproduction, thereby experiencing a period of anovulatory anestrus, delayed ovulation of large follicles and a condition of impaired fertility. To better understand the changes occurring in these large follicles as a function of time post-partum granulosa cells  of preovulatory follicles have been collected at different times: 30, 60, 90 and 120 days after calving . An analysis of the transcriptome was performed using a global bovine oligo-array microarray to map the differences in genes expression and cellular functions that occur in the follicular microenvironment during the progressive recovery from NEB condition in dairy cow

DESIGN
Four time points experiment: 30, 60, 90 and 120 days. Granulosa cells from the 30, 60 and 90 days compare to the 120 days (reference). Biological replicates: 3 from each time point. One replicate per array.
