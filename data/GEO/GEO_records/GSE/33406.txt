TITLE
mlo5-mediated resistance responses in barley

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Gene expression of a near-isogenic pair of barley lines differing in absence or presence of the mlo5 resistance gene in response to attack by barley powdery mildew (Bgh).   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Achim Fischer.  The equivalent experiment is BB7 at PLEXdb.]
