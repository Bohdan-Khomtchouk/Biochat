TITLE
Expression data from small intestine crypts of Zfp148gt/+APCMin/+ and Zfp148+/+APCMin/+ mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Zinc finger protein 148 (Zfp148) interacts physically with the tumor suppressor p53, but the siginficance of this interaction is not known. We recently showed that knockout of Zfp148 in mice leads to ectopic activation of p53 in tissues and cultured fibroblasts, suggesting that Zfp148 represses p53 activity. Here we hypothesized that targeting Zfp148 would unleash p53 activity and protect against cancer development, and test this idea in the APCMin/+ mouse model of intestinal adenomas.

DESIGN
Crypt-enriched tissues were isolated by laser microdissection (PALM) from the small intestines (proximal) of Zfp148gt/+APCMin/+ and Zfp148+/+APCMin/+ mice for RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
