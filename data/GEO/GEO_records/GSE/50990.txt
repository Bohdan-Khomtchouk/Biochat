TITLE
Intronic Non-CG DNA Hydroxymethylation and Alternative mRNA Splicing in Honey Bees

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera ; Apis mellifera scutellata

SUMMARY
Honey bee non-CG DNA hydroxymethylation is enriched in the introns, which supplements previous findings that honey bee CG DNA methylation is enriched in exons.

DESIGN
Bisulfite sequencing combined with Pvu-Seq to distinguish 5-methylcytosine from 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and RNA-Seq

PLATFORM
GPL9909 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Apis mellifera) GPL17742 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Apis mellifera scutellata)
