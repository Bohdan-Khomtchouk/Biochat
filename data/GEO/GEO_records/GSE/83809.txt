TITLE
An essential cell cycle regulator drives chromatin condensation in maturing erythroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that Setd8 is essential for murine erythropoeisis. Setd8 null erythroblasts have severe defects in cell cycle progression, chromatin condensation,and heterochromatin integrity. They also have dysregulated gene expression.

DESIGN
Ter119+,CD71+ Setd8 null and control erythroblasts were sorted from the fetal blood of E10.5 embryos. RNA from those erythroblasts was sent for RNA-seq.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
