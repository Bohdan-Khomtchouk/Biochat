TITLE
Genome-wide analysis expression of ileum tumor samples from FVBN/APCmin and iPGC-1β/APCmin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of metabolic pathway gene expression. The hypothesis tested in the present study is to assess mRNA level changes in metabolic genes in intestinal tumors from APCmin mice overexpressing PGC-1β specifically in the intestine.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from ileum tumor samples from iPGC-1β/APCmin mice was compared to the total RNA extracted from FVBN/APCmin mice.
