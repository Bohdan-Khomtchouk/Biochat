TITLE
NPM-ALK expression levels identify two distinct signatures in Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma of Childhood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) makes up approximately 15% of paediatric non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of childhood. The vast majority of them is associated with the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation that results in the expression of a hybrid oncogenic tyrosine kinase, NPM-ALK. In order to investigate ALCL  biological characteristics we used  transcriptional profiling approach. Genome-wide gene expression profiling, performed on 23 paediatric ALCL and  12 reactive lymph nodes specimens, showed two novel ALCL subgroups based on their NPM-ALK expression levels (named  (ALK low and ALK high). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed, in ALK low samples, a positive enrichment of genes involved in the Interleukin signaling pathway, whereas we found  increased expression of genes related to cell cycle progression and division in  ALK high tumour samples, such as Aurora Kinase A (AURKA)  and B (AURKB). Growth inhibition was observed upon administration of AURKA and AURKB inhibitors Alisertib and Barasertib and it was associated with perturbation of the cell cycle and induction of apoptosis. In conclusion we identified two novel ALCL subgroups, which display unique biological characteristics suggesting sensitivity to distinct targeted therapies.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured on Affymetrix in 23 Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma patients and 12 reactive lymph nodes.
