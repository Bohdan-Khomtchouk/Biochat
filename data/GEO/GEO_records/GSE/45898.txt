TITLE
Gene Expression analysis of therapeutical response in Triple Negative Breast tumors.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
10 biopsies before treatment from triple negative patients with complete response were collected. Total RNA was extracted from tumor specimens and the whole transcriptome was quantified with Affymetrix HuGene1.1ST. The biopsies were classified into Good (major or complete) or Poor (absent or minor) therapeutic response subgroup.

DESIGN
Whole genome expression of triple negative breast cancer tissues were measured before neoadjuvant chemotherapy
