TITLE
Genome-wide identification and analysis of microRNA expression in brains of mice infected with FJDRV, a street rabies virus with high virulence, and ERA, a laboratory-adapted virus with lower virulence

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Host-virus interaction was analyzed at microRNA expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that rabies virus (RABV) infection affects the microRNA expression in brains of mice and RABV with different virulence induce distinct microRNA expression pattern in host. Results provide important information that RABV infection led to alteration of microRNA expression in brains of mice and FJDRV, a street rabies virus with highly virulence isolated from brain of rabid dog in Fujian provice of China, or ERA, a laboratory-adapted rabies virus with lower virulence induced different microRNA expression pattern, and some them may involved in host defense and immune-related function.

DESIGN
An nine chip study was performed using total RNA isolated from brains in Treatment 1, three BALB/c mice infected with FJDRV, Treatment 2, three BALB/c mice infected with ERA, and Control, three BALB/c mice non-infected.
