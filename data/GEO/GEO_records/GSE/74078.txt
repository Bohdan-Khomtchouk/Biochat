TITLE
Late stages of T-cell maturation in the thymus involve NF-κB and tonic type I interferon signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Positive selection occurs in the thymic cortex, but critical maturation events occur later in the medulla.  We defined the precise stage at which T cells acquire competence to proliferate and emigrate. Transcriptome analysis of late gene changes suggested roles for NF-κB and interferon signaling. Mice lacking the IKK kinase TAK1, showed normal positive selection, but a specific block in functional maturation. NF-κB signaling provided protection from TNF, and was required for proliferation and emigration.  Alternatively, the interferon signature was independent of NF-κB, and IFNαR deficient thymocytes showed reduced STAT1 levels and phenotypic abnormality, but were competent to proliferate. Thus, both NF-κB and tonic IFN signals are involved in the final maturation of thymocytes into naïve T cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile was performed on cells isolated from mouse thymus, including Pre-DP, Post-DP, SM & M1, M2 and Tak1-deficient SM & M1 cells.
