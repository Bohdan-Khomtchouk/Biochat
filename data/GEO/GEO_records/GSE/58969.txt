TITLE
Effect of fbw7 deletion in mouse pancreatic ducts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The adult pancreas is capable of limited regeneration after injury, but has no defined stem cell population. The cell types and molecular signals that govern the production of new pancreatic tissue are not well understood. Here we show that inactivation of the SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate recognition component Fbw7 induces pancreatic ductal cells to reprogram into β-cells. The induced β-cells resemble islet β-cells in morphology and histology, express genes essential for β-cell function, and release insulin upon glucose challenge. Thus, loss of Fbw7 appears to reawaken an endocrine developmental differentiation program in adult pancreatic ductal cells. Our study highlights the plasticity of seemingly differentiated adult cells, identifies Fbw7 as a master regulator of cell fate decisions in the pancreas, and reveals adult pancreatic duct cells as a latent multipotent cell type. We used microarray to compare adult mouse fbw7 knock out ductal cells with bonafide beta cells

DESIGN
In order to isolate fbw7 ko, fbw7 wt ductal cells and beta cells we used adult mice with the following genotypes: MIP-GFP (beta cells are constitutively labelled with GFP), Ck19-CreERT; R26-LSL-YFP; Fbw7 +/+ (ductal cells are labelled with YFP upon tamoxifen injection) and Ck19-CreERT; R26-LSL-YFP; Fbw7 F/F mice (ductal cells are labelled with YFP upon tamoxifen injection). 30000 GFP+ cells were isolated by FACS-sorting. RNA was extracted and amplified using NuGEN kit.
