TITLE
mRNA-seq of satellite cells cultured and expanded in F10 conventional medium, T cell conditional medium, and cytokine cocktail

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Like most adult stem cells, culturing and expansion of satellite cells (muscle stem cells) are difficult, that prevents the utilization of satellite cells in cell-based therapies. Here, we reveal that T cells infiltrated into the injury site upon acute inflammation are able to promote muscle stem cell proliferation, expansion, and maintain their injury reparation abilities in vivo. Four cytokines, IL-1α, IL-13, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, were identified as the effective components secreted by T cells to faciliate satellite cell propagation

DESIGN
Comparison of mRNA expression profile of satellite cells between different treatment in different sample

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
