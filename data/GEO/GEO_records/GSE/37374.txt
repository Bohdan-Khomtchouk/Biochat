TITLE
miRNA expression profiling of NB4 control cells versus NB4 cells treated with SAHA (Vorinostat)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For a long time, the BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING domain 1) protein has been considered as a BRCA1 (BReast Cancer susceptibility gene 1, early onset) interactor, and tumor suppressor mutated in breast and ovarian cancers. Despite its functions in a stable heterodimer with BRCA1, there is increasing evidence for BRCA1-independent functions of BARD1. Here, we investigated BARD1 expression and function in human acute myeloid leukemias and their modulation by epigenetic mechanisms and microRNA. We show that the HDACi (histone deacetylase inhibitor) Vorinostat reduces BARD1 mRNA levels by increasing miR-19a and miR-19b expression levels. Moreover, we identify specific BARD1 isoforms that might act as tumor diagnostic and prognostic markers.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: untreated NB4 cells (control) vs. NB4 cells treated with 5ÂµM SAHA (Vorinostat) for 6h. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 treated, independently grown and harvested at 6 hours. One replicate per array.
