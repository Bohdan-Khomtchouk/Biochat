TITLE
Expression profiles of villus and crypt layers of large intestine from C57Bl/6, Apc1638N+/-, and p21-/-  mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiles obtained from the villus and crypt layers of murine large intestine can elucidate the process of differentiation undergone by epithelial cells as they migrate from the undifferentiated bottom of the crypt to the villus tip before being shed into the intestinal lumen.  This series includes profiles from wild type mice, as well as mice harboring mutations in genes (APC and p21) which play key roles in the differentiation process. We used microarrays to characterize gene expression profiles at the base of the crypt and at the villus tip of the lumenal layer of the large intestine in order to better understand the process of differentiation and eventual shedding undergone by cells of the large intestinal epithelium.

DESIGN
Four wild type, four APC1638+/- and four p21-/- mice were sacrified and the large intestines dissected out.  Cells from the villus tip and from the bottom of the crypt were isolated from the lumenal face of the each large intestine using the Weiser method of sequential elution.  RNA was extracted from each eluted sample and used to hybridize to Affymetrix 3' expression arrays.
