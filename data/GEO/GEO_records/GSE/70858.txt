TITLE
Cavin4/Murc is required for skeletal muscle development and function in zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To understand the underlying cause of the swimming defect in Cavin4/Murcb deficient larvae, we isolated mRNA from mutant and sibling zebrafish at 72 hpf and subjected it to microarray analysis.

DESIGN
RNA and gDNA were extracted from individual larvae at 72 hpf using Trizol (Life Technologies).  Following genotyping, the aqueous phases from at least 10 Trizol extractions were combined by genotype and purified over microspin columns (ZymoResearch).  RNA expression from heterozygous and mutant larvae was analyzed by single-color microarray (8x60K Zebrafish Array XS, Oaklabs, Germany).
