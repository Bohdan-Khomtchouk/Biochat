TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Candida parapsilosis bcr1 knockout.

ORGANISM
Candida parapsilosis

SUMMARY
Whole genome microarrays were used to compare the transcriptional profile of Candida parapsilosis bcr1 knockout to wild type cells.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from CLIB214 (wild type) or bcr1 delete (CDb71 or CDUHB6) grown in SD medium supplemented with 50 mM glucose and 10% fetal calf serum and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5. 7 independent biological replicates were compared. Two dye swaps were perfomed so that five of seven CLIB214 cultures were labeled with Cy3, and two were labeled with Cy5.
