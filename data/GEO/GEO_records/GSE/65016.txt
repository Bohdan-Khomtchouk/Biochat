TITLE
mRNA-seq of ros1-3 and ros1-4 with ABA treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To survey transcriptome changes by the mutations of a DNA demethylase ROS1 responding to a phytohormone abscisic acid, we performed the Next-gen sequencing (NGS) associated RNA-seq analysis. Two ROS1 knockout lines (ros1-3, ros1-4; Penterman et al. 2007 [PMID: 17409185]) with the wild-type Col line (wt) were subjected.

DESIGN
Three samples (ros1-3, ros1-4 and wt), biological triplicates, ABA or mock treatment, using Illumina HiSeq 2500 system

PLATFORM
GPL17639 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
