TITLE
Global mRNA gene expression analysis profiling control HEK293 cell and cells expressing  HSP70K71E

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is global mRNA gene expression data for HEK293  and cells expressing  HSP70K71E ; most genes were down-regulated for HSP70K71E compared to the control Keywords: Global mRNA expression

DESIGN
We overexpressed pCI1-EGFP (control) and Hsp70K71E-EGFP to HEK293 and collected total RNA from each condition to analyze global mRNA expression

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
