TITLE
RNA-seq Analysis of MoRFX1-dependent Genes in Magnaporthe oryzae 70-15

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe oryzae

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study are to find out the genes regulated directly or indirectly by the regulatory factor X protein MoRfx1 by RNA-seq in the rice blast fungus Methods: Mycelial mRNAs of the wild type strain 70-15, ΔMorfx1 incubated in H2O at 25˚C for 4 h, in triplicate independently for each strain, were extracted and isolated by RNeasy Plant mini kit (QIAGEN) and AMPure XP beads (Beckman). RNA-sequencing libraries were constructed using NEBNext RNA sample preparation kit (NEB). Samples were sequenced in a 1 x 100 nt way on Illumina Hiseq2500 instrument using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3 - cBot - HS (Illumina) and TruSeq SBS Kit v3-HS (Illumina).The M. oryzae genome database (MG8) (www.broadinstitute.org) was used as a reference gene database. Genome-wide transcript levels of genes were quantified in fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (FPKM) (Trapnell 2010). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses for differentially expressed genes were performed using hypergeometric test with topGO, and p-values were adjusted with Bonferroni for multiple testing (Alexa 2006). And we selected FDR < 0.05 as enrichment terms. Results and Conclusions: We identified 1735 genes regulated by Morfx1 through RNA-seq.

DESIGN
Mycelial mRNA profiles of wild type strain 70-15 (WT), ΔMorfx1 incubated in H2O for 4 h were generated, in biologic triplicate, by Illumina Hiseq2500 in a 1 x 100 nt way
