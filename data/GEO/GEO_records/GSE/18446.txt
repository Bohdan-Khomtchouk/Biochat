SUMMARY
The biology of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-stem cells is still incompletely understood. Therefore, we previously developed an inducible transgenic mouse model in which stem cell targeted induction of BCR-ABL expression leads to chronic phase CML-like disease. Here, we now demonstrate that the disease is transplantable using BCR-ABL positive LSK cells (lin-Sca-1+c-kit+). Interestingly, the phenotype is enhanced when unfractionated bone marrow (BM) cells are transplanted. However, neither progenitor cells (lin-Sca-1-c-kit+) nor mature granulocytes (CD11b+Gr-1+), or potential stem cell niche cells were able to transmit the disease or alter the phenotype. The phenotype was largely independent of BCR ABL priming prior to transplant. However, BCR-ABL abrogated the potential of LSK cells to induce full blown disease in secondary recipients. Subsequently, we found that BCR-ABL increased the fraction of multipotent progenitor cells (MPP) at the expense of long term HSC (LT-HSC) in the BM. Microarray analyses of LSK cells revealed that BCR-ABL alters the expression of genes involved in proliferation, survival, and hematopoietic development. Our results suggest that BCR-ABL induces differentiation of LT-HSC and decreases their self renewal capacity. Furthermore, reversion of BCR-ABL eradicates mature cells while leukemic stem cells persist, giving rise to relapsed CML upon re-induction of BCR-ABL.
