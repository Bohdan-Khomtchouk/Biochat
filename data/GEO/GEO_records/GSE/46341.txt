TITLE
Experiment comparing transcriptomes of red and purple tissue sections on Del/Ros1 Moneymaker fruit

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used to compare the gene expression profiles of red and purple sectors of VIGS (Virus-induced gene silencing)-treated Del/Ros1 fruit in the MoneyMaker background. Fruit were silenced at the mature green stage and harvested at differing number of days after breaker.

DESIGN
Custom two-colour microarray (TOM2); where one channel was employed as a common reference.
