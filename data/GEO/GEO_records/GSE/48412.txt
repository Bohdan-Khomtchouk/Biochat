TITLE
miRNA expression data from skeletal muscle stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It has been shown recently that non-coding RNAs including miRNAs are involved in the development of skeletal muscle progenitors and to maintain the quiescent condition of adult skeletal muscle stem cells. To identify the difference among developing skeletal muscle-committed progenitors or stem cells detected by Pax3-GFP; MyoD-primed RFP expressions, miRNA microarray was performed.

DESIGN
Pax3-GFP; MyoD-RFP positive cells were selected at several developmental stages for miRNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix
