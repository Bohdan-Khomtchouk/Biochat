TITLE
Binding motif analysis of METTL3，WTAP in METTL3，WTAP overexpressed Human 293T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
label the cells overexpressed Myc tagged METTL3 and Flag tagged WTAP with 4-SU, the RNA bound by METT3,WTAP can be got by Myc or Flag IP followed by RNA isolation by using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent by following the company manual.the RNA was then used for library preparation using a TruSeq™ RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.The libraries were sequenced using HiSeq2000 (Illumina) in single-read mode, creating reads with a length of 50 bp. Sequencing chemistry v2 (Illumina) was used and samples were multiplexed in two samples per lane.

DESIGN
discovery of the binding motif of METTL3，WTAP in METTL3，WTAP overexpressed Human 293T cells

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
