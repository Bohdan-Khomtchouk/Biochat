TITLE
Expression data from wild-type mice starved as compared to wild-type control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the effects of starvation on the liver transcriptome, we performed Affymetrix Gene-Chip hybridization experiments for the starved mice Transcriptome analysis of the starved mice

DESIGN
For the analysis on the starved mice,total RNA was extracted from the liver of two mice; RNA extracted from the liver of two wt mice was used as control.
