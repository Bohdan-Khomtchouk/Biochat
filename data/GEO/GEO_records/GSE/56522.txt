TITLE
MicroRNA profiles and potential regulatory pattern during the early stage of spermatogenesis in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Spermatogenesis is a complicated and poorly understood process that relies on the precise regulation of the self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonia. In many organisms, microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in multiple developmental processes as critical regulators of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing. This study investigated the expression pattern of miRNAs in type B spermatogonia cells (BSc) and primary spermatocytes (PSc) of mice, using a high-throughput small RNA sequencing system.

DESIGN
Using sRNA-seq technology to examine miRNA expression pattern's change between mouse type B spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes cell types.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
