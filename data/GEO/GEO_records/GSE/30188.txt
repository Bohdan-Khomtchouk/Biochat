TITLE
Rho transcription inhibitor CCG-1423 effect on PC-3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of serum starved PC-3 cells treated with CCG-1423, Latrunculin B, or the transcription elongation inhibitor DRB for 2 or 24 hours. Results provide insights to potential therapeutic approaches to cancer metastasis.

DESIGN
Twenty one samples in triplicate were analyzed and compared to the DMSO-treated control. The primary condition tested was the effect of the Rho-transcription pathway inhibitor, CCG-1423 As a biologically related control, the actin polymerization inhibitor, Latrunculin B, that also blocks Rho-stimulated gene transcription was tested. As a control for non-specific transcription inhibition, DRB was used. All samples, 2-hr and 24-hr treated samples were compared to the 24-hr DMSO sample.
