TITLE
Transcriptome wide target profiling for miR-23b and miR-27a.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome Identification of  direct targets of miR-23b and miR-27a using biotinylated pull-downs found that both miRNAs have roles relevant to the mammalian cell cycle and cancer.

DESIGN
HEK293T cells were transfected with biotinylated miRNAs (either miR-23b or miR-27a). The miRNAs and target mRNA were pulled down with streptavidin and compared to the input control.
