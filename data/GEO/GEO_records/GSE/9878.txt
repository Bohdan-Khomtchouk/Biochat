TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Pax5-/- proB cells transduced with control or EBF retrovirus.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have determined that sustained expression of EBF suppresses alternate lineage genes independently of Pax5. Keywords: Transcription factor EBF restricts alternate lineage options and promotes B cell fate commitment independently of Pax5.

DESIGN
Pax5-/- pro-B cells transduced with control or EBF retrovirus.  Transduced cells were FACS sorted based on GFP expression and total RNA was isolated.   RNA isolated from control or EBF transduced cells was analyzed using the Affymetrix  Rat 230A microarrays.
