TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Pax5-/- proB cells transduced with control or EBF retrovirus.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have determined that sustained expression of EBF suppresses alternate lineage genes independently of Pax5. Keywords: Transcription factor EBF restricts alternate lineage options and promotes B cell fate commitment independently of Pax5.
