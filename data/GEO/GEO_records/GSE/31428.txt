SUMMARY
Purpose: To determine the 8-week disease control rate (DCR) of sorafenib monotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the BATTLE trial. Methods: Patients with pre-treated NSCLC consented to baseline biopsies for pre-specified biomarkers assessment and biomarker discovery. Sorafenib was given at 400 mg orally twice daily until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. Outcomes by pre-specified biomarkers were analyzed and a Sorafenib sensitivity signature developed using high-throughput gene expression profiles of NSCLC cell lines and baseline biopsies. Results: 105 patients were eligible and 98 patients were evaluable. Median age was 62 (range 34-81) years, 51% of patients were male, 75% were former/current smokers, and 89% had an ECOG performance status of 0-1.  Median prior chemotherapies for stage IV NSCLC were two. Median follow-up was 9.4 (range: 1.3-32.2) months.  Overall, 8-week DCR was 58.2%. Patients with EGFR mutations had significantly lower 8-week DCR compared to patients with wild-type tumors (23.1% vs. 64.2%, P=0.0119), and patients with K-RAS mutations had the highest 8-week DCR (67%). Most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events include hand-foot syndrome (59.6%), fatigue (42.3%), rash (40.4%), diarrhea (38.5%), and weight loss (38.5%). Sorafenib sensitivity signature developed in cell lines was associated with an improved outcome. Conclusion: Patients with wild-type EGFR, including those with K-RAS mutation, may benefit from sorafenib as opposed to patients with EGFR mutation. We identify a gene expression signature associated with an improved outcome in patients with wild-type EGFR treated with sorafenib. BATTLE-2 trial is ongoing to validate those results.
