TITLE
JIL-1 RNAi in Drosophila S2 Cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Profiling of changes in steady state RNA levels upon RNAi-mediated knockdown of the chromosomal kinase JIL-1 in Drosophila S2 cells.

DESIGN
Drosophila S2 cells were incubated 7 days after treatment with 10 Âµg of dsRNA directed against GST/EGFP or JIL-1, respectively. 5 biological replicates per target have been collected.
