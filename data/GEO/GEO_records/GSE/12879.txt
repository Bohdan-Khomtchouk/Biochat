TITLE
Meiotic DNA double strand breaks in wild-type and set1∆ cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In relation with the study of the meiotic dynamic of H3K4 methylation, we determined the meiotic Double Strand Breaks (DSB) profiles of wild-type and set1∆ cells.

DESIGN
We profiled the DSB sites by immunoprecipitating Rfa1 in dmc1∆ cells, at 5h for the wild-type experiment and at 7h for the set1∆ cells.

PLATFORM
GPL4131 Agilent-014810 Yeast Whole Genome ChIP-on-Chip Microarray 4x44K (G4493A)
