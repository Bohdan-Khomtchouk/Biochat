TITLE
Cbfb/Runx1-repression independent blockage of differentiation and accumulation of Csf2rb expressing cells by Cbfb-MYH11

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It is known that CBFB-MYH11, the fusion gene generated by inversion of chromosome 16 in human acute myeloid leukemia, is causative for oncogenic transformation. However, the mechanism by which CBFB-MYH11 initiates leukemogenesis is not clear. Previously published reports showed that CBFB-MYH11 dominantly inhibits RUNX1 and CBFB, and such inhibition has been suggested as the mechanism for leukemogenesis. However, knockin mice expressing Cbfb-MYH11 (Cbfb+/MYH11) showed defects in primitive hematopoiesis not seen in Cbfb null (Cbfb-/-) embryos indicating that Cbfb-MYH11 has repression independent activities as well. To identify gene expression changes associated with this novel activity, we compared the gene expression profile in the blood cells of Cbfb+/MYH11 and Cbfb-/- embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) embryos with that of their wildtype littermates.

DESIGN
Cbfb-MYH11 chimeras were mated to C57/Bl6 females to generate Cbfb+/MYH11 (Cbfb+/MYH11) and Cbfb+/+ (WT) embryos. Cbfb+/- x Cbfb+/- matings were used to generate Cbfb+/+ (Cbfb+/+) and Cbfb-/- (Cbfb-/-) embryos. Blood from 8-10 E12.5 embryos of the same genotype was pooled, and RNA was isolated, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix Genechip mouse microarray (430 2.0) chips. 4 chips were used for both the Cbfb+/MYH11 and littermate control samples. 3 chips were used for the Cbfb-/- samples and littermate control samples.
