TITLE
Early Iron Deficiency Induced Changes in Arabidopsis Roots

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Due to limited bio-availability of Fe, plants evolved adaptive alterations in development regulated at the transcriptional level. We investigated the early transcriptional response to Fe deficiency.

DESIGN
A hydroponic system was used that allows bulk transferring of plantsand rapid Fe removal with little mechanical damage to the root systems.
