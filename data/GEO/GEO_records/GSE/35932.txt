TITLE
HIF1 is a master regulator of the adaptive gene expression to hypoxia.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total 23 samples were derived from [1] HUVEC treated in the absence (0h) or presence of hypoxia (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hrs) to determine hypoxia-regulated gene in endothelial cells, [2] control siRNA or HIF1Î± siRNA transfected HUVEC cells treated in the absence or presence of hypoxia, [3] control siRNA or KDM3A siRNA transfected HUVEC cells treated in the absence or presence of hypoxia, [4] ChIP-seq data for HIF1 binding sites and histone modifications under normoxia and hypoxia in endothelial cells.

DESIGN
This study represents 15 Samples from the gene expression part of the study described in 1,2, and 3 above. The ChIP-Seq data mentioned above is available in GSE39089.
