TITLE
Gene expression analysis of the developing cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mammalian neocortex develops layer organizations with regional differences represented by expression of multiple genes at embryonic stages. These genes could play important roles in the formation of areal cyto-architecture, yet, the number of genes identified so far is not sufficient to explain such intricate processes. Here we collected five regions; the medial, dorsal, lateral, rostral, and occipital, from the dissected E16.5 mouse cerebral cortex and performed extensive gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix U74Av2 array. Keywords = mouse Keywords = cortex Keywords = development Keywords = regional Keywords = gene expression Keywords = medial Keywords = dorsal Keywords = lateral Keywords = rostral Keywords = occipital Keywords: ordered
