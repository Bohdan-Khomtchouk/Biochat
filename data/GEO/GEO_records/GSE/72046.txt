TITLE
Transcriptome profiles of mice intestine and liver upon infection with Salmonella typhimurium (MC71-TT and MC71-DcdtB)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bacterial genotoxins, produced by several Gram-negative bacteria, induce DNA damage in the target cells. While the responses induced in the host cells have been extensively studied in vitro, the role of the genotoxins as effectors during the course of acute and chronic infections remains poorly characterized.To address this issue, we assessed the effects of the Salmonella enterica genotoxin, known as typhoid toxin, in in vivo models of murine chronic infections. Immunocompetent mice were chronically infected with isogenic S. enterica, serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) strains, encoding either a functional (MC71-TT) or an inactive (MC71-DcdtB) typhoid toxin. Keywords: salmonella typhimurium, bacterial genotoxins, typhoid toxin, chronic infection, mice model

DESIGN
Transcriptomic analysis was performed on intestine tissues (colon, jejunum and ileum) and liver collected from 129S6/SvEvTac mice, either uninfected or infected with S. typhimurium MC71 strains (strain MC71-TT, expressing a functional typhoid toxin,  and strain MC71-dcdtB, expressing an inactive typhoid toxin) for 60 days
