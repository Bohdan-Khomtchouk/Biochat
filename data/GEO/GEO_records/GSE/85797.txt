TITLE
Genome wide analysis of SMAD1 binding in mouse mesodermal cells treated or not with the WNT inhibitor IWR1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing, we studied the effect of WNT pathway inhibition of the binding of SMAD1 in mouse mesodermal cells from Embryoid Bodies (EB) cultures. The WNT inhibitor IWR1 (or the vehicle control DMSO) were added in day 3 EB cultures and cells were collected 24h later for ChIP assay.

DESIGN
Analysis of SMAD1 genomic binding in IWR1- or DMSO-treated mouse day 4 reaggregated Embryoid Bodies.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
