TITLE
Cleavage Factor Im as a key regulator of 3’ UTR length

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In eukaryotes, the 3' ends of RNA polymerase II-generated transcripts are made in the majority of cases by site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage, followed by the addition of a poly(A) tail. By alternative polyadenylation, a gene can give rise to multiple mRNA isoforms that differ in the length of their 3' UTRs and hence in their susceptibility to post-transcriptional regulatory factors such as microRNAs. A series of recently conducted high-throughput studies of poly(A) site usage revealed an extensive tissue-specific control of 3’ UTR length and drastic changes in 3’ UTR length of mRNAs upon induction of proliferation in resting cells. To understand the dynamics of polyadenylation site usage, we recently identified binding sites of the major pre-mRNA 3’ end processing factors - cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), and cleavage factor Im (CF Im) - and mapped cleaved polyadenylation sites in HEK293 cells. Our present study extends previous findings on the role of CF Im in alternative polyadenylation and reveals that subunits of the CF Im complex generally control 3’ UTR length. More specifically, we demonstrate that the  loss-of-function of CF Im68 and CF Im25 but not of CF Im59 leads to a transcriptome-wide increase of the use of proximal polyadenylation sites.

DESIGN
3' ends of transcripts were profiled by high-throughput sequencing in HEK 293 cells under normal conditions, and in HEK 293 cells depleted of 3' end processing factors CF Im25, CF Im59, and CF Im68.
