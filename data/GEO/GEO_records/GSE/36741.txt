TITLE
In vivo and in vitro investigations of heterozygous nebulin knock-out mice reveal similarities with mild human form of nemaline myopathy [miRNA]

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
In the present study, we used a multimodal approach including protein and gene expression analysis and combined in vivo and in vitro measurements of force production. Overall, we aimed at investigating the functional impact of the expression of a single nebulin allele.
