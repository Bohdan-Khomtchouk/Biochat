TITLE
Tumor bearing mice: One group was caged in 24-hour light cycle (L/L), the other group was caged in 12-hour light/dark cycle (L/D)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Abnormal circadian rhythms, including exposure to light at night, are associated with a higher cancer risk and a poorer prognosis, which may be one of the reasons that the incidence of cancer is increasing in individuals subjected to these stresses. However, the molecular or systemic mechanisms involved in tumor growth under artificial illumination stress conditions have not been identified. In fact, the question of whether artificial illumination stress promotes tumor growth at all is still controversial. To identify the possible mechanisms underlying tumor progression related to circadian rhythms, we set up nude mouse xenograft models. Eight-week-old male nude mice (BALBc nu/nu) were injected with 100ul (1x106 cells) of Hela cells suspension at two separate dorsal sites. Mice were randomly caged (5/cage) and subdivided into L/L (24-hour light cycle; circadian rhythm disruption model) and L/D (12-hour light/dark cycle; normal circadian rhythm model) groups. 11days after injection, we sacrificed one L/L mouse and one L/D mouse, tumors were immediately preserved using liquid nitrogen. Total RNA from tumors were isolated using QIAshredder and RNeasy-Mini kits (Qiagen).

DESIGN
We compared the transcriptional profiling of L/L tumor which was derived from  24-hour light cycle (L/L) caging mice with the transcriptional profiling of L/D tumor which was derived from 12-hour light/dark cycle (L/D) caging mice.
