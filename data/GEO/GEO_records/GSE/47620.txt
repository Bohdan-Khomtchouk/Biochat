TITLE
Illumina  Human1Mv1_C array CGH on NCI-60 cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The NCI-60 cancer cell lines have been used for studying cancer pathogenesis and for drug discovery. This dataset adds to the growing number of datasets on various genomic platforms that have been made public on Cellminer ( http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/ )

DESIGN
60 cell lines (including PR:DU145 and its drug resistant derivative PR:RC01) were arrayed. Four cell lines were done in duplicate CNS:SF_295, LC:HOP_92, ME:SK_MEL_28 , OV:OVCAR_3, while CO:HT29 was not assayed.

PLATFORM
GPL6983 Illumina Human1Mv1 DNA Analysis BeadChip (Human1Mv1_C)
