SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most-common cancer worldwide causing nearly 600,000 deaths esch year. Approximately 80% of HCC develops on the background of cirrhosis.It is necessary to identify novel genes involved in HCC to implement new diagnostic and treatment options. However, the molecular pathogenesis of HCC largely remains unsolved. Only a few genetic alterations, namely those affecting p53, Î²-catenin and p16INK4a have been implicated at moderate frequencies of these cancers. Early detection of HCC with appropriate treatment can decrease tumor-related deaths We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression profiles of cirrhosis and tumor liver samples.
