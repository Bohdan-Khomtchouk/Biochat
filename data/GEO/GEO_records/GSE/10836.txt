TITLE
Meiotic time course of Histone H3 occupancy

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To study the meiotic dynamic of the methylation of H3K4, in relation with the transcriptomic regulation, we determine the meiotic time-course of H3 occupancy by ChIP-chip. Keywords: ChIP-chip, meiotic time course, histone modification

DESIGN
Strain ORD7339 meiotic time-course from 0 to 6h. Immunoprecipitation with rabbit polyclonal anti H3Cter (Abcam #1791)

PLATFORM
GPL4131 Agilent-014810 Yeast Whole Genome ChIP-on-Chip Microarray 4x44K (G4493A)
