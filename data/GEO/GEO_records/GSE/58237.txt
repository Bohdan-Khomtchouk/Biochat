TITLE
MiR-29a maintains mouse hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal by regulating Dnmt3a

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling from fine purified hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells of WT or miR-29a deletion. This anlaysis identified the up- and down-regulated genes from miR-29a deletion, and suggest that cell cycle regulators are significantly changed.  The results demonstrate that the HSC lacking of miR-29a appeared as committed progentiors from their gene expression patterns.

DESIGN
Cells are sorted into hematopoietic stem cells (HSC, Lin-c-Kit+Sca-1+Slam1+CD34-) and committed progenitor cells (Prog, Lin-c-kit+Sca-1-) with > 90% purity using FACS AriaII machine.
