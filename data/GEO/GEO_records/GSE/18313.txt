Expression data from cytotoxic T cell clone

SUMMARY
T cells contribute to host-tumor interactions in patients with monoclonal gammopathies. Expansions of CD8+CD57+TCRVβ+ restricted cytotoxic T cell (CTL) clones are found in 48% of patients with multiple myeloma and confer a favorable prognosis. We now report the presence of CTL clones with varying TCRVβ repertoire in 70% of patients with Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinaemia (WM) (n=20). Previous nucleoside analogue (NA) therapy, associated with an increased incidence of transformation to aggressive lymphoma, significantly influenced the presence of TCRVβ expansions (X2=11.6; P < 0.001) as 83% of patients without (n=6) and only 7% with TCRVβ expansions (n=14) had received NA. Clonality of CD3+CD8+CD57+TCRVβ+ restricted CTLs were confirmed by TCRVβ CDR3 size analysis and direct sequencing. To characterize CTL clones, samples of CD3+CD8+CD57+TCRVβ+ cells were profiled using DNA microarrays and the results were validated on both gene and protein level. By gene set enrichment analysis, CTL clones not only expressed genes (GZMB, PRF1, FGFBP2) from cytotoxic pathways but also genes which suppress apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, arrest cell cycle G1/S transition and activate T cells (RAS, CSK and TOB pathways). Proliferation tracking confirmed their anergic state. Our studies demonstrate the incidence, NA sensitivity and anergic nature of clonal T cells in a B cell tumor. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying T cell clonal expansion and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
In this study we have sought T cell clones in the blood of patients with WM and related their presence with nucleoside analog therapy and transformation. We have also sorted CD3+CD4-TCRVβ+CD57+ from CD3+CD4-TCRVβ+CD57- cells and confirmed clonality by TCRVβ CDR3 size determination and sequencing and used carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinmidyl ester (CFSE) tracking to monitor proliferation of CD3+CD4-TCRVβ+CD57+ clones. Finally we have performed microarray analysis to search for significant differentially expressed genes and pathways in the clonally expanded CD3+CD8+TCRVβ+CD57+ cells, focusing on cytotoxic pathways but also identifying other dysfunctional changes in these cells. Expression of a selection of the most differentially expressed genes detected by microarray was validated at both gene (qPCR) and protein level.
