TITLE
Genomic characterization of clones derived from a murine acute myeloid leukemia cell line for the description of genes involved in immunogenicity (dataset 1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine the effects of gene deletions and duplications on acute myeloid leukemia cells immunogenicity. The Clones were derived from the C1498 AML cell line. Lymphocytes were isolated from the C57BL/6 mouse strain.

DESIGN
Genome profiling of mouse single cell clones originating from an acute myeloid leukemia cell line compared to control T lymphocytes from the same murine strain.
