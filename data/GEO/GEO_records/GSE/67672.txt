TITLE
RNA-seq analysis between mouse UPS tumors (KP) and mouse UPS tumors without HIF-2alpha (KPH2)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: determine RNA expression differences in an unbiased fashion between UPS tumors derived from LSL-KrasG12D;Trp53-/- (KP) mice, and  UPS tumors derived from LSL-KrasG12D;Trp53-/-;Epas1-/- (KPH2) mice. Epas1 encodes HIF-2alpha protein.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed on KP (n = 4) and KPH2 (n = 4) derived UPS tumors using Illumina HiSeq 2000.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
