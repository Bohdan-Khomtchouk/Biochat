TITLE
The Effect of Repeated Whole Cigarette Smoke Challenge on Human Air-Liquid Interface Lung Epithelial Cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Airway epithelial cells are the first cells of the lungs to be exposed to the toxic agents contained within cigarette smoke. Accordingly, the response of these cells to this challenge is of considerable interest in the context of diseases in which cigarette smoke is a major aetiological factor. We used Affymetrix microarrays to study the effects of repeated cigarette smoke challenge on three-dimensional human lung airway epithelial cultures.

DESIGN
We have used cultures from four individual donors, and compared the effects of repeated cigarette smoke challenge (30mins exposure on four separate days), with no challenge.
