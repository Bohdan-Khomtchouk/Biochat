TITLE
Derivation of small molecule Human Neural Precursor Cells (smNPCs) from human pluripotent stem cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have developed a method for derivation of smNPCs from human embryonic (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC), that are only dependent on small molecules stimulating WNT and SHH signalling for their propagation. These smNPC cultures were enzymatically split every five to six days.

DESIGN
Human pluripotent stem cells were differentiated into the neural lineage using double SMAD inhibition, together with stimulation of WNT and SHH pathways. This led to expansion of neural epithelium, which was further cultured for 20 passages.
