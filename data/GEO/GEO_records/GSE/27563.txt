TITLE
Expression data from murine PBCs from mice with advanced mammary tumors and their tumor-free counterparts.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Female MMTV/c-MYC transgenic mice expressed the c-MYC proto-oncogene or a more stable point mutation variant (T58A) of the gene under the control of the hormone-responsive MMTV long terminal repeat (LTR) in an FVB/NJ background (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). The hormones released during pregnancy and lactation have been shown to enhance expression of the oncogene. Thus, the mice were maintained in a continuous breeding program. Mice were monitored twice weekly for tumor development by palpation and tumors were measured twice weekly. Once the tumors reached 3cm3 the animals were sacrificed and tissue was obtained to confirm the tumors by histological analysis. As a control, female mice of the same age and background strain were maintained in the same facility and under the same breeding conditions as their transgenic counterparts.
