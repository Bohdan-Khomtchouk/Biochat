TITLE
Discovery of common Asian copy number variants using high-resolution array CGH

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Discovery of common Asian copy number variants using a novel integrated high-resolution array CGH and massively parallel DNA sequencing. We attempted to discover common Asian copy number variants (CNVs) from the DNA of 30 Asian women (10 Korean, 10 CHB (HapMap), 10 JPT (HapMap)) using a custom-designed 24M-oligonucleotide Agilent platform (1.1M X 24 slides). The reference sample for aCGH was NA10851 (HapMap CEPH). In addition to the 30 women, 3 more individuals were analyzed as controls (AK1 (Kim, J.I. et al., 2009 Nature), NA12878 and NA19240).

DESIGN
33 test samples (30 Asian women, AK1, NA12878 and NA19240 (Cy5)); NA10851 as the reference sample (Cy3); and custom-designed 24M-probes Agilent Arrays were utilized.
