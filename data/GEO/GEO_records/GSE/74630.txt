TITLE
RNA-Seq of Pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and Amygdala from 3-6 month old adult mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced RNA from Pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and Amygdala from 3-6 month old adult mice.

DESIGN
The amygdala and the frontal cortex were dissected from three adult mice for each genotype (WT and SMCX KO) and homogenized in trizol. RNA was purified using Qiagen RNEasy kit and ribosomal RNA was depleted using Ribominus Eukaryote v2 kit from Life Technologies. RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Direct Ligation of Adapters to first strand cDNA (DLAF) and subjected to 50 base sequencing on Illumina HiSeq2000.
