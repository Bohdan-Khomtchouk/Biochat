TITLE
Comparison of the DNA methylation profiles of CD14+ monocytes from human peripheral blood with DCs and MACs obtained by exposure with GM-CSF/IL-4 and GM-CSF, respectively, and with mature DCs and MACs after LPS exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of the DNA methylation profiles of CD14+ monocytes from human peripheral blood with derived dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (MACs) obtained by exposure with GM-CSF/IL-4 and GM-CSF, respectively, and with mature DCs and MACs after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure The methylation profiles of bisulfite-modified DNA of human CD14+ monocytes were compared with derived immature dendritic cells (iDCs) and macrophages (iMACs) following GM-CSF/IL-4  and GM-CSF incubation, and then activation/maturation with lypopolysaccharyde (LPS) using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA,). This platform allows the interrogation of > 485,000 methylation sites per sample at single-nucleotide resolution, and comprises an average of 17 CpG sites per gene in the 99% of RefSeq genes. 96% of CpG islands are covered, with additional coverage in CpG island shores and the regions flanking them. The samples were hybridized in the array following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

DESIGN
Total DNA isolated by standard procedures from CD14+ cells (total monocytes, MOs) corresponding to three sets of samples of monocytes (MOs), derived immature DCs and MACs (iDCS and iMACS) and activated/mature DCs and MACs following incubation with LPS (mDCS and mMACs)
