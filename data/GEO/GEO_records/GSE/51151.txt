TITLE
Expression data from OsSIK2-overexpression and mutant rice seedlings

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play important roles in plant development and defense responses; however, their functions in other processes remain unclear. Here, we report that OsSIK2, an S-domain RLK from rice, is involved in abiotic stress and senescence process, integrating stress signals into developmental program for adaptive growth. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression in OsSIK2-overexpression and mutant lines from 14-day-old rice seedlings and identified distinct regulated genes.

DESIGN
We sought to obtain distinct regulated genes by OsSIK2. To that end,the aerial parts of different rice seedlings,including OsSIK2-overexpression lines, mutant and respective controls, were harveted for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
