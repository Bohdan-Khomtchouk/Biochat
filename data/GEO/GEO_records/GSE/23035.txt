TITLE
Expression data from BAP1 depleted cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The deubiquitinase BAP1 is a candidate tumor suppressor regulating cell proliferation in human and is required for development in Drosophila. BAP1 is assembled into high molecular weight transcriptional multi-protein complexes. In order to identify potential BAP1 target genes, global mRNA expression profiling using microarrays was conducted.

DESIGN
U2OS cells, transfected with a non-target control shRNA or shRNAs targeting BAP1, were selected with puromycin containing medium and then synchronized at the G1/S border to allow comparative analysis of gene expression.
