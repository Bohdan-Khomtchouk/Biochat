TITLE
Custom array CGH validation of de novo CNVs in asthma samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is the validation data for candidate de novo CNV calls made in the asthma trios by Itsara et al., Genome Research 2010. In this study, de novo CNV calls in the asthma data set were initially made with Illumina 550K SNP arrays. Validation was performed with custom Nimblegen array CGH for which DNA was available. de novo CNVs would be expected to validate in the child of each trio tested, and not be detected in either parent.
