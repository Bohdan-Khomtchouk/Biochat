TITLE
miRNA regulation in diabetes associated impaired wound healing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Circulating miRNAs constitute a novel class of disease biomarkers, which are altered in diabetes but the effect of diabetes associated inflammation as seen in chronic wounds is unknown. We here compared the miRNA pattern in diabetic patients in presence or absence of chronic wound with PAD.

DESIGN
The clinical plasma samples were obtained from Heart and Diabetes centre, NRW and compared for plasma miRNA levels in 2 pools of 17 T2DM+PAD+Wound patients vs 2 pools from 20 T2DM controls
