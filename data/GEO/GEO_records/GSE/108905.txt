TITLE
Next-generation sequencing of human dermal fibroblasts transdifferentiated towards the otic lineage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the RNAseq analysis of human dermal fibroblasts which have been treated by protocols to stimulate their differentiation towards the otic lineage. This was achieved by transfection with different transcription factors with the aim to induce an initial reprogramming of the cells and was followed by growth factor treatments known to promote otic differentiation. The results show that a partial differentiation towards the otic lineage is achieved by these protocols.

DESIGN
RNAseq profiles were obtained from human dermal fibroblasts  with two different protocols. Prior to treatment with growth factors stimulating differentiation, the samples were either transfected with the transcription factors OCT4 or a combination of ATOH1, POU4F3 and GFI1.
