TITLE
Expression data comparing human foreskin keratinocytes to epithelial derivatives of human embryonic stem cells (H9)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome expression array comparison of primary keratinocytes to retinoic acid-differentiated hES cell derivatives Cells were differentiated according to Metallo et al. Stem Cells 2008

DESIGN
A 3 chip study was conducted using competitive hybridization comparing pFKs to hEKs obtained in 3 independent differentiation experiments
