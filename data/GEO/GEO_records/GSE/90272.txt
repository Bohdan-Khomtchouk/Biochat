TITLE
polyA mRNA RNA-seq from CD14-positive monocyte (ENCSR000CUC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from the whole cell fraction of independent isolates of mobilized CD14+ monocytes. They are stranded PE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted Poly-A+ RNA > 200 nucleotides in size.
