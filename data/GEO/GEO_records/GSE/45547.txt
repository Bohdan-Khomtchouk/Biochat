TITLE
Hox-C9 activates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and is associated with spontaneous regression in neuroblastoma [tumor_genex_44k]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Single-color gene expression profiles from 649 neuroblastoma tumors were generated using 44K oligonucleotide microarrays. We aimed at determining the association of class I HOX gene expression patterns with prognostic markers in neuroblastoma.We investigated the functional consequences of HOXC9 re-expression on neuroblastoma growth and programmed cell death. One-color gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
Single-color gene expression profiles from 649 neuroblastoma tumors were generated using 44K oligonucleotide microarrays. Stages were classified according to the International Neuroblastoma Staging System. The expression patterns of the 39 class I HOX genes were analyzed in 649 neuroblastoma samples by microarrays, and the association with prognostic markers was determined.
