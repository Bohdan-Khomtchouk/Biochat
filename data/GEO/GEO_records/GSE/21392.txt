TITLE
Notch signaling suppresses the progression of colorectal tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Notch signaling pathway regulates fate decision, proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. However, the role of Notch signaling in colorectal cancer progression is largely unknown. Here we show that Notch signaling suppresses the progression of colorectal tumorigenesis, even though it augments tumor initiation. In contrast to adenomas of Apcmin mice, Notch-inactivated Apcmin adenomas showed more malignant characteristics, such as submucosal invasion and loss of glandular pattern. Conversely, Notch-activated Apcmin adenomas showed a reversion from high-grade to low-grade features, such as the restoration of adherent junctions. Expression profiling revealed that Notch signaling promotes the differentiation of tumor cells with down regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin target genes and inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Comparison of mouse and human expression profiles also suggests the common role of Notch in inhibition of tumor progression. Interestingly, Notch signaling suppressed the expression of beta-catenin responsive genes through chromatin modification of Tcf4/beta-catenin binding sides. Our results suggest that Notch signaling has dual roles in colorectal tumorigenesis: promoting adenoma initiation, while inhibiting tumor progression to colorectal cancer.

DESIGN
mRNAs from normal (WT, Notch-activated and Notch-inactivated) and tumor (WT, Notch-activated and Notch-inactivated) tissues were profiled.
