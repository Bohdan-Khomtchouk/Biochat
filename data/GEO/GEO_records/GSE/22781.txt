TITLE
Differential gene expression in SN12C.19 renal cells with insertion of the chromosomal 3p arm

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SN12C.19 is a renal carcinoma cell line with loss of heterozygosity in the 3p chromosomal region near the centromere.  It is believed that a tumor suppressor gene is located in this region.  In studies with athymic nude mice, tumor formation followed injection of SN12C.19 cells.  Tumor formation did not follow by injection of the hybrid cell line SN19(3i)YY, which includes a very small fragment insertion of the 3p chromosomal arm.  The goal of this array experiment was to identify genes differentially expressed in SN12C.19 by the introduction of a normal copy of the chromosomal 3p arm. SN12C.19 and SN19(3i)YY cells were hybridized to Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 Chips.  Array quality was inspected with output from dChip software.  Gene expression was quantified with PDNN software.  There were 57 probesets showing differential expression on the 3p arm, corresponding to 46 genes.

DESIGN
A suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) library was previously constructed using as starting materials microcell hybrid clones which mapped the NRC-1 locus and containing defined fragments of chromosome 3p12 which were either suppressed or unsuppressed for tumorigencity following injection of microcell hybrid clones into athymic nude mice
