TITLE
Expression data from rat orthotopic bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In the development and progression of bladder cancer, there are many genetic changes. We established a SD rat orthotopic bladder cancer model through intravesical instillation of N-methyl-nitrosourea and pathologic diagnosis is bladder transtional cell carcinomal (BTCC). We used microarrays to analysis the gene expression changes among these rat bladder carcinoma, adjacent normal tissues and bladder tissues of normal rats.

DESIGN
Three paired tumor tissues (Group A) and adjacent normal tissues (Group B) were obtained from 3 SD rats with BTCC, and 3 normal tissues (Group C) obtained from 3 normal SD rats. Affymetrix microarrays analyzed the gene expression changes among above 3 groups of tissues.
