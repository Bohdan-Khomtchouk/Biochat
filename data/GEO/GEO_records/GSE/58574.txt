TITLE
Human MCF-7 breast cancer cells: control vs. treated with conditioned medium of cancer associated adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells comparing MCF-7 cells treated with control medium (DMEM/F12 + 0,5% BSA) with MCF-7 cells treated with conditioned medium of cancer-associated adipose tissue (CMCAAT) obtained from 2 breast cancer patients. Goal was to determine the effects of CMCAAT treatment on global MCF-7 gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: MCF-7 control vs. CMCAAT treated cells. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates pooled as 1 (LL 1-2-4), 4 CMCAAT replicates (LL 6, LL 8, LL 9, LL 10)

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
