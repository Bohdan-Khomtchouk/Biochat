TITLE
Time-Dependent miRNA Profiling Following Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Rat Retina

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The purpose of the present study was to investigate time-dependent changes in the expression profile of miRNAs, following induction of IR in the rat retina, and to characterize the affected pathways, networks and processes.

DESIGN
6 biological replicates with two treatments (Sham control and Ischemia reperfusion) and 5 time points (0h, 2h, 24h, 48h and 7day) with total of 60 samples.

PLATFORM
GPL10906 Agilent-019159 Rat miRNA Microarray (miRBase release 12.0 miRNA ID version)
