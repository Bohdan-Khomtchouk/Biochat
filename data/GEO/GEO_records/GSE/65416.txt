TITLE
Comparative metabolic and transcriptional analysis of a doubled diploid and its diploid citrus rootstock (C. junos cv. Ziyang xiangcheng) suggests its potential value for stress resistance improvement

ORGANISM
Citrus junos

SUMMARY
To investigate global genome expression changes caused by tetraploidization, we  compared, by RNA-Seq analysis, the nuclear gene expression profiles of mature leaves of the diploid citrus rootstock and its doubled diploid. A total of 212 genes were differentially expressed between the diploid and doubled dipoid. In biological process category, DEGs were found to be highly related to stress-response functions, such as response to salt stress, to water, and to abscisic acid. In molecular function category, only two terms were overrepresented, namely, inorganic anion transmembrane transporter activity, inorganic phosphate transmembrane transporter activity.

DESIGN
Total four sample pools (two independent biological replicates of the diploid and doubled diploid mature leaves)
