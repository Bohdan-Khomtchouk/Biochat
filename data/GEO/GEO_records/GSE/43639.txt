TITLE
Developmental Changes in the Transcriptome of Human Cerebral Cortex Tissue: Long Noncoding RNA Transcripts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the hypothesis that lncRNA expression varies with age, potentially paralleling 25 known developmental trends in synaptogenesis, myelination, and energetics, we quantified levels of nearly 6000 lncRNAs in 36 surgically resected human neocortical samples (primarily derived from temporal cortex) spanning infancy to adulthood.

DESIGN
One-color (Alexa 555 green) microarray experiment was performed separately on each of the 36 surgically-resected human neocortical samples (primarily derived from temporal cortex) spanning infancy to adulthood. 8 probes per gene and 5 on-chip replicates for each probe.

PLATFORM
GPL16528 Agilent-022061 human lncRNA 1X244K microarray (Probe Name version)
