TITLE
miRNAs regulated by Gadd45a during somatic cell reprogramming

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gadd45a can enhance somatic cell reprogramming significantly. To explore the roles of  Gadd45a playing in reprogramming, we performed miRNA microarray to identify miRNAs and signals pathways that regulated by Gadd45a.

DESIGN
miRNAs expression of MEFs was measured at day8 in reprogramming. Four samples were set: MEFs infected with SKO plus Flag, MEFs infected with SKO plus Gadd45a, MEFs infected with SKOM plus Flag and MEFs infected with SKOM+Ga.

PLATFORM
GPL17912 Agilent-046065 Mouse_miRNA_V19.0_Microarray (miRNA ID version)
