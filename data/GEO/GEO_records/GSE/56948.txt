TITLE
Regulatory consequences of TARBP2 over-expression in MDA-231 cell-line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transient transfection of TARBP2 expression vectors (along with GFP controls) followed by transcriptomic profiling revealed that over-expression of TARBP2 resulted in a significant enrichment of sRSE-carrying transcripts among the down-regulated transcripts.

DESIGN
Transient transfection of CMV-driven TARBP2 was used to over-express this protein in MDA-231 cells. The cells were then subjected to transcripome profiling in comparison to mock-transfected cells.
