Improved Fermentative Production of Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid via the Putrescine Route: Systems Metabolic Engineering for Production From Glucose, Amino Sugars, and Xylose

Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032

SUMMARY
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a non-protein amino acid widespread in Nature. Among the various uses of GABA, its lactam form 2-pyrrolidone can be chemically converted to the biodegradable plastic polyamide-4. In metabolism, GABA can be synthesized either by decarboxylation of L-glutamate or by a pathway that starts with the transamination of putrescine. Fermentative production of GABA from glucose by recombinant Corynebacterium glutamicum has been described via both routes. Putrescine-based GABA production was characterized by accumulation of by-products such as N-acetyl-putrescine. Their formation was abolished by deletion of the spermi(di)ne N-acetyl-transferase gene snaA. To improve provision of L-glutamate as precursor 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity was reduced by changing the translational start codon of the chromosomal gene for 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase subunit E1o to the less preferred TTG and by maintaining the inhibitory protein OdhI in its inhibitory formby changing amino acid residue 15 from threonine to alanine. Putrescine-based GABA  production by the strains described here led to GABA titers up to 63.2 g L-1 in fed-batch cultivation at maximum volumetric productivities up to 1.34 g L-11 h1-1, the highest volumetric productivity for fermentative GABA production reported to date. Moreover, GABA production from the carbon sources xylose, glucosamine, and N-acetyl-glucosamine that do not have competing uses in the food or feed industries was established.
