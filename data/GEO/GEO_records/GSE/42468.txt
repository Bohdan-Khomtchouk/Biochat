TITLE
Differentially expressed miRNAs in MDA-MB-231 over-expressing GATA3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the differentially expressed miRNAs in MDA-MB-231-GATA3 cells vs. MDA-MB-231-Control cells

DESIGN
Pooled polyclonal cells from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells +/- GATA3 over-expression were analyzed for miRNA expression
