TITLE
Hypermethylation of CpG Islands and Shores adjacent to mirtron and microRNA genes in bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined mirtron and miR expression in bladder cancer cell line following DNA Methyltransferase inhibition and normal urothelium using human Agilent microRNA microarrays.

DESIGN
Bladder cancer cell lines (EJ, RT4 and RT112) were treated with 5-azacytidine ''Aza'' (2uM) for 5-7 days and normal urothelium (NHU) were subjected for microRNA microarray analysis.  Analysis were performed in triplicates or more.
