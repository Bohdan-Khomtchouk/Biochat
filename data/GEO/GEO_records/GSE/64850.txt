TITLE
Molecular Biomarkers Screened by Next-generation RNA Sequencing for non-sentinel lymph node status predicting in breast cancer patients with metastatic sentinel lymph node

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Six candidates (all ER/PR+, HER2âˆ’, Ki-67 < 20 %) with metastatic SLNs selected from 305 patients were equally categorized as NSLN negative and positive. We identified 103 specifically expressed genes in the NSLN negative group and 47 in the NSLN positive group. Among them, FABP1 (negative group) and CYP2A13 (positive group) were the only 2 protein-encoding genes with expression levels in the 8th to 10th deciles. Using a false discovery rate threshold of < 0.05, 62 up-regulated genes and 98 down-regulated genes were discovered in the NSLN positive group. Furthermore, 10 gene fusions were identified in this group with the most frequently fused 23 gene being IGLL5.

DESIGN
examination of transcriptome differences between NSLN positive and negative breast patients
