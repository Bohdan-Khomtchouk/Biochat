TITLE
Genomic and Proteomic Analysis of the Alkaline-Tolerance Response (AlTR) in Listeria monocytogenes 10403S

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
Information regarding the Alkaline Tolerance Response (AlTR) in Listeria monocytogenes is very limited. In this study, L. monocytogenes was shown to exhibit a significant adaptive alkaline tolerance response (AlTR) following a 1-h exposure to mild alkaline (pH 9.5), which is capable of protecting cells from subsequent lethal alkali stress (pH 12.0).  Treatment of adapted cells with protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol has revealed that AlTR is at least partially protein-dependent. In order to gain a more comprehensive perspective on the physiology and regulation of AlTR, we compared differential gene expression and protein content at pH 9.5 using microarray and two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis, (combined with mass spectrometry) respectively. By interfacing the results of both approaches this study showed strong evidence that alkali tolerance response in L. monocytogenes functions as to minimize excess alkalisation and energy expenditures while mobilizing available carbon sources. Adaptive intracellular gene expression involved genes that are associated with virulence, the general stress response, cell division, and changes in cell wall structure and included many genes with unknown functions.  The variability observed between results of cDNA arrays and 2D may account for posttranslational modifications. Interestingly, several alkali induced genes/proteins can provide a cross protective overlap to other types of stresses. Alkaline pH provides therefore L. monocytogenes with nonspecific multiple-stress resistance that may be vital for survival in the human gastrointestinal tract as well as within food processing systems where similar alkaline conditions as the ones used in this study prevail.
