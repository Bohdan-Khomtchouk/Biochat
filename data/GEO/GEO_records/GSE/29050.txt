TITLE
The transcriptome of poplar roots incubated with MiSSP7, a secreted effector protein of Laccaria bicolor

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
To investigate which genes are affected by MiSSP7, a secreted effector protein of Laccaria bicolor, we analyzed the transcriptomes of poplar roots incubated with MiSSP7 protein.
