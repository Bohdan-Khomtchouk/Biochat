TITLE
The transcriptome of poplar roots incubated with MiSSP7, a secreted effector protein of Laccaria bicolor

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
To investigate which genes are affected by MiSSP7, a secreted effector protein of Laccaria bicolor, we analyzed the transcriptomes of poplar roots incubated with MiSSP7 protein.

DESIGN
The Populus trichocarpa custom-exon expression array (12x135K) manufactured by Roche NimbleGen Systems Limited (Madison, WI) ( http://www.nimblegen.com/products/exp/index.html ) contained three independent, nonidentical, 60-mer probes per gene model coding sequence. Included in the oligoarray were 43,929 annotated gene models (Populus trichocarpa genome v2 ; Phytozome 5.0), 5,859 random 60-mer control probes and labelling controls. We performed six hybridizations, three biological replicates from poplar roots inoculated with MiSSP7 peptide for one hour and three biological replicates from control roots.
