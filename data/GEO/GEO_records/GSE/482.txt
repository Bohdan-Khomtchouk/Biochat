TITLE
Vascular remodeling following pulmonary hypertension

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hypoxia can induce vasoconstriction followed by vascular remodeling including hypertrophy and hyperplasia of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle and proliferation of endothelial cells.  The goal of this project is to elucidate the genes involved in vascular remodeling following pulmonary hypertension.  Total RNA was isolated from lungs of normoxic  and hypoxic treated animals.
