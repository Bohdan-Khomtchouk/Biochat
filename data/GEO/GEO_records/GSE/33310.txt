TITLE
Rat primary chondrocyte: Control vs. IL-1beta treated

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
microRNA expression profilings of chondrocytes comparing control untreated cells with cells treated with IL-1beta. Three timepoints included are 6h,12h and 24h. Many microRNAs change their expression patterns owing to IL-1beta stimulation. Some of them are chosen for further investigation.

DESIGN
time series,including three time points and one control.Five replicates per array.
