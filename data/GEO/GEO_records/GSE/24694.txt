TITLE
miRNA expression in primary human leukaemic B-cells from peripheral blood and after culture on stromal cells in the presence and absence of CD154 and IL-4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dynamic miRNA expression data in 377 miRNA present on Taqman low density array (TLDA) Human MicroRNA Array (A) plates (Applied Biosystems, #4398965).

DESIGN
Primary human leukaemic B-cells were cultured for 24 hours on a stromal cell layer or a stromal cell layer with CD154 and IL-4 in order to find out how miRNA expression compared to that of freshly isolated leukaemic cells.
