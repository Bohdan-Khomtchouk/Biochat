TITLE
Synechocystis PCC6803 time course responses to cadmium (CdSO4, 50 microM, 300 min.

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
The transcriptome approach was used to characterize the of the global change in Synechocystis gene expression in response to continuous exposure to cadmium (50 microM). Total RNA were isolated from stressed and unstressed cells, reverse-transcribed, differentially labelled (dye swapped), hybridized together (stressed versus unstressed samples) and analyzed with DNA glass microarrays (two slides per each time point) (Custom-commercial array : IntelliGeneTM CyanoCHIP version 2.0, TAKARA). To identify differentially expressed genes, the median of the normalized ratio of Cy5/Cy3 intensity was calculated for each spot of the replicated dye-swap. The results of the analysis were carefully examined to exclude the dye effect between the 2 Cy-swapped arrays. Keywords: stress responses

DESIGN
We analysed cadmium responses on the new version of Takara cyanochip (version 2.0, GPL3214). This analysis is composed of 2 arrays (dye swap).

PLATFORM
GPL3214 Takara CyanoChip v.2.0
