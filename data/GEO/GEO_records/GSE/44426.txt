TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells from patients with Primary Myelofibrosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm whose severity and treatment complexity is attributed to the presence of bone marrow (BM) fibrosis and alterations of stroma impairing the production of normal blood cells.  Despite the recently discovered mutations including the JAK2V617F mutation in about half of patients, the primitive event responsible for the clonal proliferation is still unknown. In the highly inflammatory context of PMF, the presence of fibrosis associated with a neoangiogenesis and an osteosclerosis concomitant to the myeloproliferation and to the increase number of circulating hematopoietic progenitors suggests that the crosstalk between hematopoietic and stromal cells is deregulated in the PMF BM microenvironment. Within these niches, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (BM-MSC) play a supportive role in the production of growth factors and extracellular matrix which regulate the proliferation, differentiation, adhesion and migration of hematopoietic progenitors. A transcriptome analysis of BM-MSC in PMF patients will help to characterize their molecular alterations and to understand their involvement in the hematopoietic progenitor deregulation that features PMF.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis was performed on BM-MSC amplified in vitro after 3 to 5 passages. Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays were used to compare expression profiling of BM-MSC from PMF patients and healthy donors.
