TITLE
Expression data from mouse CD3+ T-cells from WT and KLF13 KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Kruppel-like factors are a subclass of zinc finger transcription factors that play important roles in different aspects of cell growth, development, and differentiation. Our group have identified KLF13 as an essential transcription factor for the late expression of chemokine RANTES in T lymphocytes. However, very little is known about the role of KLF13 in T cells and other potential transcriptional targets. To address this, we sought to identify genes that are regulated by KLF13 in mouse T cells. Using microarray analysis, we compared gene expression in activated CD3+ T lymphocytes from wild type and Klf13-/- animals.

DESIGN
We isolated CD3+ T-cells from WT and KO mouse spleen. Isolated cells were activated with CD3 and CD28 for 4 days and RNA was extracted. All samples were hybrdized and gene expression were analyzed with Affymetrix microarrays.
