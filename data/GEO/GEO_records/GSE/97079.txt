TITLE
Apoptosis-associated blood transcriptome changes caused by EBV antiviral therapy

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Herpesviridae family members are the etiologic agents of several social significant pathologies. Identification of blood markers for monitoring and prognosis of diseases caused by herpesviruses is  the actual task of clinical research.  Serie of microarray experiments presented here focused on EBV patients during acute mononucleosis and after recovery for identifying potentially clinically relevant  mRNAs extracted from blood samples and encoding elements of apoptotic-associated cascades. In particular, an attempt to identify significant transcripts and genes associated with EBV eradication or with decrease in viral load was made.

DESIGN
We developed the splicing-sensitive microarray covering 221 genes, each microarray encompassed 4 identical probe-containing areas. Blood samples obtained from 3 EBV patients during acute mononucleosis and after convalescence plus one sample from a patient on acute stage were included in the experiment. Quantile normalization was performed over all the samples to compare averaged values from the samples on convalescent stage with averaged values from the samples on acute stage.
