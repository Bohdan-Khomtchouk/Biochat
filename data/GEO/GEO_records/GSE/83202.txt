TITLE
Glucocorticoids in maintaining cardiac homeostasis in C57bl/6 (wild-type) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further understand the genomic effects of glucocorticoids in the heart we performed microarray studies on hearts collected from long-term ADX-mice. Our objective is to find cardiac specific genes regulated by glucocorticoids.

DESIGN
C57bl/6 (wild-type) mice were adrenalectomized. Hearts were collected from sham-adrenalectomized and adrenalectomized mice 6 months following the surgery. Three biological replicates were used for this study.
