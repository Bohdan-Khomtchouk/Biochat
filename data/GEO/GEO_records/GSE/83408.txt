TITLE
Chromatin Binding of Gcn5 in Drosophila is Largely Mediated by CP190 [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
80% of the genomic binding sites of the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 are colocalizing with CP190 binding. Depletion of CP190 reduces the number of Gcn5 binding sites and binding strength to chromatin. Binding dependency was further supported by Gcn5 mediated co-precipitation of CP190

DESIGN
Gcn5 ChIP-Seq in Kc cells treated either with GFP RNAi or CP190 RNAi

PLATFORM
GPL17275 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
