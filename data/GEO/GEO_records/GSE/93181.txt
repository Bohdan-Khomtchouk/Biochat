TITLE
Effect of light on translatome of Arabidopsis seeds during germination

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au14-10_wd40 - effet of light on translatome of arabidopsis seeds during germination - Does light regulates germination via polysome association ? - At harvest seeds are dormant.They stay dormant if stored at -20°C.A.Th dormant seeds dont germinate at 25°C in darkness.Total RNA and polysomal RNA (polysomal fractions purified on sucrose gradients)were extracted from imbibed seeds for 20h at 22°C in darkness and light(3 biological replicates). Transcriptome and translatome are compared for light vs dark for 20h of imbibition. In silico comparison will allow to compare transcriptome and translatome for each type of sample.

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison
