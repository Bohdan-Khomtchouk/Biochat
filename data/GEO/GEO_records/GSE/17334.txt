TITLE
Oogenesis in Solea senegalensis: vitellogenic versus atretic ovaries

ORGANISM
Solea senegalensis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile changes in ovary during the reproductive cycle of Solea senegalensis: from vitellogenic stage to atresia stage obtained at different times during the annual reproductive cycle. An oligo microarray based on ESTs sequenced from S. senegalensis previously designed (Cerd√† et al., 2008, BMC genomics) was used.

DESIGN
The two stages of ovary development were directly compared using three individuals for each stage (IR-Vt-1, IR-Vt-2, IR-Vt-3 for vitellogenic individuals and IR-At-1, IR-At-2, IR-At-3 for atretic individuals). For the experiment, the atretic stage was used as the control.
