TITLE
Genome wide analysis of genes expressed in late G1/S phase of the cell cycle in PMCA4 knockout (P4KO) and P4KO rescued with PMCA4a primary vascular smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Husain lab cell proliferation in vitro experimental data showed that electroporating PMCA4a cDNA into P4KO cells rescued the  G1 arrest phenotype in P4KO primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). This microarray documents the different gene expression profiles of P4KO and P4KO+PMCA4a VSMC at the late G1/S stage in serum synchronized cell populations (n=4 populations for each genotype).

DESIGN
Serum synchronized late G1/S stage cell populations  (P4KO and P4KO+PMCA4a) were employed to extract total RNA which was used for microarray analysis.
