TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in conventional and germ-free intestine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Whole tissues corresponding to the ileum, colon and rectum were dissected from adult mice and used for RNA preparation. The aim of experiment was to study the impact of gut microbiota on gene expression in different gut regions. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were used for each condition. Each RNA preparation was independently hybridized to one chip.
