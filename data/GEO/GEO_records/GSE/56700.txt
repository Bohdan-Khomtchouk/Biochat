TITLE
ChIP-chip data of Thp1-Flag and Sac3-Flag in wild-type cells, and Rrm3-Flag in sac3∆ and thp1∆ cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcription is a major obstacle for replication fork progression and a cause of genome instability. Such instability increases in mutants with a suboptimal assembly of the nascent messenger ribonucleo-protein particle (mRNP), as THO/TREX and the NPC-associated THSC/TREX-2 complex. Here we show that yeast sac3∆ and thp1∆ cells accumulate genome-wide replication obstacles as determined by the distribution of the Rrm3 helicase. Such obstacles preferentially occur at long and highly expressed genes, to which Sac3 and its interacting partner Thp1 are preferentially bound in wild-type cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip studies were perfomed with antibodies against Flag-tagged Thp1 and Sac3 proteins in wild-type cells of the yeast S. Cerevisiae, as well as Flag-tagged Rrm3 protein in sac3∆ and thp1∆ cells that were compared with Rrm3 in wild-type cells from Santos-Pereira et al., 2013 (accession number GSE50185).
