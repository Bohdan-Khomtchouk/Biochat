TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of MAPK KOs mutants under normal growing conditions (mpk)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au07-10_mpk - mpk - Gain insight into the function of mpk genes by characterizing the transcriptional profile of the mpk5, mpk10 and mpk11 KO mutants in comparison with that of the Arabidopsis wt plants. - 1) mpk5 (WS genetic background) versus wt-WS 2) mpk11 (Col0 genetic background) versus wt-Col0 3) mpk10 (Col0 genetic background) versus wt-Col0 Seeds were surface sterilized and grown in MS agar medium (3% sucrose) for 11 days in long day conditions. Entire seedling were harvested and deep frozen in liquid nitrogen. Keywords: gene knock out

DESIGN
8 dye-swap - CATMA arrays
