TITLE
JNK-mediated control of gene expression in liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNAseq analysis of gene expression in Liver of Control and JNK deficient mice fed a control or a High fat diet

DESIGN
Contro(Albcre+)l and mice with liver-specific defiency of JNK (Alb Cre+ Jnk1flox/flox, Jnk2flox/flox or Jnk1flox/floxJnk2flox/flox) were fed a control or a high fat diet for 16 weeks. Gene expression analysis in liver was analyzed by RNAseq
