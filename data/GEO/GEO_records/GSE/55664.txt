TITLE
Genomic profiling of human Leishmania braziliensis lesions identifies transcriptional modules associated with cutaneous immunopathology

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The host immune response plays a critical role not only in protection from human leishmaniasis, but also in promoting disease severity. Although candidate gene approaches in mouse models of leishmaniasis have been extremely informative, a global understanding of the immune pathways active in lesions from human patients is lacking. To address this issue, genome-wide transcriptional profiling of Leishmania braziliensis-infected cutaneous lesions and normal skin controls was carried out. A signature of the L. braziliensis skin lesion was defined that includes over 2,000 differentially regulated genes. Pathway-level analysis of this transcriptional response revealed key biological pathways, as well as specific genes, associated with cutaneous pathology, generating a testable 'metapathway' model of immune-driven lesion pathology, and providing new insights for treatment of human leishmaniasis.

DESIGN
Thirty-five skin biopsies were analyzed, including 10 normal skin biopsies (2 from North America and 8 from non-endemic area in Brazil), and 25 skin lesion biopsies (8 early cutaneous lesions, 17 late cutaneous lesions) obtained from Leishmania brazilensis-infected patients presenting at the Corte de Pedra Health Post in Corte de Pedra, Bahia, Brazil.
