TITLE
Genes regulated by T cell and B cell derived TNF in naive lymph nodes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We present a RNA microarray analysis of RNA`s extracted from naive mesenterial lymph nodes of mice with specific inactivation of tumor necrosis factor only in B cells (B-TNf mice) or in T- and B-cells  (TB-TNF mice). Several genes are cooperatively regulated by T cell derived and B cell derived TNF Keywords: cell type comparison design

DESIGN
For 1 independent sample 3 mice of one genotype have been sacrificed, mesenterial lymph nodes were isolated and pooled together. Lymph nodes were immediately frozen in luquid N2  and RNA was prepared using Tri-reagent. RNA was precipitated with isopropanol, washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in DEPC dH2O.
