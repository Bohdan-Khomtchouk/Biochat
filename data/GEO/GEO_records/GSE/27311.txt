TITLE
SLF1 overexpression versus control cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Measure the relative changes of gene expression upon GIS2 overexpression; BY4741 cells bearing plasmid pBG1805-Slf1 or control plasmid pBG1805 were grown in SC ura- gal  at 30 C for 6 or 24 hours. An overnight culture of cells was inoculated at an OD600 of 0.1 and further grown to an OD600 of 0.5- 0.7 in 60 ml SC Ura- Gal at 30 C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 600 ul of ice-cold sterile water. 200 ul of cells were removed and RNA was isolated by hot phenol extraction for microarray analysis. 7.5 ug of total RNA derived from cells expressing the empty vector (pBG1805) or Slf1p (pBG1805_Slf1) were reverse transcribed in the presence of 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP and natural dNTPs with a mixture of N9 and dT20V primers, and cDNAs were covalently linked to Cy3 and Cy5 NHS-monoesters (GE HealthSciences Cat# RPN5661), respectively, and competitively hybridized on yeast oligo arrays at 42 degrees celsius for 14 hours in formamide-based hybridization buffer. Microarrays were scanned with an Axonscanner 4200 (Molecular Devices) and analyzed with GenePix Pro 5.1 (Molecular devices).

DESIGN
An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract.
