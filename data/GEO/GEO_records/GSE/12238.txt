TITLE
Analysis of growth-phase regulated genes in Streptococcus agalactiae by global transcript profiling

ORGANISM
Streptococcus agalactiae

SUMMARY
We determined dynamic behavior of S. agalactiae transcriptome during growth in THY medium and detected growth phase regulated genes

DESIGN
Three independent cultures (three biological replicates) of S. agalactiae NEM316 strain in rich laboratory medium were sampled at mid log, late log early and late stationary growth phase.

PLATFORM
GPL6923 TMHRI Streptococcus agalactiae 2K array version1
