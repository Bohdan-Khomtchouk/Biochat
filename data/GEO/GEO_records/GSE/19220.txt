TITLE
Expression data from TKI258 treated 4T1 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cells have an autocrine FGFR active loop leading to constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways. We found that FGFR inhibitors have a strong effect on the proliferation and survival of these cells. We used microarray to understand the contribution of FGFR signaling to the tumorigenic phenotype of the 4T1 cells.

DESIGN
4T1 cells were grown in tissue culture and treated with TKI258 or DMSO as vehicle control for 16 hours. The RNA were extracted from three individual dishes per condition and hybridized on Affimetrix microarrays.
