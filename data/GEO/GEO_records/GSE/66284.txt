TITLE
CAGE-Seq of gonads and carcasses from D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila pseudoobscura

SUMMARY
We performed CAGE-Seq on dissected ovaries and testes as well as female and male carcasses of two species of Drosophila (D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura).  These data are used to map transcription start sites. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
For both species, D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, CAGE-Seq was performed on dissected gonads (with reproductive tracts) and remaining carcasses from wild-type adults, using Illumina GAIIx (SRA Study SRP001602, Bioproject PRJNA36315).  There are eight samples.  Only Drosophila melanogaster testis samples were performed in biological duplicate.  See Chen ZX et al. Genome Res 2014, 24(7):1209-23.
