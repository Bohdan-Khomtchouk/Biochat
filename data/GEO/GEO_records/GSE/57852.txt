TITLE
Genome-wide maps of the total and lysine methylated enriched pools of peroxisome proliferating activated receptor gamma (pparg) co-activator 1 alpha (ppargc1a)  in Hepa 1-6 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of single nucleotide sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of ppargc1a  in mouse hepatome cells (Hepa1-6). By obtaining 1.2 billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide maps of ppargc1a sin mouse hepatoma cells. We identify novel non- coding sites of ppargc1a occupation in hepatic cells for Sirt5, Idh3b, Pfkl, and Hmox2 strongly corresponds with the enrichment of enhancer -associated RNAs.

DESIGN
Examination of the genomic disttribution of the total pool of ppargc1a and the lysine methylated (K779me) enriched pool of ppargc1a in mouse Hepa1-6 hepatoma cells.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
