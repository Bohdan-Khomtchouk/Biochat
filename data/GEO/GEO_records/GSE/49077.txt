TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the D3 mouse embryonic stem cell line in comparison to the MIN6 pancreatic beta-cell insulinoma cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptional differences between mouse ES cells from the D3 cell line and transformed beta-cells (MIN6 cell line) as determined by a direct comparative analysis of their transcriptome. The results show that 40% of transcripts were differentially expressed between D3 and MIN6 cells. There is thus a marked difference in the pattern of transcription between the ES cell and beta-cell genomes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from three independent replicates of passage 21 D3 cells and passage 23 MIN6 cells. A whole mouse genome comparison between D3 and MIN6 cells was performed using the Mouse WG-6 v2.0 Expression Beadchip from Illumina.
