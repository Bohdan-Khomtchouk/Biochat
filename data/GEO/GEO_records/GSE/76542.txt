TITLE
Expression data from wild-type or Rb mutant MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The retinoblastoma family regulates numerous genes in multiple biochemical processes including cell cycle, apoptosis, and cellular metabolic. We used multiple genetically modified cell lines in order to better understand the contributing role of each pocket protein to gene expression. Microarray analysis was performed on wild-type, Rb1 knock-out, triple knock-out (TKO: Rb1, p107, p130), or TKO-RasG12D mouse embryonic fibroblasts

DESIGN
MEFs from each genetic background were collected during exponential growth to discern the role of the Rb family on gene expression. RNA from biological triplicates from each cell lines was collected for microarray analysis.
