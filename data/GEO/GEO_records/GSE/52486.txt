TITLE
Gene expression timecourse in wild-type strain

ORGANISM
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942

SUMMARY
The goal of the experiment was to obtain a replicate of the wild-type LL circadian timecourse published in Vijayan et al, PNAS 106: 22564-22568 (2009), in order to identify reproducible circadian genes in LL.

DESIGN
Cultures were grown in a turbidostat as described previously (Vijayan et al, PNAS 2009), except that the culture volume was 3 L instead of 4.5 L.  Cultures were entrained with two consecutive light/dark cycles and released into continuous light at time T = 0.  Cultures were samples every 4 hours from T = 36 h and T = 64 h, inclusive.  Gene expression at each timepoint was compared to the time-averaged gene expression (determined using a pool of equal mass quantities of RNA from all timepoints) using a two-color Agilent microarray.  Timepoint T = 52 h is omitted due to poor data quality.
