TITLE
Global Mapping of Human RNA-RNA Interactions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We describe a new method enabling the global-scale mapping of RNA-RNA duplexes cross-linked in vivo, ‘LIGation of interacting RNA followed by high-throughput Sequencing’ (LIGR-Seq). Applying this method in human cells reveals a remarkable landscape of new RNA-RNA interactions involving all major classes of ncRNA, and mRNA. LIGR-Seq data reveal unexpected interactions between small nucleolar (sno)RNAs and mRNAs, including interactions involving the orphan C/D box snoRNA, SNORD83B, that control steady-state levels of its target mRNAs. LIGR-Seq thus represents a powerful approach for illuminating the functions of the myriad of uncharacterized RNAs that act via base-pairing interactions.

DESIGN
RNA-RNA interaction discovery in HEK293T cells in two replicates.
