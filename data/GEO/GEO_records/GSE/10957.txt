TITLE
Effects of mitochondrial DNA on the gene expression profiles of human cells grown in culture and in tumor xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Interactions between the gene products encoded by the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes play critical roles in normal eukaryotic cellular function. Here, we characterized the metabolic and transcriptional properties of A549 lung cancer cells and their isogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-depleted rho zero counterparts grown in cell culture and as tumor xenografts in immune-deficient mice. A manuscript summarizing our conclusions is under review. Keywords: genetic modification and culture conditions

DESIGN
A549 rho zero and their parental A549 cells were grown in culture and as xenografts in nude mice.  All experiments conducted in culture were performed in triplicate (6 experiments total) and all experiments conducted in xenografts were performed in quadruplicate (8 experiments total).  A manuscript summarizing our experimental design is under review.
