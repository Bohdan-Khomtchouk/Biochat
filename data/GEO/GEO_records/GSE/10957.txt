TITLE
Effects of mitochondrial DNA on the gene expression profiles of human cells grown in culture and in tumor xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Interactions between the gene products encoded by the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes play critical roles in normal eukaryotic cellular function. Here, we characterized the metabolic and transcriptional properties of A549 lung cancer cells and their isogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-depleted rho zero counterparts grown in cell culture and as tumor xenografts in immune-deficient mice. A manuscript summarizing our conclusions is under review. Keywords: genetic modification and culture conditions
