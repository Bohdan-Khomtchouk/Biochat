TITLE
Epigenome analysis of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An integrated approach combining genomics, proteomics and DNA methylation with functional profiling to define molecular features associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) states.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from 36 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines was bisulfite treated and analyzed on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27K BeadChip

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
