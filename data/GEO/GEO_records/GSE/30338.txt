TITLE
Methylation analysis of 81 glioma clinical samples (49 CIMP+ and 32 CIMP-) and 53 cell line samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioma CIMP (G-CIMP) is a powerful determinant of tumor pathogenicity but the molecular cause of G-CIMP is a fundamental question that is unresolved.  Here, we show that mutation of a single gene, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), directly causes the G-CIMP in gliomas by remodeling the methylome.

DESIGN
In this study 81 glioma clinic samples (49 CIMP+ and 32 CIMP-) were analyzed. Parental IDH1 wild-type and IDH1 mutant cells were passaged until passage 50.
