TITLE
Unraveling multifaceted contributions of small regulatory RNAs to the photomorphogenic development in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Small RNA-mediated post-transcriptional control of gene expression is critical for the growth and development of plants. Previous investigations on Arabidopsis suggest that photomorphogenesis may be regulated by the action of sRNAs. However, current information on sRNAs and their regulation of target genes during photomorphogenesis remain mostly unknown. We aim to provide a more systemic view on sRNA-controlled gene expression in this developmental process. We have found that, in addition to microRNAs (miRNAs) and phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs), other siRNAs may also act as regulators of the de-etiolating process. In addition, we have discovered several miRNA-target pairs that act as new players of photomorphogenesis.

DESIGN
Examine the expression patterns of Arabidopsis small RNAs under 6 time points of light exposure.
