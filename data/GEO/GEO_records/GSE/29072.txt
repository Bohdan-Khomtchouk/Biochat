TITLE
Zebularine effect on mouse embryonic stem cells manifested as cardiod-myogenic potential: testable hypothesis generation using microarray data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lineage commitment during Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) differentiation is controlled not only by a gamut of transcription factors but also by epigenetic events, mainly histone deacetylation and promoter DNA methylation. Moreover, the DNA demethylation agent 5′-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AzadC) has been widely described in the literature as an effective chemical stimulus used to promote cardiomyogenic differentiation in various stem cell types; however, its toxicity and instability complicate its use. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of zebularine, a stable and non-toxic DNA cytosine methylation inhibitor, on ESCs differentiation. Herein are the Affymetrix Expression data obtained from RNA of murine ESCs treated with zebularine.

DESIGN
9 control samples (replicates) and 9 zebularine samples (replicates).
