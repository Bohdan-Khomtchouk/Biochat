TITLE
Expression patterns of cDNAs in gamma-irradiation induced T-cell lymphomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This set of data contains the expression levels of cDNAs in T-cell lymphoblastci lymphomas induced by gamma-irradiation. These tumor samples were compared to normal thymuses Keywords: Tumor profiles, comparison of tumoral versus wilf-type tissues, lymphomas and leukemias

DESIGN
C57BL/6J animals were maintained in our animal facilities following the appropriate ethical recommendations from our institutions. For tumor induction, 4-week-old mice of both sexes were exposed to four weekly doses of 1.75 Gy/dose of ionizing gamma radiation. Treated mice were observed daily until moribund, then sacrificed and autopsied. DNA, RNA and proteins were isolated from these samples using routine procedures.
