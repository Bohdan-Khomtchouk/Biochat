TITLE
fumonisin biosynthesis

ORGANISM
Fusarium verticillioides

SUMMARY
In the study, expression profiles in wild type and a fcc1 mutant were compared to identify genes with patterns of expression similar to the FUM genes. DNA microarrays were constructed with ESTs from cDNA libraries obtained from the fcc1 mutant and wild-type strain of F. verticillioides grown on maize kernels . By microarray methodology, gene expression was measured in the fcc1 mutant and the wild type during growth on maize and in a synthetic medium at pH 3 and 8. The results of the analysis provide potential candidate genes for future studies to determine their functional roles in fumonisin biosynthesis. Keywords: other
