TITLE
Differential gene expression in neuroblastoma cells after treatment with JQ1, nanaomycin, or combination of JQ1 and nanaomycin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BET bromodomain inhibitors are emerging as very promising novel anticancer agents. Combination of BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 and quinone-containing compound nanaomycin exerts synergistic anticancer effect in neuroblastoma We analysed whether a treatment with BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1, and quinone-containing compound Nanaomycin synergistically modulate gene expression

DESIGN
Neuroblastoma BE(2)-C cells were treated with vehicle control, 500nM JQ1, 125nM nanaomycin, or combination of JQ1 and nanaomycin. RNA was extracted from the cells 6 hours after treatment, and subjected to differential gene expression studies with Affymetrix microarrays.
