TITLE
Expression data from meningiomas and normal meninges

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Correlate the gene expression profiles with the most relevant patterns of chromosome abnormalities (cytogenetic subgroups of meningiomas) and the gene expression profiles could help to explain the differences in clinical behaviour of meningiomas.

DESIGN
The impact of tumor cytogenetics on the gene expression analyzed in meningiomas. Here, we analyzed the gene expression profiles (GEP)  of 47 tumors and correlated them with the most clinical relevant cytogenetic subgroups of meningiomas, including diploid tumors, isolated -22/22q-, del(1p36) alone and complex karyotypes associated with del(1p36) and/or -14q. In addition, 4 samples containing purified RNA extracted from normal meningeal cells (BioChain Institute, Hayward, CA and US Biological, Swampscott, MA, USA) were also processed.
