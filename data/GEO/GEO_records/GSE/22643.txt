TITLE
Expression data from stage 54 Xenopus laevis larvae treated with 20 nM triiodothyronine (T3)

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Induction of Xenopus laevis larvae metamorphosis is dependent on exposure to TH.  Metamorphosis involves the regression, growth or remodeling of almost all the tissues in the animals body. Metamorphosis in frogs is induced by thyroid hormone. Each organ system has a unique morphological and genetic program that it follows while undergoing metamorphosis involving both the upregulation and downregulation of genes.  In this array we examined the change in gene expression in the tail of larvae undergoing precocious metamorphosis following induction with thyroid hormone.

DESIGN
Whole stage 54 xenopus larvae were exposed to either vehicle for 48 hours or 20 nM T3 for 6 or 48 hours.  Total RNA was then purified from tail tissue and the samples were examined by hybridization to the Affymetrix Xenopus array.  Developmental stage 51-54 Xenopus larvae were selected because these stages do not express high levels of endogenous T3 but are still capable of morphologically responding to exposure.
