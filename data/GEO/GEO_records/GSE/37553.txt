TITLE
Expression data from LCM-captured Arabidopsis root cells after challenge with Meloidogyne incognita

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The differentiation of specialized feeding sites in Arabidopsis root cells in response to nematode infestation involves substantial cellular reprogramming of host cells that is not well characterized at the molecular level. Expression data was generated from Arabidopsis root cells undergoing giant cell formation due to nematode infestation and from non-infested control root cells. Cells were laser captured 14 and 21 days after infestation.

DESIGN
Samples, collected 14 days post infestation, consisted of three biological replicates per treatment (control root cells or giant cells). RNA samples were isolated from ~150 control cells or from ~80 giant cells using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus, Mountain View, USA). RNA amplifications were carried out with the NuGEN WT-Ovation Pico kit. GSM546568-GSM546577: Control and giant cells collected 21 days post infestation.
