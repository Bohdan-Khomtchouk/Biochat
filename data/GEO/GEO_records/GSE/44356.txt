TITLE
Expression data from wild-type and HMGN1 knockout mice injected with N-nitrosodiethylamine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HMGN1 contributes to the shortened latency of liver tumorigenesis by changing a chromatin structure and expression of relevant genes To assess the molecular mechanisms underlying accelerated tumor development in Hmgn1-/- mice, we performed the gene expression profiling of liver cells at early stages

DESIGN
Expression profiles has been compared between Hmgn1+/+ and Hmgn1-/- mice livers at 4 weeks after birth and at 12 weeks after DEN or saline (control) injection at 4 weeks
