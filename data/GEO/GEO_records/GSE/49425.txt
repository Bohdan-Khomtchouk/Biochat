TITLE
Hfq regulated genes in Pseudomonas chlororaphis 30-84

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens 30-84

SUMMARY
Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain 30-84 is an effective biological control agent against take-all disease of wheat.  In this study, we conducted an RNA-seq analysis by comparing the wild type strain with a Hfe deficient mutant. RNA-seq analysis identified over 900 genes differentially regulated by Hfq.

DESIGN
A total of 4 samples were analyzed in AB medium + 2% casamino acids, Pseudomonas chlororaphis wild type strain (2 replicates);  Pseudomonas chlororaphis ZN mutant (2 replicates).

PLATFORM
GPL16805 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Pseudomonas chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens 30-84)
