TITLE
Robertsonian translocations modify genomic distribution of gH2AX and H3.3 in mouse germ cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: determine if gH2AX and H3.3 are enriched at unsynapsed regions of chromosomes involved in translocations in mouse germ line (meiotic prophase I) Methods: testes were isolated from 4-week or 6-week old heterozygous carriers of a single Robertsonian translocation RB(8;12) or 3 Robertsonian translocations RB(8;12), RB(1;3) and RB(9;14) and controls. ChIP assays were conducted as described in Smagulova 2011. Experiments done in triplicate. Results: We find enrichment of gH2AX in the proximal gene-rich regions of translocation-associated chromosomes and reduced enrichment of gH2AX and H3.3 at sex chromosomes

DESIGN
Testes gH2AX and H3.3 occupancy profiles were generated using  ChIP and next generation sequencing
