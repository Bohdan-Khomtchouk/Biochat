TITLE
Pervasive TTP binding but selective target mRNA destabilization in the macrophage transcriptome [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Precise control of mRNA decay is fundamental for robust yet not exaggerated inflammatory responses to pathogens. Parameters determining the specificity and extent of mRNA degradation within the entire inflammation-associated transcriptome remain incompletely understood. Using transcriptome-wide high resolution occupancy assessment of the mRNA-destabilizing protein TTP, a major inflammation-limiting factor, we qualitatively and quantitatively characterize TTP binding positions and functionally relate them to TTP-dependent mRNA decay in immunostimulated macrophages. We identify pervasive TTP binding with incompletely penetrant linkage to mRNA destabilization. A necessary but not sufficient feature of TTP-mediated mRNA destabilization is binding to 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs). Mapping of binding positions of the mRNA-stabilizing protein HuR in activated macrophages revealed that TTP and HuR binding sites in 3’ UTRs occur mostly in different transcripts implicating only a limited co-regulation of inflammatory mRNAs by these proteins. Remarkably, we identify robust and widespread TTP binding to introns of stable transcripts. Nuclear TTP is associated with spliced-out introns and maintained in the nucleus throughout the inflammatory response. Our study establishes a functional annotation of binding positions dictating TTP-dependent mRNA decay in immunostimulated macrophages. The findings allow navigating the transcriptome-wide landscape of RNA elements controlling inflammation.
