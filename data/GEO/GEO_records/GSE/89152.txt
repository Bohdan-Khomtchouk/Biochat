TITLE
Transcriptome of EMT induced MCF10A cells by TGFb treatment or SNAIL S6A expression.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EMT, Epithelial to mesenchymal transition is a developmental biology process associated with migration, known to be involved in cancer metastasis. To study this process, we used the breast epithelial cell line MCF10A that enter in EMT after treatment with the cytokine TGFB or by expression of EMT transcriptor factor SNAIL.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of MCF10A cells treated for 1 or 6 days with TGFb (done in duplicate), and mRNA profiles of Snail inducible line, MCF10A-SNAIl, induced for 1 or 6 days.
