TITLE
Impact of PDR8 allelic variation on yeast transcriptome profile in wine fermentation condition.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
An eQTL analysis show that mutations in PDR8 gene in 59A strain versus S288c could trigger expressions variations of QDR2. In order to confirm this result and highlight other gene expression variations associated to PDR8 allelic variation, we performed an allele switch of PDR8 in 59A background (59A PDR8-S288c) and compared the transcriptomic profile of this strain to 59A. The analysis was performed in wine alcoholic fermentation conditions in stationary phase during nitrogen starvation and in alcoholic stress. PDR8 allelic variation: 9 non synonymous SNP (S288c- > 59A)   9(K- > T), 17(S- > L), 79(P- > S), 198(G- > D), 263(H- > R), 267(T- > S), 371(L- > F), 550(A- > G), 601(I- > V).

DESIGN
6 transcriptomic profiles were performed with Agilent mono-color array: 3 hybridizations were performed for each strain corresponding to 3 biological replicated samples. Using mono-color array, the intensity was used after normalization to calculate logarithm base 2 of expression ratios.
