TITLE
Expression Profile of Untransformed Bone Marrow Stromal Cells from Wild-Type C57Bl/6 Mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These samples, isolated from untransformed marrow stromal cells from wild-type C57Bl/6 mice, serve as a control set. The cells (CD31-, CD34 low/-, CD45-) are from a mixed population of 100% bone marrow stromal cells arising after more than two months in culture and 10-15 passages. Keywords: other

DESIGN
this experiment include 1 samples and 9 replicates
