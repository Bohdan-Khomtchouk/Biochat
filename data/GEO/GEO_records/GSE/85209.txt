TITLE
Silencing SMOC2 protects from kidney fibrosis by inhibiting Fibroblast to Myofibroblast Transformation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Secreted MOdular Calcium-binding protein-2 (SMOC2) belongs to the SPARC (Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteines) family of matricellular proteins whose members are known for their secretion into the extracellular space to modulate cell-cell and cel

DESIGN
