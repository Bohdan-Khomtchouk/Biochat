TITLE
Gene expression analysis (RNA-seq) of Arabidopsis thaliana roots in wild type and trm4b-1 mutants under control and oxidative stress conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To investigate why Arabidopsis trm4b mutants have short roots and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, we investigated gene expression in wild type and trm4b-1 mutants under control and oxidative stress conditions

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis was performed on wild type and trm4b-1 mutants under controlled conditions and under oxidative stress (0.01 uM paraquat). Three biological replicates were performed for each sample.

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
