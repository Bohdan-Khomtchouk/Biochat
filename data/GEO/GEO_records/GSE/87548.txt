TITLE
Layer-specific ATAC-seq of the neurons of adult mouse visual cortex defined by Cre-driver lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammalian cortex is a laminar structure, with each layer composed of a characteristic set of cell types with different morphological, electrophysiological, and connectional properties. Here, we define chromatin accessibility landscapes of major, layer-specific excitatory classes of neurons, and compare them to each other and to inhibitory cortical neurons using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq). We surveyed five Cre-reporter-labeled mouse cell lines using ATAC-Seq of 500-cell populations.
