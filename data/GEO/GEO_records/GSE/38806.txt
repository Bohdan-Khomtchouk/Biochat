TITLE
Gene expression profiles of induced pluripotent mesenchymal stromal cells [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) is an epigenetic phenomenon. We have reprogrammed mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from human bone marrow by retrovirus-mediated overexpression of OCT-3/4, SOX2, c-MYC, and KLF4. This series summarizes gene expression profiles of eight iP-MSC clones derived from three different donors. These datasets were subsequently used for PluriTest analysis (Muller FJ, Schuldt B et al., Nat. Methods 2011; 8: 315-317) demonstrating that all iP-MSC clones were clearly associated with pluripotent cells.

DESIGN
Eight iP-MSC clones derived from three different donors.
