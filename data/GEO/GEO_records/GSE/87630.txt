TITLE
Integrated analysis of genomic and epigenomic regulation of transcriptome identifies molecular subtypes of liver cancer (gene expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled DNA copy numbers, DNA methylation, and mRNA expression levels in the same HCC patients. To identify genes which transcriptional expression levels are regulated by genomic and/or epigenetic deregulation, we defined the copy number-correlated and methylation-correlated genes with their corresponding gene expression levels across the samples as genic and epigenetic deregulators, respectively.

DESIGN
mRNA expression profiling of 64 hepatocellular carcinoma and 30 non-tumor were performed

PLATFORM
GPL6947 Illumina HumanHT-12 V3.0 expression beadchip
