TITLE
DNA copy number variation from human Wilms' Tumor samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA copy number was studied to determine whether the Wilms' tumor samples generally show normal copy number variation comparing to the colon tumor samples We used custom Nimblegen microarrays to determine the genome-wide DNA copy number in human Wilms' Tumor samples

DESIGN
We isolated genomic DNA from human Wilms' tumor tissues and hybridized to custom-designed Nimblegen microarrays (CHARM arrays).
