TITLE
Follicular B (FoB) cells purified from miR-17-92 transgenic mice, stimulated with LPS/IL-4 for 13.5 or 25.5 hours

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have generated a miR-17-92 transgenic allele (termed miR-17-92 Tg) whose expression can be turned on conditionally by Cre recombinase (Xiao et al, Nature Immunology, 9:405-14, 2008). The mice were crossed to CD19-Cre mice to turn on the transgene expression specifically in B cells.

DESIGN
Follicular B(FoB) cells were purified from CD19-Cre;miR-17~92 Tg/Tg mice (TG1, TG2, TG3) and miR-17~92 Tg/Tg mice (WT1, WT2, WT3) by MACS depletion of cells positive for CD5, CD43, and CD93 (also known as AA4.1). The purified B cells were stimulated with LPS/IL-4 for 13.5hr or 25.5hr. The purity of follicular B cells was examined by flow cytometry and was greater than 95% for all samples. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (QIAGEN).
