TITLE
Global analysis of non-coding small RNAs in Arabidopsis in response to jasmonate treatment by deep sequencing technology

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In plants, non-coding small RNAs play a vital role for plant development and stress responses. To explore the possible role of non-coding small RNAs in the regulation of the jasmonate (JA) pathway, we compared the non-coding small RNAs between the JA-deficient aos mutant and the JA-treated wild type Arabidopsis via high-throughput sequencing. 30 new miRNAs and 27 new miRNA candidates were identified through a bioinformatics approach. 49 known miRNAs (belonging to 24 families), 15 new miRNAs and new miRNA candidates (belonging to 11 families) and 3 tasiRNA families were induced by JA, whereas 1 new miRNA, 1 tasiRNA family and 22 known miRNAs (belonging to 9 families) were repressed by JA.

DESIGN
2 samples were examined: wild type treated with JA, and the JA-deficient aos mutant.
