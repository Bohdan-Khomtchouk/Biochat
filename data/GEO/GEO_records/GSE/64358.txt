TITLE
Quantitative analysis of chromatin interactions upon copy number variation at mouse 4E2 [4C-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The three-dimensional organization of chromatin has a critical impact on the regulation of gene expression. However, little is known about the effect of DNA copy number variants (CNVs) on chromatin organization. We performed an allele-specific chromatin conformation and gene expression analysis of wild-type (WT) mouse chromosome 4 and an engineered 4.3Mb chromosome 4 deletion in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. A newly developed quantitative framework for the analysis of paired-end 4C-seq data revealed a number of significant differentially interacting regions (DIRs) and higher-order chromatin compaction changes present in the deletion chromosome. Selected DIRs were validated by 3D DNA FISH experiments. We discovered a significant enrichment of CTCF and Smc1 binding sites within DIRs, as well as differentially expressed genes determined by RNA-Seq. Together, our findings highlight the complex effects of a 4E2 CNV on chromatin structure and function, both locally in the deletion chromosome and globally in the WT copy.
