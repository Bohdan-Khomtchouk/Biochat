TITLE
Effects of combined heat shock and glucose-deprivation on wild type and os2 mutant cells of Neurospora crassa.

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
Whereas the combined stresses kill wild type cells, the os2 signaling mutant survives them.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from wild type and os2 mutant cells subjected to 30 degree control conditions, 45 degree heat shock, or heat shock combined with 2-deoxyglucose

PLATFORM
GPL16164 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Neurospora crassa)
