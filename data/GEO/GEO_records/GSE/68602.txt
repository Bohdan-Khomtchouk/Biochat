TITLE
Gene expression changes in control- and shSamd14-infected R1 fetal liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Samd14 was discovered as a novel GATA-2 target gene.  Samd14 increased hematopoietic progenitor levels/activity, promoted signaling by a pathway instrumental for  hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell regulation (Stem Cell Factor/c-Kit), and c-Kit rescued Samd14 loss-of-function phenotypes

DESIGN
A control shRNA or an shRNA targeting Samd14 was retrovirally introduced to fetal liver ex vivo cultures. Progenitor cells (CD71-, Ter119-) were isolated and analyzed from these cultures

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
