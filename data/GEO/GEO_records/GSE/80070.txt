TITLE
Whole transcript expression profiling of short-term and long-term hypoxic neural stem cells (NSCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of murine foetal NSCs (E14) after short-term (48 hours) and long-term (13 days) hypoxic (3% oxygen) culture compared to normoxic culture (21% oxygen) We focused on whole-transcriptome analyses using gene chip microarrays to compare expression profiles of NSCs cultured at hypoxic conditions to those of normoxic cells. Therefore, we used NSCs derived from the mesencephalon and the cortex and cultured them for short- and long-term at hypoxia/normoxia.

DESIGN
We analyzed NSCs from cortex and midbrain after short- and long-term culture of hypoxia compared to normoxia.
