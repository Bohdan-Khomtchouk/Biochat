TITLE
Gene expression profiles of endometriosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Endometriosis is a common disease seen by gynecologists. Clinical features involve pelvic pain and unexplained infertility. Although endometriosis is pathologically characterized by endometrial tissue outside the normal uterine location, endometriosis is otherwise not easily explained. Endometriomas, endometriotic cysts of the ovary, typically cause pain and distortion of pelvic anatomy. To begin to understand the pathogenesis of endometriomas, we carried out transcriptome:microRNAome analysis of endometriomas and eutopic endometrium, using gene expression arrays and next generation small RNA sequencing technology. Keywords: two group comparison

DESIGN
Patients undergoing surgery for endometriomas, suspected endometriosis, pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic organ prolapse, or uterine leiomyomas were approached for participation.  After informed consent, the patients underwent scheduled surgical procedure. Tissues were collected either as cyst wall of endometrioma or endometrial curettage of hysterectomy specimen and placed directly into RNALater (Ambion, Austin, TX) and eventually frozen at -80˚C. Samples were designated as endometriomas or non-endometriosis control endometrium based on surgical pathology reports. Total RNA was isolated from frozen tissue. High quality RNA was subjected to Illumina’s Human WG-6 version 2.0 BeadChips (Illumina). . *** This Series represents the transcriptome component of the study. ***
