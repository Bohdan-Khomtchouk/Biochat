TITLE
Analysis of aerobic and resistance training-induced changes in human vastus lateralis gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to use global gene expression to identify skeletal muscle genes that correlate with exercise-induced Si changes. Longitudinal cohorts from the Studies of Targeted Risk Reduction Intervention through Defined Exercise (STRRIDE) were utilized for vastus lateralis gene expression profiles. Si was determined via intravenous glucose tolerance test pre- and post-training. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients determined relationships between a) baseline and b) training-induced changes in gene expression and Si after training.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from human vastus lateralis prior-to and following 8 months of structured aerobic and resistance training
