TITLE
Expression profiles of pediatric solid tumor cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For identification of candidate genes that is specifically expressed in Ewing family tumor (EFT) cells, we performed DNA microarray-based global expression profiling using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array and analyxed expression profiles from EFT cell lines (7 lines), neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines (3 lines), a Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cell line, and a human immortalized mesenchymal progenitor cells UET-13 cells. Keywords: Ewing family tumor
