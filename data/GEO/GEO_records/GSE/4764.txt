TITLE
Murine intestinal lymphoid tissue infected with Yersinia enterocolitica

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To gain a comprehensive view of the host response to pathogens within these tissues, we determined the transcriptional profiles of intestinal lymphatic tissue infected with Y. enterocolitica. Expression analysis using Affymetrix GeneChips revealed a complex host response in the Peyerâ€™s patches (PP) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) following oral infection with Y. enterocolitica. Keywords: Disease state analysis
