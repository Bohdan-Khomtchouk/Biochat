TITLE
Murine intestinal lymphoid tissue infected with Yersinia enterocolitica

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To gain a comprehensive view of the host response to pathogens within these tissues, we determined the transcriptional profiles of intestinal lymphatic tissue infected with Y. enterocolitica. Expression analysis using Affymetrix GeneChips revealed a complex host response in the Peyerâ€™s patches (PP) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) following oral infection with Y. enterocolitica. Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes were surgically removed from uninfected (control) and infected (experimental) mice at 12 hours, day 2, 4 and 7 post oral infection. Tissue samples from 10 mice per time-point were combined. Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol method prior to total cDNA syntesis, labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix MGU74Av2 GeneChips. Data was processed and analyzed using MAS 5.0 and custom analysis protocols. Samples from Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes are included in this series.
