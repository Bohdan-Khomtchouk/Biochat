TITLE
Screen mRNAs specifically regulated by mTORC1 in calvarial osteoblasts from mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To screen mRNAs specifically regulated by mTORC1, a global mRNA expression profile in calvarial osteoblasts (OBs) from mice with or without OB-specific Tsc1 knockout was developed using microarray.

DESIGN
Wild type (WT) or OB-specific Tsc1 knockout (KO) mice were sacrificed, with calvarial osteoblasts harvested and subjected to total RNA extraction.
