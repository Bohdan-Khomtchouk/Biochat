TITLE
Controlled induction of 49 transcription factors in transgenic mouse ES cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Controlled induction of individual transcription factors (TFs) in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with subsequent global gene expression profiling is a promising approach for identification of downstream genes regulated by these TFs in a relatively promiscuous epigenetic background. Here we generated and characterized mouse ESCs clones with 49 doxycycline-controllable TFs as a continuation of the NIA Mouse ESC Bank project. Together with the previous clone libraries, the project now comprises 186 TFs (ca. 10% of all TFs in the genome). Induction of individual TFs shifts the transcriptome towards specific differentiation fates (e.g., neural for Myt1, St18; fibroblasts and osteoblasts for Pitx1, Pitx2, Barhl2, and Lmx1a; thymocytes for Myb; lymph nodes and spleen for Etv2 and Plac1, and ovary for Pitx1, Pitx2, and Dmrtc2). Gene set enrichment analysis for expression profile change after induction of TFs provides additional information on the functions and phenotypes associated with these TFs. These data could facilitate methods for generating various types of cells in regenerative medicine as well as ameliorating pathogenic phenotypes in gene therapy.

DESIGN
Dox- overexpressing transcription factor vs. Dox+ (control).
