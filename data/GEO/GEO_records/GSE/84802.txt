TITLE
Temporal-spatial Establishment of Initial Niche for the Primary Spermatogonial Stem Cell formation is Determined by an ARID4B Regulatory Network (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The primary spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), which arise from gonocytes during neonatal development, serve as a foundational self-renewing reservoir to ensure continuous production of spermatozoa throughout adulthood. The transformation of gonocytes into SSCs takes place in a niche established by Sertoli cells. To date, the factors that guide Sertoli cells to establish the initial stem cell niche remain largely unknown. Using Sertoli cell-specific Arid4b knockout (Arid4bSCKO) mice, we demonstrated that ablation of ARID4B resulted in failure to establish a niche for the SSC formation. We performed ChIP-Seq analysis to identify target genes of ARID4B in testes.

DESIGN
A pool of 108 testes was dissected from wild type male mice at P1.5 for ChIP, library preparation, sequencing, and initial data analysis. ChIP assays were performed using the anti-ARID4B antibody. Input DNA was used for control.
