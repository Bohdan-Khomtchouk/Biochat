TITLE
Expression data from primary Glioblastoma in adults

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling revealed over-representation of a distinct (proneural-like) expression signature in long-term survivors that was linked to IDH1/2 mutation. However, among the IDH1/2-wildtype patients, tumors from long-term survivors did not show distinct gene expression profiles and included proneural, classical and mesenchymal glioblastoma subtypes. We performed genome- and/or transcriptome-wide molecular profiling of primary tumor samples from 70 glioblastoma patients of the German Glioma Network, including 23 longterm survivors with > 36 months overall survival (OS), 16 short-term survivors with < 12 months OS, and 31 patients with intermediate OS

DESIGN
For this study, we screened prospectively recruited patients with a histopathological reference diagnosis of glioblastoma, known KPS at diagnosis, information on extent of resection by early postoperative neuroimaging, available frozen tissue specimens from the initial operation, and documented clinical outcome.
