TITLE
Functional astrocytes differentiated from hiPSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Growing evidence implicates the importance of glia, particularly astrocytes, in neurological and psychiatric diseases. Here, we describe a rapid and robust method for the differentiation of highly pure populations of astrocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), via a neural progenitor cell (NPC) intermediate.  Using this method, we generated hiPSC-derived astrocyte populations (hiPSC-astrocytes) from 42 NPC lines (derived from 30 individuals) with an average of ~90% S100Î²-positive cells. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the hiPSC-astrocytes are highly similar to primary human fetal astrocytes and characteristic of a non-reactive state. hiPSC-astrocytes respond to inflammatory stimulants, display phagocytic capacity and enhance microglial phagocytosis. hiPSC-astrocytes also possess spontaneous calcium transient activity. Our novel protocol is a reproducible, straightforward (single media) and rapid ( < 30 days) method to generate homogenous populations of hiPSC-astrocytes that can be used for neuron-astrocyte and microglia-astrocyte co-cultures for the study of neuropsychiatric disorders.

DESIGN
6 hiPSC-derived astrocyte lines were generated. Total RNA were extracted from these hiPSC-astrocytes as well as 2 primary astrocyte lines and analyzed by RNA sequencing.
