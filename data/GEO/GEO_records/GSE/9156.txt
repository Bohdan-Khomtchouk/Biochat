TITLE
Drosophila Ecdysone Receptor Study

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We used the DamID method to systematically identify the binding sites of Ecdysone Receptor and its heterodimeric partner USP across the whole genome in Drosophila Kc cells. We find that the EcR sites are a subset of the USP sites and that only a proportion are ecdysone regulated from an accompanying ecdysone profiling study. The role of EcR/USP in the ecdysone network appears to be coordinated by the recruitment of many transcription factors as well as signaling molecules.
