TITLE
miRNA array on podocytes with the stimulation of TGF-b1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify miRNAs regulating CTGF at the downstream of TGF-Î², we analyzed expression profiles of human miRNAs in immortalized human podocytes.

DESIGN
TGF-b1 induced gene expression in human cultured podocytes were measured at 24 hours after the stimulation. Cells with PBS treatment were used as control.
