TITLE
Late chick lung development

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Type IV collagen is the main component of the basement membrane which gives strength to the blood-gas barrier. In avians the formation of the blood-gas barrier happens rapidly and before hatching. We have performed a microarray expression analysis in late chick lung development and found that COL4A1 and COL4A2 were among the most significantly upregulated genes during the formation of the avian blood-gas barrier. Our study showed that type IV collagen and therefore the basement membrane play fundamental roles in coordinating alveolar morphogenesis.

DESIGN
Four developmental stages of chick lung maturation (E14, E15, E16, E18). Three biological replicates per time point.
