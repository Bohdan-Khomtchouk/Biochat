TITLE
Array CGH analysis of Oral Leukoplakia and Early Stage Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) profiling of Oral Leukoplakia (OPL) and early stage Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) was performed to delineate candidate non-random chromosomal loci associated with disease progression and clinico-pathological parameters. The array CGH hybridizations were performed for 24 OPL and 38 OSCC samples with pooled gender matched controls. All tissue samples were collected after obtaining written informed consent.
