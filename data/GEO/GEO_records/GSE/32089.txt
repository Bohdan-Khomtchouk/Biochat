TITLE
Gene Expression Profile for the identification of miR-126 targets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
" The analysis was designed to search for putative seed sequences for miR-126 in the 3â€™UTR of up-regulated genes. ECs were co-transfected with anti-miR-126 and a plasmid vector bearing the GFP-coding sequence and three complementary sites for miR-126 downstream. As a consequence of the presence of miR-126 binding sites the GFP expression was under the control of miR-126. Fluorescente cells were the cells transfected with anti-miR-126 oligo. MiR-126 target enrichment analysis was performed on the basis of the Miranda database, as provided by Diana miRGen. Significance was estimated on the basis of hyper geometric distribution p-values comparing the occurrence of miR targets in the signature with respect to the universe, defined as the genes expressed in HUVEC. Frequency of log 2 ratio between the subset of mir-126 targets and the genes which are not targets of miR-126 were plotted, highlighting enrichment of the target of miR in differentially regulated genes. "

DESIGN
3 x biological replicates of transiently trasfected cells with anti miR-126 oligo (LNA), and controls oligo. 2 biological replicates for GFP are included as technical controls.
