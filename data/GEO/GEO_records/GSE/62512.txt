TITLE
c-Myc Transcriptionally Amplifies Sox2 Target Genes to Regulate Self-Renewal in Multipotent Otic Progenitor Cells [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An immortalized multipotent otic progenitor (iMOP) cell was generated by transient expression of c-Myc in Sox2-expressing otic progenitor cells. The procedure activated endogenous c-Myc expression in the cells and amplified existing Sox2-dependent transcripts to promote self-renewal. Downregulation of c-Myc expression following growth factor withdrawal resulted in a molecular switch from self-renewal to otic differentiation.

DESIGN
Progenitor cells  from embryonic inner ear that form otospheres were infected with a c-Myc retrovirus to promote self-renewal
