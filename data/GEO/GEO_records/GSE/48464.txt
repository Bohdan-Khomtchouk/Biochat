TITLE
RING1B binding in the 11 dpc embryonic tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the distribution of RING1B (one of Polycomb group factors) within the genome of mouse embryonic tissues. We prepared the chromatin from 11 dpc embryonic forebrain, midbrain, and forelimb buds and made chromatin precipitation with antibody against RING1B (mouse monoclonal antibody). High-throughput sequencing applied for the ChIP analysis revealed the differential distribution of RING1B protein among embryonic tissues.

DESIGN
ChIP analysis of mouse 11 dpc embryonic forebrain, midbrain and forelimb buds against anti-RING1B antibody.
