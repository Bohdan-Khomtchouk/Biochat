TITLE
JunB is essential for IL-23-dependent pathogenicity of Th17 cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand molecular mechanisms by which JunB regulates Th17 differentiation, we performed microarray analyses of JunB-deficient and control Th17 cells.

DESIGN
Gene expresson profiles in WT and JunB-deficient TH0, TH17(Î²), TH17(23) cells.
