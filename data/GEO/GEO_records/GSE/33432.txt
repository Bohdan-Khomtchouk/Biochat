TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling of T6PNE cells in the presence and absence of HNF4α antagonist BIM5078

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effects of the HNF4α antagonist, BIM5078, at the gene expression level. Results provide important information on the global effects of HNF4α antagonism on human gene expression in a cell line derived from human fetal islets.
