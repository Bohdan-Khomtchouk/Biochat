TITLE
Expression profiling of 143B-shCtrl and 143B-shIRX1 stable osteosarcoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pulmonary metastasis is the main cause of medical failure and death of osteosarcoma patients. Our recent study identified IRX1 as a potential metastasis-driving gene in osteosarcoma. Studies showed that IRX1 can promote the migration, invasion and anoikis resistance of osteosarcoma cells. We generated 143B stable IRX1 knockdown and control cell lines, and found that IRX1 knockdown can inhibit the pulmonary metastasis of 143B cells in orthotopic mouse osteosarcoma model.

DESIGN
Expression microarrays are performed in143B-shCtrl and 143B-shIRX1 cells to study the mechanism of IRX1 on promoting metastasis of osteosarcoma
