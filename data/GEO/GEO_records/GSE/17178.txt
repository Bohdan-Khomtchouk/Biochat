TITLE
Wild-type p53 enhances efficiency of simian virus 40 large-T-antigen-induced cellular transformation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To measure on a global scale the SV40 large T antigen-mediated changes in gene transcription in mouse embryo fibroblasts differing in the expression of p53.

DESIGN
Samples of total RNA from 3T3 (wt p53) and 10-1 (p53-null) mouse embryo fibroblasts stably transfected with SV40 large T-antigen expressing pMYcLT vector (3T3 LT and 10-1 LT cells) or empty pMYsIG vector (3T3 IG and 10-1 IG cells) were subjected to gene expression analysis.
