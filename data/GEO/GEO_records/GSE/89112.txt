TITLE
Sub-kilobase resolution Kc167 cell Hi-C

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The locations of chromatin loops in Drosophila were determined by Hi-C (chemical cross-linking, restriction digestion, ligation, and high-throughput DNA sequencing).  Whereas most loop boundaries or “anchors” are associated with CTFC protein in mammals, loop anchors in Drosophila were found most often in association with the polycomb group (PcG) protein Polycomb (Pc), a subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1).  Loops were frequently located within domains of PcG-repressed chromatin.  Promoters located at PRC1 loop anchors regulate some of the most important developmental genes and are less likely to be expressed than those not at PRC1 loop anchors.  Although DNA looping has most commonly been associated with enhancer-promoter communication, our results indicate that loops are also associated with gene repression.

DESIGN
Hi-C experiments where ligation is performed on beads (tethered) on embryonic Kc167 Drosophila cultured cells from two independent biological replicates.
