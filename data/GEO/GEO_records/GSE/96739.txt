TITLE
Aluminum stress study in wheat and wheat-rye addition lines 3R and 6R.

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of three different genotypes (wheat cv Chinese Spring, and  the wheat-rye addition lines 3R and 6R) comparing control and 24h exposure to 200 Î¼M de AlCl3. The goal was to determine the effects of AlCl3 on global gene expression in each genotype and study the differences between them.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment (control vs aluminum exposure), for three genotypes (wheat cv Chinese Spring, wheat-rye addition line 3R, wheat-rye addition line 6R). Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 aluminum exposed replicates. Please note that the experiments have been performed technically as dual channel (eg, Cy3 and Hy5-labeled samples hybridized to the same array) but processed as though they are single channel. Therefore there are total 9 raw data files for 18 samples and the corresponding raw data file (for each samples) is indicated in the sample description field. ***Please note that the 3R and 6R  lines are called 'addition lines'. They are composed of the complete genome of Triticum aestivum + a pair of chromosomes from secale cereale (3R or 6R).****
