TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Ramos germinal center B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Ramos germinal center B cells, comparing untreated cells to cells treated with etoposide, and untreated cells to cells treated with anti-IgM.  Both treatments, engagement of the B-cell receptor with anti-IgM and induction of DNA double-strand breaks with etoposide, result in phosphorylation and cytoplasmic sequestration of CRTC2, and cause downregulation of known CRTC2 target gene TCL1.  The goal of these experiments was to determine what other genes are downregulated by both of these CRTC2-inactivating treatments, and to compare this list to the list of genes whose promoters were occupied by CRTC2 in our ChIP-on-chip assay.

DESIGN
Untreated samples vs. etoposide-treated samples, untreated samples vs. anti-IgM-treated samples.  Each comparison was done in biological triplicate plus dye swap.
