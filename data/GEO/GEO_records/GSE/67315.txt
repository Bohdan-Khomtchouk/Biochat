TITLE
Gene expression profile of carbon starvation gene knockouts, ΔcstA and ΔyjiY, in Salmonella typhimurium

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Two carbon starvation (cst) genes, cstA and yjiY, in Salmonella are predicted to mediate peptide utilization under nutrient stress. However, the mechanistic details of their function and their importance in the context of Salmonella pathogenesis is not addressed. In this study, the transcriptomes of cst gene knockouts were compared to that of wild type to check the global impact of cst genes on Salmonella metabolism as well as pathogenesis. Microarray was done for duplicate samples for each strain in late log phase of growth in LB, which is also marked by the expression of many virulence associated genes.
