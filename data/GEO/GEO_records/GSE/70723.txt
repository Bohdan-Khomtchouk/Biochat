TITLE
RNA sequencing of Taf4+/+ and Taf4-/- cells in 1 timepoint during the differentiation into the cardiac lineage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We determined the Taf4 dependent differential expression of RNAs in WT as well as KO cells at day 9 of the differentiation into the cardiac lineage.

DESIGN
Examination of RNA expression in 4 different cell lines (2 independent Taf4 WT and 2 independent Taf4 KO) in 1 timepoint during cardiac differentiation.

PLATFORM
