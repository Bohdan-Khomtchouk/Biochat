ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Atf1 was overexpressed in wt S. pombe cells for 24 hours and gene expression changes were analysed

DESIGN
all samples were processed in duplicates.  Gene expression in cells overexpressing ATf1 was compared with respect to the levels in control cells transformed with the empty vector.
