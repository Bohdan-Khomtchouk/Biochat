TITLE
Halobacterium NRC-1 VNG1451C deletion mutant growth in defined medium with and without glucose

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
Gene regulatory networks play an important role in coordinating biochemical fluxes through diverse metabolic pathways.  The modulation of enzyme levels enables efficient utilization of limited resources as organisms dynamically acclimate to nutritional fluctuations in their environment.  Here we have identified and characterized a novel nutrient-responsive transcription factor from the halophilic archaea, VNG1451C. In this experiment we used whole-genome microarray analysis in the VNG1451C deletion mutant vs. H. salinarum NRC-1 ura3 parent strain in defined medium during growth with and without glucose to show that the expression of many metabolic genes is perturbed in the VNG1451C deletion mutant in response to this sugar.

DESIGN
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 (ATCC700922) ura3 parent and VNG1451C strains were grown in complete defined medium (CDM; 20 amino acids at concentrations defined by Shand and Perez, 1999. NaCl 250g/L, MgSO4 20 g/L, KCl 1 g/L, NaH2PO4 0.167mM, Biotin 0.02mM, Thiamin 0.015mM, Folic acid 0.0113 mM, MnSO4 0.01mM, FeSO4, 0.01mM, glucose added at 10% w/v where indicated in sample files) at 37ÂºC under full-spectrum white light. Biological replicate samples were removed throughout the growth curve at early log, mid log, and stationary phase to measure genome-wide transcription.
