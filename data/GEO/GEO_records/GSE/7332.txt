TITLE
Comparison of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived mesenchymal precursor cell populations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have developed efficient protocols for the derivation of mesenchymal precursors from hESCs. While previous protocols were based on mesodermal induction via co-culture of hESCs on OP9 mouse stroma (Barberi et al., PLoS Biology, 2005), our recent work shows the derivation of hESC derived mesenchymal precurors under feeder-free conditions. The data presented here show a large and highly signficant overlap in global gene expression profiles between hESC derived mesenchymal precursors derived under feeder-free conditions with those derived via OP9 co-culure and mesenchymal precurosrs isolated directly from the adult bone marrow. Keywords: cell type comparison
