TITLE
Comparison of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived mesenchymal precursor cell populations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have developed efficient protocols for the derivation of mesenchymal precursors from hESCs. While previous protocols were based on mesodermal induction via co-culture of hESCs on OP9 mouse stroma (Barberi et al., PLoS Biology, 2005), our recent work shows the derivation of hESC derived mesenchymal precurors under feeder-free conditions. The data presented here show a large and highly signficant overlap in global gene expression profiles between hESC derived mesenchymal precursors derived under feeder-free conditions with those derived via OP9 co-culure and mesenchymal precurosrs isolated directly from the adult bone marrow. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
These data compare the gene expression profiles of hESC derived mesenchymal precursors derived via the OP9 protocol, with those obtained under feeder-free conditions and adult bone marrow derived mesenchymal precursors. Three samples of undifferentiated hESCs are used for subtracting genes to define mesenchymal precurosr cell specific signatures (see Barberi et al. Nature Medicine 2007 for details).
