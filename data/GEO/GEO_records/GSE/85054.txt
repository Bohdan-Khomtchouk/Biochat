TITLE
An integrated genomic approach for the study of mandibular prognathism in the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) II

ORGANISM
Dicentrarchus labrax

SUMMARY
A sea bass oligo microarray platform was used to profile gene expression in mandibles of 58 days-old sea bass affected by prognathism, a skeletal malformation that strongly affects sea bass production. Two different conditions: i) protruding jaws, and ii) normal jaws were used for gene expression analysis. For each condition, total RNA was extracted from five (5) independent biological replicates, each consisting of pools of five (5) jaws.

DESIGN
In this study, we analyzed ten (10) samples, five (5) pools of jaws dissected from normal sea bass and five (5) pools of jaws dissected from individuals affected by prognathism. Gene expression profiling was performed using the GPL9663 Dicentrarchus labrax Oligo Microarray platform (10 arrays, no replicate) based on single-colour detection (Cyanine-3 only). This series contains re-analyzed samples from GSE19001 and two new samples.
