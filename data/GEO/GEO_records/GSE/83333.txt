TITLE
Expression profile of (inducible) homozygous Apc loss in the mouse intestinal epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To asses the effect of Apc loss on the intestinal epithelium we induced homozygous VillinCreERT2 Apc flox/flox mice with tamoxifen on 3 consecutive days (day 0, 1 and 2), and harvested small intestinal epithelium on day 3.

DESIGN
For CreERT2 mediated recombination, mice were given 5 injections with 50mg/kg tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO 10mg/ml in corn oil) intraperitoneally, during 3 consecutive days, and were sacrificed 24 hours thereafter. Control mice only carried the CreERT2 allele (not the Apc fl/fl alleles) and were treated under the same regimen.
