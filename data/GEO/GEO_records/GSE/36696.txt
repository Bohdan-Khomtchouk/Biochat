TITLE
Comparative transcriptome analysis of transporters, phytohormone and lipid metabolism pathways in response to arsenic stress in rice (Oryza Sativa L.)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Arsenic (As) is a carcinogenic metalloid that is a contaminant widely polluting rice paddy soils around the world. In order to gain better insight into molecular mechanism of rice exposed to As(III) stress, we used next-generation sequencing technology to acquire global transcriptome alteration and miRNA regulation in rice upon As(III) treatments.   Our results suggest time course and As(III)-dosing treatments were devised. Cluster analyses show that root and shoot samples were differentially grouped. For roots, sub-clusters were more distinct in the dosage course whereas for shoots they were most recognizable for the time course treatments.   Other than the significantly regulated gene expression in the heavy metal-responsive sulfur and glutathione metabolism pathways, the expression of genes related to heavy metal transportation, jasmonate biosynthesis and signaling pathways, lipid metabolism and gene transcription were sharply regulated, indicating that rice allocates energy and resources from growth to stress response under As(III) stress. In addition to the detection of previously identified stress-related miRNAs, we further discovered 36 new As(III)-responsive miRNAs.  These results expand our understanding of As(III) stress mechanism to the As(III)-responsive mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes, which provide a foundation for subsequent functional research.
