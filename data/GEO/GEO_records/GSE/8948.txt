TITLE
Effect of loss of CREB and CREM on cocaine-induced gene expression in the striatum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ablation of the Creb1 gene in forebrain neurons was performed using the Cre/loxP system, with the recombinase expressed from the Camk2alfa promoter. Mice were crossed into the Crem KO background to prevent compensation of CREB loss by CREM overexpression. Our goal was to analyze how loss of CREB will affect acitivity-regulated transcription induced by strong stimulation, i.e. cocaine. Keywords: Treatment x Genotype

DESIGN
Animals were injected i.p. with either 25 mg/kg cocaine or saline and sacrificed after one hour by cervical dislocation. Expression profiling was performed using total RNA isolated from the striatum.
