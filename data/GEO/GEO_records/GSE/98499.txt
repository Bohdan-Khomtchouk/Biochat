TITLE
Early Transcriptome Response of Lactococcus lactis to Environmental Stresses Reveals Differentially Expressed Small Regulatory RNAs

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis

SUMMARY
In general, most stress response systems were activated after 5 min of exposure to a variety of stressors. In addition, many tRNAs and small non-coding RNAs were also differentially expressed.

DESIGN
One strain (NCDO712), 6 stress conditions and a control condition

PLATFORM
GPL23427 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Lactococcus lactis)
