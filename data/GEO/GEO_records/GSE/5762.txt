TITLE
High resolution time-course data of regenerating Dorsal Root Ganglion neurons

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Successful regeneration of injured neurons requires a complex molecular response that involves the expression, modification and transport of large numbers of proteins. The neuronal proteins responsible for the initiation of regenerative neurite outgrowth are largely unknown. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons display robust and successful regeneration following lesion of their peripheral neurite, whereas outgrowth of central neurites is weak and does not lead to functional recovery. We have utilized this differential response to gain insight in the early transcriptional events associated with successful regeneration. Surprisingly, our study shows that peripheral and central nerve crushes elicit very distinct transcriptional activation, revealing a large set of novel genes that are differentially regulated within the first 24 hours after the lesion. A large number of known regeneration associated genes were retrieved in our study, and, in addition, hundreds of novel genes possibly involved in the transcriptional regulatory network underlying successful regeneration.
