TITLE
Cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly-deficient mutant, nar1 and nbp35 mutant seedling

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of two-weeks-old wild type, nar1-4/- and nbp35-3/-  mutant seedlings. The cytosolic Fe -S cluster assembly pathway is involved in cytosolic and nucleus Fe-S protein maturation. The nar1 mutant was identified by the screeing for abnormal transcription feature in endosperm.We performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of weak allele nar1-4/- using microarrays to estimate whether the  cytosolic Fe -S cluster assembly could affect on the transcriptional profile even in vegetative tissues.

DESIGN
Two biological replicate were performed using two weeks seedling of wild type, nar1-4/- and nbp35-3/-. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit(QIAGEN).
