TITLE
Expression data from bone marrow CLP and B-cell progenitor subfractions.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of CLP subfractions (with different potential to develop into T-cells) and B-cell progenitors. Keywords: cell type comparison, B-cell progenitor, common lymphoid progenitor cells (CLP)

DESIGN
CLP and B-cell progenitor subpopulations were FACS sorted. Subsequently RNA was extracted, labelled and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. The CLP subfractions were the target of investigation (B-cell progenitors subpopulations served as references of expression levels for B-cell related transcripts) as we sought to identify expression changes potentially explaining difference in function between the hCD25 positiv and negativ subsets.
