TITLE
Migratory chondrogenic progenitor cells from repair tissue during the later stages of human osteoarthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The regeneration of diseased hyaline cartilage remains a great challenge, mainly because degeneration activities after major injury or due to age-related processes overwhelm the self-renewal capacity of the tissue. We show that repair tissue from human articular cartilage of late stages of osteoarthritis harbor a unique progenitor cell population, termed chondrogenic progenitor cells exhibiting stem cell characteristics, such as multipotency, lack of immune system activation and, in particular, migratory activity. The isolated CPC exhibit a high chondrogenic potential and were able to populate diseased tissue in vivo. Moreover, down-regulation of the osteogenic transcription factor runx-2 enhanced the expression of the chondrogenic transcription factor sox-9 and consequently the matrix synthesis potential of chondrogenic progenitor cells. Our results, while offering new insight into the biology of progenitor cells from diseased cartilage tissue, might assist future strategies to treat late stages of osteoarthritis. Keywords: cell type comparison
