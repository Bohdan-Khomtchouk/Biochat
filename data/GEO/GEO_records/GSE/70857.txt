TITLE
Gene expression profile in Liver, skeletal muscle, brown and white adipose tissues in mice after different interventions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SIRT1 is a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase. SIRT1 plays key roles in metabolic regulation and adaptation. In this study, we wanted to compare gene expression profile in SIRT1 overexpressing mice to WT mice submitted to different intervention (caloric restriction and exercise training) in different tissues (liver, skeletal muscle, brown and white adipose tissues).

DESIGN
SIRT1 transgenic model has already been described (Pfluger et al., 2008). Here we used homozygote transgenic mice which had been backcrossed to C57Bl/6N background. 3 months old WT and SIRT1tg mice were fed with a low fat diet. After sacrifice, total mRNA obtained from brown adipose were used for microarray. Caloric restriction (CR) : everyother day feeding during 3 months Exercise training (EX) : mice were housed in running wheel cages during 10 weeks
