SUMMARY
Response of A673-cells to transfection with interleukin 2 (IL-2). Ewing family tumor (EFT) cell line A673 was transfected with an expression vector for IL-2 (cell line SBVGA1) or empty control vector (cell line SBVGA3). Cells were harvested at 3 different time points and processed for DNA-microarray analysis using Affymetrix HG-U95A microarrays. Primary image analysis was performed using MAS 5.0. In addition, primary analysis was performed with MAS 4.0 and data were scaled to an target intesity of 200. These data have been analysed together with other published data that have been scaled to the same target intensity (see Staege et al. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2004 Jul;43(1):23-34. See also Staege et al. Cancer Res. 2004).
