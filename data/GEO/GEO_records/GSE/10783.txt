TITLE
Validation Set for Prediction of Outcome in Adult Male Germ Cell Tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This series represents expression profiles of 34 non-seminoma germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) from patients who received cisplatin based chemotherarpy for treatment of their disease for whom full clinical follow-up information was available. These specimens were used as a validation set to test outcome prediction models using a subset of previously profiled GCT specimens (see GEO accession #GSE3218). Keywords: Disease state analysis (good vs. poor patient outcome)

DESIGN
Tumor tissues were collected under IRB-approved protocols at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, between 1987 and 2003. The tumor samples consist of 34 NSGCT specimens. RNA was isolated, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix U133A and U133B microarrays using standard protocols. Data were processed by the RMA method.
