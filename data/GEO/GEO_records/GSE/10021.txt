TITLE
mRNA expression profiles in human cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a global analysis of both miRNAs and mRNAs expression across sixteen human cell lines and extracted negatively correlated pairs of miRNA and mRNA which indicate miRNA-target relationship. The many of known-target of miR-124a showed negative correlation, suggesting our analysis were valid. We further extracted physically relevant miRNA-target gene pairs, applying computational target prediction algorism with inverse correlations of miRNA and mRNA expression. Furthermore, Gene Ontology-based annotation and functional enrichment analysis of the extracted miRNA-target gene pairs indicated putative functions of miRNAs. Keywords: Cell type comparison
