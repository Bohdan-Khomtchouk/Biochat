TITLE
HepaRG cells as a model of the primary human hepatocyte transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this experiment is to determine the similarities and differences between gene expression profiles in HepaRG cells versus primary human hepatocytes, human liver, and the commonly used HepG2 cell.

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression profiles from replicate triplicate biological samples of human liver, primary human hepatocytes, HepG2 cells, and HepaRG at differing levels of maturity (differentiated and undifferentiated).
