TITLE
High throughput sequencing enables detailed analysis of S. cerevisiae DNA replication

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
For rapid characterisation of replication dynamics in wild-type cells from an unperturbed cell cycle we have obtained replicating (S phase) and non-replicating (G2 phase) cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and subjected the DNA to copy number analysis.

DESIGN
Measurement of genome replication time for various S. cerevisiae strains. For each strain two samples were analysed: a replicating sample (from S phase) and a non-replicating sample (from G2 phase).
