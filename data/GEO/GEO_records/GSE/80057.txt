TITLE
De novo Assembly and Characterization of Swertia japonica Transcriptome for the Identification of Candidate Genes Involved in the Biosynthesis of Therapeutic Metabolites

ORGANISM
Swertia japonica

SUMMARY
Here, we performed deep transcriptome sequencing for the aerial-tissues and the roots of S. japonica, generating over 2 billion raw reads with an average length of 101 nt by using an Illumina paired-end sequencing by HiSeq2000 platform. Using a combined approach of three popular assemblers, de novo transcriptome assembly for S. japonica was obtained, yielding in 81,729 unigenes with an average length as 884bps and N50-value as 1,452bps, with 46,963 unigenes being annotated based on the sequence similarity against NCBI-nr protein database.
