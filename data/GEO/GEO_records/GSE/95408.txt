TITLE
Genomic characterization of murine monocytes reveals C/EBPb dependence of Ly6C-cells [ATAC data]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of open chromatin by ATAC sequencing in murine blood monocyte subsets

DESIGN
20.000 - 50.000 blood monocytes were isolated in duplicates after CD115 biotin MACS enrichment by FACS sorting and open chromatin regions were identified by transposase accessibility

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
