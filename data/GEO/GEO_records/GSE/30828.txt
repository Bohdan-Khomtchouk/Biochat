TITLE
Expression in AtBBX32 Transgenic Soybean

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Transgenic soybean plants expressing AtBBX32 are taller, and have more nodes, flowers, pods, and seed. The effects of expression of AtBBX32 are most evident in altering expression of a subset of genes in the early morning hours.  In particular, AtBBX32 alters expression of the soybean clock genes TOC1 and LHY1 This experiment compares the response of AtBBX32 transgenic plants with a control plant under field grown conditions at five time points.

DESIGN
Four lines, five timepoints and three biological replicates for a total of 60 samples. Of the four lines, three were AtBBX32 transgenic lines (of which two were high yielding [Event1 and Event2], one was not [Event4]), and a non-transgenic control event [A3244]. Sample times: 3AM, 6AM, 9AM, Noon, and 3PM (ZT21, ZT0, ZT3, ZT6 and ZT9) (Sunrise was at 6:08 AM and Sunset was at 8:08 PM) Development Stage and Tissue:  Trifoliate leaf at R5 stage (80 days post-emergent) Each of the three bioreps was a pool of three plants. The field was located in central Illinois
