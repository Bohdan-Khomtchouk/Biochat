TITLE
Serum miRNAs from Drug-induced liver injury, Hepatitis B, Liver cirrhosis and Type 2 Diabetes patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The dataset comprises of circulating miRNAs in human subjects with various types of liver impairments. In our study, we analyzed a total 48 serum samples from a group of 42 subjects that included  subjects with accidental acetaminophen overdose (APAP), hepatitis B infection (HBV), liver cirrhosis (LC) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) subjects with alanine amino transference (ALT) elevation. As a control 16 sex and age matched healthy controls from subjects with no evidence of liver disease were analyzed. The miRNA profiles were measured using next-generation sequencing platform.

DESIGN
small RNA profiles of serum form 3 APAP patients, 9 LC patients, 7 HBV patients, 7 T2DM patients with ALT elevation and 16 healthy control (HC) subjects
