TITLE
Thyroid hormone induced resorption of tail in  Xenopus laevis tadpole

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Premetamorphic Xenopus laevis tadpole tail respond to thyroid hormone by resorption. The goal of this experiment is to identify the genes involved in the TH-induced resorption tadpole tail and compare it to TH-induced proliferation and differentiation program in tadpole limb and brain. Xenopus tadpoles (NF54) were treated with 100 nM T3 in 0.1 x MMR for another 24h and 48h or without T3 for 48h (control group). NF 61 tadpoles were in 0.1 X MMR till they reached NF stage 62. The tails were dissected after the experiment. Keywords: development or differentiation design,organism part comparison design,reference design,replicate design,time series design
