TITLE
Gene expression profiling of multiple myeloma patients included in the HOVON65/GMMG-HD4 trial

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify relevant, molecularly defined subgroups in Multiple Myeloma (MM), gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed on purified CD138+ plasma cells of 320 newly diagnosed myeloma patients included in the Dutch-Belgian/German HOVON-65/ GMMG-HD4 trial using Affymetrix GeneChip U133 plus 2.0 arrays. Hierarchical clustering identified 10 distinct subgroups. Using this dataset as training data, a prognostic signature was built. The dataset consists of 282 CEL files previously used in the hierarchical clustering study of Broyl et al (Blood, 116(14):2543-53, 2010) outlined above. To this set 8 CEL-files/gene expression profiles were added. Using this set of 290 CEL-files, a prognostic signature of 92 genes (EMC-92-genesignature) was generated by supervised principal components analysis combined with simulated annealing (Kuiper et al.).

DESIGN
Bone marrow plasma cell samples were obtained from 320 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients included in a large multicenter, prospective, randomized phase III trial (HOVON65/GMMG-HD4). Purified myeloma plasma cells samples with a monoclonal plasma cell purity > 80% were used for analysis. To  the original set of 320 samples which were used for the hierarchical clustering analysis,  8 CEL-files were added. Out of 328 CEL-files, 290 CEL-files were linked to survival data and were used to generate the 92 gene survival signature. GCRMA was performed on 290 CEL-files to give the values given for the additional 8 CEL-files. The values of the original 320 CEL-files are left unchanged (i.e. GCRMA on the original 320 CEL-files) to allow optimal comparison to the original paper by Broyl et al.
