TITLE
Alteration of MicroRNA Expression Profile Linked to Microcystin-LR-Induced Tumorigenicity in Human WRL-68 Cell Line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report microcystin-LR, a cyclic heptapeptide that acts as a potent hepatotoxin and carcinogen, was used to induce the malignant transformation of the WRL-68 cell line and alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression in the transformed cells.
