TITLE
Comparing genome-wide H3K36me3 levels in WT vs. dKDM4A mutant

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
dKDM4A is a Drosophila H3 K9/K36 me2/me3 demethylase, which has been disrupted here by P-element insertion.  We compare whole-genome ChIP-chip in mutant and WT to look for target genes of dKDM4A.

DESIGN
Two samples, WT and dkDM4A mutant. 2 biological replicates each. 2 arrays.
