TITLE
Role of PI3K pathway in serum/growth factor response of quiescent fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PI-3K inhibitor (LY294002) was added to quiescent fibroblasts 30 minutes prior growth factor/serum treatments. The role of PI-3K pathway was thus monitored by comparing with untreated samples. Keywords: time course, growth factor response, cell line comparison

DESIGN
Overall design was similar to growth factor/serum treatment series. Each time point was compared to 0 hour time point before LY294002 treatment.
