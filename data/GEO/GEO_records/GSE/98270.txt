TITLE
ZEB1 binding sites in TGF-beta-stimulated MCF7 breast cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We searched for roles of ZEB1 during EMT through genome-wide analysis of its binding sites in breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
ZEB1 binding sites in TGF-beta-stimulated MCF7 cells were determined by ChIP-seq as a negative control of those obtained from the basal typle breast cancer cell lines.
