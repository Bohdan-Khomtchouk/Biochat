TITLE
Gene expression data of Lsd1fl/fl and Lsd1fl/fl Mx1Cre Gr1dim Mac1 granulocytic progenitor cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We discovered that mice with hematopoietic-specific deletion of Lsd1 lacked Gr-1+ Mac1+ neutrophilic granulocytes whereas the numbers of Gr-1dim Mac1+ granulocytic progenitor cells was increased. To determine the genes altered by Lsd1-loss, Gr-1dim Mac1+ granulocytic progenitor cells from Lsd1fl/fl and Lsd1fl/fl Mx1Cre mice were FACS-purified to be analyzed by gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
Primary Gr-1dim Mac1+ granulocytic progenitor cells were isolated from the bone marrow of Lsd1fl/fl and Lsd1fl/fl Mx1Cre animals by FACS-sorting, one week after the final p(I:C) dose. Total RNA from three biological replicates per genotype was extracted and used to hybridize to Affymetrix expression arrays using the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array platform.
