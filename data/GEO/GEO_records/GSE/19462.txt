TITLE
microRNA profiling in vitro activated primary hepatic stellate cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
pHSCs were isolated from Wistar rats and cultivated in cell culture flasks. The miRNA was isolated at day 0 and 10 and hybridized onto the Ncode Multi-species miRNA microarray V2 from Invitrogen

DESIGN
3 samples from different rats were analyzed on miRNA microarray performing dye swap

PLATFORM
