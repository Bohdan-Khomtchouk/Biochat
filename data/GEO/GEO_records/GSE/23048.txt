TITLE
affy_dormance_mrnaoxidized_sunflower-Molecular mechanisms of seed dormancy release: transcriptome evolution and ROS signalling during sunflower seed after-ripening.

ORGANISM
Helianthus annuus

SUMMARY
affy_dormance_sunflower - affy_dormance_mrnaoxidized_sunflower - We focus our research on the release of embryonic dormancy in sunflower seeds and more precisely on the molecular mechanisms controlling seed dormancy release during dry after-ripening. Our data show an increase of ROS during dormancy release associated with an increase of stored mRNA oxidation during after-ripening as shown with determination of the RNA oxidation marker : 8-hydroxyguanosine (8OHG) To assess to role of mRNA oxidation in this process, we isolated 8OHG-containing mRNA to identify oxidized transcript using microarray analysis.-The samples compared are the following: 1) 8OHG containing mRNA isolated from total RNA extracted from a population of 100 embryonic axis of dry dormant seed (Dox) ie. Seed which have been frozen at -30Â°C after harvest to keep dormancy  2) 8OHG containing mRNA isolated from total RNA extracted from a population of 50 embryonic axis from dry non dormant ie. Seeds which have been after-ripened (stored) at 70% RH during 2 month (NDox)   Replicates correspond to different batches of seeds from the same harvest, which have been treated (after ripened) independently and from which the 8OHG containing fraction have been isolated independently.
