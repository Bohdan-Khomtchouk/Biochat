TITLE
RNASeq Analysis of the Shoot Apex of Flax (Linum usitatissimum) to Detect Phloem Fiber Specification Genes

ORGANISM
Linum usitatissimum

SUMMARY
We used RNAseq to compare transcript expression patterns in two segments of the vegetative stem of 14d flax plants, from which all visible leaves had been removed.  The segments were: (i) the apical region (AR) of the shoot apex, which contained the apical-most 0.5 mm of the stem, including the SAM and its immediate derivatives; and (ii) the basal region (BR), which contained the entire stem except for the apical-most 1 cm, and therefore represented all stem and vascular tissues at later stages of differentiation as compared to the AR.  These data will help identify genes that contribute to specification of phloem fiber identity.

DESIGN
Two tissue systems compared using RNASeq, with at least two biological replicates each
