TITLE
Transcriptome of human B cell subsets isolated from terminal ileum and spleen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non-switched memory (ME-M) B cells are an enigmatic population of IgM+ memory lymphocytes that are thought to emerge from germinal centers during systemic antibody responses against T cell-dependent antigens. To gain new insights into the properties of ME-M B cells generated during intestinal antibody responses, we performed global gene transcriptome expression analysis on na√Øve, ME-M and canonical memory class-switched (ME-SW) B cells purified from human gut samples. Marginal zone (MZ) and ME-SW B cells isolated from human spleen samples were used for comparison.

DESIGN
Naive (N) B cells (CD45+CD19+CD38-CD10-IgD++IgM+CD27-), MZ B cells (CD45+CD19+CD38-CD10-IgD+IgM++CD27+), ME-M B cells (CD45+CD19+CD38-CD10-IgD-IgM+CD27+) as well as ME-SW B cells (CD45+CD19+CD38-CD10-IgD-IgM-) were FACSorted from histologically normal tissue samples obtained from human terminal ileum (4 adult donors undergoing right hemicolectomy) and/or human spleen (4 adults donors).
