TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of H3K9me2 and JIL-1 kinase mediated histone H3S10 phosphorylation in drosophila [ChIP-seq: 13 samples]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In this study we have determined the genome-wide relationship of JIL-1 kinase mediated H3S10 phosphorylation with gene expression and the distribution of the epigenetic H3K9me2 mark.  We show in wild-type salivary gland cells that the H3S10ph mark is predominantly enriched at active genes whereas the H3K9me2 mark largely is associated with inactive genes.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different histone modifications  in 2 genotype types.
