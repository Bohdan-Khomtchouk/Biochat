TITLE
Expression data from control and LRF-deficient mouse germinal center B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
B cells are indispensable for humoral immunity, as they ultimately give rise to antibody-secreting plasma cells. During T cell-dependent antibody responses, naive B cells form germinal centers (GCs), a distinct histologic structure found in secondary lymphoid organs. Naive B cells become activated upon interaction with T cells and antigen presenting cells, and begin to rapidly proliferate and form the characteristic GC structure. To elucidate the overall effect of LRF loss in the GCB cell transcriptome, gene expression microarray analysis of FACS-sorted GCB cells was performed. LRF Flox/+ mb-1 Cre+ mice were used as a control to normalize the potential effects of Cre recombinase, and four RNA samples for each genotype were used for the analysis.
