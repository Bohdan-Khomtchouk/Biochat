TITLE
Expression data from testis of day-7 Sohlh1 knock-out mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sohlh1 and Sohlh2 encode a germ cell-specific basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulator critical in spermatogonial differentiation. Seven-day-old Sohlh1 or Sohlh2 knockout and wild-type testes were arrayed on the Affy 430 2.0 platform.
