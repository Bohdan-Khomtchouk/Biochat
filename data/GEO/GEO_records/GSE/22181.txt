TITLE
Entrapment Neuropathy Results in Different MicroRNAs Expression Patterns from Denervation Injury in Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To compare the microRNAs (miRNAs) expression profile in the innervated soleus muscle and L4-L6 DRG neuronsafter sciatic nerve entrapment with a non-constrictive silastic tube, subsequent surgical decompression, and denervation injury. The experimental soleus muscles and dorsal root ganglions (DRGs)  from each experimental group (sham control, denervation, entrapment, and decompression) were analyzed with an AgilentÂ® rat miRNA array to detect dysregulated miRNAs

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, DRGs and soleus muscles of the rats receiving sciatic nerve denervation 6 months, sciatic nerve entrapment 6 months, and sciatic nerve entrapment 6 months then decompression for 3 months v.s. soleus muscle (sham control), Biological replicates: 1 control replicates, 3 experiment replicates
