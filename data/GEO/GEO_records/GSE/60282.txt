TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of mouse plasma cell tumors show importance of IL-6 in tumor development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine important for plasmacytomagenesis. Here we showed that the strom cell-derived IL-6 is critical for plasma cell tumors (PCTs). The gene expression analysis of mouse PCTs showed that adoptive-transfer PCT and spontaneous PCT have similar patterns. Further, the mouse tumors also illustrated resemblance to human multiple myeloma (MM).

DESIGN
Twenty-five tumor samples were analyzed, with three normal B cell controls. 14 of the samples are from adoptive transfer of premalignant B cells, while 11 are from spontaneously arising tumors.
