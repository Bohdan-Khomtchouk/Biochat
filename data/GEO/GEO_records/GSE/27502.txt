TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of adult wild-type IFM and leg muslce in comparison to salm RNAi IFM.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling comparing adult wild-type indirect flight muscle (IFM) with wild-type leg muscle and salm RNAi IFM (Mef2-GAL4, UASsalmIR). We used 2 different salm hairpin constructs for the experiments, TF3029 and TF101052, both available from the VDRC Drosophila stock centre.

DESIGN
Experiments were done in biological duplicates + 1 technical replicate  (1 labeled sample was hybridized on a different array)

PLATFORM
GPL6385 Agilent-018972 D. melanogaster (FruitFly) Oligo Microarray 4x44K G2519F (Feature Number version)
