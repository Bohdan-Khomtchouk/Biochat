TITLE
ChIPseq analysis of IRF4 and BATF in immune cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The purpose of this study is to find the binding partner of IRF4 in the context of Th17- cell differentiation. To this end, we have used ChIPseq analysis followed by de novo motif search around genome-wide binding sites to identify BATF as the binding partner for IRF4 in the context of not only Th17 cells but other immune cell types as well.

DESIGN
Na√Øve T-cells isolated from the spleen of C57BL/6J mice are cultured under Th17, Th2 or Th0 polarizing conditions for 42 hrs and subject to ChIP using IRF4 and/or BATF antibodies followed by high-throughput sequencing.  Bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were stimulated with LPS for 6hrs and similrly subjected to ChIPseq analysis with IRF4.
