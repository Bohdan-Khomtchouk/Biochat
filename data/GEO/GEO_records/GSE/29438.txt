TITLE
Oncogenic ETS proteins regulate a Ras/MAPK gene expression program in the absence of MAPK signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Approximately 50% of prostate cancers have chromosomal translocations resulting in the over-expression one of four ETS family transcription factors. However, it is not known why these four four family members are selected for oncogenic roles, while other ETS proteins are not.  We found that the four oncogenic ETS family members have a specific role in prostate cell migration.  Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing, this specific biological function was matched to a specific set of genomic targets highlighted by the presence of an AP-1 binding site.  ETS/AP-1 binding sites are prototypical Ras-responsive elements, but oncogenic ETS proteins could activate a Ras/MAPK transcriptional program in the absence of MAPK activation.  These findings indicate that the specific function of ETS proteins over-expressed in prostate cancer is the activation of a Ras/MAPK gene expression program in the absence of signaling pathway mutations.

DESIGN
16 samples were analyzed, comprised of four replicates each of four different biological conditions.  RNA from U0126 treated RWPE-1 empty vector cell RNA serves as a control for each experiment. Cell lines have retroviral expression constructs expressing either empty vector, Flag-ERG, or Flag-ETV1.
