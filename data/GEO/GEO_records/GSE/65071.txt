TITLE
Plasma profiling of miRNAs in human specimens from osteosarcoma patients.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the primary bone tumor in children and young adults.  Currently, there are no reliable, non-invasive biological markers to detect the presence or progression of disease, assess therapy response, or provide upfront prognostic insights. Using a qPCR-based platform that analyzes more than 750 miRNAs, we analyzed control and diseased-associated plasma from human cases of OS to identify a profile of differentially expressed miRNAs.

DESIGN
Comprehensive miRNA expression profiling was completed using the Exiqon miRNome platform (human panels I+II, V3) on 20 disease samples (10 localized, 10 metastatic) and 15 healthy controls.

PLATFORM
GPL19631 Exiqon human V3 microRNA PCR panel I+II
