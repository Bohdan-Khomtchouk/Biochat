TITLE
Effect of PCO1 overexpression [normoxia]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The effect of the overexpression of Plant Cysteine Oxidase (PCO1) on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis resettes was investigated. For this purpose, 4-week old rosette of wild-type and 35S:FLAG:CDO1 plants were compared. Samples were composed of a pool of 5 plants.

DESIGN
In total, 6 samples were analyzes, subdivided in 2 thesis with 3 replicates each. 35S:PCO1 plants were compared to wild-type plants.
