TITLE
Gene expression analysis in Panc-1 cells in response to treatment with Gli3T, a dominant-negative repressor of Gli

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive human malignancies. In our studies, we find that the Gli transcription factors are required for Kras initiation of pancreatic tumorigenesis. In order to identify the downstream transcriptional targets of Gli in PDAC, we conducted gene expression analysis using Gli3T, a transcriptional repressor of Gli. In this data set we include the expression data from 6 samples with three of them expressing a control vector and another three expressing Gli3T

DESIGN
Gli3T with IRES-GFP, or an empty vector was ectopically expressed in Panc-1 cells using lipofectamine transfection. GFP positive cells were sorted 24 hours post transfection and RNA was isolated from the cells using Qiagen RNAeasy kit. Affymetrix gene expression array was conducted on the Panc-1 cells expressing the control vector and cells expressing Gli3T. Relative gene expression between the two sample sets was analyzed. Three samples were analyzed for each set.
