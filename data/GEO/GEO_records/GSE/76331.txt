TITLE
α-linolenic acid and long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids modulate colitis operating with a different gene set

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Adult Wistar rats were fed diet enriched with either α-linolenic acid (ALA) or fish oil for 8 (n=10) weeks. Colitis was induced in rats using 5% dextran sulfate sodium for 7 days. The rats were dissected and RNA was isolated from the colon tissues of rats, the samples from 6 rats were pooled and used for the microarray experiments. Global gene expression analysis was done in duplicates in each group and the results were compared to n-6 fatty acid group. α-linolenic acid (ALA) and fish oil rich in eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid significantly attenuated the symptoms of colitis, compared to n-6 fatty acid group. Gene expression analysis has revealed that there is no common gene signature in the two groups.

DESIGN
Agilent Custom Rat Gene Expression 8X60K (AMADID: 28279) designed by Genotypic Technology Private Limited , Labeling kit: Agilent Quick-Amp labeling Kit (p/n5190-0442) Adult Wistar rats were fed diet enriched with either α-linolenic acid (ALA) or fish oil for 8 (n=10) weeks. The results were compared to n-6 fatty acid group.
