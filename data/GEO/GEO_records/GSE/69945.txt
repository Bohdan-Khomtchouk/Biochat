TITLE
Mouse lung tissue transcriptome response to H1N1, H5N1, and mutants [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA, miRNA, proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and histopathology analysis in mouse lung infected with WT A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1; 'VN1203'), VN1203-NS1trunc124, and WT A/California/04/2009 (H1N1; 'CA04').

DESIGN
Groups of 22-week-old C57BL/6 mice were infected with WT A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1; 'VN1203'), VN12013-PB2-627E, VN1203-NS1trunc124, and WT A/California/04/2009 (H1N1; 'CA04').Infections were done at 176 PFU/mouse for VN1203, 1100 PFU/mouse for VN1203-NS1trunc124, and 10^4 PFU/mouse for CA04. Time points were 1, 2, 4, and 7 d.p.i. There were 5 mice for all infection groups and 3 mice for all mock groups. Lung samples were collected for virus load, transcriptional and proteomics analysis. Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.
