TITLE
Divergent Compensatory Responses to High Fat Diet Between C57BL6/J and C57BLKs/J Inbred Mouse Strains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To assess whether changes in islet gene expression contribute to differences in phenotypes in response to high fat diet or tretament with pioglitazone, Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarrays were performed on RNA isolated from islets of 4 mice per each treatment group for discovery analysis of gene expression.

DESIGN
Male 8 week-old BL6 and BLKS mice were fed normal chow (18% kcal from fat), HFD (42% kcal from fat), or HFD supplemented with the PPAR-Î³ agonist pioglitazone (PIO) (140 mg PIO/kg diet) for 16 weeks.
