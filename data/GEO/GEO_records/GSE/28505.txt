TITLE
Comparative global gene expression profiling of mice liver and spleen fed with nucleoprotein (NP) diets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A diet rich in nucleic acids and protamin protein, termed as nucleoprotein was used for the study. Mice were fed with NP diets for 4 weeks followed by removal of the liver and spleen. Total RNA extracted from livers and spleens was pooled in each group (low NP or LNP-control, and 1.2% NP-treatment, diets), prior to DNA microarray analysis (Agilent mouse whole genome 4 x 44K). Results revealed 1373 & 3386 up ( > 1.5 fold)- and down ( < 0.75 fold)-regulated genes in the liver, and 252 & 1838 up- and down-regulated genes in the spleen, respectively following 1.2%NP diet. Analysis of genes related to NP diets will be discussed.

DESIGN
To investigate the effect of NP, we added S-nuclegenÂ® at a concentration of 1.2% into CLEA basic purified diet (CLEA JAPAN, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) known to include nucleic acids (NAs) at much lower amounts than standard diet. By HPLC analysis CLEA basic purified diet (low NP), and 1.2% NP diet included 0.03%, and 0.5% NAs, respectively. Male C57BL/6J mice (13 weeks) were fed with NP diet for 4 weeks. The liver and spleen were removed and deep frozen in liquid nitrogen. Whole blood was also sampled from these mice, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA extracted from livers and spleens was pooled in each group (control, lowNP or LNP; and treatment, 1.2%NP), prior to DNA microarray analysis (Agilent mouse whole genome 4 x 44K).
