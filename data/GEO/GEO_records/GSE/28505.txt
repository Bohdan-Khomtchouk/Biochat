TITLE
Comparative global gene expression profiling of mice liver and spleen fed with nucleoprotein (NP) diets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A diet rich in nucleic acids and protamin protein, termed as nucleoprotein was used for the study. Mice were fed with NP diets for 4 weeks followed by removal of the liver and spleen. Total RNA extracted from livers and spleens was pooled in each group (low NP or LNP-control, and 1.2% NP-treatment, diets), prior to DNA microarray analysis (Agilent mouse whole genome 4 x 44K). Results revealed 1373 & 3386 up ( > 1.5 fold)- and down ( < 0.75 fold)-regulated genes in the liver, and 252 & 1838 up- and down-regulated genes in the spleen, respectively following 1.2%NP diet. Analysis of genes related to NP diets will be discussed.
