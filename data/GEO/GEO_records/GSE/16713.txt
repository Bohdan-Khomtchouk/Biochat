TITLE
Atonal and Senseless perturbations in Drosophila melanogaster eye-antennal imaginal discs.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify co-expressed genes downstream of Atonal and Senseless. These gene lists are used as candidate target genes (technically: as foreground sets) in computational predictions of cis-regulatory elements using the cisTargetX method ( http://med.kuleuven.be/cme-mg/lng/cisTargetX ). Together, the gene expression results and cis-regulatory predictions, yield a gene regulatory network underlying the early events in retinal differentiation. Predicted cis-regulatory interactions have been validated extensively in vivo using enhancer reporter assays and genetic perturbations.

DESIGN
Six samples were analyzed for Atonal gain-of-function (GOF) in the eye-antennal imaginal discs of third instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster, namely three biological repeats for two different Gal4 drivers (Gal4/7 and AtoGal), crossed with UASato. Three samples were analyzed for Atonal loss-of-function (LOF) in the eye-antennal imaginal discs, namely three biological repeats of ato-/- larvae. Three samples were analyzed for Senseless GOF, namely three biological repeats of atoGal4 crossed with UASsens. Finally, eight control samples were analyzed, namely two biological repeats of four different lines (atoGal4, Gal4/7, UASato, and cantonS wild type).
