TITLE
Changes of miRNA expression in granulocytes of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) receiving INCB018424 in a Phase 2 study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A global microRNA expression profile was obtained from gradient-purified granulocytes ( > 95% pure) collected at the time of screening and at cycle 4 of treatment Protocol #18424-256 is a Phase 2 study of the JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor INCB01842 in patients with advanced polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) refractory to hydroxyurea;

DESIGN
The aim was to to determine whether treatment with INC180424 was associated with changes in the global microRNA expression profile we compared granulocytes collected at baseline (screening) and at cycle 4
