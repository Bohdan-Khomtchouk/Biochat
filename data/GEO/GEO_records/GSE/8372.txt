TITLE
Gene regulation in ki-ras transfected murine fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ki-ras gene mutations are involved in the carcinogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma and different carcinomas. In order to define potential mutation-specific therapeutic targets, expression profiling analyses were performed using stable transfected NIH3T3 cells carrying different ki-ras gene mutations. Maybe, this analysis allows the discorvery of ras-associated cellular mechanisms, which might lead to the identification of physiological targets for pharmacological interventions of the treatment of Ki-ras-associated human tumors. Keywords: cDNA microarray, murine fibroblast, ki-ras mutations, carcinogenesis

DESIGN
4 transfected murine fibroblast cell lines (mock, wt-kras, Asp, Val) were compared to non-transfected cell line. For each of the four comparison 4 chip experiments were performed including 2 dye swaps.

PLATFORM
