TITLE
NR2C/F orphan receptors induce telomere-genome rearrangements in ALT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Most sarcomas have complex karyotype and are characterized by multiple chromosomal rearrangements. Moreover, sarcomas very frequently maintain their telomeres by recombination in the process called Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) which enables their continuous growth and immortalization. Previously our group showed that orphan receptors bind specifically to the ALT telomeres and that their presence is important for the ALT mechanism. In these studies we focus on the function of orphan receptors at the telomeres and their contribution to telomeric recombination. We demonstrate that orphan receptors induce proximity of their binding sites in telomeric and genomic context and reveal novel aspects of ALT which are telomere-genome rearrangements which can underlie complexity of sarcomas. Our data perturb the dogma of telomere function in protecting the genome integrity. Here we show that in some cases telomeres may in fact drive genomic instability and chromosomal rearrangements by recombination with genomic sites.
