TITLE
Whole-transcriptome microarray to identify sexually dimorphic RNA transcripts that are differentially expressed in disease-susceptible versus nonsusceptible CNS regions of male and female SJL mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that sexual dimorphism in experimental autoimmune enecphalomyelitis arises from sexually dimorphic and CNS-region specific expression of genes that regulate BBB permeability and leukocyte entry. To test this hypothesis, we profiled total RNA from the cerebella and frontal cortices of naïve female versus male SJL mice

DESIGN
100 ng of total RNA was extracted from cerebella and frontal cortices of naïve SJL female and male littermates to identify differential expression of gene transcripts unique to female cerebellum.
