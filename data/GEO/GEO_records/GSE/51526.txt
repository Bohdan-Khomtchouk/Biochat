TITLE
IM015 - Influenza infection of C57BL6 and RIPK3 knock-out mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This purpose of this experiment was to investigate the transcriptional differences between C57BL6, RIPK3 knock-out mice infected with influenza strain A/CA/04/2009 (H1N1) virus.

DESIGN
Overview of Experiment: Groups of 6-8 week-old C57BL6 and RIPK3 knock-out mice were infected with influenza A/CA/04/2009 virus. Infections were done at 10^5 PFU or time-matched mock infected. Time points were 2 and 4 d.p.i.  There were 2-3 animals/dose/time point. Lung samples were collected for virus load and transcriptional analysis. Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
