TITLE
Increased virulence mediated by subinhibitory concentrations of Cefotaxime (CTX)

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Identification of mutants under negative selection mediated by a non-lethal concentration of CTX

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, transposon library exposed during 3 h to CTX  vs. Non-exposed control transposon library (paralelly growing). Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 antibiotic exposed cells, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
