TITLE
Histone deacetylation at coding sequences adjusts transcription kinetics during Candida albicans morphogenesis [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of wild type and set3-deficient Candida albicans cells in yeast and hyphal morphological phases

DESIGN
RNA Sequencing was performed of wild type and set3-deficient Candida albicans strains in two morphological phases (yeast and hypha). Yeast-phase cells were grown to the exponential phase in YPD at 30oC. Hyphal differentiation was induced by resuspending the cells in YPD+20% Fetal Calf Serum and a shift of the growth temperature to 37oC. Induction was performed for 30 minutes. Three biological replicates of both genotypes in each morphological phases were analyzed.
