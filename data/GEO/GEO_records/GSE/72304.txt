TITLE
Remodeling of major genomic fabrics and their interplay in metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRC) accounts for > 80% of all kidney cancers but what triggers the tumorigenesis in the kidney and metastases in the bones are still under debate. Our hypothesis is that remodeling of the genomic fabrics of certain functional pathways and their interplay beyond critical limits are key causes of CCRC. We profiled the transcriptomes of metastatic chest wall and of two primary cancerous sites of the renal medulla and compared them with that of non-cancerous kidney resection margins. Samples were collected from a 74 years old male with metastatic carcinoma, consistent with renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, Fuhrman grade 3, who undergone total right kidney nephrectomy and resection of a chest wall mass. Transcriptomic analysis pointed the tumor region in the right kidney that led to the chest wall metastases. The tumor proved heterogeneous not only in the expression level but also in the expression control, coordination and interplay of pathways responsible for cellular processes and genetic and environmental information processing. The differently regulated pathways in the two sides of the tumor: CCRC, and HIF-1, Vegfa and mTor signaling indicate activation of distinct mechanisms.

DESIGN
Four-conditions (CTR = control - non-cancerous kidney resection margins, PTA = primary tumor side  A, PTB = primary tumor side B, MET = chest wall metastasis. Four biological replicates of each condition.
