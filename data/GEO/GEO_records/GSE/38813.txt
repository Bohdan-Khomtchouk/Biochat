TITLE
piRNAs can trigger a multigenerational epigenetic memory in the germline of C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transgenerational effects likely have wide-ranging implications for human health, biological adaptation and evolution, however their mechanism and biology remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that a germline nuclear small RNA/chromatin pathway can maintain epi-allelic inheritance for many generations when triggered by a piRNA-dependent foreign RNA response in C. elegans. Using forward genetic screens and candidate approaches we find that a core set of nuclear RNAi and chromatin factors are required for multigenerational inheritance of environmental RNAi and piRNA silencing. These include a germline-specific nuclear Argonaute HRDE1/WAGO-9, a HP1 otholog HPL-2 and two putative histone methyltransferases, SET-25 and SET-32. Most surprisingly, piRNAs can trigger highly stable long-term silencing lasting at least 20 generations. Once established, this long-term memory becomes independent of the piRNA trigger but remains dependent on the nuclear RNAi/chromatin pathway. Our data present the first report of multigenerational epigenetic inheritance induced by piRNAs in any organism.

DESIGN
Seven C. elegans small RNA libraries from three distinct experiments (A, B, C) were sequenced using Illumina sequencing technology. Five small RNA libraries were prepared according to library construction protocol 1 and sequenced as part of 22 flow cell lanes on the Illumina GA IIx platform. Samples were labelled for multiplexing using 4-bp 5'-barcodes, a single flow cell lane included several multiplexed libraries. Two small RNA libraries were prepared according to library construction protocol 2 and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform.
