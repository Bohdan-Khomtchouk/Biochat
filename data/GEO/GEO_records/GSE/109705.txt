TITLE
microRNA expression in sham and ovariectomy (OVX) mice femur tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To search for the role of microRNAs in postmenopausal osteoporosis, we used an experimental ovariectomized (OVX) mice moldel. We operated ovariectomy in 3-month-old C57BL/6 mice and collected the femurs after 6months to perform miRNA microarray analysis to identify dysregulated microRNAs.

DESIGN
Two groups were accessed by by miRNA microarray (wt-sham and wt-OVX), and each sample was mixed with four mice tissue.
