TITLE
CNA data from The human glioblastoma cell culture resource: validated cell models representing all molecular subtypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To meet the present shortage of relevant GBM cell (GC) lines we developed a library of annotated and validated cell lines derived from surgical samples of GBM patients, maintained under conditions to preserve GSC characteristics. This collection, which we call the Human Glioblastoma Cell Culture (HGCC) resource, consists of a biobank of GC lines and an associated database containing high-resolution molecular data.

DESIGN
DNA isolated from GC lines using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen) was profiled on Affymetrix Cytoscan arrays at the Uppsala Academic Hospital Array and Analysis facility, in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
