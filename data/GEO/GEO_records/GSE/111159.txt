TITLE
Tissue-specific features of oxidative stress-associated gene expression in a healthy mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oxidative stress is a common phenomenon and is linked to a wide range of diseases and pathological processes. Tissue-specific variation in redox signaling and cellular responses to oxidative stress may be associated with vulnerability to toxic agents and carcinogenic exposures. In order to provide a basis for tissue-specific difference, we examined the tissue-specific transcriptional features of 101 oxidative stress-associated genes in 10 different tissues and organs of healthy mice under physiological conditions. Microarray analysis results, which were consistent with qPCR results, showed that catalase, Gpx3 and Gpx4 were most highly regulated in the liver, kidney and testes. We also found the tissue-specific gene expression of SOD1 (liver and kidney), SOD2 (heart and muscle) and SOD3 (lung and kidney). The current results will serve as a reference for animal models and help advance our understanding of tissue-specific variability in oxidative stress-associated pathogenesis.

DESIGN
10 different tissues collected from the five mice: Sp, spleen; Th, thymus; Lu, lung; St, stomach; He, heart; Mu, muscle; Li, liver; Ki, kidney; Ce, cerebrum; and Te, testis.
