SUMMARY
Binding of in vitro synthesized HAC1 mRNA was studied using protein microarray. 3 replicates, plus 3 reverse dye replicates An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract. is_reverse: no: HAC1 mRNA Cy5 labeled; yes: HAC1 mRNA Cy3 labeled

DESIGN
