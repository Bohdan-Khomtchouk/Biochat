TITLE
Gene epxression profiling in murine Flt3+ granulocyte progenitors (Flt3+ GPs) and Flt3- granulocyte progenitors (Flt3- GPs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the mechanism by which IRF8 promotes basophil differentiation

DESIGN
Murine bone marrow Flt3+ GPs and Flt3- GPs were isolated by cell sorting from wild-type or Irf8 deficient mice. Two independent experiments were performed.
