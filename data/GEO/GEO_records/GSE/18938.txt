TITLE
Effect of EGF and/or HER2 on the growth of MCF10A cells on extracellular matrix: time course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mammary epithelial cells MCF10A  and HER2 overexpressing MCF10A  cells were grown on matrigel in the absence or presence of epidermal growth factor. Cells were lysed and RNA was collected  at 1.5,3,5,7,9 days.

DESIGN
Total 20 arrays from four time course experiments. MCF10A and MCF10A-HER2 (overexpressed HER2) were plated on  Matrigel in the absence or presence of 20 ng/ml of EGF. This design creates four panels of experiments of 5 time points each.

PLATFORM
