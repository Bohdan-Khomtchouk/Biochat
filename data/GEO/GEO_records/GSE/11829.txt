TITLE
Prg1 is regulated by the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Math2

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Math2 (NEX-1/NeuroD6) is a member of the bHLH transcription factor family and is involved in neuronal differentiation and maturation. In the present study, we identified the genes targeted by Math2 using DNA microarrays and cultured rat cortical cells transfected with Math2. Of the genes regulated by Math2, we focused on plasticity-related gene 1 (Prg1). Prg1 expression induced by Math2 was confirmed in cultured rat cortical cells and PC12 cells analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. Examining the promoter region of rat Prg1, we found four E-boxes designated -E1 to -E4 (CANNTG) which were recognized by the bHLH transcription factor. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we found that Math2 directly bound to the E-box(es) in the Prg1 promoter. The reporter assay of Prg1 showed that -E1 was critical for the regulation of the Prg1 expression by Math2. Then, the functional role of Math2 and Prg1 was investigated in PC12 cells. Seventy-two hours after transfection of Math2 or Prg1, neurite length and number was significantly induced in PC12 cells. Co-transfection with Prg1-siRNA completely inhibited Math2-mediated morphological changes. Our results suggest that Math2 directly regulates Prg1 expression and Math2-Prg1 cascade plays an important role in neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells.
