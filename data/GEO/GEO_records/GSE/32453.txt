TITLE
Study of transcriptional expression in HCM

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptional expression patterns in the myocardium of HCM patients may contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that drive and stabilize the hypertrophy.

DESIGN
Cardiac myectomies/biopsies from 8 patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) (3 men) and 5 controls without cardiac disease were studied

PLATFORM
GPL6104 Illumina humanRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
