TITLE
Comparison of gene expression regulated by WRKY6

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
WRKY6-overexpressing line 35S:WRKY6-9, knockout mutant wrky6-1 and wild-type seedlings were used to analyze genes whose expression are controlled under WRKY6.

DESIGN
Seven-day-old seedlings of wild-type, 35S:WRKY6-9 and wrky6-1 mutant were harvested for RNA extraction.
