TITLE
Glycogene expression changes between different passages in the 4T1 Mouse metastatic breast cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This laboratory's focus is on the immune response to carbohydrate antigens, with an emphasis on modalities to analyze and to increase the immune response. We are also interested in carbohydrate drug targeting. The hypothesis is that these 2 variants have different cell surface carbohydrate expression, which results in different adhesion patterns, which ultimately results in different metastasis patterns. Evidence for expression differences and loss of the variants ability to metastasize to the lung could have clinical implications in the prevention of metastasis to different organs.

DESIGN
The 4T1 mouse metastatic breast cancer cell line is known to change with passages in culture. Our data has shown changes cause the cells to metastasize to the intestine rather than to the lung. Four classes of RNA were analyzed: one each from 4T1 metastatic cell line variant #1, 4T1 variant #2, non-metastatic cell lines 4T07, and non-metastatic cell line 67NR. Classes were prepared in triplicate for a total of 12 samples. All samples were hybridized to the custom designed CFG GLYCOv2 glycogene array.
