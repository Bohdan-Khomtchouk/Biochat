TITLE
Genowide-wide analysis of scc2-4 binding.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741

SUMMARY
The evolutionarily conserved cohesin complex is crucial for holding sister chromatids together from the time of DNA replication until their segregation during the metaphase to anaphase transition. Human diseases associated with with mutations in the cohesin network are termed " cohesinopathies " . Scc2 is required for loading cohesin onto DNA prior to DNA replication. Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a developmental disorder characterized by growth and intellectual impairment is caused by mutations in Scc2. How mutations in Scc2 gives rise to these developmental defects is currently unknown, as overt defects in chromosome segregation are not observed in CdLS patients. One hypothesis is that, reduced binding of Scc2 causes gene misregulation. To further explore this idea ChIP-seq was performed using an scc2-4 mutant. We observed from the analysis, we observe reduce binding of Scc2 to Pol II transcribed genes (snoRNAs, ribosomal protein genes) and pol II transcribed genes (tRNAs). Studies are currently underway to examine the biological implications of this observation.
