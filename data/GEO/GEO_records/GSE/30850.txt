TITLE
X chromosome gene expression in D. melanogaster testes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Whole genome expression analyses reveal little evidence for X chromosome dosage compensation or meiotic inactivation in Drosophila testes, whereas testes-specific transgene reporters suggest a novel form of X chromosome-specific regulation.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in RNA extracted from adult male and female dissected thorax, and in cells dissected from the apical tip of 2-4 day old adult male testes. Each tissue was assayed on four replicate arrays.
