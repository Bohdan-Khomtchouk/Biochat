TITLE
The BET bromodomain inhibitor CPI203 overcomes resistance to ABT-199 (venetoclax) by downregulation of BFL-1/A1 in in vitro and in vivo models of MYC+/BCL2+ double hit lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Double Hit Lymphoma (DHL) were treated with the BRD4 inhibitor 100 nM CPI203 for 6h We used microarrays to uncover the mechanisms underlying CPI203 activity in Double Hit Lymphoma (DHL)

DESIGN
Global RNA expression was done in three DHL cell lines and two DHL patients treated in vitro with CPI203 for 6h

PLATFORM
GPL13667 [HG-U219] Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array
