TITLE
Comparative transcriptomics of wild-type (Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133) and hmpD-deletion strains (UCD 543) of Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133

ORGANISM
Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102

SUMMARY
Change in gene expression for a wild-type (Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133) and hmpD-deletion strain (UCD 543) of Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 over the time course of hormogonium  development This study is further descirbed in Risser, D.D. and Meeks, J.C. 2013. Comparative transcriptomics with a motility deficient mutant leads to identification of a novel polysaccharide secretion system in Nostoc punctiforme. Molecular Microbiology

DESIGN
Total RNA from 3 biological replicates at each time point from 0 to 24 hours after hormogonium induction was converted to cDNA, dye-labled and hybridized to nimblegen 12x135k array slides
