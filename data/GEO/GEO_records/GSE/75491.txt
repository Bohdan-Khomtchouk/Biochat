TITLE
Determination of a comprehensive alternative splicing regulatory network and the combinatorial regulation by key factors during Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition [RBM47 KD]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RBM47 is a RNA binding protein that is known to regulate alternative splicing. To study the genome wide regulatory role of RBM47 in alternative splicing and determine the potential function of RBM47 during EMT, we used lentiviral shRNAs to knockdown RBM47 in H358 cells and performed RNA-seq in biological triplicates.

DESIGN
We used lentiviral based shRNAs to knockdown RBM47 in human H358 cells. We harvested total RNA and protein from RBM47 knockdown and control knockdown in biological triplicates. We made cDNA libraries for each replicate and subjected them to RNA-seq.
