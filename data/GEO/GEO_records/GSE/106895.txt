TITLE
Gene expression profiling of mouse macrophages following IRF2 knockdown

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We applied next-generation sequencing to investigate the gene expression profiles in mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages with or without IRF2 knockdown. We identified a number of differentially regulated genes in cells with IRF2 knockdown.

DESIGN
Mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages were transfected with control siRNA or IRF2 specific siRNAs. 48h after transfection, total RNA was isolated and subjected to high-throughput sequencin (RNA-seq), using Illumina GAIIx. Gene expression profiles were compared between two groups.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
