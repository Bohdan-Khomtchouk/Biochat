TITLE
Gene profile of mid-log phase of SD medium grown Candida albicans rhb1 gene deletion strain

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogenic yeast that is commensally found in variety of host niches. Rhb1 serves as an positive regulator of Tor1 kinase which is the central component of the TOR signaling in controlling several virulence factors. Here, we used microarray to determined changes in transcript profile while the cell lacks the RHB1 gene.

DESIGN
10 array generated by six batchs of individual experiment (from cell isolation to culture); each included one flask of wild type culture (SC5314) and one flask of rhb1âˆ† (CCT-D1)mutant culture.
