TITLE
Pathways of ovarian cancer development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to evaluate pathways that drive the development of ovarian cancer, we compared Affymetrix expression profiles from normal ovarian surface epithelium to those from primary ovarian carcinomas.

DESIGN
mRNA expression profiles for 57 ovarian carcinomas and 12 ovarian normal samples.

PLATFORM
GPL15048 Rosetta/Merck Human RSTA Custom Affymetrix 2.0 microarray [HuRSTA_2a520709.CDF]
