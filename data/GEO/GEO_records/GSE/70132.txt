TITLE
BMP signaling differentially regulates distinct hematopoietic stem cell types

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In BRE-GFP transgenic mice BMP activated cells are marked by GFP expression. Analysis of GFP+ and GFP- LSK-SLAM HSC enriched fractions from fetal liver and adult bone marrow shows the interinsic differences in the genetic program of these two HSC enriched fractions.

DESIGN
RNAseq of GFP+ and GFP- LSK-SLAM cells from BRE-GFP transgenic mice Fetal liver and adult bone marrow

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
