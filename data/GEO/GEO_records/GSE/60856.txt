TITLE
Expression data of isolated motor neurons from SOD1 G93A mice, after G-CSF treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes in spinal motor neurons of the SOD1G93A-transgenic model for ALS after treatment with G-CSF. To gain insight into the mode of action of G-CSF, we performed gene expression profiling on isolated lumbar motor neurons from SOD1G93A mice, the most frequently studied animal model for ALS, with and without G-CSF treatment.

DESIGN
A first group of SOD1G93A and WT mice was included in the study at week 11 of age when SOD1G93A mice present no signs of motor dysfunction but subtle signs of denervation detectable by electromyography. The second cohort of mice was treated with G-CSF or vehicle from week 11 to week 15. At the time of study completion, SOD1G93A mice presented clear motor impairment and motor neuron degeneration is documented. This design should provide information on genes altered in motor neurons of SOD1G93A mice from the clinically non-symptomatic to an early symptomatic stage, and give insight into genes influenced by G-CSF treatment. We sampled 300 motoneurons per mouse spinal cord by laser microdissection.
