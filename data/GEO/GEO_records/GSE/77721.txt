TITLE
Comparison of the transcriptomes of a Pasteurella multocida VP161 wild-type strain with a Pasteurella multocida VP161 hfq mutant

ORGANISM
Pasteurella multocida

SUMMARY
Objectives: To determine the transcripts that are differentially expressed in a hfq mutant. Hfq is an RNA chaperone that mediates many interactions between regultory RNAs and their mRNA targets. Analysis of the transcriptomes of the Pasteurella multocida wild-type strain and the Pasteurella multocida hfq mutant will allow for identification of genes controlled by hfq and the sRNAs with which it interacts.

DESIGN
Methods: RNA sequencing was employed to determine the transcriptomes of a wild-type Pasteurella multocida strain and a hfq mutant strain. Comparison of these two transcriptomes allows for determination of differentially expressed genes and therefore those genes controlled by Hfq and sRNAs with which it interacts.
