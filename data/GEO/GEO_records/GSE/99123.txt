TITLE
Gene Expression data from induced Pluripotent Stem cells from healthy control donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have generated human induced Pluripotent Stem cells (hiPSc) using Retroviral or Sendai virus-mediated delivery of reprogramming factors. hiPSc lines have been screened using SNP array to assess chromosomal stability (alongside the fibroblast lines from which they derived), and validation of the pluripotency of the hiPSc lines is provided by Pluritest assessment of transcriptome datasets, prior to differentiation and downstream assays. MAPT genetic variation and neuronal maturity alter isoform expression affecting axonal transport in iPSC-derived dopamine neurons.

DESIGN
human iPSc lines were derived from human dermal fibroblasts from 3 control donors (newly-derived lines are reported here; for lines that have been previously described and for fibroblasts from which lines have been derived, refer to current manuscript for relevant references). SNP and gene expression datasets were generated.
