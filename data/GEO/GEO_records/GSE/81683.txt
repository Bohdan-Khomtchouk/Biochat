TITLE
Angiogenesis in the skin of SHARPIN-deficient mice with chronic proliferative dermatitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Angiogenesis is a common feature of pathological processes including wound healing, tumor formation, and chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation can also be associated with dilation or proliferation of lymph vessels. We examined blood vessels and lymphatics and the expression of pro- and anti-angiogenic genes in the skin of SHARPIN-deficient mice which spontaneously develop a chronic proliferative dermatitis (cpdm). The number of blood vessels in the dermis of cpdm mice increased with age as the inflammation progressed. Lymphatics identified by labeling for LYVE1 and podoplanin were moderately dilated, but they were not increased in number. The expression of proangiogenic Vegfa, Flt1 and anti-angiogenic Sema3a mRNA was increased. VEGFA was primarily localized in keratinocytes of cpdm skin. There was also increased expression of Ece1 and Pdpn mRNA. Podoplanin was restricted to lymphatic endothelial cells in normal skin, but fibroblasts in cpdm skin also reacted with anti-podoplanin antibodies indicating that they were activated. The expression of other angiogenic and lymphangiogenic factors was not altered or decreased. These results indicate that cpdm mice may be a useful model to study the pathogenesis of angiogenesis in chronic inflammation.

DESIGN
Thirty-one skin samples were taken from fifteen C57BL/KaLawRij-Sharpincpdm/Sharpincpdm RijSunJ (cpdm) and sixteen C57BL/6J (wildtype) female Mus musculus subjects at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks of age.  Three replicates were taken per sample group, except an additional sample was taken for wildtype mice at 6 weeks of age.
