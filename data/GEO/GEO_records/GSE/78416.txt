ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from independent growths of bipolar neurons that were differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells. They are stranded SE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted Total RNA < 200 nucleotides in size that was pre-treated with TAP prior to cloning.
