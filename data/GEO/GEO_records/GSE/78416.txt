TITLE
small RNA-seq from bipolar spindle neuron (ENCSR603RPC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from independent growths of bipolar neurons that were differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells. They are stranded SE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted Total RNA < 200 nucleotides in size that was pre-treated with TAP prior to cloning.
