TITLE
A modified lung allograft renal capsule model to investigate the differentiation of lung epithelial cells from murine embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of epithelial type cell formation with mouse embyronic stem cells following 11 days of differentiation using the small molcule IDE2 as well as FGF2 and FGF10 growth factors. Up-regulation of selected lung epithelial genes will provide evidence as to whether these IDE2-based differentiation protocols result in a higher yield of alveolar-epithelial type cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated following 11 days of differentiation in culture using IDE2 with or without FGF2 or FGF 10. Undifferentiated embryonic stem cells were taken as a control
