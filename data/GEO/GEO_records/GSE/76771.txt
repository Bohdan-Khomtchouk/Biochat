TITLE
Transcription factor ATF4 directs basal and select gene expression in the unfolded protein response and cholesterol metabolism in liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the physiological role of ATF4 within mouse liver, under basal and ER stress conditions.  With three mice per group, and approximately 30 million reads per sample, we obtained genome-wide role of ATF4 within the liver.  We find ATF4 is responsible for a small subset of ER stress genes, and larger than previously thought basal subset.

DESIGN
Examination of the loss of ATF4 basally and during 6 hour Tunicamycin induced ER stress

PLATFORM
