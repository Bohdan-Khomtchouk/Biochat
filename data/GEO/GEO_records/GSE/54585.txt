TITLE
Gene expression of alveolar macrophages before and after allergen challenge

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mild asthmatics who met the criteria of the IRB approved protocol of Sub-segmental Bronchial Provocation with Allergen were recruited. The subjects were challenged with sensitive allergen through bronchoscopy. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were collected before and at 48 hours after allergen challegen. From the BAL fluids, alveolar macrophages were purifed and their RNA was extracted. Total 138 genes including five house keeping genes were evaluated.

DESIGN
Two samples of alveolar macrophages from single subject, before and 48 hours after allergen challenge, were directly compared in terms of the expression of inflammatory, chemokine, cytokine genes and their receptor genes.
