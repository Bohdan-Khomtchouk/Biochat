TITLE
Expression profiling of laser-microdissected tissue from Tg2576 plaque-depositing mouse model of Alzheimer's disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Amyloid-ß (Aß) plaques are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. However, the precise neuropathological changes that occur in brain in response to amyloid deposition are largely unknown. To study the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for Aß-mediated neuropathology, we performed a gene expression analysis on laser-microdissected brain tissue of Tg2576 mice compared to their littermate controls.

DESIGN
4 samples; 2 biological replicates of each condition = 2 transgenic versus 2 non-transgenic mice; double amplification of total RNA; only Cy3; no dye-swaps

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
