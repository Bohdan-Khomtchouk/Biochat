TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of MCF-7 cells expressing or not MMP-14 (MT1-MMP) growing in monolayer cell culture conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the impact of MMP-14 (MT1-MMP) on the transcriptomes of a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, we performed a microarray analysis from RNAs isolated from MCF-7 cells expressing either an empty vector (VEC) or human MMP-14 cDNA (MT1) in monolayer growth conditions.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with either an empty vector (pcDNA3.1/Zeo) or human MMP-14 cDNA (pcDNA3.1-MMP-14/Zeo). Cells were grown for 48 hours in monolayer culture. Cells were then lysed in TRIzol and total RNA was isolated. For each experimental condition, total RNAs isolated from 3 independant biological replicates were pooled.
