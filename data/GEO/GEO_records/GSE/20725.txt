TITLE
ChIP-seq of PHF8 and H3K4me3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PHF8 is an H3K9me2 demethylase, interacts with H3K4me3 and RNA Polymerase II, is enriched at thousands of transcription start sites and can act as a transcriptional co-activator.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of PHF8 in HeLa, 293T and Hs68 cells, and of H3K4me3 in Hs68 fibroblasts was performed. Normal IgG-IP or input DNA served as negative controls.
