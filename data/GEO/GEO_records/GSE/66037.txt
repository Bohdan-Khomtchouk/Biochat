TITLE
Genome wide analysis of androgen-receptor binding sites and epigenetic condition in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and AR downstream signalings promote prostate cancer cell proliferation. To investigate the AR signaling, we performed ChIP sequence analysis in AR positive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. In addition, we used hormone-refractory prostate cancer model cells, Bicalutamide-resistant (BicR) to explore the differences of androgen signaling in prostate cancer progression.

DESIGN
ChIP sequence analysis of AR binding sites and epigenetic condition in two prostate cancer cells
