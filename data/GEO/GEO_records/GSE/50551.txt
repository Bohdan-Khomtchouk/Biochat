TITLE
Histone Deacetylase Inhibition Promotes Osteoblast Maturation by Altering the Histone 4 (H4) Epigenome (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-Seq analysis revealed that suberoylanilidehydroxamic acid (SAHA) increases genome-wide H4 acetylation in differentially regulated genes, except for the 500 bp upstream of transcription start sites (TSS).

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel high throughput sequencing (Seq) was used to map genome-wide histone H4 acetylation (K4/7/11/15) in the presence or absence of SAHA in differentiating  MC3T3 sc4 osteoblasts.
