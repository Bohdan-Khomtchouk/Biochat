TITLE
Murine ES cells, neural precursor cells and embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Expression profiles for isogenic (129SvJae x C57BL/6) murine embryonic stem (ES) cells, neural precursors (NPC) obtained through in vitro differentiation of the ES cells, and embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) obtained at day 13.5. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
3 replicates of wt ES cells, 3 replicates of wt NPCs obtained by in vitro differentiation, 2 replicated of primary MEFs
