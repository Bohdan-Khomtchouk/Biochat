TITLE
In vivo nucleosome occupancy in yeast (MNase-seq)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Open chromatin provides access to a wide spectrum of DNA binding proteins for DNA metabolism processes such as transcription, repair, recombination, and replication. In this regard, open chromatin profiling has been widely used to identify the location of regulatory regions, including promoters, enhancers, insulators, silencers, replication origins, and recombination hotspots. Regulatory DNA elements are made accessible by nucleosome-depeleted states. Thus, nucleosome remodelling and modification should be intimately coupled with open chromatin formation and regulation. However, our knowledge of nucleosome regulation is largely limited to promoter regions, which comprise only a subset of all regulatory loci in the genome. In order to examine nucleosome patterns in open chromatin regions, we performed micrococcal nuclease (MNase) sequencing for a laboratory strain of yeast.
