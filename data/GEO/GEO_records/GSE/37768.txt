TITLE
Expression data in lung tissue from moderate COPD patients, healthy smokers and nonsmokers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive and irreversible chronic inflammatory lung disease. The abnormal inflammatory response of the lung, mainly to cigarette smoke, causes multiple cellular and structural changes affecting all of its compartments, which leads to disease progression. The molecular mechanisms underlying these pathological changes are still not fully understood The aim of this study was to identify genes and molecular pathways potentially involved in the pathogenesis of COPD

DESIGN
Peripheral lung tissue samples from moderate COPD patients, smokers and nonsmokers were obtained. All patients were undergoing lung resection for localized carcinomas. RNA was extracted and processed for further hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
