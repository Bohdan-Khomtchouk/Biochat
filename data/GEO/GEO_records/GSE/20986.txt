TITLE
Comparative Gene Expression Profiling of HUVEC and Ocular Vascular Endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare the gene expression profiles of unpassaged, proliferating HUVEC and human iris, retinal and choroidal microvascular endothelial cells. Gene expression profiling revealed significant differences between HUVEC and ocular microvascular endothelial cells suggesting that HUVE cells may not be a suitable surrogate when studying pathophysiological mechanisms of ocular disorders. There were significant differences in the gene expression of important cell signalling pathways in human retinal and choroidal ECs. These differences may be important in the mechanisms and treatment of choroidal and retinal neovascularisation.

DESIGN
12 arrays are included.  Endothelial cells were derived from 4 tissues: iris, retina, choroid and human umbilical vein.  RNA extracts from cells were hybridised to Affymetrix HGU133plus2 arrays in triplicate.
