TITLE
Altered gene expression in the lower expiratory tract of Car6-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to explore the functions of carbonic anhydrase VI (CA VI) more fully, we examined the transcriptomic responses to CA VI deficiency in the trachea, and lung of Car6-/- mice by cDNA microarray. 44 and 2 genes were up- or down-regulated in the above-mentioned tissues of Car6-/- mice, respectively. The functional clustering of differentially expressed genes revealed a number of altered biological processes. In the trachea, the affected biological pathways included metabolic process, biological regulation, single-organism process, and immune response in mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue. Trachea, and lung samples were collected from eight wild-type and six Car6-/- male mice, respectively, at the age of two months. Total RNAs were purified and used for cDNA microarray.

DESIGN
32 samples, including 4 replicates.
