TITLE
Expression data from 7 day old Arabidopsis roots with 1h  Red light or dark

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Red light can affect a variety of responses in Arabidopsis.  We characterize the early gene expression patterns of roots exposed to 1 hour of red light.  Early genes indicate elements involved in photomorphogenesis, chloroplast development, PAL pathways, root hair development are regulated by 1 hour of red light We used microarrays to detail the gene expression underlying the effects of red light on roots. Keywords: treatment
