TITLE
Expression data from 7 day old Arabidopsis roots with 1h  Red light or dark

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Red light can affect a variety of responses in Arabidopsis.  We characterize the early gene expression patterns of roots exposed to 1 hour of red light.  Early genes indicate elements involved in photomorphogenesis, chloroplast development, PAL pathways, root hair development are regulated by 1 hour of red light We used microarrays to detail the gene expression underlying the effects of red light on roots. Keywords: treatment

DESIGN
7 Day dark-grown 1 cm Arabidopsis root tips were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We pooled samples from several Petri plates for each experiment to obtain enough RNA for arrays.  Three experiments were performed. Treatment 1 hour of red light 630 nm (max) and dark controls
