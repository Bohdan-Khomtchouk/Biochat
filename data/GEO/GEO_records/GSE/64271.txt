TITLE
Systematic Comparison of Mouse and Human Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma by Using Functional Transcriptomic Analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aims to compare the global expression signature of protein coding genes between oral cancers from carcinogen-induced mice and human patients. Combinatorial treatment of 4NQO and arecoline for 8 weeks consistently induced the formation of mouse oral cancer with morphology and pathology resembling human oral squamous cell carcinoma. In this dataset, 5 mouse normal tongue and 7 tumor samples were used and Illumina Mouse Ref-8 cDNA microarray was conducted.

DESIGN
To identify protein coding genes differentially expressed in mice oral cancers, 7 tumor tissues from carcinogen-treated mice and 5 normal tongue tissues from control mice were used in a microarray-based analysis for protein-coding gene expression patterns.
