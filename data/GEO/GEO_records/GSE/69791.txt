TITLE
Expression Data from Memory P14 Tg CD8 T cells after either saline mock-infection, Pichinde Virus Infection (bystander infection) or Pichinde Virus infection with daily treatment with anti-CD122 (clone TM-b1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exposure to inflammatory cytokines driven by bystander cytokines can have profound effects on the function of memory CD8 T cells. Here we transferred a 1-5X10^4 of P14 TCR-tg T cells (specific for gp33-41 of LCMV) on day -1 followed by infection with 2X10^5 PFU of LCMV Armstrong ip to generate memory P14 populations. Mice were rested for > 50 days before further challenge. Mice containing memory P14 populations were either mock-infected with saline, infected with 2X10^6 Pichinde Virus ip (no cross-reactivity wtih LCMV gp33-41) or infected with 2X10^6 Pichinde Virus ip together with daily injections of 200 micrograms of anti-CD122 antibody (clone TM-b1). On day 4 following indicated treatments P14s were flow sorted and RNA was extracted from 1X10^6 cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Each group had 3 biological replicates. Transcriptomes were compared by DAVID analysis (p < 0.01, Fold-Change > 1.5)

DESIGN
3 biological replicates per group. Groups included P14 from mock-infected mice, P14 from Pichinde virus infected mice and P14 from Pichinde virus and anti-cd122 treated mice.
