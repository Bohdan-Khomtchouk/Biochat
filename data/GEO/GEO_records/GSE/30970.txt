TITLE
Arabidopsis AGO5 contributes to a POL II-based RNA silencing pathway directing epigenetic marks

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To characterise the Arabidopsis AGO5 protein, we report the AGO5 associated sRNAs, ago5 mutant total sRNAs and digital gene indexing tags with altered abundance in the ago5 mutant.

DESIGN
Examination of AGO5 associated sRNAs, population of total sRNAs in the ago5 mutant and characterisation of RNA transcripts with altered abundance in the ago5 mutant.

PLATFORM
GPL9302 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Arabidopsis thaliana)
