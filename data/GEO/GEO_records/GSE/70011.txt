TITLE
A screen for cis-regulatory elements for murine miR-142 using an sgRNA library prepared by Molecular Chipper technology

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CRISPR-based loss-of-function screens have been proven powerful to identify genetic regulators in mammalian cells, but current approaches for single guide RNA (sgRNA) library construction are expensive and difficult to be adapted in most laboratories. Here, we present a Molecular Chipper technology for inexpensive and easily customizable sgRNA library generation, and a proof-of-principle screen that identifies novel cis-regulatory regions for miR-142 biogenesis.  This method will be useful for functional interrogation of non-coding elements in mammalian genomes

DESIGN
12 biological samples were sequenced from three biological replicates (Sam1, Sam2 and Sam3 below). Each biological replicate was sorted into neg-GFP, low-GFP, med-GFP and high-GFP populations for sequencing library construction. An unsorted sample is included.
