TITLE
ADAM-28: A potential oncogene involved in asbestos-related lung adenocarcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify gene expression biomarkers associated with asbestos-related lung adenocarcinoma, we analyzed primary tumour gene expression for a total of 36 primary lung adenocarcinomas on 22,323 element microarrays, comparing 12 patients with lung asbestos body counts above levels associated with urban dwelling (ARLC-AC: asbestos-related lung cancer-adenocarcinoma) with 24 patients with no asbestos bodies (NARLC-AC: non-asbestos related lung cancer-adenocarcinoma).

DESIGN
To identify gene expression biomarkers associated with asbestos-related lung tumorigenicity, we performed gene expression array analysis on tumours of 36 patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma, comparing twelve patients with lung asbestos body counts above levels associated with urban dwelling (ARLC-AC: asbestos-related lung cancer-adenocarcinoma) with twenty-four patients with no asbestos bodies (NARLC-AC: non-asbestos related lung cancer-adenocarcinoma). Synthesis of the labelled first strand cDNA was conducted using Amersham CyScribe Post-Labelling kit with starting material of 20 ug of total RNA. The amino-allyl labeled dNTP mix was added to the reaction to generate amino-allyl labelled second strand cDNA. Following the hydrolysis reaction, single-stranded cDNA probes were purified using Amersham GFX columns. Dye coupling reactions were performed by mixing the cDNA samples with Amersham Cy3 (reference) or Cy5 (tumour) and incubating in the dark. The reactions were purified with Amersham GFX columns to remove the unincorporated/quenched dyes. After the purification samples were combined for hybridization, the labeled cDNAs were co-hybridized to 22K oligo microarrays. Slides were scanned on GMS418 confocal scanner (Agilent). Genes differentially expressed between ARLC-AC and NARLC-AC were identified on fold change and P-value, and then prioritised using gene ontology.
