TITLE
Expression profile of HCT116 cells treated with TNF-α/IFN-ɣ, both TNF-α/IFN-ɣ and silibinin, and without treatment.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of HCT116 colon cancer cells with different treatments. Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip was used to obtain expression profiles across more than 31,000 annotated genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HCT116 cells with different treatments, namely, cells with TNF-α (50ng/ml)/IFN-ɣ (50U/ml) treatment, cells with TNF-α (50 ng/ml)/IFN-ɣ (50 U/ml) and silibinin (100 uM) treatment and cells without any treatment. Each sample has 2 biological replicates.
