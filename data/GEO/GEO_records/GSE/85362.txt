TITLE
RNA-seq data of Paracoccus denitrificans grown under different N2O levels

ORGANISM
Paracoccus denitrificans

SUMMARY
We report here the RNA seq results of sRNA enriched Paracoccus denitrificans grown under three different N2O levels (high N2O reffered to as CuL/ low N2O reffered to as CuH/ Low N2O aerobic reffered to as CuH O2)

DESIGN
Three different copper regimes for 16 hours.  Total RNA was isolated and processed by vertis Biotechnologie AG to isolate the sRNA fraction. This was then converted to cDNA and sequenced.
