TITLE
The effects of temporally restricted feeding on hepatic gene expression of Cry1, Cry2 double KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Restricted feeding impacts the hepatic circadian clock of WT mice. Cry1, Cry2 double KO mice lack a circadian clock and are thus expected to show rhythmical gene expression in the liver. Imposing a temporally restricted feeding schedule on these mice  shows how the hepatic circadian clock and rhythmic food intake regulate rhythmic transcription in parallel

DESIGN
Cry1, Cry2 double KO mice were entrained either to ad libitum or temporally restricted feeding (tRF) schedules. Food was made available to mice under the tRF regimen only between ZT(CT)1 and ZT(CT)9. Mice were then released into constant darkness while the respective feeding schedules were still maintained. Liver tissue was collected on the second day of constant darkness at the indicated timepoints. Total RNA was extracted and 5ug of RNA was used in the standard Affymetrix protocol for amplification, labeling and hybridization
