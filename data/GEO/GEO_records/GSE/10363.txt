TITLE
Within and between-species transcript profiling during cotton fibre development

ORGANISM
Gossypium barbadense ; Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
A gene expression profiling study on two major cotton species that are cultivated for fibre, Gossypium hirsutum (L.) and Gossypium barbadense (L.), at different stages during fibre development using a printed cDNA microarray was undertaken to identify potential candidate genes for manipulation to improve fibre quality. Keywords: Species comparison, development

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment: 7, 11 and 21 day post anthesis. Biological replicates: 3, Two species compared at each condition: Gossypium.hirsutum and Gossypium.barbadense.  One replicate per array, dye swap, one rep per array.

PLATFORM
GPL4043 CSIRO cotton whole plant cDNA array
