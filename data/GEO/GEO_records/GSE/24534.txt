TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of a breeding program pedigree

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Transcriptome comparison of 15 lines representing the University of Minnesota six-rowed malting breeding program  at two time points of the malting process: 'out of steep' and '3 days of germination'. Three replicates of each genotype and time point were accomplished.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Maria Mu√±oz-Amatriain.
