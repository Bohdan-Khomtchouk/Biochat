TITLE
Expression profiling of skeletal muscle following acute β2-adrenergic stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Systemic administration of β-adrenoceptor (β-AR) agonists has been found to induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy and significant metabolic changes. In the context of energy homeostasis, the importance of β-AR signaling has been highlighted by the inability of β1–3-AR-deficient mice to regulate energy expenditure and susceptibility to diet induced obesity. However, the molecular pathways and gene expression changes that initiate and maintain these phenotypic modulations are poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify differential changes in gene expression in murine skeletal muscle associated with systemic acute administration of the β2-AR agonist formoterol. Skeletal muscle gene expression (from murine tibialis anterior) was profiled at both 1 and 4 hours following systemic administration of the β2-AR agonist formoterol, using 46K Illumina(R) Sentrix BeadArrays. Illumina expression profiling revealed significant expression changes in genes associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy, myoblast differentiation, metabolism, circadian rhythm, transcription, histones, and oxidative stress.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from tibialis anterior of mice at 1 or 4 hours following a single intraperitoneal injection of formoterol or saline.
