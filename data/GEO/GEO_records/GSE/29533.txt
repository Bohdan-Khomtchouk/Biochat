SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer often diagnosed only after it has metastasized to distant sites (Meuwissen and Berns 2005; Cooper and Spiro 2006). Despite the need to better understand this disease, SCLC remains poorly characterized at the molecular and genomic levels (Forgacs et al. 2001; Pleasance et al. 2010). Using a genetically-engineered mouse model of SCLC driven by conditional deletion of Trp53 and Rb1 in the lung (Jonkers et al. 2001; Vooijs et al. 2002; Meuwissen et al. 2003; Sage et al. 2003), we identified several frequent, high-magnitude focal DNA copy number alterations in SCLC. We uncovered amplification of a novel, oncogenic transcription factor, Nuclear Factor I/B (Nfib) in the mouse SCLC model and in human SCLC. Functional studies indicate that NFIB regulates cell viability and proliferation during transformation.
