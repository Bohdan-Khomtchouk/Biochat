TITLE
Nuclear Factor I/B is an Oncogene in Small Cell Lung Cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer often diagnosed only after it has metastasized to distant sites (Meuwissen and Berns 2005; Cooper and Spiro 2006). Despite the need to better understand this disease, SCLC remains poorly characterized at the molecular and genomic levels (Forgacs et al. 2001; Pleasance et al. 2010). Using a genetically-engineered mouse model of SCLC driven by conditional deletion of Trp53 and Rb1 in the lung (Jonkers et al. 2001; Vooijs et al. 2002; Meuwissen et al. 2003; Sage et al. 2003), we identified several frequent, high-magnitude focal DNA copy number alterations in SCLC. We uncovered amplification of a novel, oncogenic transcription factor, Nuclear Factor I/B (Nfib) in the mouse SCLC model and in human SCLC. Functional studies indicate that NFIB regulates cell viability and proliferation during transformation.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of two replicates each of two independent mSCLC cell lines (3583T3 and 3151T4) stably expressing Nfib, Mycl1 or both Nfib and Mycl1
