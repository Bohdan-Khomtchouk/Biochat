TITLE
Expression Data from ALDH1+ breast cancer stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide and metastatic dissemination is the principal factor related to death by this disease. Breast cancer stem cells, are thought to be responsible for metastasis and chemoresistance.. In this study, based on whole transcriptome analysis from putative breast CSCs and reverse-engineering of transcription control networks, we were able to identify two networks associated to this phenotype.

DESIGN
Using samples acquired before the chemotherapy, Breast cancer cells from patient were sorted using flow cytometry to select for ALDEFLUORhigh cells. Gene expression profiles of these cells were compared with their matched tumor samples.
