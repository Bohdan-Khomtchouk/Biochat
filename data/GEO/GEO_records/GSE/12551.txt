TITLE
Inducible expression of trichome regulators, GL1 and GL3

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The development of trichomes (leaf hairs) from pluripotent epidermal cells in Arabidopsis provides a powerful system to investigate the regulatory motifs involved in plant cell differentiation. Genetic studies have revealed that a bHLH transcription factor, GL3, activates downstream genes required for trichome initiation by interacting with a R2R3-MYB protein, GL1. In order to investigate genome-wide regulatory functions of GL1 and GL3, we  performed genome-wide expression analyses using GR inducible systems of GL1 and GL3.
