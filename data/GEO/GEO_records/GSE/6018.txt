TITLE
Analyzing the dose-dependence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae global transcriptional response to MMS and IR

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Wt S. cerevisiae cells from a W303 background were exposed to multiple doses of MMS and Gamma Radiation and their global transcriptional response was measured Keywords: dose response

DESIGN
We analyzed 3 doses of MMS and a control no-dose array and 3 doses of Gamma radiation and control no-dose array in triplicate for 24 arrays total

PLATFORM
