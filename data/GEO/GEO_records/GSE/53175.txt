TITLE
Changes in gene expression during epithelial-mesenchymal transition in a breast cancer primary culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is an important process during normal development, but also co-opted by various cancer cells to enable them to invade and form metastases at distant sites. In this study, we examinated  changes in gene expression during EMT in breast cancer using primary culture named BCpc.

DESIGN
Changes in gene expression in primary cells from breast tumour specimen (named BCpc) were analyzed as two-color hybridizations using Agilent Technologies whole human genome 4x44K microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
