TITLE
Lariat sequencing in a unicellular yeast identifies regulated alternative splicing of exons that are evolutionarily conserved with humans

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Here we describe a lariat-sequencing approach, which offers high sensitivity for detecting splicing events, and its application to the unicellular fungus, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, an organism that shares many of the hallmarks of alternative splicing in mammalian systems but for which no previous examples of exon-skipping had been demonstrated. Over 200 previously unannotated splicing events were identified, including examples of regulated alternative splicing.

DESIGN
Total RNA from âˆ†dbr1 S. pombe grown under 41 different conditions, pooled, then run under two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to separate linear from circular RNA. Circular RNA was excised and prepared as a single-end barcoded Illumina sequencing library.

PLATFORM
GPL15167 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Schizosaccharomyces pombe)
