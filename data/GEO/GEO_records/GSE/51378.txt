TITLE
Expression data from wild type (WT) and TREM2 null alveolar macrophages (AM)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TREM-2 has been described to be a phagocytic receptor. We assessed the influence of TREM-2 on gene expression in alveolar macrophages (AM) In this data-set we characterised the differences in basal gene expression using affymetrix mouse 1.0 ST arrays between WT and TREM2-/- AM and observed TREM2 -/- AM to exhibt higher expression of opsonins

DESIGN
4 samples were analysed in biological duplicate (2 x WT and 2 x TREM2-/-)
