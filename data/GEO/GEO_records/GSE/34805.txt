TITLE
High-throughput sequencing of  small RNAs from seedling of Larix leptolepis

ORGANISM
Larix kaempferi

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as essential, albeit poorly characterized, regulators of biological processes. The miRNA in gymnosperms is under-identified, which limits the progress of miRNA in gymnoperms. Using the high-throughput sequencing, a total of 87 conserved miRNAs were identified from Larix leptolepis. Eighteen novel miRNAs were discovered in our library, most of which were Larix-specific miRNAs.
