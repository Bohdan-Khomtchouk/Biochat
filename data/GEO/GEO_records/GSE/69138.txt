TITLE
Epigenome analysis of ischemic stroke patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from 404 ischemic stroke patient cohort, distributed across 3 ischemic stroke subtypes: Large-artery atherosclerosis (n=132), Small-artery disease (n=141) and Cardio embolic (n=127) . Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 404 samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
