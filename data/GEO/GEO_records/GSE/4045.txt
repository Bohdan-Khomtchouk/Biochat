TITLE
Classification of serrated colorectal tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Serrated adenocarcinomas are morphologically different from conventional adenocarcinomas. The serrated pathway has recently been proposed to represent a novel mechanism of colorectal cancer (CRC) formation. However, whether they are biologically different and truly form a distinct subclass of CRC, is not known. This study shows that the gene expression profile of serrated and conventional CRCs differs from each others and that serrated CRCs are not only morphologically novel, but also biologically distinct subclass of CRC. Keywords: molecular classification
