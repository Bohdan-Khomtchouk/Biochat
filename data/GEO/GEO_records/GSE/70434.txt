TITLE
Gene expression data from HEK-293T cells transfected with miR-194 mimics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway plays an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. miR-194 was previously shown to reduce the induction of NF-κB activity upon addition of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). To clarify the molecular mechanism responsible for the effect of miR-194 on NF-κB pathway, mRNA microarray assays were performed to identify the genes that were suppressed by miR-194.

DESIGN
HEK-293T cells transfected with miR-194 mimics were cultured for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix mRNA microarrays. These were compared against the control, which were HEK-293T cells transfected with negative control mimics.
