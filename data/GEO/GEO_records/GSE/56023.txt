TITLE
Expression data from different tissues in different seasons  from P. tomentosa

ORGANISM
Populus tomentosa

SUMMARY
Different fuctional genes have different expression levels in various tissues. Along with the seasons changing, expression level also changes. One-year expression level for functional genes can be indicated by the four seasonal samples and respective time-course change can also be detected. We use microarry chips to study the expression levels for specific genes and explore new functional genes involved in secondary metabolism

DESIGN
Samples from four tissues (bud, root, xylem and phloem) were collected in different seasons in one year. April and May were the months in spring for collecting samples. June and July were the months in summer for collecting samples.  September and October were the months in autumn for collecting samples. December was the month for collecting samples in winter. RNA from each sample was extracted for hybridization.
