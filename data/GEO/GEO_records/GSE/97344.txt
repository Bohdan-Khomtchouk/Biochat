TITLE
Liver fibrosis model of  hepatocyte-specific FOXA2 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver firbrosis model of  hepatocyte-specific FOXA2 knockout mice. Adeno-associated virus AAV8-TBG-Control or AAV8-TBG-Cre was injected via the tail vein of FOXA2flox/flox (FOXA2f/f) mice 2 weeks prior to CCl4 administration. Hepatic fibrosis was induced by injection of CCl4 twice per week for 4 weeks.

DESIGN
Adeno-associated virus AAV8-TBG-Control or AAV8-TBG-Cre was injected via the tail vein of FOXA2flox/flox (FOXA2f/f) mice 2 weeks prior to CCl4 administration. Hepatic fibrosis was induced by injection of CCl4 twice per week for 4 weeks. The mice were sacrificed on the third day after the last injection of CCl4 (0.25ml/kg BW). Total RNA was extracted from primary hepatocytes.
