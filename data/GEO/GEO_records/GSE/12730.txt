TITLE
Mouse gestational protein restriction: Newborn offspring liver and hindleg muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gestational protein restriction is a model for low birth size. We hypothesized that taurine supplementation would protect against changes in newborn liver and muscle caused by a maternal low protein diet.

DESIGN
Pregnant mouse dams were subjected to different diet schemes from day 1 of pregnancy until birth. Pups were killed following birth and liver and hindleg skeletal muscle taken out and frozen at -80C until analysis. Diet schemes: Normal Protein (20% casein; NP), Normal Protein + taurine (1% taurine supplementation in water ad libitum; NP+tau), Low Protein (8% casein; LP) and LP+tau The liver and muscle samples were normalized separately.
