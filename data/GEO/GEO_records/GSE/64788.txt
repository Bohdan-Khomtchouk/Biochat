TITLE
Expression data from different tissues (shoots and roots) of Medicago truncatula exposed to three different types of biosolids amended soil

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
Little progress has been made in studying the toxicity of realistic 'non-pristine' forms of nanoparticles that presents in real soil environment. It is presently unkown whether the transformed nanoparticles in realistic environment exerts an adverse effect to rhizobium-legume symbiosis on molecular level. We used microarray to investigate the toxicogenomic responses of the model legume Medicago truncatula following 30 days exposure to three different types of biosolids (control biosolids (control BS), a mixture of Ag, ZnO and TiO2 manufactured nanomaterials added biosolids (Nano BS) and a corresponding bulk metals added biosolids (Bulk BS) ) amended soil that were aged for 6 months prior to exposure in pot experiment.

DESIGN
Our GenechipÂ® Medicago Genome Array is designed specially to monitor gene expression in Medicago truncatula, Medicago sativa, and the symbiotic organism Sinorhizobium meliloti. For our study, RNA were extracted from shoots and roots of Medicago truncatula that exposure to control, Bulk and Nano BS treatments for 30 days, and used for all hybridization on Affymetrix microarray. The objective of our study is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of toxicity of Nano BS in comparison with their counterpart Bulk BS treatment, using a commercial Medicago truncatula microarrays.
