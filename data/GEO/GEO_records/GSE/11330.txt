SUMMARY
SOX genes encode a family of high-mobility group transcription factors that play critical roles in organogenesis. Virtually all members of SOX family have been found to be deregulated in tumors of various origins. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular behaviours involved in the oncogenic potential of SOX proteins. Cell culture experiments, tissue analysis, and molecular profiling revealed that SOX2 promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis through its transcription regulation of cell cycle related genes in breast cancer cells Keywords: Gene Transfection
