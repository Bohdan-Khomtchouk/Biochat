TITLE
Expression data from MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SOX genes encode a family of high-mobility group transcription factors that play critical roles in organogenesis. Virtually all members of SOX family have been found to be deregulated in tumors of various origins. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular behaviours involved in the oncogenic potential of SOX proteins. Cell culture experiments, tissue analysis, and molecular profiling revealed that SOX2 promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis through its transcription regulation of cell cycle related genes in breast cancer cells Keywords: Gene Transfection

DESIGN
To delineate the molecular mechanism underlying the cell proliferation and tumorigenic properties of SOX2, we investigated the gene expression profile in MCF-7 cells. Briefly, MCF-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 and Human SOX2 expression constructs respectively. 24 hours after transfection, total RNA collected from control and SOX2-overexpressing MCF-7 cells was used to probe Human Genome GeneChip array U133 Plus 2.0
