TITLE
Expression data from 76N human mammary epithelial cells (hMECs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression after knockdown of Ecdysoneless in hMECs

DESIGN
76N cells were treated with control or Ecd siRNA for  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
