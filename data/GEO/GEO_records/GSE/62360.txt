TITLE
FoxM1 is essential for quiescence and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FoxM1, a mammalian Forkhead Box M1 protein, is known as a typical proliferation-associated transcription factor that regulates of G1/S and G2/M transition in the proliferating cells. However, the in vivo function of FoxM1 in adult stem cells remains unknown. Here, we  found that FoxM1 is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and is essential for maintaining quiescence and self-renewal of HSCs in vivo. FoxM1-deficient mice developed leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia with an approximately 6-fold decrease in HSC pool size, which is associated with a failure of G0 cell cycle regulation and increased cell cycling in HSCs.  FoxM1 absence did not affect lineage commitment of HSCs and progenitors. However, FoxM1 loss significantly reduced the repopulating capacity and self-renewal of long-term HSC in a cell-autonomous manner. Mechanistically, FoxM1 loss markedly down-regulates the expression of orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1, known to regulate HSC quiescence.   We found that FoxM1 directly bound the promoter region of Nurr1 and induced transcriptional activity of Nurr1 promoter in vitro, and forced expression of Nurr1 rescued FoxM1-deletion-induced G0 loss of HSC-enriched population in vitro.  Thus, our studies show a previously unrecognized role of FoxM1 as a critical regulator of HSC quiescence and self-renewal by controlling Nurr1-mediated pathways.

DESIGN
The Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) were sorted from FoxM1[fl/fl]  and Tie2-Cre FoxM1[fl/fl] mice, then amplified with OvationÂ® Pico WTA System V2 before microarray analysis. There are 3 samples from FoxM1[fl/fl]mice and 3 samples from  Tie2-Cre FoxM1[fl/fl] mice.
