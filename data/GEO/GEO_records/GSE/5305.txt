TITLE
p68 SMC differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This project investigates the function of p68/p72 in muscle gene expression and skeletal C2C12 cell differentiation. p68/p72 in C2C12 cells cultured in either growth medium (GM) or differentiation medium (DM) was knocked down using shRNA p68/p72 retrovirus, and globle gene expression was profiled using Affymetrix MOE 430A and 430B GeneChip. Keywords: Time-Series
