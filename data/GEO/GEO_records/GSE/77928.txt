TITLE
KDM4A regulated gene expression in human prostate cancer LNCaP cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Histone lysine demethylase KDM4A is overexpressed in prostate cancer and plays a crucial role in tumor growth and survival. To understand the mechanisms underlying KDM4A-depedent cell growth and survival, microarray analysis was performed in LNCaP cells transduced with control or KDM4A specific-knockdown construct. The role of KDM4A in prostate carcinogenesis involves activation of E2F1 and androgen receptor transcriptional profiles.

DESIGN
LNCaP cells were transduced by lentivirus carrying control pLKO.1 (empty vector) or shKDM4A construct (KDM4A-specific shRNA) for three days, followed by RNA extraction. Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays were used for microarray analysis.
