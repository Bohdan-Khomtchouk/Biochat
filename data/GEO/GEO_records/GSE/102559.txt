TITLE
Cooperative and Antagonistic effects on SWI/SNF occupancy following BRG1 loss [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We monitored changes to genomic binding of BRG1, BRM and H3K27ac following BRG1 loss to understand how disuprtion of one member of the SWI/SNF complex affected remaining forms of the complex present in the cell.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq was performed for BRG1, BRM, and H3K27ac in HepG2 cells treated with non-targeting or BRG1 shRNA and processe

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
