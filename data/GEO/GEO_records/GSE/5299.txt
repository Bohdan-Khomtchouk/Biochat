TITLE
Comparison of small medium and large healthy ovarian pig follicles

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Three different stages of pig antral follicles have been studied in a granulosa-cell transcriptome analysis on nylon microarrays (1152 clones). The data have been generated from 7 RNA follicle pools and several technical replicates were made. Four Large, one Medium and two Small follicles pools were considered. For each follicle pool, 2 radioactive labellings were performed. Each membrane was exposed 16 hours (to avoid saturation of the signal of highly expressed genes) and 28 hours (to get some signal from lowly expressed genes). Each probe was hybridised on GPL3971 scag_scai Sus scrofa 1.2K mono array and on GPL3970 scag_scai Sus scrofa 4.6K triplicate array  (except for GFS2172 which was labelled only once and hybridised onto 2  GPL3971 scag_scai Sus scrofa 1.2K mono array membranes), so that 4 spots are available for each gene (and 2 spots for GFS2172), for a given RNA and a given radioactive labelling. Keywords: granulosa-cell transcriptome analysis
