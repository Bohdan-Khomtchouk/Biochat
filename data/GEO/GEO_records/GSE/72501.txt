TITLE
Ro60-knockout cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq of Ro60-null GM12878 cell lines in order to determine the gene expression changes resulting from loss of Ro60.

DESIGN
3 separate clones of Ro60(Trove2)-null cells derived from zinc finger nuclease targeting of exon 2, two wildtype biological replicates, +/- IFNa for 6 hours.
