TITLE
A diet enriched with low or high molecular weight oat beta-glucans on blood inflammatory and oxidative stress status in rats with LPS-induced enteritis

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of a diet enriched with two types of oat beta-glucans on inflammatory and oxidative stress status in blood cells in rats with LPS-induced enteritis

DESIGN
The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effect of low and high molecular weight beta-glucans on chosen immunological parameters, markers of antioxidative potential in rats blood ceels. Experiment was carried out on 72 8-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats: control (n=36) and experimental (n=36). In half of the animals from each group enteritis was induced by LPS (10 mg/kg). Rats from experimental group were divided into two groups receiving high (GI) or low (GII) molecular weight beta-glucans for 6 consecutive weeks. RNA from blood cells were hybridized to Agilent two color microarrays with a common reference. Then, the transcriptomic profile of these cells were compared to the transcriptomic profile of rats received the same control diet and diet enriched with low and high molecular weight beta-glucans.
