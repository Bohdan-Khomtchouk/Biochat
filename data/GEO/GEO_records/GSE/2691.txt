SUMMARY
[Oryza sativa Genome Oligo Set Version 1.0 was designed by Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) and contain 60,727 70mer oligos representing both indica and japonica genomes. All oligos were designed from cDNAs, expreseed sequence tag (EST) sequences, predicted genes of BGI rice genome build and other public resources. Mapping to TIGR rice genome pseudommolecues release 2 is based on the BLAST results, if a oligo has greater than 97% identity to a gene sequence from TIGR pseudomolecules, the oligo represents that gene. Rice 30K Operon Version 1.0 -70 mer oligos. The array is in 48 pin conformation. It has 25 columns and 25 rows in each of 4 x 12 subarrays. This is the slideA of the two slide sets.
