TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq of 346 epithelial cells from the mammary glands of pre-pubescent, pubescent and adult mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammary glands were collected from pre-pubescent (2 weeks old), pubescent (4.7- 4.9 weeks old) and adult (10 week-old) female mice. Freshly sorted epithelial cells were submitted to a Fluidigm C1 System machine for single cell capture and cDNA synthesis. Cells were visualized under a microscope to ensure integrity of the captured single cells prior to cDNA preparation. Libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT kit and sequencing was carried out on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 to achieve 100 bp paired-end reads.

DESIGN
RNA-seq profiling was completed for 144 cells from 8 pre-puberty (2 week old) mice, 136 cells from 8 pubescent (4.7-4.9 week old) mice and 66 cells from 8 adult (10 week old) mice.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
