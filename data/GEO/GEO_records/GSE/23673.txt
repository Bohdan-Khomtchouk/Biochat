TITLE
ZNF703 overexpression and/or knockdown in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The telomeric amplicon at 8p12 is common in ER+ breast cancers. Array-CGH and expression analyses of 1172 tumors revealed ZNF703/Zeppo1 was the single gene within the minimal amplicon and was amplified predominantly in the Luminal B subtype. Amplification was shown to correlate with increased gene and protein expression and was associated with a distinct expression signature and poor outcome. In the luminal MCF-7 cell line manipulation of ZNF703 expression altered transcription of genes also present within the primary tumor signature, including TGFBR2 (whose promoter was bound by ZNF703). Overexpression of ZNF703 rendered MCF-7 cells insensitive to TGFÎ²-induced suppression of mammosphere formation. Forced overexpression of ZNF703 in normal human breast epithelial cells enhanced the frequency of in vitro colony-forming cells from luminal progenitors. Together these data strongly point to ZNF703/Zeppo1 as a novel oncogene in Luminal B breast cancer.

DESIGN
MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was infected with ZNF703 overexpression (ZNF703) or control (HIV) virus and following GFP sorting of infected cells, were transfected with control siRNA (siC) or siRNA against endogenous ZNF703 (siZNF), resulting in four different conditions: siC_HIV, siC_ZNF, siZNF_HIV and siZNF-ZNF. RNA for each condition was harvested from triplicate plates.
