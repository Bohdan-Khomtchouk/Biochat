TITLE
CPD-seq mapping of UV damage formation and repair in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
UV-induced DNA lesions are an important contributor to mutagenesis and cancer, but it is not fully understood how the chromosomal landscape influences UV lesion formation and repair. We have used a novel high-throughput sequencing method to precisely map UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) at nucleotide resolution throughout the yeast genome. Analysis of CPD formation reveals that nucleosomal DNA having an inward rotational setting is protected from CPD lesions. In strongly positioned nucleosomes, this nucleosome 'photofootprint' overrides intrinsic dipyrimidine sequence preferences for CPD formation. CPD formation is also inhibited by DNA-bound transcription factors, in effect protecting important DNA elements from UV damage. Analysis of CPD repair revealed a clear signature of efficient transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Repair was less efficient at translational positions near a nucleosome dyad and at heterochromatic regions in the yeast genome. These findings define the roles of nucleosomes and transcription factors in UV damage formation and repair.

DESIGN
UV mapping data was analyzed for yeast cells irradiated with 125J/m2 and allowed to repair for 0hr (2 samples), 20 minutes, 1 hour, or 2 hours. Data is also included for naked DNA irradiated with UV 60 or 90 J/m2
