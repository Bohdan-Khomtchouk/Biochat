TITLE
Genes differentially regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor in developing skin of the GR knock out and wt embryos.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the transcriptional program by which GR regulates skin development, we performed a microarray analysis using the skin of E18.5 GR-/- and GR+/+ mouse embryos.

DESIGN
RNA from four dorsal skin samples from GR-/- and GR+/+ E18.5 mouse embryos was collected and analyzed using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChips.
