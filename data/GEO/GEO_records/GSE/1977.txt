TITLE
Portrait of transcriptional responses to ultraviolet and ionizing radiation in human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Peripheral blood lymphocytes from a total of 15 healthy individuals without history of cancer (NoCa) were immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus. Cells were exposed to mock treatment (Mock), ultra-violet radiation (UV), or ionizing radiation (IR).  For UV radiation treatment, cells were exposed to 10 J/m^2 and harvested for RNA 24 hours later.  For IR treatment, cells were exposed to 5 Gy of IR and harvested for RNA 4 hours later.  For example, NoCa1-Mock refers to cells from healthy patient 1 exposed to mock treatment.  The published manuscript (NAR 32:4786, 2004) can be found at Data were analyzed with Affymetrix MAS version 4.0. Normalization â€“ A reference data set was generated by averaging the expression of each gene over all data sets. The data for each hybridization were compared with the reference data set in a cube root scatter plot. A linear least-squares fit to the cube root scatter plot was then used to normalize each hybridization. Keywords: repeat sample
