TITLE
Expression Profiling of HL-60 Cells Stimulated by ATRA and DMSO

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stimulation of HL60 progenitor cells with either DMSO (1.25% v/v) or atRA (10E-07M) resulted in their differentiation into neutrophils within six days. Gene expression profiles across 12 600 genes were measured for the differentiation processes induced by DMSO and atRA at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 18 h and daily thereafter until day 7 using oligonucleotide DNA microarrays. Keywords: time course, differentiation, cell fate transitions

DESIGN
The experiment consists of 24 Affymetrix hgu95av2 chips. 12 chips were used for the ATRA-stimulated time course, 12 chips were used for the DMSO-stimulated time course.

PLATFORM
GPL8300 [HG_U95Av2] Affymetrix Human Genome U95 Version 2 Array
