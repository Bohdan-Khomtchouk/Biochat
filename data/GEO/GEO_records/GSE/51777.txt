TITLE
Expression data from Gprc5a wild type or knockout mouse tracheal epithelial cells (MTECs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gprc5a is a lung tumor suppressor gene. Gprc5a-knockout (ko) mice can develop spontaneous lung cancer and Gprc5a-ko mouse model is relevant to human lung cancer. Thus, exploration of the mechanisms underlying lung tumorigenesis in Gprc5a-ko mice would be very helpful for revealing those in human lung cancer. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression profile that underlies oncogenesis by Gprc5a-knockout gene deletion in mouse tracheal epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Wild type and gene-knockout mouse tracheal epithelial cells that were divided into two groups were used for RNA extraction.
