TITLE
5'RNA-seq analysis of soleus, tibialis anterior (TA), diaphragm and left ventricle myocardial tissue from adult wild-type mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We applied a 5'RNA-seq methodology to assess gene and differential isoform expression in striated muscle tissues extracted from adult wild-type mice.

DESIGN
5'RNA-seq analysis of transcriptomes from mouse soleus, tibialis anterior (TA), diaphragm and left ventricle myocardial tissues. Three biological replicates per tissue were pooled into a single sequencing run. 5'RNA-seq methodology consists of enhanced sequencing of 5' ends and computational assessment of changes at start-sites of genes.
