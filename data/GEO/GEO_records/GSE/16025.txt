TITLE
miRNA prognostic profiles in lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is comprised mainly of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), is the cause of 80% of all lung cancer deaths in the US. NSCLC is also associated with a high rate of relapse following clinical treatment and therefore requires robust prognostic markers to better manage therapy options. The aim of this study was to identify miRNA expression profiles in squamous cell carcinoma (SSC) of the lung that would better predict prognosis.

DESIGN
Total RNA from 61 SCC samples and 10 matched normal lung samples was processed for small RNA species and profiled on MirVana miRNA Bioarrays (version 2, Ambion).

PLATFORM
GPL5106 mirVANA miRNA Bioarray V2
