TITLE
The phenylpropanoid pathway is controlled at different branches by a set of R2R3 MYB C2 repressors in grapevine

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
A set of grapevine R2R3 MYB repressors negatively regulate the expression of genes involved in different branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway

DESIGN
For the genetic transformation of Vitis vinifera cv Maccabeu, the in vitro plantlets were grown for 90 days under light and temperature controlled. For overexpression of VvMYBC2-L3 in Vitis vinifera cv Maccabeu hairy roots, the cDNA sequence was transferred into the binary vector pH2GW7 by site-specific recombination. The construct was then inserted into Agrobacterium tumefaciens A4 by electroporation and used for the grapevine transformation. The induction and culture of transgenic HRs in grapevine were performed as described by Torregrosa and Bouquet (1997), with modifications reported in Cutanda-Perez et al. (2009).
