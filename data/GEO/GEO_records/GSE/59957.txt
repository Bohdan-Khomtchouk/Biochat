TITLE
Identification of lncRNA-NTT regulated genes using small interference RNA knockdown for cDNA microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying lncRNA-NTT knockdown We employed small interference RNA (siRNA) and microarray techniques to investigate the effect of NTT silencing on gene expression in HepG2 cells.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were transfected with NTT siRNA (siNTT) or control siRNA (siCon) for 120 h, and then RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We collect siRNA-transfection HepG2 cells and test knockdown efficiency. After comparison of the siCon group then we choose the best three sample for microarray.
