TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of perinatal effect of nitric oxide (NO) donor molsidomine on the kidneys of Fawn-Hooded Hypertensive (FHH) rats at different ages

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Microarray was performed on kidneys in molsidomine-treated FHH rats in order to gain understanding why perinatal treatment with molsidomine in FHH was beneficial in FHH offspring (e.g. lower blood pressure and less renal damage)

DESIGN
In total 62 samples were used. 6 different groups for each gender: 2d, 2w and adult rats with or without molsidomine treatment. Total 12 groups.

PLATFORM
