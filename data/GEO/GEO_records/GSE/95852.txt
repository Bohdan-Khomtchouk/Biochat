TITLE
Gene expression profiles in retinas from miRNA183/182/96 cluster knockout mice versus wild type controls by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retinas from various developmental stages at postnatal p5, p11, and p27 from miRNA183/182/96 cluster knockout mice versus wild type controls were used to prepare total RNA for RNA-sequencing.

DESIGN
Differential mRNA expression between miR183C knockout mice and age matched C57bl6/J control mice was quantified by RNA-seq data analysis using the Tuxedo package (i.e. the Tophat-Cufflinks pipeline)
