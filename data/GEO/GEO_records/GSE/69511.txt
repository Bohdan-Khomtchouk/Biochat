TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Jurkat T-ALL clones from control and CBAP-knockdown/knockout sets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced whole-genome mRNA from 8 different single stable clones of Jurkat cells modified with CBAP gene expression usng shRNA knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout and their controls.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels from individual cell line using high throughput sequencing
