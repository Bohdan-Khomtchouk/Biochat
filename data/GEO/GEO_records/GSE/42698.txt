TITLE
Transcriptional response to aneuploidy in mouse epidermis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptional response to aneuploidy in mouse epidermis. In this study we measured the transcriptional response to aneuploidy by aboragting the spindle checkpoint in mouse epidermis. We found that, whereas spindle checkpoint inactivation in the epidermis is tolerated, but results in metabolic deranged cells, SAC abrogation kills bulge stem cells

DESIGN
Mad2; K14-Cre mice were sacrificed at indicated timepoints and epidermis was separated from dermis using overnight trypsin. RNA was isolated and expression patterns were compared between K14-Cre; Mad2f/f and Cfre negative animals for all timepoints.
