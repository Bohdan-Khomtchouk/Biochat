TITLE
Regulation of the anti-immune response by Chlorella intake during swimming stress in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chlorella has been used as a food supplement and has been reported to have health benefits. We used the forced swimming test to investigate the influence of Chlorella intake during muscle stress training in mice. Swimming time was about two-fold longer for the Chlorella intake mice than for the control mice. Microarray analysis revealed that the global expression profile of muscle from the Chlorella intake mice was similar to that for intact (nonswimming) mice rather than to that for control swimming mice. By contrast, oxidoreductase activity and the leukotriene synthesis pathway were repressed in Chlorella intake mice. According to measurement of the cytokine activities of primary cultures of spleen, Th1 cytokines, such as interferon-g・and interleukin-2, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, such as MIP-1a・ GMCSF, and IP-10, were decreased in control swimming mice, but these cytokines were rescued in the Chlorella intake mice. We suggest that the immune response during muscle training can be repressed by intake of Chlorella.

DESIGN
The intact (nonswimming) and control (swimming) groups were fed normal food, and the Chlorella intake (swimming) group was fed food including 0.5% Chlorella powder. After 14days, the total RNA was isolated from muscle and samples was pooled for each group (n = 10 for each group).
