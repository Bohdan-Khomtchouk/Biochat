TITLE
Host cell gene expression in Influenza A/duck/Malaysia/F119/3/1997 (H5N3) infected A549 cells at 10 hour post infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used the microarray data to analyze host cells response on A549 cells infected with A/duck/Malaysia/F119/3/1997(H5N3)

DESIGN
A/duck/Malaysia/F119/3/1997(H5N3) infected A549 cells were harvested at 10 hpi and RNA extraction was performed using standard protocol as described by Affymetrix. The aim of this experiment is to analyze host response to Influenza A/duck/Malaysia/F119/3/1997(H5N3) infection.
