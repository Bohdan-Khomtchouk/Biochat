TITLE
ChIP from Candida albicans cells (3153A-parental and Sor125(55)-mutant) with H3pan-ac and H4pan-ac

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Sorbose resistant Candida albicans mutant strain [Sor125(55)] derived from parental strain [3153A] has characteristic Ch5 monosomy plus Ch4/7b trisomy. ChIP-chip data showed marked elevation of H4 histone acetylation on monosomic Ch5 in Sor125(55) mutant compared with parental strain (3153A). There was no remarkable diffrence in H4 acetylation level on other chromosomes between those strains and no difference in H3 acetylation on all chromosomes.

DESIGN
Comparison of histone acetylation between mutant strain [Sor125(55), Ch5 monosomy plus Ch4/7b trisomy] and parental strain [3153A]
