TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of adipose tissue from cytoskeletal tropomyosin transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect on global gene regulation in epididymal adipose tissue of overexpressing the cytoskeletal tropomyosin, Tm5NM1 to help understand the transcriptional events that lead to increased fat mass in transgenic mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from epididymal adipose tissue for 3 month old transgenic and non-transgenic control mice.
