TITLE
The gene expression on human hair root

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In HAIR experiment of astronauts, the hair samples are limited to only five strands from each astronaut.  Therefore, it is essential to develop the method to analyze no less than five hair roots.  To achieve this purpose, in this study, we performed the microarray analyses using the extracted RNA from one, five, or ten hair roots.

DESIGN
13 samples from two healthy subjects

PLATFORM
GPL13607 Agilent-028004 SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
