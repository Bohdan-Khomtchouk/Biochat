TITLE
TSA induced gene expression variation on breast cancer cell SKBR3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore TSA influence on human breast cancer cells, we attempt to analyze genes differentially expressed between TSA treated and untreated SKBR3 cells, which will hopefully provide clues for TSA target genes.

DESIGN
Gene expression in human breast cancer cell SKBR3 was measured at 24 hours after treated with 330nM TSA. Three independent experiments were performed at each time using different donors for each experiment.
