TITLE
The gene expression profiles of P4N treated THP-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of P4N treated THP-1 cells at gene expression level. The hypothesis in the present study was that low dose P4N influence the activation of monocyte. Results provide important information of the response of monocyte activation, such as cytokine genes and growth factors genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated  from THP-1 cells treated w/o P4N for 12h.
