TITLE
Integrated analysis of the transcriptome-lipidome reveals the interactions of inositol-choline and SNF1 in controlling lipid biosynthesis

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Characterize the transcriptional response to inositol-choline and snf1

DESIGN
We used microarrays to capture the global responses of inositol-choline concentration and snf deletion in Carbon and Nitrogen limited growth
