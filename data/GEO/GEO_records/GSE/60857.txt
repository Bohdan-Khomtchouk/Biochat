TITLE
Coordinate Regulation of Enhancer Transcription at Super-Enhancers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using GRO-Seq, we find extensive regulation of enhancer RNAs (eRNA) within super-enhancers in response to lipopolysaccharide treatment in macrophages.  Both activation and repression of gene expression are associated with super-enhancers and eRNA transcription dynamics. Treatment of macrophages with LPS targeted specific super-enhancers by attenuating their eRNA expression, leading to expression of key inflammatory genes.  We propose that super-enhancers function as molecular rheostats integrating the binding profiles of key regulators to produce dynamic profiles of gene expression.

DESIGN
Nascent transcriptome (GRO-Seq) analysis over a time course (0, 20, 60, 180 min) of Lipopolisaccharide signaling in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages.
