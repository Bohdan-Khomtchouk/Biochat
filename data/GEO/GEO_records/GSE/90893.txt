TITLE
Cooperative binding of Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 with stage-specific transcription factors orchestrates reprogramming [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc (OSKM) reprogram somatic cells to pluripotency. To gain a mechanistic understanding of their function, we mapped OSKM-binding, stage-specific transcription-factors (TFs), and chromatin-states in discrete reprogramming stages and performed loss- and gain-of-function experiments. We found that early in reprogramming OSK extensively bind somatic-enhancers and initiate their decommissioning by recruiting Hdac1. Concurrently, OSK engage other sites, including specific pluripotency-enhancers, and induce the relocation of somatic TFs to these sites and away from somatic-enhancers, extending somatic-enhancer decommissioning genome-wide. Pluripotency-enhancer selection early in reprogramming occurs predominantly at sites with high OSK-motif densities and requires collaborative binding by OSK. Most pluripotency-enhancers are selected later and occupied by OS and stage-specific-TFs like Esrrb. Overexpression of stage-specific-TFs influences reprogramming efficiency by changing OSK-occupancy, somatic-enhancer decommissioning, and pluripotency-enhancer selection. We propose that collaborative interactions among OSK and with stage-specific-TFs direct both somatic-enhancer decommissioning and pluripotency-enhancer selection, which drives the enhancer reorganization underlying reprogramming
