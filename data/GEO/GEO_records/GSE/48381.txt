TITLE
ChIp-Chip using RNAP II, CREB C/EBPb and cJun antibody in undifferentiated or differentiated keratinocytes (ChIP-Chip)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Combinatorial recruitment of CREB, C/EBPb and Jun determines activation of promoters upon keratinocyte differentiation Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of RNAP II, CREB C/EBPb and cJun in undifferentiated or differentiated keratinocytes demonstrate recruitment of RNAP II to promoters bound by combination of specific transcription factors

DESIGN
comparison of undifferentiated and differentated keratinocytes
