TITLE
ChIp-Chip using RNAP II, CREB C/EBPb and cJun antibody in undifferentiated or differentiated keratinocytes (ChIP-Chip)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Combinatorial recruitment of CREB, C/EBPb and Jun determines activation of promoters upon keratinocyte differentiation Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of RNAP II, CREB C/EBPb and cJun in undifferentiated or differentiated keratinocytes demonstrate recruitment of RNAP II to promoters bound by combination of specific transcription factors

DESIGN
comparison of undifferentiated and differentated keratinocytes

PLATFORM
GPL3793 Nimblegen Mouse 1.5 kb promoter array [2006-11-16_MM5_min_promoter]
