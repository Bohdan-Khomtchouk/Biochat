TITLE
Targeted transcriptome analysis of the SigB regulon in Bacillus subtilis

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Bacillus subtilis is exposed to a wide range of transitory stress and starvation conditions. Here we investigate the expression changes observed in the B. subtilis wild type strain 168 and its isogenic sigB mutant(BSM29) with respect to each stress condition tested.

DESIGN
Gene expression was queried for the stress conditions: ethanol-, butanol-, osmotic- and oxidative stress, heat shock, low temperature growth, glucose as well as oxygen limitation. For butanol-, ethanol-, osmotic-, and oxidative stress as well as heat shock : time points (0min, 5min, 10min, 15min and 20min) ; for glucose limitation and oxygen limitation : time points (0min, 15min, 30min, 45min, 60min or 90min) and for low temperature growth, samples for recording of expression values were taken during mid-exponential growth at OD540 0.9 and 1.0.
