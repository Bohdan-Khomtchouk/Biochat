TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata after Alternaria alternata infection

ORGANISM
Nicotiana attenuata

SUMMARY
To understand the transcriptome changes of source-sink transition leaves after infection of Alternaria alternata at 1 dpi

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of source-sink stransition leaves at 1 dpi/ mock 1 d were generated by deep sequencing,  using Illumina Hiseq2000.
