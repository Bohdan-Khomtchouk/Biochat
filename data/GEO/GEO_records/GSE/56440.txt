TITLE
Expression data from mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes under berberine treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression under berberine treatment in 3T3-L1 adipocytes

DESIGN
3T3-L1 cells were induced into differentiated adipocytes and then treated with 5Î¼M berberine for 3h, 6h or 12h for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the change of gene expressions under such treatment.
