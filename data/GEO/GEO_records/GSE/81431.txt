TITLE
Effect of timed sleep restriction on transcriptome rhythms in the MBH of mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Timed sleep restriction designed to mimic human shift work was performed over a 2 week period in mice. On the final day, MBH biopsies were collected at 6 hour intervals to exmaine the effects of sleep restriction on circadian gene expression. (MBH = mediobasal hypothalamus)

DESIGN
3 mice were used at each time point, for both controls and sleep restricted (TSR) groups

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
