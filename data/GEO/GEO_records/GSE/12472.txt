TITLE
A COPD-related gene expression signature in squamous cell lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and squamous cell lung carcinoma (SCC) are both smoking-related diseases. Interestingly, COPD itself is a risk factor for SCC, and this is independent of smoking history. Inferring from this knowledge, it is plausible to assume that patients with COPD may have a different gene expression profile in normal bronchial epithelium and in SCC. To test this hypothesis, we compared gene expression profiles in bronchial epithelium and in SCC from patients with and without COPD. Gene expression profiles were generated using whole human genome oligo microarrays for 28 laser microdissected histologically normal bronchial epithelium samples (10 without COPD, 18 with COPD) and 35 laser microdissected SCC samples (17 without COPD, 18 with COPD). We found no significant differences in gene expression levels between normal bronchial epithelium from patients with and without COPD. Remarkably, 374 genes were differentially expressed in SCC obtained from patients with or without COPD; 295 showed a higher expression level in SCC from patients with COPD and 79 genes showed higher expression levels in SCC from patients without COPD. Genes related to mitochondrial localization (n=44) and genes located on chromosomal arm 5q (n=34) were significantly overrepresented. For both categories, all genes showed a higher expression level in SCC from patients with COPD than from those without COPD. In conclusion, SCC from patients with COPD show a different gene expression profile compared to SCC from patients without COPD. This suggests that COPD related factors affect the gene expression signature in SCC.
