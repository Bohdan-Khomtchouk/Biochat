TITLE
Global expression data  from HCT-8 human colorectal cancer (CRC) wild type cells (HCT8/WT) and its 5-FU-induced resistant cell line (HCT8/5-FU)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Complete growth medium RPMI-1640 which contains 10% FCS, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin Solution was used for cell culture. Both cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. MTT assay was performed to determine the 5 ‑ FU resistance in both of HCT-8/WT and HCT-8/5-FU cell line.

DESIGN
CRC wild type cell (HCT8/WT) and its 5-FU-induced resistant cell line (HCT8/5-FU) , both of which were treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for 0, 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Three biological replicates of each condition were used for the microarray experiment.
