TITLE
New transgenic mouse lines for selectively targeting astrocytes and for studying calcium signals in astrocyte processes in situ and in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Khakh laboratory developed and characterized a new Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 transgenic mouse line to selectively target astrocytes in vivo. Crosses with RiboTag mice allowed sequencing of actively translated mRNAs and analyses of the cortical astrocyte transcriptome from adults.

DESIGN
Cortices were extraced from 4 young adult (~P80) male and female Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 x Ribotag mice. After homogenization, RNA was purified from (i) cleared lysate as the input and control, and (ii) astrocyte-specific ribosome-associated RNA precipitated via a hemagglutinin (HA) tag.
