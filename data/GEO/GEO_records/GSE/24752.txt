TITLE
Microarray Analysis of differential gene expression in peripheral blood cells of patients with human essential hypertension

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The polygenic nature of essential hypertension and its dependence on environmental factors pose a challenge for biomedical research. We hypothesized that microarray analysis of differential gene expression in peripheral blood cells would distinguish patients with hypertension from normotensive controls. We utilized microaaray analysis of differential gene expression in peripheral blood cells to identify differences in transcription profile of human essential hypertension compared with normotensive volunteers.

DESIGN
Samples were pooled from participants who met with our recruitment criteria for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix Gene Chips Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Experiments were performed at CapitalBio Corporation (Beijing, China)
