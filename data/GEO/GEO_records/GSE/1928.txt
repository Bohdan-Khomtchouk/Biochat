TITLE
acute genes during CNS injury and their expression in cultured astrocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A robust set of CNS transcript changes was defined by comparing microarray data that describe the injury response of the rat retina [Vazquez-Chona et al., IOVS 2004; GSE1001], brain [Matzilevich et al., J Neurosci Res 2002; GSE1911], and spinal cord [Di Giovanni et al., Ann Neurol 2003; GDS63]. We determined the CNS injury genes that were expressed in cultured astrocytes from rat cortex [GSM34300] and from human optic nerve head [Yang et al., Physiol Genomics 2004; GDS532].
