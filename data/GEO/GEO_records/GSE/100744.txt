TITLE
Sparus aurata transcriptomic data comparing long-term starvation and feeding with three diets differing in the macronutrient composition

ORGANISM
Sparus aurata

SUMMARY
Agilent custom-made 8x60k 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray slides were used, covering unique sequences (21,093 annotated sequences and 4,299 unannotated sequences) of Sparus aurata transcriptomic data obtained from assembling of reads deposited in the NCBI SRA database corresponding to BioProject ID PRJNA391557, together with controls (8 transcripts of Sparus aurata plus Agilent controls). Two probes per sequence were used (in sense orientation for annotated sequences).

DESIGN
A double loop hybridisation with dye swap (Cy3/Cy5) experimental design was performed. For two tissues (liver and skeletal muscle), four conditions were analysed: long-term starvation and feeding with three diets differing in the macronutrient composition: HLL, MHL and LLH. For each condition, four samples were used (n = 4).
