TITLE
A Window of Opportunity Study of Valproic Acid in Breast Cancer Testing a Gene Expression Biomarker

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Valproic acid(VPA) has anti-cancer activity attributed to histone deacetylase inhibition(HDACi). We published the Genomicallyâ€“Derived Sensitivity Signature for VPA(GDSS-VPA), a gene expression biomarker predicting breast cancer sensitivity to VPA in vitro and in vivo.  We conducted a window-of-opportunity study examining the tolerability of VPA and the ability of the GDSS-VPA to predict biologic changes in breast tumors from VPA. Methods: Eligible women had untreated breast cancer with breast tumors over 1.5 cm.  After a biopsy, women took VPA for 7-12 days, increasing from 30mg/kg/day PO divided BID to a maximum of 50mg/kg/day.  After VPA treatment, serum VPA level was measured followed by breast surgery or a biopsy.  Tumor proliferation was assessed by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMCs) histone acetylation was assessed by Western blot. Results:  Thirty women were evaluable.  The median age was 54(range 31-73).  52% of women tolerated 50mg/kg/day, but 10% missed more than two doses due to adverse events(AEs).  Grade 3 AEs included one patient with vomiting and diarrhea and one with fatigue.  The end serum VPA level correlated with change in PBMC histone acetylation(rho=0.451, p=0.024).  50% of women with triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC) had a Ki-67 reduction of at least 10%, compared with 17% of other women.   GDSS-VPA correlated with a Ki-67 decrease of at least 10%(AUC 0.66). Conclusions:  Most women tolerate VPA. VPA treatment caused a decrease in proliferation of breast tumors. The genomic biomarker correlated with decreased proliferation. HDACi is a valid strategy for drug development in TNBC using gene expression biomarkers.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from breast tumors before and after treatment for 7-12 days with valproic acid
