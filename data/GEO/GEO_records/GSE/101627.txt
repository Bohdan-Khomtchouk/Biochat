TITLE
Effects of Inhibition of CDK8/19 Mediator Kinase by Senexin A in HEK293 cells treated with TNF-alpha  II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have investigated the effects of CDK8/19 inhibitor Senexin A on NFκB-mediated transcription, induced by a canonical NFκB activator, TNFα.

DESIGN
HEK293 cells were pre-treated with or without 5 μM Senexin A for 1 hour, followed by treatment with or without 10 ng/ml TNFα for different time period.
