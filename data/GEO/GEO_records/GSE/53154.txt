TITLE
Imatinib treatment causes substantial transcriptional changes in adult Schistosoma mansoni in vitro exhibiting pleiotropic effects

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of  Imatinib-treated paired adult S. mansoni vs. Non-treated (control) paired adult S. mansoni during 24 and 48 hours

DESIGN
Two conditions (Imatinib-treated vs. Non-treated ) for each time of treatment (24 hours and 48 hours) with three biological samples of each conditions. For each biological sample (three Imatinib-treated and three Non-treated for each time of treatment) were performed two technical replicas.
