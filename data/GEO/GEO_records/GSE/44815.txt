TITLE
DOCK8 is critical for the survival and function of NKT cells [NKT_CD103+]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of DOCK8 deficient animals revealed a novel marker of NKT cell development, the integrin CD103. The role of CD103 was further investigated by RNA microarray comparing CD103 negative versus positive NKT cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 3 biological replicates of thymic, CD103positive NKT cells and compared using an Illumina microarray to CD103negative NKT cells.
