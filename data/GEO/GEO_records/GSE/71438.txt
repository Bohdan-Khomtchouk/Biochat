TITLE
Genome-wide tissue gene expression profiling in 1 year old Göttingen Minipigs with customized NimbleGen microarrays

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Minipigs resemble many features of human anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry and represent an animal model for drug efficacy and safety testing. To evaluate at the molecular level the expression of drug targets, drug metabolism pathways or general features of organ transcriptomes in minipigs, we used Customized NimbleGen Microarrays (Design-ID:  120229_MiniPig_TH_expr_HX12) for genome-wide gene expression profiling on 18 different tissues from 6 male and 6 female Göttingen minipigs. The gene expression results analyzed in this study are further described in Heckel T. et al. (2015) Functional analysis and transcriptional output of the Göttingen minipig genome. under submission

DESIGN
A NimbleGen customized 12x135K Gene Expression Array [design ID: 120229_MiniPig_TH_expr_HX12] study using total RNA recovered from drug-naive minipig tissues. Each microarray measures the expression level of 24,499 probe sets covering 17,261 genes with five 60-mer probes (PM) per probe set. The number of replicates is 1 - i.e., only one set of probes on the array. The design includes 16,642 random GC probes for the estimation of the signal threshold and 1536 ERCC control probes.
