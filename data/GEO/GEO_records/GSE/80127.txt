TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic analysis of Gardnerella vaginalis biofilms versus planktonic cultures using RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Gardnerella vaginalis AMD

SUMMARY
Bacteria assume distinct lifestyles during the planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. In biofilms, they are more tolerant to antibiotics and can evade the immune system response more effectively. However, little is known regarding the molecular determinants involved in biofilm formation by Gardnerella vaginali, the predominant species found in bacterial vaginosis (BV). Hence, to gain insight into the pathogenesis of G. vaginalis, we carried out a comparative transcriptomic analysis between planktonic and biofilm phenotypes, using RNA-sequencing. The major alterations observed were related with the transcription of genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and typical stress factors, in which was found significantly up-regulated in biofilms, resulting in a protected mode of bacterial growth. In addition, biofilm phenotype was characterized by low metabolic activity, which is appropriate to guarantee long term survival during BV recurrence.
