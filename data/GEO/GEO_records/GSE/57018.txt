TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) were investigated in adult Chinese patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and these patients were screened for adult ALL prognostic genes.The most frequent CNVs are gain at chr13q, loss at chr6 and recurrent LOH at chr17p and 1p33. In Ph- B-ALL patients, the most frequent CNVs are gain at chr7, loss at chr9p and recurrent LOH at chr15q. In T-ALL, the most frequent CNVs are gain at chr20 and 7q, loss at chr2p and recurrent LOH also at chr15q.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from cryopreserved bone marrow samples. Copy number analysis of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays was performed for 33 newly diagnosis adult ALL samples, 11 paried complete remission(CR) ALL samples and 1 relapse ALL. There are also 5 healthy donor samples which were used as references for copy number inference.
