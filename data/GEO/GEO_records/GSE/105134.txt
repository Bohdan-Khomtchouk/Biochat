TITLE
Expression analysis of microRNA  by expression microarrays  of breast cancer derived from the Cancer Institute Hospital of Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed the expression microarray experiments for miRNA of breast cancer tissue.

DESIGN
microRNA were extracted from primary tumor of 50 breast cancer patients, hybridized and scanned with Agilent miRNA Complete Hybri kit Arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL10850 Agilent-021827 Human miRNA Microarray (V3) (miRBase release 12.0 miRNA ID version)
