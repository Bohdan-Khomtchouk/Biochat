TITLE
The Dynamics of Diverse Segmental Amplifications in Populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Adapting to Strong Selection

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Population adaptation to strong selection can occur through the sequential or parallel accumulation of competing beneficial mutations. The dynamics, diversity and rate of fixation of beneficial mutations within and between populations are still poorly understood. To study how the mutational landscape varies across populations during adaptation, we performed experimental evolution on seven parallel populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae continuously cultured in limiting sulfate medium. By combining qPCR, array CGH, restriction digestion and CHEF gels, and whole genome sequencing, we followed the trajectory of evolution to determine the identity and fate of beneficial mutations. Over a period of 200 generations, the yeast populations displayed parallel evolutionary dynamics that are driven by the coexistence of independent beneficial mutations. Selective amplifications rapidly evolve under this selection pressure, in particular common inverted amplifications containing the sulfate transporter gene SUL1. Compared to single clones, detailed analysis of the populations uncovers a greater complexity whereby multiple subpopulations arise and compete despite a strong selection. The most common evolutionary adaptation to strong selection in these populations grown in sulfate limitation is determined by clonal interference, with adaptive variants both persisting and replacing one another.

DESIGN
These are CGH arrays.  Each experiment compares the DNA content of an experimentally evolved strain with its ancestor.
