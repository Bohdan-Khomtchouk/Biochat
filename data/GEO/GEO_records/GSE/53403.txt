TITLE
Expression data from mouse adipose tissue macrophage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In mammals, expansion of adipose tissue mass induces accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). We isolated CD11c- (FB) and CD11c+ (FBC) perigonadal ATMs from SVCs of lean (C57BL/6J Lep +/+) and obese leptin-deficient (C57BL/6J Lep ob/ob) mice. We used expression microarrays to generate transcription profiles of perigonadal ATMs from lean (C57BL/6J Lep +/+) and obese (C57BL/6J Lep ob/ob) mice. Profiling purified FBs and FBCs, we identified 521 transcripts whose expression was differentially (nominal p-value < 0.01) expressed between FBs from lean and obese mice and 1509 genes whose expression was differentially (nominal p-value < 0.01) expressed between FBC from lean and obese mice

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from sorted FBC (F4/80+, CD11b+, CD11c+) cells and FB ( F4/80+, CD11b+, CD11c-) cells and using RNeasy micro-kits (Qiagen), using a PicoPure RNA isolation kit then amplified two-rounds. Labeled cRNA Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays (purified FB and FBC adipose tissue macrophages.  There was a total of sixteen samples. FB and FBC populations were isolated from 4 lean and 4 obese mice.
