TITLE
Transcriptome analyses using the Chen Lab Cotton 25k oligo microarray

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
The chip of cotton oligonucleotide microarrrays, which contain ~23,000 UniGenes from our own ESTs sequence project (Gossypium hirsutum L. TM-1 immature ovules (GH_TMO) ) and open resources, was developed. Transcriptome analyses were performed to compare gene expression changes in laser capture microdissected (LCM) fiber cell initials (or epidermis) and inner ovules. The gene expression profiles of the fiber cell initials were compared with those of the inner ovules in each developmental stage prior to (-2DPA), right at (0DPA), and shortly after the initiation of fiber cells (2DAP and 7DPA). Many genes in various molecular functions or biological processes were over- or under-represented between fibers and non-fiber tissues in each developmental stage, suggesting temporal regulation of gene expression during early stages of fiber development.

DESIGN
For gene expression studies using a large set cotton oligo-microarray, 4 developmental stages were chosen. To study differential expression during fiber initiation, ovules at -2 DPA, 0 DPA, and 2 DPA were used. One of the fiber elongation stage tissues (7 DPA) was included. In each developmental stage, epidermis was separated from inner ovules and subjected to the hybridization. In addition, epidermis and ovule comparisons were performed individually with 0 DPA as a control point for comparison.
