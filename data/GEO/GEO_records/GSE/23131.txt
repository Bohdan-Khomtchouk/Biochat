TITLE
Intrinsic differentiation potential of human postnatal MSC, Mab and MAPC reflected in their transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes that characterize different populations of human postnatal stem cells and reflect their potency

DESIGN
MSC, Mab and MAPC cultures were established from at least three different donors and their transcriptome was assayed using the Agilent 4x44k whole human genome microarray; furthermore, the H9 ESC line from U of Wisconsin and MSC from Lonza were added for comparison MSC = Mesenchymal Stem Cells, MAPC= Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells, Mab= Mesoangioblasts, ESC= Embryonic Stem Cells
