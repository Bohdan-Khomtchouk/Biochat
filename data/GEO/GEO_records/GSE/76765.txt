TITLE
Tumor Cell Survival Dependence on the DExH-Box Helicase DHX9

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ATP-dependent DExH/D-box helicase DHX9 is a key participant in a number of gene regulatory steps, including transcriptional, translational, microRNA-mediated control, DNA replication, and maintenance of genomic stability. DHX9 has also been implicated in maintenance of the tumorigenic process and in drug response. Here, we report that inhibition of DHX9 expression is lethal to multiple human and mouse cancer cell lines. In contrast, using a novel conditional shDHX9 mouse model, we demonstrate that sustained and prolonged suppression of DHX9 is well tolerated at the organismal level. Our results demonstrate a robust tolerance for DHX9 knockdown in non-transformed cells and supports the targeting of DHX9 as an effective and specific chemotherapeutic approach.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression in large intestine of mice with or without reduced expression of DHX9.
