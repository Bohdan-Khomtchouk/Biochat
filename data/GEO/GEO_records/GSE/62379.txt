TITLE
Chromatin decondensation is sufficient to alter nuclear organization in embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Determination of the specificity of activation by Ptn (TALE) fusion constructs transfected into mES cells by genome-wide expression analysis.

DESIGN
Polyadenylated mRNA was prepared from mouse ES cells transfected with either eGFP, Ptn(TALE)VP64, Ptn(TALE)DEL or Ptn(TALE)Delta. 4 replicate hybridisations were prepared for each sample representing 2 biological and two technical replicates. RNA was extracted 48 post-transfection.
