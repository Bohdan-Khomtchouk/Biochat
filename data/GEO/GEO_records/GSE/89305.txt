TITLE
Transcriptional responses of Rhizopus microsporus host and non-host isolates to physical interaction with Burkholderia endobacteria of the host

ORGANISM
Rhizopus microsporus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify fungal gene expression changes during early stages of symbiosis establishment with its Burkholderia endosymbionts. Results: Leveraging this RNA-seq dataset we identified fungal genes utilized for symbiosis establishment with bacteria.

DESIGN
Methods: Host (ATCC 52813) and non-host (ATCC 11559) isolates of R. microsporus were growth alone or in the presence of Burkholderia endobacteria isolated from the host isolate. Fungal mycelia were harvested at a timepoint when the fungal colony has just begun to come into physical contact with the bacteria. Total RNA was extracted, rRNA depleted with RiboZero, and sequenced on the Illumina Hi-Seq 100bp-paired end reads platform
