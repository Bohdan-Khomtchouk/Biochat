TITLE
G-Quadruplex structures are stable and detectable in human genomic DNA.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The G-quadruplex is an alternative DNA structural motif that is considered to be functionally important in the mammalian genome. Herein, we address the hypothesis that G-quadruplex structures can exist within double-stranded genomic DNA using a G-quadruplex-specific probe. An engineered antibody is employed to enrich for DNA containing G-quadruplex structures, followed by deep sequencing to detect and map G-quadruplexes at high resolution in genomic DNA from human breast adenocarcinoma cells. Our high sensitivity structure-based pull-down strategy enables the isolation of genomic DNA fragments bearing a single as well as multiple G-quadruplex structures. Stable G-quadruplex structures are found in sub-telomeres, gene bodies and gene regulatory regions. For a sample of identified target genes, we show that G-quadruplex stabilizing ligands can modulate transcription. These results confirm the existence of G-quadruplex structures and their persistence in human genomic DNA.

DESIGN
Four independent libraries have been enriched in DNA G-quadruplex structures using a G-quadruplex-specific probe. One genomic input library was sequenced as control. Deep-sequencing of these libraries allowed the mapping of G-quadruplexes on the genome.
