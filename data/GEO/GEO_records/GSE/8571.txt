TITLE
Comparison of B. japonicum 110spc4 (wild type) induced versus uninduced

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium japonicum

SUMMARY
An initializing step in the rhizobia-legume symbiosis is the secretion of flavonoids by plants that leads to the expression of nodulation genes in rhizobia. Here we report the genome-wide transcriptional response of Bradyrhizobium japonicum to genistein, an isoflavone secreted by soybean. About 100 genes were induced in the wild type. This included all nod box-associated genes, the flagellar cluster and several genes that are likely to be involved in transport processes. To elucidate the role of known regulators, we analysed mutant strains. This revealed that the two-component response regulator NodW is essential for induction of almost all genistein-inducible genes, with the exception of 8 genes. The phenotype of the nodW mutant could be partially suppressed by overexpression of NwsB, which is also a two-component response regulator. These data indicate that genistein has a much broader function than mere induction of nod genes. Keywords: transcriptional analysis, genistein induction

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of wild type uninduced and wild type induced with genistein were compared.
