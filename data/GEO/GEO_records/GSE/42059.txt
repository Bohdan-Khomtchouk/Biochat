TITLE
viromouv-Analysis of the genic expression modifications of Arabidopsis Companion cells infected by plants viruses

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra10-02_viromouv - viromouv - transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis Companion cells after infection by plants viruses - Transgenic plants expressing GFP under the control of a companion cell specific promoter were infected by two different viruses: LMV and TuYV. Companion cell protoplasts from these plants were sorted by FACS and extracted RNA were compared to healthy companion cell protoplasts.

DESIGN
10 dye-swap - normal vs disease comparison

PLATFORM
GPL9553 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 34.6K CATMA_v5
