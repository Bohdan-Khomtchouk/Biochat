TITLE
Expression data from rat adult and pups heart and hippocampal tissue.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To assess in order to assess potential disparities in gene expression due to developmental differences we performed a comparison between hippocampus and heart tissues from rat and mouse pup (one week old) and adult (10 week old) animals.

DESIGN
Using heart and hippocampal tissue from mouse  (C57BL/6) and rat (Sprague Dawley) we investigate via microarrays, gene expression divergence at the tissue level between a Brain and a Non-brain tissue. We also investigated any developement difference in gene expression between pups and adult animals. For the pups samples we used 3 biological replicates and for the adult samples we used 2 biological replicates with 2 technical replicates for each.
