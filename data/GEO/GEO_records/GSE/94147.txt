TITLE
Human Adult Sorted Live Cell Erythroblasts transduced with Sigma non-targeting shRNA negative control (SHC002V) with puromycin selection RNAseq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Erythroblasts cultured from mobilized CD34+ cells from six healthy adult human donors were used to generate an erythroblast transcriptome transduced with Sigma non-targeting shRNA negative control . Cellular maturation was maintained including enucleation.  On culture day 14 total RNA was isolated (see PMID: 23798711 for details). These RNA-Seq profiles were generated after flow cytometric sorting (live cell gating of culture Day 14 erythroblasts according to forward and side scatter). We would like to thank Gerard Bouffard and the National Human Genome Research Institute for their expertise and assistance with RNA-seq.

DESIGN
Human CD34+ cells from health donor transduced with lentivirus expressing Sigma non-targeting shRNA negative control in serum free culture.  RNA extracted from sorted live cell gate on Day 14 using Qiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit.  1ug of RNA was used for library construction and Ribo depletion with globin subtraction.
