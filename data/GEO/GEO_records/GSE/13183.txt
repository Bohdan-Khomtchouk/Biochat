TITLE
Effect of AICAR and SAICAR accumulation on global transcription (second part)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of AICAR and SAICAR accumulation on transcriptional regulation of purine biosynthesis and other metabolic pathways. These data were compared to those obtained in the ade16ade17 vs WT data set to determine the transcriptional effects associated to AICAR/SAICAR accumulation and those due to ade16 and ade17 deletions. In this work, global transcription analyses were combined to measurements of intracellular nucleotides pools by HPLC Keywords: Comparative genomic transcription analysis on total RNA from cells accumulating or lacking AICAR and SAICAR nucleotide derivatives.
