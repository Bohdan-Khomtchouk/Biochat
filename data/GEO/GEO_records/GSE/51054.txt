TITLE
Gene expression profiles of E8.5, E9.5 and E11.5 kidney precursors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Understanding processes how the early stage kidney precursor gives rise to metanephric mesenchyme, which is a committed progenitor cells of adult kidney is important for the regeneration of kidney in vitro. The combination of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of global gene expression profiles of the developing kidney precursors. Those gene expression data provides insights into not only the stage specific marker genes but also the signals working in each population, which should be informative for the directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells in vitro.

DESIGN
Osr1-GFP knock-in mice were used to isolate kidney precursor cells from embryos at E8.5, E9.5 and E11.5. At E9.5 and E11.5 embryos, to identify the differences between nephron progenitors and surrounding mesenchyme, nephron progenitor populations were further enriched by gating Osr1-GFP positive Integrin alpha8 positive Pdgfr alpha negative population and compared with Osr1-GFP positive cells other than that gate. RNA was isolated from cells and the gene expression profiles were determined by microarrays.
