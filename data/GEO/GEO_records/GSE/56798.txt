TITLE
Expression data during plantaris muscle regrowth following two weeks of hind limb suspension in young adult mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression patterns were determined from microarray results on day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 during plantaris muscle regrowth following two weeks of hind limb suspension in young adult mice (5 months).

DESIGN
For each time point, one Affymetrix chip (Mouse Gene 1.0 ST) was used with 100 ng of total RNA derived from a pooled sample of the left plantaris muscle from six animals.

PLATFORM
