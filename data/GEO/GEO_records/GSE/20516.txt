TITLE
Expression array for Trichoderma atroviride in mycoparasitic interaction with Rhizoctonia solani

ORGANISM
Trichoderma atroviride ; Rhizoctonia solani

SUMMARY
A self-designed Trichoderma high density oligonuclotide (HDO) microarray  (Roche-NimbleGen, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) was constructed in a similar way  than a previous Trichoderma HDO microarray (Samolski et al., 2009). The  microarray was composed of 392,779 60-mer probes designed against 13,443  EST-derived transcripts (Trichochip-1) and the genomes of T. atroviride (11,100 genes) and T.  virens (11,643 genes). The Trichochip-1 ESTs were obtained from 28 cDNA libraries from eight different species (representing the biodiversity of this genus: T. harzianum, T. atroviride, T. asperellum, T. viride, T. longibrachiatum, T. virens, T. stromaticum and T. aggresivum)  under a wide range of growth conditions, including biocontrol-related conditions and different nutritional situations (Vizcaíno et al., 2006). The Trichochip1 EST database was generated in the TrichoEST project funded by the EU (QLK3-CT-2002-02032)

DESIGN
T. atroviride P1 mycelium grown (approximately for 24h) at 25ºC on a cellophane sheet on PDA (Difco) plates before contact (at a distance of 5 mm) a R. solani colony grown under identical conditions in the same plate was compared with T. atroviride P1 mycelium after contact (5 mm) the above R. solani colony (mycoparasitic interaction). RNAs from both conditions were extracted and the corresponding cDNAs were use to hybridize by triplicate the Trichoderma HDO microarray.
