TITLE
Effect of tenascin C on brain tumor initiating cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have determined that tenascin C (TNC) regulates the growth of human brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs). We have identified novel mechanisms by which TNC regulates BTIC growth. Analysis of the array data identified a number of genes that were altered with TNC treatment that could potentially regulate BTIC growth. The study provides the mechanistic basis for the regulation of BTIC growth with TNC.

DESIGN
We subjected one BTIC line to microarray analysis to identify genes involved in the regulation of BTIC growth. To determine the effect of TNC on BTIC gene expression, BTIC cells (BT025 cells) were treated with TNC for 6h and subjected to microarray analysis. Three (3) control and 3 treatment (TNC treated) samples were generated from BT025 line. Thus, a total of 6 RNA samples from BT025 line were obtained for microarray analysis.
