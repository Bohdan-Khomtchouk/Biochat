TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Analysis of Wild Type and fl3 Transcriptomes in 10DAP(day after pollination) endosperm

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Maize floury3 (fl3) is a classic semi-dominant mutant that shows severe defects in the endosperm but appears normal in the plant.The goals of this study are to compare WT to fl3 transcriptomes in 10DAP(day after pollination) endosperm by Next Generation Sequencing.

DESIGN
10 DAF endosperm of WT and fl3 were used to compare the gene expression, and three independent biological replicates for each material.
