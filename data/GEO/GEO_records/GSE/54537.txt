TITLE
MicroRNA Profiling of Laser-Microdissected Hepatocellular Carcinoma Reveals an Oncogenic Phenotype of the Tumor Capsule

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor cells were microdissected from FFPE sections of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples. Samples were compared between different localisations either within or around the tumor. miRNA was labeled with the Affymetrix FlashTag Biotin HSR RNA Labeling Kit

DESIGN
6 microdissected hepatocellular carcinoma samples were compared to four different tumor localisations (LC: cirrhotic septa of the tumor-adjacent liver; LP: tumor-adjacent liver parenchyma;TC: fibrinous capsule of the tumor; TP: tumor parenchyma)
