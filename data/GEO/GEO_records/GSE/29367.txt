TITLE
Expression data from human squamous cell lung cancer line HARA and highly bone metastatic subline HARA-B4.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the molecular mechanisms for osteolytic bone metastasis by selecting human lung cancer cell line subpopulations with elevated metastatic activity and validating genes that are overexpressed in these cells. A bone-seeking squamous lung cancer cell line (HARA-B4) was established by sequentially injecting parental HARA cells into the left ventricle of male 5-week-old nude mice 4 times.

DESIGN
The parental line HARA and highly bone-metastatic line HARA-B4 were analized. Total of two samples. No replicates.
