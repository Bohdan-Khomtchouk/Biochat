TITLE
Effect of Concentration and type of Dietary Fatty Acid on Development of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The current study was designed to determine if dietary fatty acid concentration and composition affects the development and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Male SD rats were overfed diets low (5%) or high (70%) fat diets via total enteral nutrition where the fat source was olive oil (monounsaturated), or corn oil (polyunsaturated). Overfeeding 5% corn oil produced little steatosis relative to feeding 5% olive oil. This was associated with lower fatty acid synthesis and reduced SREBP-c signaling in the 5% corn oil group. Overfeeding 70% fat diets increased steatosis and lead to increased liver necrosis in the 70% corn oil but not olive oil group. Increased injury after feeding polyunsaturated fat diets was linked to peroxidizability of hepatic free fatty acids and triglycerides and appearance of peroxidaized lipid products HETES and HODES previously linked to clinical nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
