TITLE
Expression data from CD11cHI and CD11cLO decidual macrophage populations.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Decidual macrophage populations, CD11cHI and CD11cLO cells were analyzed for expression profiles and unique characteristics. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression and to determine differences between these two unique decidual macrophage populations.

DESIGN
First trimester decidual tissue was digested in order to release immune cells.  Cells were stained for CD14 and CD11c and purified by MoFlo sorting.  Cells were immediately lysed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We utilized 8 patient paired samples (total of 16 microarrays).
