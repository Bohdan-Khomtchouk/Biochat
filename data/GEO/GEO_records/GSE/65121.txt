TITLE
HP1Î² has distinct subnuclear localizations, chromatin binding features and functions in embryonic stem cells and differentiating cells [expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify the gene expression changes in Cbx1-/- (HP1beta) knockout embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and Cbx5-/- (HP1alpha) knockout ESCs compared to WT ESCs and in embryoid bodies (EBs) differentiated from those three ESC types.

DESIGN
ESCs were grown and the pluripotent SSEA1-positive cells from all ESC types using MACS were sorted and harvested or sorted and differentiated into EBs. Total RNA from all samples was extracted.
