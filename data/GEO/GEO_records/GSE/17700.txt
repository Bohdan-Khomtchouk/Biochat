TITLE
Factorial study for evaluating the effect of Affy platform and lab on gene expression measurements

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of concordance in single and multi-gene genomic indices from data generated by two different laboratories (MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDA) and Jules Bordet Institute (JBI)) and on two different Affymetrix platforms (U113A and U133_Plus2). We used a 2x2 factorial study in which 16 clinical breast cancer samples were profiled by both laboratories on both platforms (64 arrays total).

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted, cRNA was labeled and fragmented at MDA.  Fragmented cRNA was profiled on both platforms at MDA.  Fragmented cRNA was shipped to JBI where it was also profiled on both platforms.
