TITLE
Primary melanoma tumors from CDKN2A mutation carriers do not belong to a distinct molecular subclass.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profiles from sporadic and hereditary primary melanomas. The hypothesis was to test whether any gene expression differences exist between melanomas from CDKN2A mutation carriers and sporadic melanomas.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue blocks. RNA was analysed using the WG-DASL technique.
