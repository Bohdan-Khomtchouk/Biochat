TITLE
Gene expression regulating the onset of heat-induced intratesticular calcification.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression profiles between testes from C57BL/6 and C57BL/6-background congenic mouse strain B6.MRLc1-(D1Mit202–D1Mit403) carrying the telomeric region of MRL-type Chr 1 (67.97–81.63 cM) at 10 days after a single scrotal heat stress of 43°C for 20 min.

DESIGN
Heat-induced gene expression in mouse testis was measured at 10 days after a single heat exposure. The testes were isolated from 3 C57BL/6 and 3 B6.MRLc1-(D1Mit202–D1Mit403). C57BL/6 versus B6.MRLc1-(D1Mit202–D1Mit403) analysis was performed.
