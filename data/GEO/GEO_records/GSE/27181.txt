TITLE
Comparison of gene expression data between control and tissue specific epicardial PDGF receptor (a and b) knockout embryonic hearts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epicardial cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transtion (EMT) to generate coronary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and cardiac fibroblasts.  Little is known about the mechanisms regulating EMT or the in vivo signals directing epicardial-derived cell (EPDC) fate.  Here, we show that loss of PDGF signaling leads to a disruption in Sox9 expression, and when Sox9 expression was restored in mutant hearts, the EMT defect was rescued.  Interestingly, mutants lacking only one of the PDGF genes exhibited a lineage specific requirement for the individual receptors.  Loss of PDGFRα resulted in a deficit in cardiac fibroblast formation, while cVSMC development was unperturbed.  Conversely, PDGFRβ was required for cVSMC development but not cardiac fibroblast development.  Combined, our data demonstrate a novel role for PDGF receptors in epicardial EMT and EPDC development.

DESIGN
GSM671723-GSM671724: Total RNA was isolated from E12.5 control and PDGF receptor epicardial knockout hearts using the Trizol reagent.  RNA was processed as per manufacturer's instructions (Illumina Gene expression array, Illumina, inc.   San Diego, CA, USA) GSM671877-GSM671882: Total RNA was isolated from E12.5 control and PDGF receptor epicardial knockout primary epicardial cultures using the Trizol reagent.  RNA was processed as per manufacturer's instructions (Illumina Gene expression array, Illumina, inc.   San Diego, CA, USA)
