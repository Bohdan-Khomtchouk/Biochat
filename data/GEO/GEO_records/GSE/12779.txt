TITLE
The transcriptional response of Pasteurella multocida to three classes of antibiotics

ORGANISM
Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida str. Pm70

SUMMARY
We studied the effects of three classes of antibiotics (amoxicillin, chlortetracycline and enrofloxacin ) on P. multocida transcriptome using custom oligonucleotide microarrays from Nimblegen systems. All the 2015 genes of Pm70 were spotted on the array and hybridizations were carried out with RNA isolated from three independent cultures of Pm70 grown in the presence or absence of sub-minimum inhibitory (sub-MIC) doses of antibiotics.    Differentially expressed genes were identified by ANOVA and Dunnettâ€™s test. Biological modeling of the differentially expressed genes (DE) was carried out based on Clusters of Orthologous (COG) groups and network analysis in Pathway Studio. Keywords: Response to sub-MIC antibiotics

DESIGN
The experimental design included three biological replicate cultures of P. multocida grown in the absence or presence of sub-MIC antibiotics. Effects of antibiotics on the transcriptome with each antibiotic were determined by comparing the growth in the presence of antibiotic (treatment) to growth in the absence of antibiotic (control).
