TITLE
Induction of trophoblast stem cells from embryonic stem cells by forced repression of Oct3/4.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize the transdifferentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells into trophoblast stem (TS) cells triggered by forced repression of Oct3/4, we performed whole-genome expression analysis after tetracycline (Tet)-induced knockout of Oct3/4.
