TITLE
Induction of trophoblast stem cells from embryonic stem cells by forced repression of Oct3/4.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize the transdifferentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells into trophoblast stem (TS) cells triggered by forced repression of Oct3/4, we performed whole-genome expression analysis after tetracycline (Tet)-induced knockout of Oct3/4.

DESIGN
A Tet-inducible Oct3/4 knockout ES cell line ZHBTc4 was treated with Tet for 4 days in the presence of FGF4 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). A total of 21 samples from Day 0 to Day 4 were analyzed in three biological replicates.
