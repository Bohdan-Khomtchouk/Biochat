TITLE
Microarray data of prepubertal, peripubertal, and adult oocytes, and from GV and MII oocytes matured in vivo or in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression data from prepubertal, peripubertal, and adult derived mouse oocytes, and from germinal vesicle (GV), in vivo matured, and in vitro matured mouse oocytes. Oocytes derived from prepubertal females, or oocytes matured in vitro, are less developmentally competent compared to adult derived, or in vivo matured, oocytes, indicated by decreased embryonic development.  One potential mechanism for decreased developmental potetential in prepubertal or in vitro matured oocytes is inadequate or inappropriate RNA degradation during oocyte maturation (progression from GV to MII). To investigate mechanisms involved in establishing oocyte cytoplasmic maturation and developmental competence, Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays were used. Keywords: Oocyte developmental competence
