TITLE
Microarray data of prepubertal, peripubertal, and adult oocytes, and from GV and MII oocytes matured in vivo or in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression data from prepubertal, peripubertal, and adult derived mouse oocytes, and from germinal vesicle (GV), in vivo matured, and in vitro matured mouse oocytes. Oocytes derived from prepubertal females, or oocytes matured in vitro, are less developmentally competent compared to adult derived, or in vivo matured, oocytes, indicated by decreased embryonic development.  One potential mechanism for decreased developmental potetential in prepubertal or in vitro matured oocytes is inadequate or inappropriate RNA degradation during oocyte maturation (progression from GV to MII). To investigate mechanisms involved in establishing oocyte cytoplasmic maturation and developmental competence, Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays were used. Keywords: Oocyte developmental competence

DESIGN
The study encompassed three experimental designs using female B6D2F1 mice: 1) In vitro matured oocytes were obtained from d20 (prepubertal), d26 (peripubertal), and 7-8 wk old (adult) mice; 2) in vivo and in vitro matured oocytes were obtained from  d26 mice; and 3) GV, in vivo matured, and in vitro matured oocytes were obtained from 7-8 wk old mice.  RNA was extracted from pools of 150 oocytes and hybridized onto the Affymetrix microarrays.
