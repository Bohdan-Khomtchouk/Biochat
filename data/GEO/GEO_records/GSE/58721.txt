TITLE
BRAF inhibition leads to oxidative phosphorylation and cellular senescence in human melanoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Targeting components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway prolongs survival of patients with advanced BRAFV600E melanomas but such an approach is not curative because of the rapid acquisition of numerous resistance mechanisms. Here we analyze melanoma cells that evade MAPK inhibitors by undergoing a senescence-like, slow-growth, phenotype, which leads to acquired resistance. The initial therapeutic response is characterized by an integrated stress response program, including stimulation of autophagic flux, activation of the endoplasmic reticulum machinery, and an enhanced ability of detoxifying reactive oxygen species. Reversibly senescent cells also exhibit an increase in mitochondrial genome copy number and a strong metabolic shift towards oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Inducing mitochondrial dysfunction by co-targeting the MAPK pathway and mitochondrial Hsp90-directed protein folding with specific inhibitors prevented entry of cells into a reversibly senescent state, suppressed mitochondrial energy metabolism and augmented therapy response.

DESIGN
Human melanoma cells were treated with BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 at 10uM. There are two biological replicates at each time point.
