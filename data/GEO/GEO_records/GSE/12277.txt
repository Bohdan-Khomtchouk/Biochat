TITLE
Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells of Different Donor Age

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this series we have analyzed the effect of donor age on the gene expression profile of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPC). Cells were taken from umbilical cord blood (CB) or from G-CSF mobilized blood of healthy donors for allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation.
