TITLE
Exogenous H2S administration does not regulate gene expression in primary murine alveolar type II cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Primary alveolar type II cells were either treated with vehicle or NaHS for 6 h and 24 h (RS-266 samples). Primary alveolar type II cells treated with GYY4137 at 100 µM concentration were exposed to either 21% O2 or 85% O2 for 24 h (RS-284 samples). Overall no changes in gene expressionwere found in the corrected p values of both microarray studies.

DESIGN
Four vehicle samples at 6 h of exposure, four NaHS treated samples at 6 h of exposure, four vehicle samples at 24 h of exposure and four NaHS treated samples at 24 h of exposure were used for the RS-266 microarray study. four GYY4137 100 µM samples in 21% O2 after 24 h of exposure were compared to four GYY4137 100 µM samples in 85% O2 after 24 h of exposure and used for the RS-284 microarray study.
