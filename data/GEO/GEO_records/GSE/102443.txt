TITLE
Single-cell RNA-Seq of the geniculate ganglion from Mus musculus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We use comprehensive and unsupervised transcriptome analyses to provide molecular classifications of sensory neurons in the mouse geniculate ganglion. 96 neurons were isolated on a C1 Fluodigm chip, underwent RNA-Seq, and iteratively clustered into sub-classes.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq analysis of 96 geniculate ganglion neurons collected on two 96-well C1 Fluodigm chips.
