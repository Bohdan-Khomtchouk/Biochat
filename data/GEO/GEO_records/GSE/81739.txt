TITLE
Methylation profiling of 3T3-L1 Cells: Control vs slincRAD-shRNA8 stable transfected

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide methylation profiling of mouse 3T3-L1 Cells comparing control wildtypes with cells stable transfected with slincRAD shRNA8 (sh8).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, 3T3-L1 wildtype vs. slincRAD-shRNA8 stable transfected cells before and after Adipogenesis. One replicate per array.
