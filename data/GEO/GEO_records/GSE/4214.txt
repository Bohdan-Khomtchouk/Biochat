TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the four human tissues by two microarray platforms and TaqMan real-time PCR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study provides one of the largest “reference” data set of gene expression measurements using TaqMan® Gene Expression Assay based real-time PCR technology.  This data set allowed us to use an orthogonal gene expression technology to evaluate the performance of different microarray platforms.    We conclude that microarrays are indeed invaluable discovery tools with acceptable reliability for genome-wide gene expression screening, though validation of putative changes in gene expression remains advisable.   Our study also characterizes the limitations of microarrays; understanding these limitations will enable researchers to more effectively evaluate microarray results in a more cautious and appropriate manner Keywords: cross-platform comparison of gene expression measurements

DESIGN
In this study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of three human tissues: brain, lung, liver and one universal human reference sample (UHR) using two representative commercial long-oligonucleotide microarray platforms: (1) Applied Biosystems Human Genome Survey Microarrays (based on single-color detection); (2) Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays (based on two-color detection).  1,375 genes represented by both microarray platforms and spanning a wide dynamic range in gene expression levels, were selected for TaqMan® Gene Expression Assay based real-time PCR validation.  For each platform, four technical replicates were performed on the same total RNA samples according to each manufacturer’s standard protocols.  For Agilent arrays, comparative hybridization was performed using incorporation of Cy5 for brain/lung/liver RNA and Cy3 for UHR RNA (common reference).  Using the TaqMan® Gene Expression Assay based real-time PCR data set as the reference set
