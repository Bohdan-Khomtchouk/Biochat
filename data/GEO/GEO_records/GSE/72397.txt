TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of madin-darby canine kidney cells with canine parvovirus 2a persistent infection

ORGANISM
Canis lupus

SUMMARY
It has been demonstrated that parvovirus infection causing cytotoxicity and immune activation effect in many virus-induced cell lines, however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. To investigate the gene expression signature of host cell after CPV-2 infection, we performed transcriptome profiling of MDCK after persistent infection of CPV-2a  using microarray analysis. Uninfected MDCK cells act as negative control. The data show the genes regulated by CPV-2 infection..

DESIGN
The monolayer MDCK cells were digested with trypsin and plated into new cell culture flasks, supplement with 1/10 (v/v) CPV-2 virus solution (MOI=1) in DMEM containing 5% FBS. The infected MDCK cells were cultured at 37Â°C with 5% CO2, and passage for ten generation. MDCK F10 cells infected with CPV-2a and mock-treatment were harvest for microarray analysis.
