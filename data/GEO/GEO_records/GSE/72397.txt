TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of madin-darby canine kidney cells with canine parvovirus 2a persistent infection

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
It has been demonstrated that parvovirus infection causing cytotoxicity and immune activation effect in many virus-induced cell lines, however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. To investigate the gene expression signature of host cell after CPV-2 infection, we performed transcriptome profiling of MDCK after persistent infection of CPV-2a  using microarray analysis. Uninfected MDCK cells act as negative control. The data show the genes regulated by CPV-2 infection..
