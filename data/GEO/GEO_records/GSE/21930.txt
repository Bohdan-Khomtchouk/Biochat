TITLE
Expression data from Caco-2 cells co-cultivated with B. animalis subsp. lactis BB-12

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although intestinal microbiota play a pivotal role in the development of host immune system this biological issue was not so far studied in great detail. In this study we examined immune response of Caco-2 enterocytes after incubation with common probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 for 4 hours. We used microarrays to inspect the global gene expression of Caco-2 cells upon co-culturing with B. animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and several distinct immune-related genes up-regulated during this process.

DESIGN
One time point (T4) and two controls (T0) were analysed. T0 represent differentiated Caco-2 cells cultivated for 3 weeks. T4 represents differentiated Caco-2 cells cultivated for 3 weeks plus consequent 4 hours of co-cultivation with B. animalis subsp. lactis BB-12. 3 technical replicates for T0-1, T0-2 or T4 were pooled to a single sample, RNA extracted and further used in gene expression experiments.
