TITLE
microRNA profiling of murine wt and MyD88-/- deficient bone marrow derived macrophages upon infection with Legionella Pneumophila

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
wt and MyD88-/- murine bone marrow derived macrophages were infected with Legionella Pneumophila for 24h. RNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform precipitation. 400 ng RNA per sample were then reverse transcribed with the Life Technologies miR RT kit with megaplex primers. Reverse transcribed RNA was then loaded on the rodent Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA) Cards and run according to manufacturerÂ´s recommendations

DESIGN
Uninfected MyD88-/- and wt cells were used as control to evaluate the impact of infection. Normalized infected MyD88-/- samples were then compared against normalized infected wt samples.
