TITLE
HER2-enriched tumor initiating cell (HTIC) genomic predictor of response following neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy in HER2+ breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified a 17-gene Her2-enriched tumor initiating cell (HTIC) signature in MMTV-Her2/Neu mouse mammary TICs. Here, we show that patients with HTICS+ HER2+:ERα− tumors are more likely to achieve a pathologic complete response to trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with HER2+:ER+ tumors.

DESIGN
Neoadjuvant study of 50 HER2-positive breast cancer cases treated with trastuzumab-based chemotherapy pre-operatively. Pre-treatment FNA from primary tumors were obtained and RNA extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays according to manufacturer protocol. Pathologic response was assessed at the end of neoadjuvant treatment.
