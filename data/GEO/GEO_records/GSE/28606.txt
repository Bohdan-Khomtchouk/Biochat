TITLE
Monitoring of functional gene responses to ERD (enhanced reductive dechlorination) from four TCE-contaminated sites

ORGANISM
Shewanella

SUMMARY
A functional microarray targeting 24 genes involved in chlorinated solvent biodegradation pathways has been developed and used to monitor the gene diversity present in four trichloroethylene (TCE) contaminated sites under ERD (enhanced reductive dechlorination) treatment. The microarray format provided by NimbleGen and used in this study is 12x135K. 2 Âµg of labelled gDNA from 30 groundwater samples were hybridized on the microarrays.
