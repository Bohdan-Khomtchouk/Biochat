TITLE
Monitoring of functional gene responses to ERD (enhanced reductive dechlorination) from four TCE-contaminated sites

ORGANISM
groundwater metagenome

SUMMARY
A functional microarray targeting 24 genes involved in chlorinated solvent biodegradation pathways has been developed and used to monitor the gene diversity present in four trichloroethylene (TCE) contaminated sites under ERD (enhanced reductive dechlorination) treatment. The microarray format provided by NimbleGen and used in this study is 12x135K. 2 µg of labelled gDNA from 30 groundwater samples were hybridized on the microarrays.

DESIGN
A 30-chip study was performed, each chip corresponding to hybridization with 2 µg of labelled gDNA retrieved from a monitoring well from one of the four contaminated sites. Each probe (760nt) on the microarray was synthesized in eight replicates, and a total of 5,707 random probes was used to determine the background noise. Groundwater samples were collected from four contaminated sites (B, F, G and H), four monitoring wells per site (P1, P2, P3 and P4). P1: well located upstream to the contamination source. P2: well in the contamination source. P3 and P4: wells located downstream to the contamination source. For site B, the monitoring of ERD demonstration was performed through a total of 5 sampling campaigns: C1 (T=0), C2 (T=104 days), C3 (T=231 days), C4 (T=291 days) and C5 (T=378 days). For the three other sites (F, G and H), only one sampling campaign was performed after the treatment.
