TITLE
Expression data from primary hepatocytes from mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retinol Saturase (RetSat) is an oxidoreductase expressed at high levels in the hepatocyte fraction of liver. We investigated the effects of RetSat depletion on gene expression in primary mouse hepatocytes.

DESIGN
Hepatocytes were isolated from a male C57BL/6J mouse (wild-type, 10 weeks of age). Four hours later, cells were transfected with siRNA (Dharmacon) using Lipofectamin 2000 overnight. Medium was changed the next morning and total RNA harvested 48 hours later.
