TITLE
A Shared Runx1-bound Zbtb16 Enhancer Directs Innate and Innate-Like Lymphoid Lineage Development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Combined with CRISPR/Cas9 and ATAC-seq approach, we identified open chromatin sites critical for PLZF expression in ILC and NKT innate lineages. Runx1 is bound to multiple open chromatin sites and is essential for PLZF expression.

DESIGN
ATAC-seq was performed in NKT cells vs CD4SP thymocytes, ILCP vs CLP. Runx1 ChIP-seq was performed in NKT cells.
