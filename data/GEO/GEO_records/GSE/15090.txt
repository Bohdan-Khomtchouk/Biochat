TITLE
Gene expression profiles in muscle tissue from FSHD patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Muscle biopsies from biceps and deltoid were taken from 5 patients with FSHD, 5 asymptomatic carriers and 5 normal controls. The genome-wide expression patterns were compared using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 chips. Keywords: Facioscapulohumeral, FSHD, muscular dystrophy

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were generated for 15 individuals (5 affected patients, 5 asymptomatic carriers and 5 healthy controls)
