TITLE
Time-course hypoxia incubation (1% O2) of D283-Med medulloblastoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Elucidation of the impact of  hypoxia in D283-Med (medulloblastoma Homo sapiens, human, ATCC® HTB-185™) cells to depict molecular mechanisms, which could explain drug resistance when cells are exposed to long-term hypoxia (5 days). Global gene expression study by microarray analysis to allow an efficient search for a range of genes. D283-MED cells were incubated for a varied hypoxic duration (0, 6, 64 and 96 hours in triplicate), cDNA samples were prepared and sent directly to NimbleGen.

DESIGN
3 independent replicate were analysed. For each set of experiment, 4 time-points were analysed: 0h (control), 6h, 64h and 96h. Gewne expression was compared to the control condition (left at 21% O2).

PLATFORM
