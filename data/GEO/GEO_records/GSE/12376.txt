TITLE
Aspergillus CEA10 compared to SRBA mutant under hypoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
Aspergillus fumigatus strains CEA10 and srbA mutant expression patterns were compared after exposure to 24h of hypoxic conditions Goal of this study was to find genes that are directly and/or indirectly regulated by the transcription factor srbA, that is know to be crucial for growth under hypoxic conditions Keywords: hypoxic stress response

DESIGN
two strains, 2 biological replicates with dye-swaps

PLATFORM
