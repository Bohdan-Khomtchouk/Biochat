TITLE
RNA-SEQ analysis of E14.5 ALL Ret-positive (EGFP-labeled) FACSd dorsal root ganglia neurons.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this set is to build expression data using FACS isolated Ret-positive cells harvested from a Ret-EGFP reporter mouse (embryonic day E14.5). These can be used as a time point in comparative analysis of ontogeny of genes expressed at various developmental time points.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from E14.5 FACS isolated dorsal root ganglia dissected from Ret-EGFP C57BL/6J mice (EGFP knocked-in Ret locus-heterozyotes) and sequenced using Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. Refer to protocols on the GUDMAP website under Jain.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
