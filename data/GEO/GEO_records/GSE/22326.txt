TITLE
CpG Island methylation variation in placentae of Intra-Uterine Growth Restricted (IUGR) fetuses versus controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylation profiling of CpG Island Methylation of genomic DNA samples extracted from placentae of Intra-Uterine Growth Restricted newborns and gestational age matched controls. These data can be used for methylation comparisons between these two types of samples. The results of such comparisons can be used to generate hypotheses on the involvement of DNA methylation variation in placenta development and fetal growth.

DESIGN
Two-condition Methyl DNA Immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) experiment, IUGR vs. Control placenta samples. Biological replicates: 8 control, 8 IUGR cases.

PLATFORM
GPL9767 Agilent-014791 Human CpG Island ChIP-on-Chip Microarray 244K (G4492A) (Probe Name version)
