TITLE
Transcript Profiling of Different CNS Regions in Response to Experimental Restraint Stress on Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
It generally believes that moderate stress could have protective and adaptive effects, but less is known about the moderate or experimental stress on CNS in stimulated animals. This study aims to investigate the potential gene expression in nociception-related central regions induced by moderate experimental stress in rats. Rats were given moderate restrain for 50 min and using cDNA microarrays to compare different gene expression in central regions. Transcriptome profiling analysis showed that stress-related genes at acute stage were up-regulated in Arc; rhythmic process-related genes were up-regulated in PAG, while glutamine metabolism-, arginine metabolis-related genes were up-regulated in DH. At late stage, immune related genes were broadly up-regulated in the CNS regions. These results suggest that specific GO categories? genes could be regulated in the specific CNS regions correlated with relative function in response to external stimuli at the beginning period. It also suggest that moderate stress could enhance neuroendocrine and immune function in broad CNS regions at late stage, and experimental stress should be careful considered, especially in neuroendocrine and immune studies. Furthermore, Sgk1 was verified by qRT-PCR and western blot. The significant up regulation implied Sgk1 in the CNS may play an important role in the response to stress.
