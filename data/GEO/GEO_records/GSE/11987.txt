TITLE
Expression data from GLI1-transformed RK3E cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
SHH signaling pathway is activated in many type of cancers.  However, the role of its activation in particular type of cancer was poorly understood.  The GLI family transcription factor GLI1 is the effector of Shh pathway activation and functions as oncogene.  Our goal of research is to identify the GLI1 targets in desmoplastic medulloblastomas. We used microarrays to obtain the global gene expression profiles in cells transformed by GLI1 and identified distinct classes of genes by comparing with those of desmoplastic medulloblastomas
