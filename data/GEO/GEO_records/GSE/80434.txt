TITLE
Molecular Signatures Associated with ZIKV Exposure in Human Cortical Neural Progenitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection causes microcephaly and has been linked to other brain abnormalities. How ZIKV impairs brain development and function remains elusive. Here we systematically profiled transcriptomes of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) exposed to Asian ZIKVC, African ZIKVM, and Dengue virus (DENV). DENV causes distinct gene expression changes; and ZIKV has a broader impact on the expression of gene involved in DNA replication and repair. While overall expression profiles are similar, ZIKVC, but not ZIKVM, induces upregulation of viral response genes. Our analyses reveal virus- and strain-specific molecular signatures associated with ZIKV infection. Further investigation of ZIKV-host interactions based our transcriptomic datasets may help to illuminate neural virulence determinants of ZIKV in patients.
