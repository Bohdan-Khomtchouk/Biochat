TITLE
A gene expression database for retinal neuron subtypes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to define gene expression patterns of thirteen mouse retinal neuron subsets, labeled by expression of fluorescent proteins in transgenic mice.

DESIGN
Neurons expressing xFPs were purified by flow cytometry. Thirteen different neuron subtypes were compared. Two biological replicates, originating from different litters, were collected for each cell type. RNA was extracted from sorted cells and prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays.
