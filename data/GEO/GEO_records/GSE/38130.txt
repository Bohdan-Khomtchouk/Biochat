TITLE
Gene expression profiling of acute drought response in leaf and root of rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
In this research, an array of 27,448 rice genes was used to elucidate gene expression in air-dried rice seedlings (lead and root) at various periods of treatment times. The analyses show that rice responds to drought stress mainly by down-regulating many biological processes including gene expression and regulation, protein phosphorylation, and cellular metabolism. Among strategies to actively adapt to drought, most significant are inducing protective molecules, which may be differentially regulated based on plant organs.

DESIGN
A total of 20 chips was used for the microarray analysis. Total RNAs were extracted from leaf and root of rice seedlings that had undergone 0-12 hrs acute drought. Experiments were duplicated. The profiling was conducted with the Rice 3'-Tiling Microarray designed from 27,448 genes deposited at IRGSP, RAP1 database ( http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/ ).
