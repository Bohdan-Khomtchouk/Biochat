TITLE
Gene expression profiles of NIH3T3 influenced by MARVELD1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate biological function of MARVELD1, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a platform to analyze gene expression alternation influenced by MARVELD1. MARVELD1 stably transfected NIH3T3 and control vector cells were used to compare their gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
Total RNA from MARVELD1 overexpressing NIH3T3 cells and control cells were extracted to analyze their gene expression profiles by using mouse whole genome expression  microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
