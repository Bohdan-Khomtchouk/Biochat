TITLE
Maturation of the thalidomystery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile (GEP) was analyzed from cultured bone marrow (BM) samples of patients with lenalidomide-responsive versus lenalidomide-resistant myeloma after 24 hours incubation in vitro with thalidomide (Thal) (0.8 µg/ml), lenalidomide (Len) (0.5 µg/ml)  or with DMSO (control).

DESIGN
Comparative gene expression profile of cultured bone marrow samples from patients with lenalidomide responsive versus lenalidomide resistant myeloma after 24 hours incubation in vitro with thalidomide, lenalidomide or DMSO (control).
