TITLE
Folic acid induces cell type-specific changes in the transcriptomes of breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effect of folic acid (FA) on breast cancer (BC) risk is uncertain. We hypothesised that this uncertainty may be due, in part, to differential effects of FA between BC cells with different phenotype. To test this we investigated the effect of treatment with FA concentrations within the range of unmetabolised FA reported in humans on the expression of the transcriptomes of non-transformed (MCF10a) and cancerous (MCF7 and Hs578T) BC cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from three breast cancer cell lines (MCF10a, MCF7, Hs578T) treated with 100nmoles/l folic acid untreated control cells. Six replicates per treatment group.
