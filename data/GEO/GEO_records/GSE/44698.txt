TITLE
Global analyses of how 3' UTR-isoform choice influences mRNA stability and translational efficiency

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We obtained global measurements of decay and translation rates for mammalian mRNAs with alternative 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs).

DESIGN
1 3P-Seq sample from 3T3 cells and 1 3P-Seq sample from mouse ES cells; 2 2P-Seq steady state and 4 2P-Seq with actinomycin D; 6 polysome fraction 2P-Seq

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus) GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
