TITLE
Single-cell aneuploidy detection by array CGH

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we extend array CGH technology by making the accurate detection of chromosomal imbalances possible from a single fibroblast and blastomere following Phi29 DNA polymerase amplification. Keywords: CGH

DESIGN
Firstly, array CGH experiments were performed on four different fibroblast cell lines, derived from patients affected by, respectively, trisomy 13, 18, 21, and monosomy X. For each cell line, three single cells were amplified. Following DNA amplification, all cells showed the expected DNA yields (n=12; 1.87 µg plus:minus 0.39). Sex-mismatch array CGH experiments were conducted on amplified DNA samples obtained from each cell. Sex chromosome ploidy levels, as well as all expected autosomal abnormalities were clearly identified. Secondly, we applied single-cell aneuploidy screening for the detection of chromosomal imbalances in preimplantation embryos. DNA from blastomeres from three 7-8 cell-stage embryos was amplified by Phi29 DNA polymerase. Following DNA amplification, all cells yielded the expected amount of DNA (n=16; 2.45 µg plus:minus 0.41). Chromosomal aneuploidies were accurately detected using a simple and rapid array CGH protocol.
