TITLE
mRNA-seq comparison of N2 and tps1;tps2 double mutants with and without trehalose supplementation

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Wild-type (N2) and tps1;tps2 double mutant embryos were resuspended at 1 embryo/uL in S-basal with or without 50mM trehalose. Samples were collected after 24 hours after bleach as L1 larvae

DESIGN
4 biological replicates were sequenced for each of four conditions: N2 in S-basal, tps-1;tps-2 in S-basal, N2 in 50mM trehalose, and tps-1;tps-2 in 50mM trehalose
