TITLE
To define the role of glycosylation in the interaction and metastatic behaviour of tumor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of our study is to define the role of glycosylation in the interaction of pancreatic tumor cells with dendritic cells and/or in the metastatic behaviour of the tumor cells.

DESIGN
We want to examine two cell lines, established from the same primary human pancreatic tumor, which exhibit different grades of differentiation as well as a different potency to metastasize. We believe that these cell lines represent a suitable model for study of glycosylation in the cell biology of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
