TITLE
Gene expression profiles of desmoid tumor cells treated with gamma-secretase inhibitor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare mesenchymal monoclonal lesions that have a high risk of local recurrence but lack metastatic potential. Since the Notch pathway appears to be   important in the carcinogenesis of several tumor types, in the past few years γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) have emerged as a potential therapeutic treatment by inhibiting cancer cell  Notch signaling through NICD cleavage blockade. To investigate the antitumor effect of PF-03084014, a γ-secretase inhibitor, in DT models, cells treated with PF-03084014 were characterized by gene  array analysis.

DESIGN
Three cell strains of Desmoid tumors (Desm14, Desm27 and Desm39b) were subjected to either no treatment (control, called G-0) or treatment with 10μM of PF-03084014 (called G-10). The regimen for each treatment was ~8 days and ~30 days; multiple group comparison
