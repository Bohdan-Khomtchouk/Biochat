TITLE
Expression data from Drosophila larvae

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The expression of Drosomycin, an antimicrobial peptide, is induced by pinching larvae with forceps in Drosophila We used microarray to examine whether other innate immune genes are up-regulated upon pinching.

DESIGN
Drosophila larvae were pricked with tungsten needle or pinched by forceps, incubated for 4 hours, and subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
