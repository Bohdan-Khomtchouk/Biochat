TITLE
Gene expression profiling of glioblastoma cell lines transfected with FGFR3-TACC3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of SNB19 and U251 glioblastoma cell lines transfected with the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion, FGFR3 wildtype and TACC3 wildtype constructs.

DESIGN
SNB19 and U251 cells were transfected with different clones of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion and with wildtype FGFR3 and TACC3 constructs. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized onto Agilent dual channel gene expression microarrays. In each hybridization, empty vector transfected SNB19 or U251 cells were hybridized into the reference channel.
