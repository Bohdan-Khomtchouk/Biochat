TITLE
Arabidopsis: Control- vs. acetic acid treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Comparing Arabidopsis plants gene expresion in normal conditions (control) with acetic acid treated plants (acetic). Plants were grown on liquid MS media for 13 days, then they were transfered to MS liquid media (control) or MS+3,5 acetic acid (acetic) for two hours.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Control vs Acetic. Biological replicates: 4 control, 4 treated with acetic, independently grown. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL4570 Galbraith Laboratory Operon Long Oligonucleotide Microarray version 3.0 (ATv305.02.Z)
