TITLE
A Dysregulated Proinflammatory Status in Preterm School-aged Children with PVL-induced Spastic Cerebral Palsy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Injury occurring during critical periods of development may have long-term effects on inflammatory responses. Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is the most common cause of cerebral palsy (CP) in preterm infant. Activated leukocytes are the main source of inflammatory cytokines that give rise to white matter damage and CP in preterm infant. Here, we tested the hypothesis that inflammation profiles as pathogenic mediators for the occurrence of PVL in the neonatal period may persist in preterm children with CP at school age.

DESIGN
Five preterm children with PVL-induced CP and gestational age-matched five preterm children with normal neurodevelopment were recruited from follow up clinics. Proinflammatory gene expression in the PBMCs from preterm children were determined by Superarray PCR study.
