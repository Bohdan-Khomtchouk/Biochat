TITLE
Gene expression comparison between different stages of endogenous Sertoli cells and induced embryonic Sertoli cells derived from MEFs and TTFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare the transcriptional profile of endogenous Sertoli cells from different Stage of Sertoli cell development (embryonic, immature, mature) to the transcriptionla profile of induced embryonic Sertoli cells derived from MEFs or TTFs we employed the agilent whole genome microarray Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
The following samples were analyzed in duplicates (MEFs, TTFs, ieSCs (derived from MEFs), ieSCs (derived from TTFs), 14.5 dpc male gonad, immature Sertoli (19 dpc embryo testis) and mature (8 week-old mouse testis))
