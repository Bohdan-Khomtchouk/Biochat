TITLE
North American Brain Expression Consortium: Laser capture microdissection of Cerebellar Purkinje Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previous studies in bulk tissue suggest that there are abundant expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in human brain. This sample series is of cerebellar Purkinje cells isolated using laser capture microdissection from human cases without neurological disease but of known genotypes. These data may be helpful in confirming eQTLs in bulk tissue or in mapping other gene expression traits in an enriched neuronal population. Authorized Access data: Mapping of GEO sample accessions to dbGaP subject/sample IDs is available through dbGaP Authorized Access, see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000249

DESIGN
The aim of this study was to examine gene expression in isolated purkinje cells from the human cerebellum. We obtained frozen brain tissue from the cerebellum. We stained sections with cresyl violet and separated Purkinje cells based on morphology and location within the cerebellum using laser capture microdissection. Expression analyses were then performed.
