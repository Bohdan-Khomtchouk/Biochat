TITLE
DNA-damaging agent and immune inducer synergistically induced defence gene expression in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes after DNA-damaging agent bleomycin (BLM) and/or immune inducer 2, 6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA) treatment. We focused on those genes that were synergistically induced by co-treatment (BLM+INA).

DESIGN
Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with 4 μg/ml BLM and/or low INA (10 μM). There are 4 treatments: control (CK), INA, BLM and BLM+INA. Each treatments have three biological replicates. There are 12 samples in total.
