TITLE
RNA seq analysis on zebrafish Notch 3 mutants and adult neural stem cells

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify the Notch3 targets directly responsible for maintaining the quiescent state and the stemness of adult pallial zebrafish Radial Glia.

DESIGN
Three independent experiments with 15 larval brains for each condition were performed for library construction from genotyped notch3-/- mutant versus notch3+/+ larvae, crossed into the gfap:gf. Three independent experiments with 20 adult telencephali were performed for library construction from her4:drfp;mcm5:gfp double transgenic fish.

PLATFORM
