TITLE
Deregulated Myc Requires MondoA for Metabolic Reprogramming and Tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the effect of MondoA loss on the expression of Myc-dependent genes, we performed a microarray analysis from RNAs isolated from TET21N cells expressing either control (siControl) or MondoA (siMondoA) siRNAs either with (NT) or without (Doxy) induced N-Myc expression.

DESIGN
TET21N cells were grown in medium with either Doxy (Myc-Off) or No Treatment (Myc-On), then transiently transfected with either non-specific siRNA or MondoA siRNA in replicates. Cells were then lysed and RNA isolated.
