TITLE
Extensive cryptic splicing upon loss of RBM17 and TDP43 in neurodegeneration models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Translating ribosome affinity purification technology was used to isolate mRNAs from cerebellar Purkinje neurons from control (Pcp2-BacTrap; Rbm17 f/+) and mutant (Pcp2-BacTRAP; Pcp2-Cre; Rbm17 f/-) mice.

DESIGN
RNA isolation was performed when animals were four-weeks-old (n=3 animals per genotype). Using NuGEN Ovation RNA-Seq System v2, purified double-stranded cDNA was generated from 10 ng of total RNA and amplified using both 3’ poly (A) selection and random priming. 2 µg of each sample was sheared using the Covaris S2 focused-ultrasonicator following the manufacturer’s protocol to obtain a final library with insert size of 400 bp. The sheared samples were quantified using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer and Invitrogen Qubit 2.0 DNA quantitation assay. The fragment sizes were confirmed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer to verify proper shearing. A double-stranded DNA library was produced using Illumina TruSeq DNA library preparation system and the sequencing was run on a HiSeq 2500 system.
