TITLE
Expression data from keratinocytes treated either with IL-22 or combination of tofacitinib (JAK1/3 inhibitor) and IL-22 at 6 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
JAK inhibitors like tofacitinib were thought to act primarily on T cells. However, our data and recent research suggest that JAK receptors are also present on keratinocytes. Here, we show effect of tofacitinib on primary keratinocytes, which could explain effects of topical tofacitinib treatment in psoriasis. We have performed whole transcriptome analysis (using microarray) on RNA isolated from cultured primary keratinocytes treated either with IL-22 alone or combination of tofacitinb and IL-22 at 6 hours

DESIGN
Primary keratinocytes were cultured in-vitro and pretreated with tofacitinib (0.6Î¼M) for 1 hour followed by IL-22 (20 ng/ml) treatment for 6 hours. Total RNA was isolated and whole transcriptomic analysis was performed.
