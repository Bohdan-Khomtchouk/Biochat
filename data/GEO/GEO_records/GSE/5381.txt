TITLE
Gene expression analysis of liver and kidney following methapyrilene treatment in male Sprague-Dawley rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study was performed to gain insight into the hepatotoxicity of methapyrilene.  Gene expression changes in the kidney (non-target tissue for toxicity) were compared to those in the liver (target tissue for toxicity) to attribute gene expression changes to relevant biological processes (i.e. toxic response, non-specific acute response, pharmacological response, etcâ€¦). Keywords: Time course, tissue comparison, liver toxicity, hepatotoxicity
