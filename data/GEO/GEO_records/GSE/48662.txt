TITLE
Cell senescence abrogates the immunomodulatory therapeutic potential of human mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we have addressed how cellular senescence influences the immunomodulatory potential of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). We induced cell senescence in a panel of bone marrow-derived hMSC samples by means of gamma-irradiation, and performed both gene expression and miRNA microarray analyses on the untreated and senescent samples. We also compared the gene expression profile of untreated and senescent hMSCs with those obtained from several hMSCs samples used in an ongoing allogeneic clinical study of Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD), of which their therapeutic efficacy is known. We have identified several genes (PLEC, C8orf48, TRPC4, and ZNF14) differentially expressed in senescent hMSCs that are similarly regulated in hMSC samples that did not show a therapeutic effect in the GVHD study. These genes might be useful as markers to evaluate the therapeutic potential of hMSCs used in future clinical studies.

DESIGN
We compared the gene and miRNA expression profiles of untreated (WT) control bone marrow-derived hMSCs with the same primary cell lines 10 days after gamma-irradiation (SEN) and with several hMSCs samples used in a clinical stydy of GVHD. The samples used in the clinical study were classified in two groups, depending on whether they elicited a therapeutic response (G1) or not (G2). A total of four independent samples (biological replicates) were used for WT and SEN conditions. For the samples used in the clinical study, a total of five samples were used for the G1 group, and three samples for the G2 group.
