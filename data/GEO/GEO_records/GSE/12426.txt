TITLE
DIDS protects against neuronal injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using long-oligo beadschip arrays, we examined the global gene expression profile in cultured hippocampal slices under the simulated ischemic condition with and without the presence of DIDS .

DESIGN
Control-ACSF: cultured hippocampal slices were incubated with ACSF for 2 hours and were analysed on whole-genome expression chips to determine the gene expression profile. This group was used as controls for IS-treated groups and ACSF+DIDS-treated grous. IS: cultured hippocampal slices were treated wtih IS for 2 hours and the gene expression was analyzed and compared with the control group. IS+DIDS: cultured slices were treated with both IS and DIDS for 2 hours and the gene expression profile was determined. Differentially expression genes were identified by comparing with IS group. ACSF+DIDS: cultured slices were incubated with both ACSF and DIDS for 2 hours and gene expression profile was determined. This group was used as a control for IS+DIDS group. ACSF: artificial cerebral spinal fluid DIDS: 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid IS: ischemic solution
