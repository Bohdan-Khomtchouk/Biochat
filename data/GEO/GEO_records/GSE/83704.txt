TITLE
MiRNAs regulate dynamic transcriptional changes of broiler embryos in response to modification of the incubation temperature (Musculus gastrocnemius)

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
miRNA expression was analysed of samples derived from M. gastrognemius of day 10 and day 13 chicken embryos and day 35 broiler after variation of incubation temperature

DESIGN
Broiler eggs were incubated at a lower or higher temperature (36.8°C, 38.8°C) relative to control (37.8°C) over two developmental intervals, embryonic days (ED) 7-10 and 10-13. MicroRNA expression of Musculus gastrocnemius was assayed at ED 10, ED 13, and slaughter age [post-hatch day (D) 35] (6 groups; 3 time points) by microarray analysis and treated samples were compared to controls within each time point
