TITLE
MiRNAs regulate dynamic transcriptional changes of broiler embryos in response to modification of the incubation temperature (Musculus gastrocnemius)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
miRNA expression was analysed of samples derived from M. gastrognemius of day 10 and day 13 chicken embryos and day 35 broiler after variation of incubation temperature
