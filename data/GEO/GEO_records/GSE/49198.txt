TITLE
Identification of a stable gene signature of tolerance to renal allograft by meta-analysis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study corresponds to a re-analysis and meta-analysis of the five transcriptomic studies related to spontaneous tolerance to renal allograft in human. It examines the transcriptome of peripheral blood samples from six distinct clinical groups: healthy volunteers (HV); tolerant patients (TOL); stable patients on minimal immunosuppression (MIS) or maintained on classical immunosuppressive therapy (STA); patients showing either signs of chronic rejection (CR) or acute rejection (AR). The initial studies are the following:   -Study 1 from Braud C. et al. (J Cell Biochem., 2008) published under GEO accession number GSE47755 and comprising 250 unique samples (8 HV; 21 TOL; 190 STA; 31 CR).  -Study 2 from Brouard S.  et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A., 2007) published under GEO accession number GSE47683 and comprising 67 unique samples (8 HV; 12 TOL; 10 MIS; 12 STA; 11 CR; 14 AR).   - Study 3 from Lozano JJ. et al. (Am J Transplant., 2011) published under GEO accession number GSE22707 and comprising 42 unique samples (6 HV; 12 TOL; 12 STA; 12 CR).  - Study 4 from Newell KA. et al. (J Clin Invest., 2010) published under GEO accession number GSE22229 and comprising 58 unique samples (12 HV; 19 TOL; 27 STA).  - Study 5 from Sagoo P. et al. (J Clin Invest. 2010) published under GEO accession number GSE14655 and comprising two distinct cohorts of patients. The IOT (“Indices of Tolerance”) cohort (5a) corresponds to a European group of patients and totalizes 74 unique samples (8 HV; 10 TOL; 11 MIS; 36 STA; 9 CR). The ITN (“Immune Tolerance in Transplantation”) cohort (5b) corresponds to an American group of patients and totalizes 105 unique samples (20 HV; 22 TOL; 11 MIS; 34 STA; 18 CR). The final data matrix corresponds to the combination of the data from the five independent studies and examines the expression of 1846 meta-genes (MG) across 596 unique blood samples. The 1846 meta-genes correspond to the genes being measured across the five datasets and form a virtual microarray platform (TOL-HUMAN-G1846). The 596 examined samples can be divided into 62 HV, 96 TOL, 32 MIS, 311 STA, 81 CR, and 14 AR.
