TITLE
Expression Patterns of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease genes and Efficacy of Green Tea on Hyperlipidemic Animal Model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Currently, there are no established treatments for NAFLD/NASH. Treatment recommendations include weight reduction through both diet and physical exercise, and weight-loss surgery for extreme obesity. Most medical regimens target components of the metabolic syndrome or oxidative stress associated with the pathogenesis of NASH. These include anti-obesity regimens, insulin sensitizers, anti-hyperlipidemics, and antioxidants. Thus, a need exists to validate approaches that might help the development and progression of hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in association with NAFLD.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from liver tissues of treated and untreated (NAFLD) groups and submitted for whole genome expression analysis.
