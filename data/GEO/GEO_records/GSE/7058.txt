TITLE
TL2 14028s M9+arabinose (3 passages) LibM9 vs Lib0 Exp.2

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Salmonella typhimurium 14028s Transposon library recovered after three consecutive rounds of growth to late log phase in M9 minimal medium (arabinose 0.4%) at 37°C with aeration, compared to an expansion of the initial library selected on Luria agar plates + kanamycin (50ug/ml), O/N at 37°C Keywords: Transposon tag analysis

DESIGN
2 biological replicates analysed after arbitrarily primed sampling (Klenow, DOPR degenerate primer) + specific PCR amplification (Taq DNA Pol) + T7 in vitro transcription (AmpliScribe T7) + RT labeling (Cy3) + hybridization, compared to identically processed standard library (Cy5)

PLATFORM
