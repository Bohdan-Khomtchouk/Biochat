TITLE
IRE1-mediated downregulation of miR-146a and miR-155 in primary dermal fibroblasts across three TNFRSF1A mutations results in hyperresponsiveness to LPS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As part of the above publication, experiments look at fold changes in 380 miRs at baseline in 3 healthy controls and 3 TRAPS patients were analysed.

DESIGN
A scientific experiment using RT-qPCR to look at fold change difference in miR expression between HC dermal fibroblasts and TRAPS dermal fibroblasts at baseline (i.e. without any stimulation of the fibroblasts).

PLATFORM
GPL17214 Human Array MicroRNA Card A v2
