TITLE
IgH Isotype-Specific B Cell Receptor Dosage Regulates B Cell Fate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We use polyclonal Ighγ1/γ1 and Ighε/ε mice (which initially produce only IgG1 or IgE from their respective native genomic configurations) to examine the role of IgH isotype on BCR function. We use microarray expression analysis to compare the internal state of the three IgH isotype specific B-cells. Microarray was used to compare the expression level of various genes in splenic follicular B-cells of Ighε/ε,  Ighγ1/γ1 and Ighwt mice. Each mouse strain also had a naturally pre-assembled Ig light chain (VJk5).

DESIGN
The follicular B-cells were sorted form spleen of polyclonal Ighε/ε, Ighγ1/γ1 and Ighwt mice. RNA extracted from trizol was used for the analysis. 3 independent replicates were performed.
