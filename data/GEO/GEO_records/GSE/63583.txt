TITLE
Replication-coupled nucleosome assembly and positioning by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We have previously shown that Okazaki fragments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are sized according to the chromatin repeat. Here we demonstrate that nucleosome positioning is rapidly established on newly synthesized DNA. Using deep sequencing, we demonstrate that ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes, Isw1 and Chd1, collaborate with histone chaperones, such as CAF-1 and Rtt106, to remodel nucleosomes, as they are loaded. Importantly, we find that nucleosome positioning is ultimately specified by select sequence-specific DNA-binding factors, which serve as physical cues for chromatin remodeling. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of how chromatin structures are replicated in vivo, and show that chromatin structure at gene promoters is rapidly established after DNA replication.  Altogether, our data provide evidence for coordinated “loading and remodeling” of nucleosomes behind the replication fork, in collaboration with packing of nucleosomes against a barrier.

DESIGN
7 samples, including a wild type, are included. All are single-end sequenced via Ion Torrent PGM methodology.
