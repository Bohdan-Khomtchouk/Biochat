TITLE
Trf4p in vivo crosslinking and ribonucleoprotein-immunopurification-chip analysis (X-RIP-Chip)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In vivo cross-linking and ribonucleoprotein-immunopurification experiments followed by microarray analysis of bound RNAs (X-RIP-chip). Cells expressing recombinant tandem-affinity purification (TAP)-tagged Trf4 protein were cross-linked with formaldehyde, and Trf4-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes were recovered by affinity selection on IgG-coupled beads (see linked protocol). As a control for non-specifically enriched RNAs, the same experiment was done with untagged WT cells and with cells expressing Fpr1-TAP, a peptidyl-prolyl-cis-trans-isomerase not expected to bind RNA. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Antigenic peptide used in IP: Protein A derivative
