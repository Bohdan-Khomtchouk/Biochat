TITLE
Impact of NCoR1 on global transcriptomic profiling in intestinal epithelial cells during development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular events engaged following the deletion of NCoR1 in intestinal tissue during development, we performed global transcriptional profiling in wild type (F/FUN) and NCoR1 intestinal deletion (Î”IECUN) mice at neonates (day 12) and adults (week 10) by utilizing RNA-seq technology.

DESIGN
Intestine RNA was prepared from F/FUN and DIECUN mice at either 12-day old (neonates) or 10-week old (adults) for RNA-seq. RNA from two mice were pooled and a total three samples per strain were used for RNA-seq studies. Polyadenylated mRNA was purified with the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (ThermoFisher). The mRNA libraries were prepared for strand-specific sequencing as previously described 58and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 by running 36 cycles. Image deconvolution, quality value calculation, and the mapping of exon reads and exon junctions were performed. Sequencing reads were aligned to the Mus musculus (UCSC mm9) genome.
