TITLE
mRNA profiling of iPSCs and derivative NT-ESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pluripotent cells can be derived from somatic cells by either overexpression of defined transcription factors (resulting in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)) or by nuclear transfer or cloning (resulting in NT-ESCs). To determine whether cloning further reprograms iPSCs, we used iPSCs as donor cells in nuclear transfer experiments.

DESIGN
An iPSC clone derived from tail-tip fibroblasts using adenoviral vectors was used as donor cell in nuclear transfer experiments. RNA was isolated from both parental iPSC clone and derivative NT-ESCs lines and analyzed.
