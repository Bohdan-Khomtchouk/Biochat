TITLE
Programmed cell senescence during embryonic development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cellular senescence disables the proliferation of damaged cells and it is relevant for cancer and aging. Here, we show that cellular senescence occurs during mammalian embryonic development. Specifically, we have focused on the mouse regressing mesonephros and the endolymphatic sac of the inner ear. Senescence is characterized by SAβG activity, heterochromatinization, and proliferative arrest. Mechanistically, developmentally-programmed senescence at the mesonephros and endolymphatic sac is strictly dependent on p21, but independent of DNA damage, p53 or other cell cycle inhibitors, and it is regulated by the TGFβ/SMAD and PI3K/FOXO pathways. Developmentally-programmed senescence is followed by macrophage infiltration and clearance of senescent cells. Abrogation of senescence by p21 deletion is only partially compensated by apoptosis and originates detectable developmental abnormalities. Importantly, high levels of p21 are also associated to the regressing mesonephros and endolymphatic sac in human embryos. These findings place cellular senescence as a relevant morphogenic process during embryonic development.

DESIGN
We microdissected mesonephric tubules from senescent (WT) and non-senescent (p21-null) embryos to get information about this new senescence that occurs during embryogenesis.
