TITLE
Effect of clp1 induction on rbf1-dependent gene regulation

ORGANISM
Ustilago maydis

SUMMARY
The clp1 gene is a b-regulated gene that is required for clamp formation during the biotrophic growth phase of U. maydis. Interaction studies demonstrated that Clp1 imnteracts with Rbf1, the central regulator of pathogenciity. To exclude b-dependent effects the experiments were performed in a b-null background to analyze clp1-depndent effects on rbf controlled gene regulation

DESIGN
Strains  UKH156 (nitrate inducible Rbf1 expression) and UKH164 (arabinose-inducible Clp1 and and nitrate-inducible Rbf1 expression) were grown for 12h in liquid array medium/nitrate/arabinose.
