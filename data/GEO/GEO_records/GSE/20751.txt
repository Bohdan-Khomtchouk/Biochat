SUMMARY
Here, we report the genome-wide analysis of snRNAs that are bound to Gemin5 upon protein synthesis inhibition. Upon protein synthesis inhibition, the SMN complex that has a crucial role in the biogenesis of snRNPs dissociates into its subunits, leaving Gemin5 alone. The existence of these subunits was confirmed using a proteomics approach. As Gemin5 has been previously reported to be the RNA-binding protein of the SMN complex, we obtained the sequence of all Gemin5 immunoprecipitated snRNAs. We found that snRNAs that were accumulated on Gemin5 contained extra genomic sequences at the 3'-end. We were thus able to identify novel precursors of all the snRNAs that have not been identified previously. This study also provides a detailed method for the characterization of in vivo captured RNPs using a ribo-proteomics approach.
