TITLE
Specification and Diversification of Pericytes and Smooth Muscle Cells from Mesenchymoangioblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recently, we identified mesenchymoangioblast (MAB), as a clonal mesodermal precursor for mesenchymal and endothelial cells. Here we show, that MABs have the capacity to produce mesenchymal progenitors, which can be differentiated into pericytes or smooth muscles cells under the influence of PDGF-BB or TGFÎ² plus sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), respectively. Based on these studies we established the hierarchy of vasculogenic progenitors that provides the platform for interrogation of molecular mechanisms regulating vasculogenic cell specification and diversification from primitive posterior mesoderm.

DESIGN
Vasculogenic cells generated under specific culture conditions. Primary cells were used as control.
