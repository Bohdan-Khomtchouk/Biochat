TITLE
Expression data of E13.5 mouse Blood Brain Barrier and lung endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Following the identification of a critical time window of Blood Brain Barrier formation in the mouse embryo, we aimed to identify genes important for barriergenesis. To this end, we isolated cortical and lung E13.5 endothelial cells and compared expression between the two populations. The working hypothesis was that endothelial cells which are actively building a barrier would have a uniqe pattern of gene expression that would be detectable in comparison to a non-barrier endothelial population that is also active in vasculogenesis.

DESIGN
E13.5 Tie2-GFP embryos were micro-dissected for cortex and lungs. Cortex tissue was carefully cleared of the meninges and choroid plexus. FACS purification of GFP positive cells and GeneChip analysis was applied . All material from a single litter (10-13 embryos) was pooled and considered as a biological replicate. n=4 litters.
