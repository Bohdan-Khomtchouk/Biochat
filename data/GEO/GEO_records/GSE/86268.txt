TITLE
Gene expression profile for L1CAM knockdown in esophageal squamous carcinoma cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The protein encoded by this gene is an axonal glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin supergene family. The ectodomain, consisting of several immunoglobulin-like domains and fibronectin-like repeats (type III), is linked via a single transmembrane sequence to a conserved cytoplasmic domain. This cell adhesion molecule plays an important role in nervous system development, including neuronal migration and differentiation. Mutations in the gene cause X-linked neurological syndromes known as CRASH (corpus callosum hypoplasia, retardation, aphasia, spastic paraplegia and hydrocephalus). Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants, some of which include an alternate exon that is considered to be specific to neurons.

DESIGN
shRNA sequences targeting L1CAM was ligated into the pGLV3/H1/GFP/+Puro Vector and transfected into ESCC cell line KYSE150 with an empty plasmid as a control. The mRNA expression profiles of L1CAM knockdown was analyzed by GeneChip® PrimeView™ Human Gene Expression Array (Affymetrix, USA). The knockdown of L1CAM was confirmed by QRT-PCR and Western blot. Total RNAs from L1CAM knockdown cells and control cells were extracted for GeneChip® PrimeView™ Human Gene Expression Array.
