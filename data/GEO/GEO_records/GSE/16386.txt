TITLE
Expression data from human alternatively activated macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human CD14 positive monocytes were purified from healthy volunteersâ€™ blood and cultured in vitro for 6 hours. While culturing, macrophages were activated alternatively with interleukin-4 (IL-4 100 ng/ml). Simultaneously, macrophages were also treated with vehicle (DMSO:ethanol) or 1uM synthetic PPARg agonist, Rosiglitazone. We used Affymetrix microarrays (U133Plus 2.0) to analyze activation and PPARg-induced gene expression changes.

DESIGN
Monocytes from 2 donors were used and treated as indicated in Summary. Technical replicates were generated from each sample.
