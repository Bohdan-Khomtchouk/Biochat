TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in mouse jejunum following exposure to the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 or Fibroblast growth factor-7.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine whether Ex-4 and Fgf7 acitvate a subset of overlapping gene expression profiles in mouse jejunum.

DESIGN
Total RNA islolated from mucosal scrapings taken from the jejunum of C57BL/6 male mice treated with a single dose of Ex-4 (10 nmol/kg, ip), human recombinant KGF/Fgf7 (1 mg/kg, ip), or vehicle/control (PBS) for 1 h (n=3 for each group), 5h (n=4 for each group), or 20 h (n=3 for each group).
