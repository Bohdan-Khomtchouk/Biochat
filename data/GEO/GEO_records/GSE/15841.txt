TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of short-term transcriptional responses in thrombin-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The strength and duration of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation can define the phenotypic outcome of cells. Stimualtion of the proteinase-activated receptor (Par) triggers a Gi-dependent long-lasting transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and subsequent ERK1/2 phosphorylation. To understand the mechnaisms underlying this signaling cascade, microarray analysis was performed in vascular smooth muscle cells.

DESIGN
Par receptors on neonatal rat aortic smooth muscle cells were stimulated with thrombin or TRAP in presence or abscence of Gi-uncoupling pertussis toxin.
