TITLE
Integrated epigenome profiling of repressive histone modifications, DNA methylation and gene expression in normal and malignant urothelial cells [ChIP-Seq data]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled two repressive histone modifications (H3K9m3 and H3K27m3) using ChIP-Seq in normal urothelial cells and cell lines representing non-invasive and invasive tumors.

DESIGN
Two bladder cancer cell lines (RT112 and EJ/T24 from ATCC) and normal human urothelial (NHU) cells were treated according to standard ChIP-Seq protocols using antibodies against the histone modifications H3K9m3 and H3K27m3 (from Millipore). The sequencing reads were mapped against the human genome (GRCh37/hg19).
