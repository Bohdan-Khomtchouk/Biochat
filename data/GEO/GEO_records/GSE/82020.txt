TITLE
Ovol2 expression in germ cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze gene expression patterns of mouse Ovo-like gene family genes, global gene expression profiles of ES cells and germ cells were determined by Agilent microarray.

DESIGN
ES cells were cultured as undifferentiated state on feeder layers. For harvesting the ES cells, the stem cells were separated from feeder cells, and RNA was extracted from the ESCs. Embryonic germ cells were isolated from Oct4-GFP mice by FACS and RNAs were extracted from purified germ cells.
