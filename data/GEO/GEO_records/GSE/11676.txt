TITLE
Gene expression variations caused by dietary changes in methy-donor content

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we adapted and tested the applicability of Methylation Specific Digital Karyotyping (MSDK), a non-array based method, for the prospective analysis of epigenetic changes after perinatal nutritional modifications in a mouse model of allergic airway disease. As part of the same study we also analyzed the gene expression profiles by SAGE.

DESIGN
Pairwise comparison of two pools of two individual mouse lung tissue samples.
