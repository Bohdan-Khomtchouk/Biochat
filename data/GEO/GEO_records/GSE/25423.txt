TITLE
LSD1 knockdown in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Obesity is often associated with a low-grade systemic inflammation state that contributes to the development of insulin resistance and atherosclerotic complications. This is usually coupled with increased macrophage infiltration in the adipose tissue and a defect in adipocyte differentiation that results in accumulation of hypertrophic fat cells characterized by a deregulated pattern of adipokine expression. Here we show that knockdown of histone demethylase lsd1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes results in defective adipogenesis and derepression of an inflammatory program in these cells.

DESIGN
The dataset consists of four sample groups: [1] 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (passage 19) transfected with a control scrambled siRNA at 24h after transfection (siC.24h), [2] 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (p.19) transfected with a siRNA directed against LSD1 at 24h after transfection (siLsd1.24h), [3] 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (p.21) transfected with a control scrambled siRNA at 48h after transfection (siC.48h), and [4] 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (p.21) transfected with a siRNA directed against LSD1 at 48h after transfection (siLsd1.48h). The 24h sample groups (siC.24h and siLsd1.24h) consist of two biological replicate samples; the 48h sample groups (siC.48h and siLsd1.48h) consist of three biological replicate samples. Each sample was hybridized to a separate array, for a total of ten arrays.
