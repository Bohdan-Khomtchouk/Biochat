TITLE
Epigenomic Evolution of Diffuse Large B-cell Relapse

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we characterize an association between disease progression and DNA methylation in Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). By profiling genome-wide DNA methylation at single base-pair resolution in thirteen DLBCL diagnosis-relapse sample pairs, we show DLBCL patients exhibit heterogeneous evolution of tumor methylomes during relapse. We identify differentially methylated regulatory elements and determine a relapseâ€“associated methylation signature converging on key pathways such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptor activity.  We also observe decreased intra-tumor methylation heterogeneity from diagnosis to relapsed tumor samples. Relapse-free patients display lower intra-tumor methylation heterogeneity at diagnosis compared to relapsed patients in an independent validation cohort. Furthermore, intra-tumor methylation heterogeneity is predictive of time to relapse.  Therefore, we propose that epigenomic heterogeneity may support or drive the relapse phenotype and can be used to predict DLBCL relapse.

DESIGN
Using ERRBS, we profiled genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of non-relapse DLBCL tumor samples at diagnosis, relaspe DLBCL patient samples at diagnosis and relaspe.
