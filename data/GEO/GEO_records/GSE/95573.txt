Whole transcriptome analysis of PBMCs stimulated with either a P. aeruginosa phage PNM lysate or with its bacterial host  P. aeruginosa

SUMMARY
The ability of bacteriophages to kill bacteria is well known, as is their potential use as alternatives to antibiotics. As such, bacteriophages reach high doses locally through infection of their bacterial host in the human body. In this study we assessed the gene expression profile, by means of whole transcriptome analysis, of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from a healthy human donor and stimulated with a Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage PNM lysate, or P. aeruginosa strain 573. The PBMCs were stimulated for 20 h, followed by lysis of the cells and RNA extraction. In total, three stimulations were performed: control sample (i.e. not stimulated), P. aeruginosa phage PNM lysate and P. aeruginosa strain 573. Each stimulation was conducted in triplicate. The transcriptome analysis showed that the phage induce a clear immunological responses. Both pro- and anti-inflammatory genes were up-regulated in the PBMCs in the presence of the phage or its bacterial host. Our results indicate that bacteriophages might play a bigger role in the  immune response then previously described and might have a broader effect than the clearing of bacterial infections alone, such as the suppression of the immune response to benefit their own survival.
