TITLE
Comparison of mRNA expression between wildtype and Wnt9b-/- isolated metanphric mesenchyme from E11.5 kidneys.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wnt9b is expressed in the ureteric bud of the kidney at all stages of development. In Wnt9b mutants, the ureteric bud forms but the metanephric mesenchyme is never induced to undergo differentiation. We used microarrays to compare differences in gene expression between wildtype and Wnt9b mutants. To focus on direct targets, mesenchymes isolated away from the E11.5 ureteric bud were assayed

DESIGN
Ell.5 kidneys were manually dissected away from embryos collected from Wnt9b+/- intercrosses. Mesenchymes were isolated away from the ureteric bud after a brief enzymatic digestion (trypsin/pancreatin). Paired mesenchymes were stored int RNA-Later until the genotype was determined. 25-30 Wnt9b-/- or Wnt9b+/- mesenchymes were pooled for each replicate (giving approx. 1ug of total RNA). cRNA was synthesized and hybridized to the Affymetrix  GeneChip Mouse Genome 430.2 Array.
