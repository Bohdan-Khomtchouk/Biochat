TITLE
Differential gene expression between female hNAG-1 transgenic and Wt mice in abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the mechanism of extended lifespan in hNAG-1 mice, we used whole genome microarray analysis to examine differential gene expression in abdominal WAT in hNAG-1 mice. Differential category expression analysis may show significant differences between hNAG-1 mice and WT mice in key pathways in the regulation of metabolism and mammalian lifespan. In addition, To explore the reason why hNAG-1 mice are leaner than Wt littermates.

DESIGN
A total of 6 animals from each genotype were used and WAT was extacted from each mouse, we then pooled two sample as one sample for each genotype to be used in microarray experiment.
