TITLE
Analysis of Hybrid Incompatability between C nigoni and C briggsae by mRNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis briggsae ; Caenorhabditis nigoni

SUMMARY
Two introgression strains (ZZY10307 and ZZY10330) of C. briggsae onto the X chromosome of C. nigoni results in male sterility. In order to determine the cause, we sequenced the mRNAs from young adult males from these two strains, and compared to fertile males of the two parent species (AF16 and JU1421). Two wild-type female samples were also included as platform QC.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of young adult male worms from sterile hybrid strains (ZZY10307 and ZZY10330) and normal fertile parental strains (JU1421 and AF16) were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina MiSeq V2 kit in 2*150 pair-end format.
