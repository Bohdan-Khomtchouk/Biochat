TITLE
Expression from dark grown Arabidopsis Wild type (Wt, Col-o) and ein3-1eil1-1 (AT3G20770, AT2G27050) mutant seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that plays important roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. EIN3 was identified as a plant-specific transcription factor and its protein level rapidly increases upon ethylene treatment. We found that activation of EIN3 and EIN3-like 1 (EIL1) is both necessary and sufficient for ethylene-induced enhancement of seedling greening, as well as repression of the accumulation of protochlorophyllide, a phototoxic intermediate of chlorophyll synthesis. Therefore, comparation of the Wt and ein3-1eil1-1 mutant etiolated seedlings' gene expression at genome wide will be helpfull for us  to find the EIN3/EIL1 target genes in chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway. Here we used microarrays to detail the global gene expression under the regulation of EIN3/EIL1.Here we used microarrays to detail the global gene expression under the regulation of EIN3/EIL1.

DESIGN
4 days dark grown Wt and ein3-1eil1-1 (AT3G20770, AT2G27050) double mutant seedlings were collected for isolation RNA. Standard Affymetrix protocal and 25K Affymetrix chip (ATH1) were used for Microarry hybridization.
