TITLE
The within-host dynamics of infection in trans-generationally primed beetles

ORGANISM
Tribolium castaneum

SUMMARY
We report the temporal dynamics of differential gene expression between primed and unprimed beetles infected with the entomopathogen Bt

DESIGN
Tribolium castaneum larvae from mothers who had (primed treatment) or had not (unprimed treatment) been pricked with heat killed Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) were infected with an LD50 dose of Bt and then sacrificed at 0 hours (uninfected) or 2,6,8,12 hours post infection. This experiment was repeated twice (TS1 or TS2). The extracted RNA was used to prepare mRNA libraries using the Illumina TruSeq v2 kit and sequenced on the Hiseq
