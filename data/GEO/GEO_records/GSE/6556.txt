TITLE
Expression profiling of A. thaliana wild type Columbia-0 and mutant gh3.5-1D in response to pathogen Pst DC3000(avrRpt2)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of GH3.5 action in modulating the SA and auxin pathways, we performed transcriptional profiling of gh3.5-1D plants after infection with or without Pst DC3000(avrRpt2) on a global scale using the Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip Keywords: Pathogen-response

DESIGN
Each 3 leaves of plants of 5-week-old wild type Columbia-0 and mutant gh3.5-1D (heterozygous) were inoculated with Pst DC3000(avrRpt2)at 105 cfu mL-1. Leaves were harvested at 0 h (uninoculated) and 48 hours after inoculation. Three biological repeats were performed on Columbia-0 (wild-type, Col-0) and gh3.5-1D (mutant) after infection with or without Pst DC3000(avrRpt2), respectively.
