TITLE
Gene expression profile of normal human mammary epithelial stem/progenitor and myoepithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There is increasing evidence that breast and other cancers originate from and are maintained by a small fraction of stem/progenitor cells with self-renewal properties. Whether such cancer stem/progenitor cells originate from normal stem cells based on initiation of a de novo stem cell program, by reprogramming of a more differentiated cell type by oncogenic insults or both remains unresolved.  A major hurdle in addressing these issues is lack of immortal human stem/progenitor cells that can be deliberately manipulated in vitro.  We present evidence that normal and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)-immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (hMECs) isolated and maintained in DFCI-1 medium retain a fraction with progenitor cell properties.  These cells co-express basal, luminal and stem/progenitor cell markers.  Clonal derivatives of progenitors co-expressing these markers fall into two distinct types: K5+/K19- (Type I) and K5+/K19+ (Type II).  We show that both types of progenitor cells have self-renewal and differentiation ability. Through microarray analysis, we want to identify genes and pathways linked to human mammary epithelial stem/progenitor cell self-renewal and differentiation.

DESIGN
Normal human mammary epithelial cells (hMECs) were isolated from Reduction Mammoplasty and immortalized by hTERT.  Type I K5+/K19-  and Type II K5+/K19+  cell colonies were isolated from hTERT-immortalized hMECs and cultured in MEGM medium for self-renewal and differentiation. Total RNA isolated from Type I, Type II, and differentiated Myoepithelial (Myo) cells were used on Affymetrix microarrays.
