TITLE
Gene expression patterns of biopsies from a colonoscopy taken in 2008 of an ulcerative colitis patient infected with Trichuris trichiura

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Helminth infection may have the potential to suppress intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases. Ulcerative colitis is more common in developed countries than in developing countries endemic for helminth infections. There are animal models, as well as clinical trials, suggesting therapeutic effects of experimental helminth infection. Here, we provide a comprehensive molecular portrait of dynamic changes in the intestinal mucosa of an individual who infected himself with Trichuris trichiura to treat his symptoms of ulcerative colitis. Genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were upregulated in helminth-colonized tissue, while tissues with active colitis showed upregulation of proinflammatory genes such as IL-17, IL13RA2, and CHI3L1. T. trichiura colonization of the intestine may reduce symptomatic colitis by promoting goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus production through TH2 cytokines and IL-22. By better understanding the physiological effects of helminth infection, new therapies for ulcerative colitis could be identified. This is the second (out of three) series of arrays from this patient from a colonoscopy in 2008 when the patient was suffering from severe colitis but still had worms in the ascending colon.

DESIGN
We analyzed 12 HEEBO arrays on which were hybridized RNA amplified from pinch biopsies collected from different regions of the colon. 4 samples were from the ascending colon, which was colonized by worms at the time. 4 samples were from the transverse colon, which was no longer colonized by worms at the time. 4 samples were from the recto-sigmoid colon, which was suffering from severe colitis at the time.
