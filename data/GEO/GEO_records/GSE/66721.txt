TITLE
Suppression of virus-induced CCL2, CXCL10 and IL-6:  biomarkers of Lactobacillus-mediated protection at the respiratory tract

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this manuscript, we present a more extensive analysis of inflammatory suppression mediated by L. plantarum at the respiratory tract.  Via full genome microarray of whole lung tissue, we have generated an extensive list of soluble proinflammatory mediators that are expressed in response to PVM infection and we identify those mediators that are suppressed and also those that are not suppressed in response to L. plantarum priming.  We focused further study on three specific virus-induced soluble mediators that are differentially expressed and that serve as specific biomarkers for Lactobacillus-mediated survival in response to acute respiratory virus infection.  Among several novel directions, we use these biomarker cytokines to explore Lactobacillus-mediated actions at the respiratory tract that are unique and distinct from those taking place at gastrointestinal mucosa.
