TITLE
FAIRE-seq in primary human megakaryocytes, erythroblasts and monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Maps of open chromatin in three primary human blood cell types of the myeloid lineage (megakaryocytes, erythroblasts and monocytes) using the formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements method followed by next-generation sequencing (FAIRE-seq). We also generated FAIRE-seq data in the megakaryocytic cell line CHRF-288-11. In addition to our data sets, we retrieved FAIRE-seq data for the erythroblastoid cell line K562 (ENCODE Project Consortium 2012) and pancreatic islets (Gaulton et al. 2010), and reanalyzed these data sets using the same methodology.

DESIGN
Genome-wide open chromatin profiles of megakaryocytes, erythroblasts and monocytes (in each 2 individuals), pancreatic islets (1 individual), CHRF 288-11 megakaryocytic cells (2 samples) and K562 erythroblastoid cells (2 samples).
