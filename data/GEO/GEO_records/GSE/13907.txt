TITLE
Medicago truncatula seedlings grown two weeks in hydroponics media then carry out salt stress

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
time-course salt stress experiment of model legume Medicago truncatula roots using Affymetrix Medicago Array, aimed to dig some useful gene for improve salt resistance for legumes and other crops

DESIGN
6 samples of Medicago truncatula seedlings grown two weeks in hydroponics media 200mM NaCl salt stress material collect at 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 24 hour after salt stress beginning 2 ug of total RNA was used to synthesize doublestranded cDNA

PLATFORM
GPL4652 [Medicago] Affymetrix Medicago Genome Array
