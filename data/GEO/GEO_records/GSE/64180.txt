TITLE
Expression data from human effector CD4 T cells co-cultured with various Treg subsets sorted from  human peripheral blood.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Teff cells (CD4+CD25-CD127+CD45RO+) were co-cultured with and without sorted Treg subsets plus dendritic cells for 18h. All the sorted Teff cells are gated on CD4+CD25-CD127(hi), and further sorted for CD45RO- and CD45RO+ phenotype.

DESIGN
The impact of different Treg subsets on Teff cell gene expression was analyzed.
