TITLE
TOXICOLOGY TAILORED LOW DENSITY MICROARRAY FOR THE THICKLIP GREY MULLET Chelon labrosus DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND VALIDATION

ORGANISM
Chelon labrosus

SUMMARY
The widely distributed thicklip grey mullet (Chelon labrosus) has been proposed as a suitable sentinel of pollution since it is able to survive heavily polluted marine/estuarine waters. Previous studies applying molecular to histological level biomarkers have indicated that mullets respond to exposure to chemical compounds. Microarrays are used to identify gene pathways responsive to specific chemical exposures. In this context, fragments of 129 genes relevant in peroxisome proliferation, detoxification, lipid metabolism, inflammatory/immune response, metal sequestration, oxidative and general stress, cell cycle regulation and proliferation, apoptosis, protein synthesis/degradation, and endocrine disruption were cloned through homological cloning using degenerate primers for microchip creation. Additional 31 sequences available in databases belonging to mugilid fishes were included in the final Agilent custom-microchip design. Female multitissue transcritome analysis was performed in mullets from Ondarrua. 108 genes showed differential expression when comparing female brain, gonad, gill and liver. Typical brain transcripts such as aromatase or dopamine receptor were expressed preferentially in the brain, whereas liver specific genes were detected in the liver; choriogenin-L, vitellogenins, fibrinogens or hepatocyte growth-factor. Genes related to peroxisome proliferation were systematically overrepresented in gonads.

DESIGN
Female thicklip grey mullet tissue transcriptome comparission from Ondarrua, Basque Country GSM861357-GSM861379: 23 samples: 5 female samples from Gonad: female-Ondarru (F-L); 6 female samples from gonad: female-Ondarru (F-GO); 6 female samples from gill: female-Ondarru (F-GI); 6 female samples from brain: female-Ondarru (F-B); GSM886139-GSM886153: 15 samples:  2 intersex samples from Ondarru (I-L); 2 intersex gonad samples: intersex-Ondarru (I-GO); 6 female hepatic samples: female-Arriluze (F-A); 5 male  hepatic samples: male-Arriluze (M-A) Immature Thicklip grey mullets were exposed to accetone, cadmium, benzo(a)pyrene and to nonylphenol and hepatic transcriptome was compared GSM886154-GSM886183: 30 samples: immature thicklip grey mullets hepatic samples 6 control seawater exposed samples, 6 acetone exposed samples; 6 cadmium exposed samples, 6 benzo(a)pyrene exposed samples (BAP) and 6 nonylphenol (NP) exposed samples.
