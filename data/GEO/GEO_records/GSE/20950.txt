TITLE
Expression data from human adipose tissue using an expanded patient cohort

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Obesity is a risk factor for numerous metabolic disorders; however, not all obese individuals are prone to insulin resistance.  The central aim of this study was to identify molecular pathways directly related to insulin resistance independent of BMI in obesity. We sought to determine the gene expression signature of adipose tissue in a body mass index (BMI)-matched obese cohort of patients that are either insulin sensitive or insulin resistant.

DESIGN
We determined the global gene expression signatures of omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue samples obtained from insulin-sensitive obese and insulin-resistant obese patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery. The SQ sample for Insulin Resistant Patient 6 has been removed from the study.
