TITLE
Expression data from EμMyc;Prdm11 WT and EμMyc;Prdm11 KO end-stage splenic tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The PR-domain family (PRDMs) encodes transcriptional regulators, several of which are deregulated in cancer. We found that loss of Prdm11 accelerates MYC-driven lymphomagenesis in the Eµ-Myc mouse model. Expression data from EμMyc;Prdm11 WT and EμMyc;Prdm11 KO end-stage splenic tumors to identify genes deregulated by loss of Prdm11

DESIGN
9  EμMyc;Prdm11 WT and 9 EμMyc;Prdm11 KO end-stage splenic tumors

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
