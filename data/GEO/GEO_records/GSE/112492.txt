TITLE
Differential miRNA expression profiles of colorectal DLD1 and HT29 cell lines grown under 3D cell culture conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study we investigated the microenvironment-dependent changes of miRNA expression in colorectal carcinoma DLD1 and HT29 cell lines. Next-generation sequencing technology was employed for the analysis of miRNA expression levels in cells cultivated under 3D multicellular spheroid and 2D culture conditions. The results of our study support the previous observations regarding the role of the tumor microenvironment in the regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, the profile of differentially expressed miRNAs, determined in the present study, could be applied for a further development of diagnostic and therapeutic applications in CRC.

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiles of colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (DLD1 and HT29), grown in two-dimensional monolayer forming culture conditions or in three-dimensional multicellular spheroid culture were examined using Illumina HiSeq 2500 miRNA sequecing by Illumina HiSeq 2500 system.
