TITLE
Role for HA and the viral RNA polymerase complex in the virulence of the 1918 influenza virus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to examine the biological properties of reassortant viruses between the 1918 virus and a contemporary human H1N1 virus to determine the role of hemagglutinin (HA) and the viral RNA polymerase complex of 1918 virus toward pathogenesis and abberant host responses in mice.

DESIGN
Six- to eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were anesthetized and inoculated with 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Mock) or with 10^6 pfu of virus in a 50 μl volume. There are a total of six biological conditions: wild-type 1918 virus (A/Brevig Mission/1/1918; 1918), wild-type K173 virus (A/Kawasaki/173/2001; K173), three reassortant viruses between 1918 and K173 viruses [1918HA/K173, 1918PB1/K173, and 1918(3P+NP)/K173], and mock-infected control animals. Nine animals per virus group were inoculated, and whole lungs were collected at 1, 3 and 5 days post-inoculation from three animals per virus group per time point. Two of three mice inoculated with 1918 virus and 1918HA/K173 virus died by day 5 post-inoculation. Six animals were inoculated with PBS. Whole lungs from two mock-infected animals per time point were collected and served as the uninfected reference. All samples were processed for lung gene expression analysis using oligonucleotide microarrays. Technical replicates were performed for 9 samples.
