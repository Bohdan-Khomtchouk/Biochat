TITLE
Expression data from ER32 and ER32.40HT IMR90

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IMR90 cells were infected with pLNC-RAS:ER (from Jesus Gil lab) with retroviral gene transfer. Infected cells were drug selected G418. The cells were induced either with ethanol as control or with 100nM final conc 4-hydroxytamoxifen (sigma H7904) for ectopic expression of protein

DESIGN
We used RNA-Seq to detail the global programme of gene expression in human IMR90 oncogene induced senescence

PLATFORM
