TITLE
Analysis of Chromosome VIII of EC-C1 strains (S. cerevisiae)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The genomic DNA of rearranged chromosome VIII (~900kb) of EC9 diploid strain was extracted from the gel of pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and analyzed by array-CGH to identify it's  amplified regions

DESIGN
After PFGE, The ChrVIII DNA was purified from agarose gel and purified by column. Then the DNA was amplified by GenomePlex Whole Genome Amplification Kit for Array-comparative genomic hybridization.

PLATFORM
GPL7305 IMB yeast 7K operon oligo array
