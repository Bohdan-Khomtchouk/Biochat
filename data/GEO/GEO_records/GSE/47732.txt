TITLE
Dynamic Transcriptional Response of Escherichia coli to Inclusion Body Formation

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
DNA microarrays were used to compare the E. coli gene expression response to soluble and insoluble recombinant protein production.  The study objective was to characterize the dynamic transcriptional changes that occur as insoluble recombinant protein is produced

DESIGN
Recombinant cultures producing VP1GFP and GFPCAT in minimal medium (MM) cultures and VP1GFP in ethanol-treated cultures were analyzed.  A total of 15 samples were collected.  Samples were collected at 5, 20, 40, and 60 minutes post-induction for all induced MM cultures and at 60 minutes post-induction for the induced ethanol-treated cultures.  Samples were collected at time 0 and 60 minutes for the uninduced MM and uninduced ethanol-treated cultures.  Time 0 of the ethanol-treated VP1GFP cultures consisted of six biological replicates, while the remaining 14 samples were conducted in biological replicates.  All biological replicates represent expression data from three independent hybridizations.
