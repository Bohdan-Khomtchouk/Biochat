TITLE
Microarray analysis of Zbtb46 KO CD4+ splenic DCs and bone marrow erythroid progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Zbtb46 represses G-CSFR and LifR in cDCs Zbtb46 does not significantly affect gene expression in erythroid progenitors

DESIGN
WT, Het, and KO cells were sorted from BM or spleen and analyzed.  Pre MegE cells were sorted as CD117+ CD150+ CD105-CD41-CD16/32-. Pre CFU-E cells were sorted as CD117+ CD150+ CD105lo CD41- CD16/32-.  CFU-E cells were sorted as CD117+ CD150- CD105+ Cd41- CD16/32-.  Splenic CD4+ DCs were sorted as B220- CD11c+ MHCII+ CD8- CD172+ CD11b+ CD4+.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
