TITLE
Expression data in NK150460 treated breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to investigate certain genes inuduced/reduced by NK150460, novel compound possessing antitumor activity. To identify genes, time course samples were prepared from NK150460 sensitive and insensitive breast cancer cell lines. By comparing patterns in both sensitive and resistant cell lines, we tried to identify genes specifically modulated by NK150460 treatment.

DESIGN
Four breast cance cell lines (3 sensitive cell lines, 1 insensitive cell line) were treated with NK150460 in vitro. 0, 3, 6, 24 hr after drug addition, total RNA were prepared. In total, 16 samples were prepared and subjected to microarray analysis.
