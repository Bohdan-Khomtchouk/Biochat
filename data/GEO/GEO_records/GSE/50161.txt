TITLE
Expression data from human brain tumors and human normal brain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The characteristics of immune cells infiltrating pediatric brain tumors is largely unexplored. A better understanding of these characteristics will provide a foundation for development of immunotherapy for pediatric brain tumors. Gene expression profiles were used to identify immune marker gene that are differentially expressed between various brain tumor types.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were generated from surgical tumor and normal brain samples (n=130) using Affymetrix HG-U133plus2 chips (Platform GPL570). Gene expression profiles of different types of brain tumors and normal brain were filtered to obtain gene expression of key immune cell markers. Comparative analyses between different brain tumors and normal brain was used to identifiy differential immune characteristics of these tumors.
