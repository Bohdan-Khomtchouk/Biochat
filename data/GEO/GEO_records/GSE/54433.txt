TITLE
YHJ8 RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report the application of next-generation sequencing technology for transcription profile analysis of S. cerevisiae strains with different genetic background. By combining the whole genome sequence of these strains, we sought to explore the effects of genome mutations on the transcription diversities.

DESIGN
Comparsion of transcription profiles in S. cerevisiae Chinese rice wine strain with laboratory strain

PLATFORM
GPL13821 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
