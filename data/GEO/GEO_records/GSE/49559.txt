TITLE
Gene expression data from PC3 prostate cells overexpressing control miR or miR-95

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global changes in gene expression resulting from miR-95 overexpression

DESIGN
PC3 prostate cells stably overexpressing control miR or miR-95 were processed for Affymetrix gene array
