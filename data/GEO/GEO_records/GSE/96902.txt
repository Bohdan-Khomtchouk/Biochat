TITLE
protein levels in BRAF/MEK inhibitor resistance melanoma cells treated with PF3758309 [CR]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
3 BRAF/MEK inhibitor resistance melanoma cells were treated with PAK inhibitor PF3758309 for 48 hr, the cell lysis were analyzed by RPPA  profiling by protein array (RPPA)

DESIGN
3 pair of samples were analyzed (control and PF3758309 treatment group) by RPPA, more than 200 of proteins were tested

PLATFORM
