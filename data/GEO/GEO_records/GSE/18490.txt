TITLE
Whole genome transcriptional profile of human tissues and cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed tiling array experiments to examine whole genome expression in human tissues. We investigated tissue specificity and association between evolutionary sequence conservation and transcription. A total of 22 tissues (bone marrow, cerebellum, colon, cortex, fetal brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, salivary gland, skeletal muscle, small intestine, spinal cord, spleen, stomach, testes, thymus, thyroid, trachea and uterus) and 2 cell lines (HeLa and SH-SY5Y) were examined in 36783546 regions of the Human genome in this study. Keywords: whole genome transcription, tiling array, non-coding transcripts, tissue specificity
