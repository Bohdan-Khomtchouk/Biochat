TITLE
Dengue patients whole blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole blood RNA (PAXgene tubes) was collected from 14 Dengue patients after hospital admission.  Additional samples were collected at later time points from 6 of the patients, and single samples were also collected from 4 healthy donors.  RNA was amplified using the MessageAmp kit (Ambion), and reverse transcribed.  Each sample was labelled with Cy5, and hybridized to a Lymphochip cDNA array along with amplified human reference RNA labelled with Cy3(Universal Human Reference RNA, Stratagene).  Analysis was restricted to those array elements (LUIDs) with signal intensity/background of at least 2.5 in either channel for at least 80% (28/34) of the samples, and a regression correlation of 0.6.  We characterized gene expression patterns associated with acute dengue infection, and identified a set of transcripts associated with diagnosis of Dengue Shock Syndrome.
