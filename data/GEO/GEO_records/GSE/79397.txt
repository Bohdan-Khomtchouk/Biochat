TITLE
Effect of LPS and glutathione depletion on gene expression profiling in mouse macrophage-like cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By microarray gene expression profiling, we investigated whether glutathione (GSH) has a signaling role in the response of RAW 264.7 cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). GSH was depleted by prior incubation with 120 ÂµM buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) for 24 h, then cells were treated with 10 ng/ml LPS for 2 or 6 h. DNA microarray analysis was performed in triplicate samples in control and GSH-depleted cells, in the presence or absence of LPS.

DESIGN
4 conditions, 3 replicates, at 2 h and 6 h

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
