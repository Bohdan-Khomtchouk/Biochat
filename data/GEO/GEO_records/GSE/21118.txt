TITLE
screen differential expressed microRNAs of RA patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We screened the differential expressed microRNA from the rheumatoid arthritis patients and healthy person in their hydrops articuli CD4+ T cells.

DESIGN
We screened the differential expressed microRNA from the rheumatoid arthritis patients and healthy person in their hydrops articuli CD4+ T cells. 1.Isolated the CD4+ T cells from the hydrops articuli cells of 2 rheumatoid arthritis patients. 2.Isolated the CD4+ T cells from healthy person's peripheral blood as control. 3.Isolation of total RNA from CD4+ T cells then sent the samples to KangChen Bio-tech Inc (Shanghai, China) where they were labeled, hybridized, scaned, normalied and transformed to the final data.
