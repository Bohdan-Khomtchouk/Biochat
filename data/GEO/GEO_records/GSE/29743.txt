TITLE
Expression data from mouse B16-F10 cells treated with heat shock (HS), Lipofectamine 2000 (LA), and benzyl alcohol (BA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Three types of stimuli -- heat shock, Lipofectamine 2000 and benzyl alcohol -- induce activity of some stress genes (hsp) in mouse B16-F10 cells. Besides hsp genes induction, each stimulus causes gene expression changes of different sets of genes. We used microarrays to analyze global gene expression changes in mouse B16-F10 cells treated with elevated temperature (heat shock, HS), with Lipofectamine 2000 (LA) or with 40mM benzyl alcohol (BA).

DESIGN
In order to study how lipofection may affect cellular homeostasis, we used Affymetrix microarrays to analyze the whole transcriptome of mouse B16-F10 cells treated with Lipofectamine 2000. To find out which genes are affected, we compared the cells treated with Lipofectamine (LA1, LA2, LA3), the cells treated with 40mM benzyl alcohol (BA1, BA2, BA3), heat-shocked cells (HS1, HS2, HS3) and control, untreated cells (C1-5). RNA was extracted from cells 30 min after treatment.
