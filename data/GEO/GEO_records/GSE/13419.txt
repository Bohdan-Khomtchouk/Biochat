SUMMARY
DNA methylation is essential for silencing transposable elements and some genes in higher eukaryotes, implying that this modification must be tightly controlled. However, accidental changes in DNA methylation can be transmitted through mitosis, as in cancer, or meiosis, leading to epiallelic variation. Here, we demonstrate the existence of an efficient and faithful mechanism that protects against transgenerational loss of DNA methylation in the plant Arabidopsis. This process is specific to the subset of heavily methylated genomic repeats that are targeted by the RNAi machinery, and does not spread into flanking regions. Remethylation is often progressive over two to four sexual generations. This differential and incremental correction of epigenetic defects may preserve genome stability while increasing adaptive opportunities.
