TITLE
Profiling Methylomic Alterations in Postmortem Prefrontal Cortex Tissues of Individuals with Alcohol Use Disorders

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of methylomic alternations related with alcohol use disorders (AUD). The hypothesis is that chronic alcohol consumption might alter genome-wide DNA methylation patterns. The results suggest that differential DNA methylation might be invovled in neuradaptations to alcohol.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was extraced from postmortem prefrontal cortex tissues of 23 AUD cases and 23 matched controls. Both AUD cases and matched controls are assessed with DSM-IV
