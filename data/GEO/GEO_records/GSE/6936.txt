SUMMARY
The cyclin D1 oncogene encodes the regulatory subunit of a holoenzyme that phosphorylates and inactivates the Rb protein and promotes progression through G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. Several prostate cancer cell lines and a subset of primary prostate cancer samples have increased cyclin D1 protein expression. However, the relationship between cyclin D1 expression and prostate tumor progression has yet to be clearly characterized. This study examined the effects of manipulating cyclin D1 expression in either human prostatic epithelial or stromal cells using a tissue recombination model. The data showed that overexpression of cyclin D1 in the initiated BPH-1 cell line increased cell proliferation rate, but did not elicit tumorigenicity in vivo. However, overexpression of cyclin D1 in Normal Prostate Fibroblasts (NPF) that were subsequently recombined with BPH-1 did induce malignant transformation of the epithelial cells. The present study also showed that recombination of BPH-1 + cyclin D1 overexpressing fibroblasts (NPF cyclin D1) resulted in permanent malignant transformation of epithelial cells (BPH-1 NPF-cyclin D1 cells) similar to that seen with Carcinoma Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs). Microarray analysis showed that the expression profiles between CAFs and NPF cyclin D1 cells were highly concordant including cyclin D1 upregulation. These data indicated that the tumor-promoting activity of cyclin D1 may be tissue-specific. Keywords: cyclin D1; stromal-epithelial interactions; prostate cancer; cDNA microarray
