TITLE
RNA abundance in wild-type and rtt109 -/- Candida albicans, with and without peroxide stress

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Candida albicans is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen that is the most prevalent cause of hospital-acquired fungal infections. In mammalian hosts, C. albicans is engulfed by phagocytes that attack the pathogen with DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56) by the fungal-specific histone acetyltransferase Rtt109 is important for yeast model organisms to survive DNA damage and maintain genome integrity. To assess the importance of Rtt109 for C. albicans pathogenicity, we deleted the predicted homologue of Rtt109 in the clinical C. albicans isolate, SC5314. C. albicans rtt109 -/- mutant cells lack acetylated H3K56 (H3K56ac) and are hypersensitive to genotoxic agents. Additionally, rtt109 -/- mutant cells constitutively display increased H2A S129 phosphorylation and elevated DNA repair gene expression, consistent with endogenous DNA damage.

DESIGN
Four independent pairs of biological replicate samples were analyzed to compare RNA levels in wild-type and rtt109 -/- cells. Two experiments were performed: first, in unperturbed cells grown in YPD and second, in cells exposed to H2O2. To account for dye effects, two of the four samples for each experiment were analyzed using Cy3 labeling of the wild-type sample and Cy5 labeling of the mutant sample; the dyes were swapped for the other two biological replicates.
