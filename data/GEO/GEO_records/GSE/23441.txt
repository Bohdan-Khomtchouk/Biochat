TITLE
IGROV1 gene expression analysis after in vivo locoregional treatment with CpG-ODN

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Toll-like receptor 9 synthetic agonist oligodeoxynucleotides expressing CpG motifs are currently evaluated for their anti-tumor activity, mainly in association with DNA-damaging drugs. Microarray expression analyses of genes implicates in DNA repair on tumor cells from mice treated with CpG-OD, revealed a down-regulation in tumor cells. These findings provide the first time evidence that immune cells upon TLR9 engagement can sensitize cancer cells to DNA damaging chemotherapy.
