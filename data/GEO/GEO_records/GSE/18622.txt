TITLE
Expression data from mouse induced chondrogenic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We induced chondrogenic cells from adult mouse dermal fibroblast culture by transduction of c-Myc, Klf4, and SOX9 using retroviral vectors. We selected chondrogenic cells for promoter / enhancer activities of the Col11a2 gene, and established cell lines. We analyzed global gene expression profile of four induced chondrogenic cell lines (MK-4, MK-5, MK-7, and MK-10) using microarrays.

DESIGN
Induced chondrogenic cells (passage 6) were cultured in 60 mm dishes. After reaching confluence, total RNAs were extracted.
