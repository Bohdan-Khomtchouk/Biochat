TITLE
Genes expression profiles of postmenopausal osteoporosis with kidney Yin deficiency

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigate genes expression  profiles of postmenopausal osteoporosis with kidney Yin deficiency in peripheral blood

DESIGN
By TCM syndrome, 10 patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis were divided into three groups: kidney Yin deficiency (n=4), kidney Yang deficiency (n=3), non-kidney deficiency (n=3), another 3 healthy postmenopausal women also were selected as control group. Whole human genome oligo microarray were applied to explore gene expression difference of the groups. Kidney Yin deficiency group was compared with other three groups respectively.
