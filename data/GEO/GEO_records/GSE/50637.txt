TITLE
Transcriptional regulation patterns revealed by high-resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation during cardiac hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To identify the differential transcriptional patterns during postnatal cardiac growth, pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy and adult mouse hearts Results: Our data revealed novel transcriptional patterns during cardiac growth conditions. The results showed that most of the essential genes are regulated by promoter clearance of paused RNA pol II, while de novo recruitment is required for regulation of mostly speclaized genes during cardiac growth. We have identified two major modes of gene regulation durign cardiac hypertrophy and four transcriptional growth patterns. The results are published in January 2013 issue of Journal of Biological Chemistry.

DESIGN
Methods: Hearts were extracted from 1-2day old C57 mice, from mice subjecetd to Transaortic coarctation or adult mice. The hearts were sent to Active Motif for RNA polII and H3K9ac- ChIP-Seq.
