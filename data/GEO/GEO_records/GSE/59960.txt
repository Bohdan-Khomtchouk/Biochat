TITLE
Replicative senescence is associated with nuclear reorganization and DNA methylation at specific transcription factor binding sites (MBD-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary cells enter replicative senescence after a limited number of cell divisions. This process is associated with reproducible changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) at specific sites in the genome. The mechanism that drives senescence-associated DNAm changes remains unknown and may arise through drift in DNAm or through regulated, senescence dependent modifications at specific sites in the genome. In this study, we analyzed the reorganization of nuclear architecture and DNA methylation during long-term culture of human fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). [MethylCap-seq]

DESIGN
Fibroblasts of two female donors (both 43 years old) were culture expanded and DNA was harvested of 10,000,000 cells at early passage (P3 or P5) and late passage (P30 and P33). DNA methylation changes were subsequently analyzed by MethylCap-Seq.
