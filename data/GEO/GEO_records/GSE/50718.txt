TITLE
Comparisons of toxicogenomic responses in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to different sized AgNPs: The impact of size on global gene expression profiles

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To investigate the patterns of global gene expression profiles modulated by the different sized AgNPs and to differentiate their modes of toxicity, zebrafish (Danio rerio) will be exposed to the AgNPs (50, and 150nm) and used for microarray analysis by Agilent Zebrafish Oligo Microarray system. 334 genes overlaped between AgNPs and Ag+ treatments in a total of 7,538 differential expressed genes. Immune response, antigen processing and presentation, response to estradiol stimulus and regulation of RNA metabolic process are most significant GO terms enriched in genes up regulated by four treatments. Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway was enriched among AgNP 50nm and AgNP 150nm activated genes, and specifically induced by AgNP 50nm include cell cycle and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways.

DESIGN
The zebrafish larvae (72hpf) was exposed to AgNPs for 96hour. And then after total RNA extration from the each samples, the AgNPs related gene expression profiles identified using Agilent Zebrafish Oligo Microarray. Significant alterations in gene expression were found for all treatments and many of the gene pathways connected.
