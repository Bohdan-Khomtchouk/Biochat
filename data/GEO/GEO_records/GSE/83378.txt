TITLE
The drought-responsive gene expression in rice panicle

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The young panicles 2 cm length were used for expression analysis in well watered control and drought stressed treatment. The panicle samples from biological replicates of six rice varieties were obtained in three independent experiments. The expression profiles were generated using Affymetrix rice genome arrays.

DESIGN
In this study, six rice varieties were grown in cement enclosed plots. Water was drained for drought stress in the plots at later tillering stage and allowed to dry. The young panicles (2 cm in length) at the onset of the panicle differentiation were sampled and harvested to microarray experiments.
