TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of the zoonotic parasite Trichinella spiralis revealed novel genes in host parasite interaction

ORGANISM
Trichinella spiralis

SUMMARY
Trichinellosis of human and other mammals was caused through the ingestion of the parasite，Trichinella spiralis，contaminated meat. It is a typical zoonotic disease that affects more than 10 million people world-wide. Parasites of Trichinella genus are unique intracellular pathogens. Adult Trichinella parasites directly release newborn larvae which invade striated muscle cells and causes diseases. In this study, we profiled the global transcriptome in the three developmental stages of T. spiralis. The transcriptomic analysis revealed the global gene expression patterns from newborn larval stage through muscle larval stage to adults. Thousands of genes with stage-specific transcriptional patterns were described and novel genes involving host-parasite interaction were identified. More than 45% of the protein-coding genes showed evidence of transcription from both sense and antisense strands which suggests the importance of RNA-mediated gene regulation in the parasite. This study presents a first deep analysis of the transcriptome of T. spiralis, providing insight information of the parasite biology.

DESIGN
Messenger RNA from three developmental stages of T. spiralis was selectively purified from total RNA using oligo-(dT) conjugated magnetic beads. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized guided by oligo-(dT) as a primer.
