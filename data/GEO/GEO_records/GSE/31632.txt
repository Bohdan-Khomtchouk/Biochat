TITLE
Functions of the Mediator subunit Med31 in Candida albicans support a role in shaping species-specific gene expression.

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Mediator is an essential, evolutionarily conserved co-regulator of RNA polymerase II. Studies in model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe showed remarkably conserved roles for Mediator despite high species divergence, and thus whether Mediator contributed to establishment of species-specific gene expression programs within related fungal species remains an open question. Here we show that in the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, the Mediator middle domain subunit Med31 has a conserved role with non-pathogenic model yeasts in regulation of Ace2-dependent cytokinesis genes and stress responses, but also additional roles in the transcription of genes associated with virulence traits: genes related to filamentous growth and gene families expanded in pathogenic vs non-pathogenic yeasts, such as the ALS adhesins and the FGR6 family of filamentous growth regulators. Consistently, Med31 is required for two key virulence attributes of C. albicans: filamentous growth and biofilm formation. Unlike our data in C. albicans, no role for Med31 in adhesin expression has been reported in model yeasts. To show biological relevance for the control over adhesin gene expression, we demonstrate that ALS1 is a relevant Med31 target for development of biofilms. Collectively, our data supports a role for Med31 in shaping species-specific gene expression in related fungal species.

DESIGN
Two-color experimental design comparing cells with a âˆ†med31 mutation with a control strain in which the MED31 gene was reintroduced. RNA from each replicate came from independent cultures.

PLATFORM
GPL9818 NRC-BRI C. albicans expression microarray V2.0
