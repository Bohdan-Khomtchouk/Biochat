TITLE
Gene expression after rapamycin treatment in control, REPTOR or REPTOR-BP knockdown S2 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The first aim was to identify genes whose transcription is induced by rapamycin feeding in Drosophila S2 cells. Secondly, the goal was to find out which contribution the transcription factors REPTOR (=CG13624) and REPTOR-BP (REPTOR-binding partner, =CG18619) has to the observed changes in expression. We thus compared gene epxression between rapamycin and control treated S2 cells in GFP, REPTOR or REPTOR-BP knockdown cells.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates from control knockdown plus/minus rapamycin and REPTOR knockdown plus/minus rapamycin; 2 biological replicates from REPTOR-BP knockdown cells plus/minus rapamycin; together those are 16 samples

PLATFORM
GPL16820 Agilent-021791 D. melanogaster (FruitFly) Oligo Microarray 4x44K v. 2 (Probe Name version)
