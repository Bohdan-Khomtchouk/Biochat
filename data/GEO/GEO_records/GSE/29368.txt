TITLE
CD140a+ human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glial progenitor cells (GPCs) pervade the human brain. These cells express gangliosides recognized by MAb A2B5, and some but not all can generate oligodendrocytes. Since some A2B5+ GPCs express PDGFa receptor (PDGFRa), which is critical to oligodendrocyte development, we asked if PDGFRa-directed sorting might isolate oligodendrocyte-competent progenitors. We used FACS to sort PDGFRa+ cells from the second trimester fetal human forebrain, based on expression of the PDGFRa epitope CD140a. CD140a+ cells could be maintained as mitotic progenitors that could be instructed to either oligodendrocyte or astrocyte phenotype. Transplanted CD140a+ cells robustly myelinated the hypomyelinated shiverer mouse brain. Microarray confirmed that CD140a+ cells differentially expressed PDGFRA, NG2, OLIG1/2, NKX2.2 and SOX2. Some expressed CD9, thereby defining a CD140a+/CD9+ fraction of oligodendrocyte-biased progenitors. CD140a+ cells differentially expressed genes of the PTN-PTPRZ1, wnt, notch and BMP pathways, suggesting the interaction of self-renewal and fate-restricting pathways in these cells, while identifying targets for their mobilization and instruction.

DESIGN
10 samples, 5 CD140a+, and 5 CD140a- sorted samples for individual fetal human brain
