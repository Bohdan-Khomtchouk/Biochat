TITLE
MMP14 knockdown at U87 brain tumor cells.Analyse of the genes responsible for cell division

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Compared to the Scramble U87 cells, MMP14 ablation induces G2M arrest

DESIGN
SABioscience Cell cycle platform, human genes. U87 cells were infected separately with eithr lentivirus carry on Scramble or sh RNA against human MMP14 gene.Equla amount of mRNA was isolated prior RT-PCR  analyses

PLATFORM
GPL16818 SABiosciences Human Cell Cycle PCR assay panel [PAHS-020Z]
