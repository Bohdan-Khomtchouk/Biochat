Hormetic shifting of redox environment by the ROS-producing polyphenol resveratrol protects cells from oxidative stress

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Resveratrol is a natural product that has gained tremendous interest due to multiple reported health-beneficial effects. However, the underlying mechanisms of action of this compound remained largely controversial. Here, we demonstrate that major biological effects of resveratrol might be attributed to its bicarbonate-induced production of phenolic radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide under physiologically relevant conditions. These products derived from low hormetic micromolar concentrations of resveratrol led to gene expression reprogramming, which was mainly controlled by the redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) like 2 (Nrf2), whereas too high concentrations of resveratrol became detrimental for cells. Gentle but significant activation of Nrf2-controlled gene expression resulted in a metabolic switch and reduced cellular redox environment. Thereby cells could be preconditioned against stress, for example to protect primary keratinocytes of the human epidermis from oxidative stress that was induced by metabolization of ethanol. Hormetic shifting of cells by chemical triggers such as resveratrol towards a more reductive state might represent a powerful conceptual framework to improve cellular fitness at low nontoxic concentrations.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from cultured primary neonatal normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) subjected to 16 hours treatment with 50 µM resveratrol (trans-3,5,4’-trihydroxystilbene, RSV) compared to vehicle-treated control NHEKs.
