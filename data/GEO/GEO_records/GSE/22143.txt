TITLE
Transcriptomic impact of microRNAs-449 or microRNAs-34 overexpression in proliferating human airway epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression that occurs in response to miR-449 or miR-34 overexpression in proliferating HAECs.

DESIGN
Each donors were transfected with pre-miR-Negative control, pre-miR-449a and pre-miR-449b. The donors 3 and 4 were morever transfected with pre-miRs-34 (34a, 34b-5p, 34c-5p).
