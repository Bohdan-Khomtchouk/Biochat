Expression data from human glioma tissues

SUMMARY
Gliomas are aggressive lethal solid brain tumors arising from support cells in the central nervous system. Despite intense efforts to optimize the treatment of gliomas, the outcomes of high grade glioma patients are still frustrating. The causes and progress of gliomas have been investigated extensively; however, the genetic factors involved in the development of this disease remain poorly understood. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in different grade glioma tissues and try to find out some genes associated with the tumorigenesis of gliomas.

DESIGN
Grade I to grade IV glioma tissues were selected in surgical operations for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain gene expression profiles. To that end, we hand-selected several genes that were differentially expressed in different grade glioma tissues and then performed a further study to identify the role of these genes in the process of the development of gliomas.
