TITLE
Baf53a is involved in survival of mouse ES cells, which can be compensated by Baf53b.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The human Baf (Brg1/Brm associated factor) complex, also known as the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, is involved in a variety of cellular processes. The pluripotency and self-renewal abilities are major characteristics of embryonic stem (ES) cells and are regulated by the ES cell-specific BAF (esBAF) complex. Baf53a is one of the subunits of the esBAF complex. Here, we found that growth of Baf53a-deficient ES cells was repressed, and expression of p53, p21, and cleaved Caspase 3 was increased. Interestingly, Baf53b, a homologue of Baf53a, rescued cell death of Baf53a-deficient ES cells. Baf53a-deficient ES cells overexpressing exogenous Baf53a or Baf53b remained in the undifferentiated state and proliferated. In summary, our findings suggest that Baf53a is involved in the survival of ES cells, and that Baf53b is able to compensate for this functional aspect of Baf53a.

DESIGN
Comaprison between Baf53a-expressing or Baf53b-expressing Baf53a-deficient ES cells.
