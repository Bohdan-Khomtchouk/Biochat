Expression data from LNCaP cells

SUMMARY
Prostate Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) are considered one of the main reasons the tumor recurrence after chemotherapy. Here we employed a chemoresistant xenograft prostate cancer model in NOD/SCID mice and found CD54 is a reliable new marker for prostate CSCs. Gene expression profile were utilized to analyze stemness-related genes in cancer stem cells.

DESIGN
12 Male NOD/SCID mice were obtained from the Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China). For xenograft generation, 1Ã—106 LNCaP cells were subcutaneously injected into the backs of NOD/SCID mice (n=24). When tumors reached a diameter of 5 mm after 3 d, mice were randomly divided into two groups without castration (12 per group). Mice in the treatment group were administered with cisplatin at a dose of 5 mg/kg every 3 d for 30 d. Mice in the control group were treated with vehicle PBS. Tumors were taken out for microarray assay after 30 d.
