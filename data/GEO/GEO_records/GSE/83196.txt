TITLE
Beta-catenin-regulated genes in pancreatic cancer cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is commonly observed in pancreatic cancer. We therefore sought to identify a gene expression profile associated with the activation of this pathway in pancreatic cancer cells. We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes upon expression of an activated form of beta-catenin or its negative regulator ICAT (beta-catenin-interacting protein 1).

DESIGN
Pancreatic cancer cells stably transfected to express beta-catenin or ICAT were grown in DMEM tissue culture medium containing 10% FBS. Cells were grown in monolayer culture prior to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Three independent samples of each genotype were analyzed.
