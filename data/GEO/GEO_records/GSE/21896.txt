TITLE
Gene expression in LSK cells of C57B/L6, DBA/2J, B.D(Chr5), & D.B(Chr5) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These mouse strains differ in absolute numbers of hematopoietic stem cells but differ genetically only at the Chr 5 congenic locus. We used microarray analysis to identify candidate regulators of hematopoietic stem cells based on differential gene expression patterns.

DESIGN
Triplicate RNA samples, except for duplicate DBA/2J samples,  were isolated from 80,00-137,000 LSK cells from each strain. Each of the 11 samples were analyzed on individual microarrays on two Illumina Sentrix-Mouse 6 Whole Genome Expression Beadhips.

PLATFORM
GPL6238 mouse-6 v1.1 (Illumina)
