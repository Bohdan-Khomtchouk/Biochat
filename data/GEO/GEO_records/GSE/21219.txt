ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

MicroRNA-expression profile of dystrophic single fibres vs wild type single fibers isolated from different muscle of mdx and c57bl mice. Myofibers were isolated from different muscle type (tibialis, diaphragm and quadriceps of gender- (male) and age- (3 month old and half) matched wt and dystrophic mice).
