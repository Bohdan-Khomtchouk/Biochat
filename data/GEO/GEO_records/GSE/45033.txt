TITLE
Effect of CCAR1 depletion on androgen-dependent gene expression in LNCaP cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role in prostate cancer onset and progression, and cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1) functions as an AR co-activator. We performed genome-wide gene expression analysis in control (shNS) and CCAR1-depleted (shCCAR1) LNCaP cells to assess the global effect of CCAR1 on the expression of androgen responsive genes.

DESIGN
LNCaP cells expressing shNS or shCCAR1 were treated with ethanol or 10 nM DHT for 24 hr, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The integrity of RNA was analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Two independent biological replicates were assayed for each sample. The microarrays were performed following the Affymetrix standard protocol.
