TITLE
Spt6 Levels are Modulated by PAAF1 and 26S Proteasome to Regulate the HIV-1 LTR and a Subset of Cellular Genes involved in Cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Effect of PAAF1 and Spt6 knock-down on gene expression. Total RNAs were extracted from HeLa-LTR-Luc cells in which PAAF1 or Spt6 had been knock down by a specific siRNA or HeLa-LTR-Luc cells that had been transfected with a control siRNA (“si Neg”). Differentially expressed genes in PAAF1 knock-down cells were identified by microarray.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates (A / B) in 3 experimental conditions (si-Neg, si-PAAF1, si-Spt6) were analyzed in a single channel experiment.
