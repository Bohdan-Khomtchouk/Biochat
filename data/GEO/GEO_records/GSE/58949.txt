TITLE
Immunogenic epitopes of the meningioma-associated antigen TXNDC16

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used customized peptide arrays of 163 TXNDC16 peptides to identify immunogenic TXNDC16 epitopes and asked whether discrimination of meningioma and control sera is possible with a specific subset selection of all immunogenic epitopes.

DESIGN
CelluSpots™ peptide arrays were manufactured by Intavis (Germany) with 163 TXNDC16 spanning peptides spotted as two replicate subarrays. 15-mer peptides overlapping by 10 amino acids were covalently bound to cellulose membranes with their C-termini. Please note that the non_normalized.txt contains Ch1 Mean values for all samples (each sequence represented in duplicates) and the identifiers in the 'index' column corresponds to those in the 'index' column in raw gpr files; sample data table contains classification values (for each sequence) described in the sample data processing field.
