TITLE
Whole genome expression analysis of a skin biopsy from an individual with multi-organ epithelial inflammation associated with an inherited loss-of-function mutation in EGFR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole-genome expression microarray analysis was performed using RNA extracted from skin biopsies sampled from the affected child as well as 4 pooled, healthy controls. The hypothesis was that the downstream effects of the inherited EGFR loss-of-function mutation in the infant would be evident by enriched pathways and processess linked to the cutaneous roles of the epidemermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Functional analysis of the results identified a multitude of enriched gene ontology (GO) processes, pathways, networks and disease-associated transcripts germane to EGFR signaling in the infant's sample compared to controls. The top 3 up-regulated GO processes were linked to known EGFR functionality: keratinocyte differentiation, keratinization and epidermis development. Innate inflammatory response gene components were among the most significantly up-regulated GO networks. Additionally, regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis, processes known to be controlled by EGFR activation, were identified as significantly down-regulated GO pathways and processes, respectively. There was also down-regulation of transcripts that are normally increased in tumors which show gain-of-function mutations in EGFR (e.g. non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and glioblastoma).

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from a skin biopsy of the infant was compared to skin biopsies from 4 pooled, healthy controls.
