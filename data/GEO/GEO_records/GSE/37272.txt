TITLE
Further Insights into the Mode of Action of the Lipoglycopeptide Telavancin through Global Gene Expression Studies

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Background: Telavancin is a novel semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptide derivative of vancomycin with a decylaminoethyl side chain that is active against Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to methicillin or vancomycin.  This study describes transcriptome alterations in S. aureus strain ATCC29213 treated with telavancin for 15 min and 60 min   in comparing with other agents treatment, including  vancomycin, enduracidin, m-chlorophenylhydrazone.

DESIGN
MHB cultures (biological replicates: N=3) were then grown to exponential phase (OD580=0.35) before the addition of telavancin(8 µg/ml final concentration), or vancomycin (10 /µg ml) or  CCCP (2 µg/ ml );  or enduracidin (1 µg ml) and incubated for an additional 15 min , and 60 min before sampling.  Dye-swapping was performed between samples.
