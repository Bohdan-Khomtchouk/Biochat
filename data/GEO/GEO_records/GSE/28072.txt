TITLE
Expression data from transfected IB3 cells transfected with CFTR mutants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CFTR plasmid constructs were transfected in CF Bronchial IB3 cell cultures using Lipofectamine 2000â„¢.  Global gene mRNA expression profiles at 48 hr after transfection were created with the Affymetrix U133 chip set. We used microarrays to detail the global changes in gene expression occuring as a result of transfecting cells.

DESIGN
CFTR mutants and wild type transfected IB3 cells vs. non-transfected IB3 cells

PLATFORM
GPL96 [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array GPL97 [HG-U133B] Affymetrix Human Genome U133B Array
