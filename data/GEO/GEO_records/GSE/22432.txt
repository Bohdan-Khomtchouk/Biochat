TITLE
TGF-β1 Accelerates Dendritic Cell Differentiation from Common Dendritic Cell Progenitors (CDPs) and Directs Subset Specification Towards Conventional Dendritic Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DCs) in lymphoid tissue comprise conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) that develop from common DC progenitors (CDPs). CDPs are Flt3+c-kitintM-CSFR+ and reside in bone marrow. Here we describe a two-step culture system that recapitulates DC development from c-kithiFlt3-/lo multipotent progenitors (MPPs) into CDPs and further into cDC and pDC subsets. MPPs and CDPs are amplified in vitro with Flt3 ligand, stem cell factor, hyper-IL-6 and insulin- like growth factor-1. The four-factor cocktail readily induces self-renewal of MPPs and their progression into CDPs and has no self-renewal activity on CDPs. The amplified CDPs respond to all known DC poietins and generate all lymphoid tissue DCs in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, in vitro CDPs recapitulate the cell surface marker and gene expression profile of in vivo CDPs and possess a DC-primed transcription profile. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) impacts on CDPs and directs their differentiation towards cDCs. Genome-wide gene expression profiling of TGF-β1-induced genes identified transcription factors, such as interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF-4) and RelB, that are implicated as instructive factors for cDC subset specification. TGF-β1 also induced the transcription factor inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding 2 (Id2) that suppresses pDC development. Thus, TGF-β1 directs CDP differentiation into cDC by inducing both cDC instructive factors and pDC inhibitory factors.
