TITLE
Effects of carbazole-degradative plasmid pCAR1 on biofilm morphology in three Pseudomonas strains.

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida

SUMMARY
To elucidate the impact of the carriage of carbazole-degradative plasmid pCAR1 on biofilm formation by host bacteria, we compared biofilm morphology of pCAR1-free and pCAR1-carrying three Pseudomonas hosts: P. putida KT2440, P. aeruginosa PAO1 and P. fluorescens Pf0-1 using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Although pCAR1 carriage had no significant influence on biofilm formed by PAO1 and Pf0-1, pCAR1-carrying KT2440 became filamentous and formed flat biofilm, whereas pCAR1-free KT2440 formed mushroom-like biofilm. pCAR1 carries three genes encoding nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs); Pmr, Pnd, and Phu. Because intensive filamentous morphology was observed in two double mutants (DpmrDpnd and DpmrDphu), these NAPs cooperatively suppress cell filamentation and flat biofilm formation in KT2440(pCAR1) cells. Based on the results of transcriptome analyses of these double mutants, we could find 32 candidate genes which may be involved in the filamentation of KT2440(pCAR1). Overproduction in KT2440 and KT2440(pCAR1) of three of candidate genes (PP_2193, PP_0308, or PP_0309) induced temporal filamentation of the cells, suggesting that pCAR1 induced the abnormal filamentous morphology of KT2440 cells by overexpression of plural genes including PP_2193, PP_0308, and PP_0309. In addition, pCAR1-borne NAPs suppress the morphological changes probably by decreasing the transcriptome change by pCAR1 carriage.
