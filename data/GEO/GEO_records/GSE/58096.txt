TITLE
The transcriptomic responses of THP1 human monocyte-like cells expressing SP110b to interferon gamma stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SP110b is an interferon (IFN)-induced nuclear protein and may function as a transcriptional co-activator/repressor. IFNγ activates monocytes/macrophages thereby mediating inflammation. However, uncontrolled activation induces monocyte/macrophage cell death, which may cause immunopathology. We have demonstrated that SP110b expression prevented IFNγ-mediated monocyte/macrophage cell death. To explore the molecular mechanisms by which SP110b suppresses IFNγ-induced cell death, we performed a genome-wide microarray analysis to identify genetic determinants associated with IFNγ-induced cell death and regulated by SP110b.

DESIGN
We sought to identify genetic determinants associated with IFNγ-induced cell death and regulated by SP110b. To that end, THP1 human monocyte-like cells that could be induced by doxycycline (Dox) to over-express SP110b (THP1-SP110b) were generated and 5 experimental groups of THP1-SP110b cells were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The 5 groups are as follows: untreated THP1-SP110b cells as control (CON), cells treated with IFNγ for 2 days (IFN_2D), cells treated with Dox plus IFNγ for 2 days (DoxIFN_2D), cells treated with IFNγ for 4 days (IFN_4D), and cells treated with Dox plus IFNγ for 4 days (DoxIFN_4D).
