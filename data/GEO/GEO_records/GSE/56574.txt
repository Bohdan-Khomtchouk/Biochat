TITLE
Gene expression analysis of GzmB-/- hematopoietic stem cells (HSC).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to compare the  expression profile of GzmB deficient HSCs and their WT counterparts in order to understand their phenotype in bone marrow in vivo reconstitution assays.

DESIGN
GzmB-/- HSC mRNA expression was compared to WT counterparts. Samples of 3 biological replicates (pool of 3 mice per replicate) of each group has been used for the array.
