TITLE
Gene Expression Patterns that Predict Sensitivity to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Lung Cancer Cell Lines and Human Lung Tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression data were generated from cultured non small cell lung cancer cell lines (NSCLC), normalized using MAS 5.0, filtered and used to predict response of cells to EGFR inhibition

DESIGN
Gene expression data from additional cell lines and tumors was used to validate the predictive algorithm Total RNA was prepared from NSCLC cell lines and applied to Affymetric U133 2.0 microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL96 [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array
