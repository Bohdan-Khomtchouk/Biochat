TITLE
Exposure of rat to a variety of toxicants, thigh muscle assayed by CodeLink microarray

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
DrugMatrix is a comprehensive rat toxicogenomics database and analysis tool developed to facilitate the integration of toxicogenomics into hazard assessment.  Using the whole genome and a diverse set of compounds allows a comprehensive view of most pharmacological and toxicological questions and is applicable to other situations such as disease and development.

DESIGN
Complete Drug Matrix dataset for rat thigh muscle. Approximately 600 different compounds were profiled in up to 8 different rat tissues by obtaining tissue samples from test compound-treated and vehicle control-treated rats in biological triplicates for gene expression analysis after 0.25, 1, 3, and 5 days of exposure with daily dosing. In a few studies (1.8%), 7 days of exposure was substituted for 5 days of exposure.  Samples were hybridized to CodeLink RU1 10K rat arrays (Amersham Biosciences).
