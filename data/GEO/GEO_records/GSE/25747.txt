TITLE
A Genome-Wide Characterization of New and Drought Stress Responsive MicroRNAs in Populus euphratica

ORGANISM
Populus euphratica

SUMMARY
We present an efficient method to genome-wide discover new and drought stress responsive miRNAs in P. euphratica. High throughput sequencing of P. euphratica leaves found 197 conserved miRNAs between P. euphratica and Populus trichocarpa. Meanwhile, 189 new miRNAs which belonged to 120 families were identified, a large increasing to the number of P. euphratica miRNAs. Target prediction and degradome sequencing verification of 22 new and 21 conserved miRNA targets showed these targets were involved in multiple biological processes, including transcription regulation and response to stimulus. Furthermore, comparison of high-throughput sequencing with miRNA microarray profiling data indicated that 104 miRNA sequences were up-regulated, while 27 were down-regulated under drought stress. This preliminary characterization based on our findings provided a framework for future analysis of miRNA genes and their roles in key traits of poplar as stress resistance plant breeding and environment protection usage.

DESIGN
Examination of sRNA expression in 2 poplar leaf samples in drought and normal growth conditions.
