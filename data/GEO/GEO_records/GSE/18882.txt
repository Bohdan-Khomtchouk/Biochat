TITLE
Effect of cellular and viral miRNAs on target RNA half-life in three human B-cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total, nascent and unlabeled RNA were prepared following 1h of labeling with 100 ÂµM 4-thiouridine and 3 replicates analyzed by Affymetrix Gene ST 1.0 arrays

DESIGN
Transcript half-lives were determined in DG75-eGFP, DG75-10/12 and BCBL-1 based on nascent/total RNA ratios; unlabeled RNA was analyzed in addition
