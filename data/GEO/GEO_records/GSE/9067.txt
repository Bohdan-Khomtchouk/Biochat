TITLE
Myeloma IRF4 target genes - Agilent

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this gene expression study was to identify genes whose expression depends on the transription factor IRF4 by knocking down it's expression using shRNA in two IRF4+ myeloma cell lines. Keywords: time series design

DESIGN
Two myeloma lines were analyzed over a time course of IRF4-targeted shRNA induction. There are 3 time courses: two using KMS12 (biological replicates) and one with SKMM1. Within each time course there are technical replicates.
