TITLE
Hepatic Gene Expression Changes in Diethynitrosamin-initiated and Cholic Acid promoted tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were fed with either normal diet (ND), 0.2% cholic acid diet (0.2%CA), DEN treated and fed ND or DEN treated and fed 0.2%CA diet. DEN was treated at 15 microgram/kg body weight at postnatal day 15. Diets were fed for two months starting 8 months of age till 10 months of age. Livers were collected at10 months of age, Total RNA was isolated and used for microarray experiments.

DESIGN
4 groups [ND, 0.2%CA, DEN+ND and DEN+0.2%CA], pooled livers from 3-5 mice
