TITLE
Identification of host miRNA regulated by HIV-1 - complementary datas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Time-dependent profile of differentially expressed miRNA following HIV-1 infection. Small RNAs were extracted from HIV-1 infected and non-infected pNL4-3 Jurkat cells at days 0 and 21 and miRNA expression was analyzed by microarray. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
At each time point (0 and 21), miRNA from infected vs non-infected cells were compared in a dye-swap experiment
