TITLE
MiRNA and lung cancer (INCA Project) - 16 RNG25k microarrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify putative novel specific targets of mir-210, we overexpressed miR-210 as well as miR-34a and a siRNA targeted against E2F3 in A549 human adenocarcinoma cells by transfecting them with  synthetic pre-miRNAs or a synthetic “negative” pre-miRNA as control (miR-Neg). RNA samples were harvested at 48 hours post-transfection and 2 independent experiments were carried out.

DESIGN
48 hours post-transfection, 2 independent experiments performed in dye-swap: miR-210 versus miR-Neg ; miR-34a versus miR-Neg ; si-E2F3 versus miR-Neg ; si-control versus miR-Neg.
