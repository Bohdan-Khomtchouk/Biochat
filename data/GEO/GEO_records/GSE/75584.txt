TITLE
3´-end sequencing of poly(A)+ RNA in wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a strain carrying a deletion of the RRP6 nuclear exosome catalytic component

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The nuclear exosome performs critical functions in non-coding RNA processing, and in diverse surveillance functions including the quality control of mRNP formation, and in the removal of pervasive transcripts.  Most non-coding RNAs and pervasive nascent transcripts are targeted by the Nrd1p-Nab3p-Sen1p (NNS) complex to terminate Pol II transcription coupled to nuclear exosome degradation or 3´-end trimming. Prior to nuclear exosome activity, the Trf4p-Air2p-Mtr4p polyadenylation complex adds an oligo-A tail to exosome substrates.  Inactivating exosome activity stabilizes and lengthens these A-tails.  We utilized high-throughput 3´-end poly(A)+ sequencing to identify at nucleotide resolution the 3´ ends targeted by the nuclear exosome, and determine the sites of NNS-dependent termination genome-wide.

DESIGN
3´-end mapping of wild-type and a nuclear exosome mutant strain by direct RNA sequencing (DRS) (SeqLL, LLC).  RNAs from WT and the RRP6 deletion strain were loaded into four separate channels on the HeliScope single molecule sequencer.
