TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of conditional THAP1 knockout mice brains using microarray

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss of function mutations in the transcription factor THAP1 cause DYT6 dystonia, a childhood-onset motor disorder. DYT6 subjects display abnormalities in the white matter regions of the brain. Here, we generated conditional THAP1 knockout mice and analyzed the gene expression profiles from motor regions of mice brains to identify a role for THAP1 in the control of myelination

DESIGN
4 WT mice, 4 Conditional THAP1 knockout mice

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
