TITLE
Bioenergetics status determines motor neuron vulnerability in spinal muscular atrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparative gene expression profiling of motor neurons innervating the extensor digitorum longus (disease-resistant), gastrocnemius (intermediate vulnerability), and tibialis anterior (vulnerable) muscles in mice to determine the factors underlying their selective vulnerability in sinal muscular atrophy.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling utilised total RNA extracted from motor neurons derived from normal mice on an SMA background to investigate selective vulnerability of motor neurons
