TITLE
Expression data from human cumulus cells isolated from oocytes at MI and MII stages in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic disorder that is characterized by increased circulating androgen levels, anovulatory infertility, and frequently, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.The abnormity of oocyte nuclear maturity is the main reason for anovulatory infertility and pregnancy loss in PCOS patients.The bidirectional exchanges between oocyte and contiguous CCs are important for oocyte competence acquisition, early embryonic development and CC expansion.Gene expression profiles of CCs has been suggested to predict embryo development and pregnancy outcome. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression of CCs isolated from oocytes at metaphase I (CCMI) and metaphase II (CCMII) stage under controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) cycle in PCOS patients.

DESIGN
Cumulus cells were isolated from oocyte at stage metaphase 1(MI)and stage metaphase II (MII) of PCOS patients for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. For microarray analysis, we used three chips for each CC category. That is, CCMI1,CCMI2,CCMI3,CCMII1,CCMII2 and CCMII3.
