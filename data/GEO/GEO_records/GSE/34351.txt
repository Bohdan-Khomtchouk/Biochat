TITLE
Gene expression profile on ischemic kidneys from wildtype C57BL/10 and TLR4 null C57BL/10ScNJ mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TLR4 deficiency attenuates kidney injury after ischemic reperfusion as measured by both renal function and morphology. To better understand the role of TLR4 during the acute kidney injury, we used DNA microarray to identify genes that were differentially expressed on kidneys in wildtype B10 mice and TLR4 null mice during the early stage of injury.

DESIGN
A murine ischemic reperfusion injury model was established. After right nephrectomy, the left pedicle was clamped for 23min followed by 4hr reperfusion. Sham mice were used as controls. 6  WT males and 6 TLR4 null males were included with 3 ischemic and 3 shams in each group.
