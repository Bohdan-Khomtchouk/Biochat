SUMMARY
In our investigations of the molecular pathways of prostate tumorigenesis in Nkx3.1; Pten mutant mice using gene expression profiling, we now find that the AP-1 transcription factors, c-Jun and c-Fos, are significantly up-regulated during cancer progression. Forced expression of c-Fos and c-Jun in prostate cancer cells results in increased tumorigenicity, activation of Erk MAP kinase, and enhanced survival in the absence of androgens, which are hallmarks of disease progression. In humans, Jun and Fos proteins are significantly up-regulated during prostate cancer progression and significantly correlated with activation of Erk MAP kinase. Most notably, expression of Jun is associated with disease recurrence independent of other currently used prognostic indicators. These analyses reveal a hitherto unappreciated role for AP-1 transcription factors in prostate cancer progression vis-Ã -vis Erk MAP kinase signaling, as well as the identification of a novel marker of disease recurrence, namely c-Jun.
