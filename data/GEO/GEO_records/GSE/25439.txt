TITLE
Expression data from MMP3 and control transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Effect of induction of MMP3 expression in CCSP-rtTA/tet-MMP3 transgenic mice, fed doxycycline for 14 weeks We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression following MMP3 expression

DESIGN
Transgenic mice (CCSPrt-TA/tet-MMP3 or CCSPrtTA control mice) were fed doxycycline from week 6 to week 20, then lungs were removed, formalin fixed, and embedded in paraffin.  Sections were sliced from the paraffin blocks for RNA extraction.
