TITLE
Identification and comparative analysis of miRNAs and their targets associated with curd-forming capacity at high temperature in two broccoli genotypes

ORGANISM
Brassica oleracea var. italica

SUMMARY
We report miRNA expression profiles underlying curd-forming capacity at high temperature in two broccoli lines by high-throughput sequencing.

DESIGN
Examination of miRNA expression profiles in 2  broccoli isogenic lines with different curd-forming capacity at high temperature  (High curd-forming capacity: E22 sample; Low-curd forming capacity: L22 sample)

PLATFORM
GPL17675 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Brassica oleracea var. italica)
