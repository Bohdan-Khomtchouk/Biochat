TITLE
Analysis of the mammary gland transcriptome in wild type C57BL/6J mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was performed to identify transcripts that are differentially expressed in the mammary gland at 4 stages of developmental (virgin, pregnant, lactating and involution) in wild type C57BL/6J mice. Keywords: developmental stage

DESIGN
Whole mammary glands No4 (inguinal) were obtained from female mice at 4 stages of development: Virgin (puberty, 6 wks of age), Pregnant (14 days of pregnancy), Lactating (day 10 postpartum) and Involution (4 days post weaning of pups). Three biological replicates were obtained from Virgin females and two biological replicates for the three other stages.
