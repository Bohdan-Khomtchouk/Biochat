TITLE
Arid1a deletion in collaboration with Pten deletion leads to ovarian tumorigenesis in mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice developed ovarian tumors after Arid1a and Pten double knockout. Gene expression profiles of 5 such ovarian tumors were compared with those of 4 normal ovaries. The differentially expressed genes were then used to investigate the similarity between the mouse ovarian tumors and major subtypes of human ovarian cancers.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from the mouse ovarian tumors developing after Arid1a and Pten knockout compared to normal mouse ovaries.
