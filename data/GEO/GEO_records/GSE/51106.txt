TITLE
Androgen receptor uses relaxed response element stringency for selective chromatin binding and transcriptional regulation in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the in vivo androgen receptor (AR) binding sites in caput epididymis of intact SPARKI and wild-type mice using ChIP-sequencing. SPARKI (specificity affecting androgen receptor knock-in) mouse line has the second zinc finger of AR replaced by that of glucocorticoid receptors. In vivo analysis of SPARKI and wild-type AR genome-wide binding sites identified cis-element with less stringent sequence requirements that specify selective AR-binding sites. The ChIP experiments have been performed using antibody specific to AR and IgG non-specific antibody as a negative control.

DESIGN
Examination of AR binding sites in epididymis of wild-type and SPARKI mice using ChIP-seq. Two biological replicates from intact wild-type and SPARKI mice and two control IgG samples were sequenced and used in peak calling. To increase the depth of the analysis, replicate ChIP-seq samples were merged and the concatanated samples were used in peak calling.
