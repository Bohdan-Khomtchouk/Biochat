TITLE
Adaptive Evolution and Regulation of a Stress-Activated Transposon in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand an effect of an ONSEN insertion for a gene network, a genome wide gene expression on the ONSEN inserted lines was analyzed by a microarray. The microarray analysis identified 6,520 and 7,262 significant different expressed genes (3/2 fold or 2/3 fold, FDR < 0.05) in 13-7 and 19-4 respectively under ABA stress.

DESIGN
Two of ONSEN inserted lines (13-7, 19-4),  parent line (nrpd1), and wild-type plants (Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia) were grown on MS medium with and without 2Î¼M ABA for 7 days. Total RNA was extructed from the plants, using  TRI Reagent (Sigma T9424). 100 ng of the isolated tatal RNAs were used for the expresion profiling using the custom array.
