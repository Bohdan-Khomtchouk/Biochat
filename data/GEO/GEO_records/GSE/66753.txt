TITLE
Genome wide ChIP-seq analysis of human TOP2B occupancy in MCF7 breast cancer epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TOP2B is involved in transcriptional initiation in response to nuclear hormone ligands and plays a role in transcriptional elongation. Whole genome TOP2B ChIP-seq was carried out on human MCF7 cells in the presence and absence of the nuclear hormone estradiol. Three peak calling methods were used and the peaks identified by at least two methods were analyzed further. Approximately half of the peaks fell either within a gene or within 5Kb of a transcription start site. The coincidence of TOP2B peaks and gene promoters was analyzed; TOP2B peaks were less frequently associated with promoters in estradiol treated than in control cells, suggesting a role of TOP2B in repression of transcription or a transient role in estradiol induced transcriptional changes.

DESIGN
Whole genome TOP2B ChIP-seq was carried out on human MCF7 cells in the presence (30 mins exposure) and absence of the nuclear hormone estradiol. " Input " control samples were also sequenced for background detection and comparison.
