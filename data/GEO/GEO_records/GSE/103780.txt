TITLE
Human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer cells: Control vs gefitinib treated cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total gene expression difference after treatment gefitinib for 24 h compared to control NSCLCs To determine which proteins are responsible for the differences in glutamine metabolism in response to the gefitinib treatment between gefitinib-sensitive and gefitinib-resistant cells

DESIGN
After separately treatment with 20 ÂµM and 20 nM gefitinib in A549 and PC-9 cells for 24 h, both mRNA from control and gefitinib treated cells were transcripted for DNA microarray analysis.
