TITLE
Epigenome comparisons reveal linkage between gene expression and developmental remodeling of chromatin domain topology

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We describe a new approach to ChIP-seq analysis in which conservation of nucleosome-scale H3K27me3 topology, rather than coverage, is quantified; RNA-seq results are related to the new ChIP-seq approach.

DESIGN
Examination of histone H3K27me3 modification profiles in human monocytes and dendritic cells, and linkage of histone mark profiles to RNA-seq data
