TITLE
Expression data from diseased Ezh2 KO Lineage-c-Kit+Sca-1+ (LSK) bone marrow cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent studies have shown that epigenetic regulator are mutated in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients.  Ezh2 is frequently mutated in hematopoietic malignant patients, however, the pathophysiological role of Ezh2 mutations has not been elucidated yet.  In this study, we examined the function of Ezh2 in murine hematopoietic disease. Ezh2 deleted mice with myeloid malignancies including MDS, Myelodysplasia/myeloneoplasm(MDS/MPN), Myelodysplasia/myeloneoplasm_thrombocytosis(MDS/MPN_TC)

DESIGN
In this study, we utilized Ezh2 conditional knockout mice.  We harvested bone marrow stem/progenitor (LSK) cells from Cre-ERt (Wild) and Ezh2 deletion mice (n=3) at 3 months after transplanted and induced Tamoxifene to delete Ezh2.  We also collected bone marrow stem/progenitor (LSK) cells  at 9-12 months-post transplantation and induced Tamoxifen.
