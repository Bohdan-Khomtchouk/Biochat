TITLE
Examining efficiency of enrichment of kidney pericyte-specific messages by TRAP (Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term goal is to define the transcriptional changes that accompany pericyte-to-myofibroblast transition in fibrotic kidney disease. Medullary pericytes are identified by their expression of a eGFPL10a fusion protein whose expression is driven by a Col1a1 promoter.  Pericyte-specific RNA is generated by eGFP-affinity purification of polysomes from medullary lysates and then subject to microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Col1a1-eGFPL10a mice were subject to Sham or unilateral ureteral obstruction surgery. Sham kidneys were collected at day 0, and UUO kidneys were collected at day 2 or day 5 for TRAP.
