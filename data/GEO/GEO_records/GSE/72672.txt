TITLE
Expression data from epidermal and dorsal root ganglion tissues of wild-type and mutant mice with mechanosensory deficit

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A novel mouse line was found to exhibit prominent mechanosensory deficits both behaviorally and at the primary sensory afferents, and exhibits decreased ATP release from the skin. Microarray analysis was used to determine transcriptomic differences that may underlie the mechanosensory deficit in the mutant mouse, and to explore the decreased response of the mutant mouse to an inflammatory insult.

DESIGN
Tissues were obtained from wild-type mice and from mutant mechanosensory-deficient mice (Keratin14Cre-TRPA1(fl/fl) mice).  For each genotype, there were 3 biological replicates of the following groups: naive control epidermis, CFA hindpaw-injected epidermis, and na√Øve dorsal root ganglia). mRNA was extracted from isolated epidermis or from dorsal root ganglia. mRNA was processed and hybridizated on Affymetrix microarrays.
