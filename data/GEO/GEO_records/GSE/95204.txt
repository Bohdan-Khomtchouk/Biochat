TITLE
Plasma miRNAs expression in acute ischemic stroke patients with or without recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the expression of circulating miRNAs in AIS patients with thrombolysis and without thrombolysis. Grant ID: 81100882 Grant title: The relation between transcription of miR-497 and neurons apoptosis after ischemic stroke Funding source: Chinese National Natural Science Foundation Grantee First Name: Zhen Grantee Last Name:Deng

DESIGN
Fifteen AIS patients with thrombolysis treatment and fifteen AIS patients (admission after 8h of onset) without thrombolysis were collected blood sample on the onset of 24h. Fifteen age-match healthy person were as control group. We used miRNA microarrays to detect plasma miRNA expression profiles and real-time PCR verified miRNA expression. Totally, there 3 sample in each group.

PLATFORM
GPL18058 Exiqon miRCURY LNA microRNA array, 7th generation [miRBase v18, condensed Probe_ID version]
