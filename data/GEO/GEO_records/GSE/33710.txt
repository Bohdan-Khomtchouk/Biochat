TITLE
Transcriptomic datat of senescence WI-38 cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Senescence in WI-38 cell context was induce by RASv12 over expression Cellular senescence is a permanent cell cycle arrest that is triggered by cancer-  initiating or promoting events in mammalian cells and is now considered a major tumour suppressor mechanism. Here, we did a transcriptomic analysis and compared WI-38 contol wich is a human fibroblaste cell line and WI-38 that overexpressed RASv12  a G protein that induce senescence. The goal of our project is to compare transciptomic profile of human growing fibroblast (WI-38 control) and senescent human fibroblast (WI-38 OERAS)

DESIGN
Comparaison WI-38 vs WI-38 OE RAS
