TITLE
Comparison of metastatic derivatives of colon cancer cell line selected in vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using a human colorectal cancer cell line we incremented its metastatic capacity in a mouse model of liver and lung metastasis. Afterwards, a comparison between the different metastatic derivatives is done.

DESIGN
Metastatic derivatives were selected by the use of a balb/c nude mouse model. Once the metastasis appeared, the cells were extracted and expanded in culture. Thereafter RNA was extracted and hybridized
