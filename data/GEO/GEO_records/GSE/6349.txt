TITLE
Expression data from xylem pole pericycle cells of Arabidopsis roots undergoing lateral root initiation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression during this process. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Arabidopsis xylem pole pericycle cells were isolated at successive stages of early lateral root development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain homogeneous populations of cells at each stage in order to increase the temporal resolution of expression profiles. To that end, we used FACS on Arabidopsis roots containing a GFP marker for the xylem pole pericycle cells at three time-points: 1) arrest of G1-to-S transition (NPA or 0h NAA), 2) auxin signaling and progression through G1-to-S (2h NAA) and 3) G2-to-M transition or asymmetric cell division (6h NAA).
