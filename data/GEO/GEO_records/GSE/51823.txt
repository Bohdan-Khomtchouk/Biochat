TITLE
Transcriptional response to cotton worm feeding in resistant and susceptible soybean lines

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
The interaction between soybean and its destructive insect (cotton worm) is complicated. In this paper, the timecourse of induced responses to cotton worm were characterized in two soybean lines, suggesting complex results with different timepoints of peak induced resistance in resistant (WX) and susceptible (NN) soybean lines. To get a better understanding of induced resistant mechanisms of soybean against herbivory, two sets of transcriptome profiles of WX and NN at their peak induced resistant timepoints were compared by microarrays

DESIGN
The common phenomenon was that no matter in resistant or susceptible line, there always exist a peak level of induced resistance timepoint. Here we are aimed to focus on transcriptional changes induced by insect feeding at the peak timepoints (5 dai and 24 hai) in WX and NN, three biological replicates were used for each of the four treatments (WX treated (WX-T) and control (WX-CK); NN treated (NN-T) and control (NN-CK) ) with three biological replicates.
