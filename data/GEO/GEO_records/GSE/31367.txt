TITLE
miRNA Expression data from WASF3 overexpressing stable T47D cells and control cells

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We recently showed that inactivation of the WASF3/WAVE3 gene in breast cancer cells results in loss of cell motility and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. To obtain a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of action of WASF3, we have established the stable  WASF3 overexpressing T47D cells using lentiviral infect system. We used miRNA microarrays to detail the global programme of miRNA expression after overexpression of  WASF3 and identified distinct classes of up or down-regulated metastmir associated with breast cancer cell migration and motility invasion
