TITLE
Whole Genome Microarray comparison of two Interferon Beta 1a Pharmaceutical Preparations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have investigated the in vitro pharmacodynamic genomic effects of interferon beta 1a treatment on a whole genome microarray assay on lymphocytes from Multiple Sclerosis patients comparing the similarity between two biological products manufactured by two pharmaceutical companies. Keywords: Drug pharmacogenomics

DESIGN
Ex vivo whole genome expression profiling of the effect of two preparations of IFNÃŸ1a was performed on non-adherent mononuclear cells from five Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis patients (RRMS, 2 males and 3 females, aged from 15 to 54 years old) using microarrays analysis (CodeLinkTM Human Whole Genome).
