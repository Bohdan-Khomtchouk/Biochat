TITLE
Molecular profiling identifies prognostic subgroups of pediatric glioblastoma and shows increased tumor YB-1 expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our aim was to gain insight into the molecular pathways that distinguish pediatric- from adult-onset glioblastomas.

DESIGN
Amplified RNA from Type IV Glioblastoma brain tumor cells compared to amplified RNA from a pool of 3 normal brain samples. Pediatric and adult patients. 2-6 replicate hybridizations per patient.
