TITLE
Expression profiles of Telomerase+ vs. ALT+ G3 Atm-/-TERT-ER T-cell lymphomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarray profiling to document the difference between telomerase+ vs. ALT+ T-cell lymphomas developed on G3 Atm-/-TERT-ER genetic background.

DESIGN
T-cell lymphomas were developed in G3 Atm-/-TERT-ER mice with 4-OHT treatment. These cells were either maintained on SCID mice treated with 4-OHT or vehicle. Cells maintained on vehicle eventually developed ALT-dependent resistance. We used microarray to profile telomerase+ tumors vs. ALT+ tumors from the same parental lines.
