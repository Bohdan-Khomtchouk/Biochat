TITLE
Expression data from PAO1 and its creBC  derivative mutant (PAOΔcreBC)

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to determine the expression profile of the P. aeruginosa creBC mutant regarding its parental wild type strain PAO1.

DESIGN
Expression analysis from three independent replicates of PAO1 and its creBC  derivative mutant (PAOΔcreBC) were performed  under basal conditions and with cefoxitin and ceftazidime.  cDNA synthesis, fragmentation, labeling and hybridization were performed according to the Affymetrix GeneChip P. aeruginosa genome array expression analysis protocol.
