TITLE
PHF20 readers link methylation of histone H3K4 and p53 with H4K16 acetylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PHF20 is a core component of the lysine acetyltransferase complex MOF-NSL that produces the major epigenetic mark, H4K16ac, and is necessary for transcriptional regulation and DNA repair, however the role of PHF20 in the complex remains elusive. Here, we report on functional crosstalk between epigenetic readers of PHF20. We show that the PHF20 PHD finger recognizes dimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me2) and represents first example of a native PHD reader selective for this modification. Biochemical and structural analyses illuminate the molecular mechanism underlying this function and explain the preference of Tudor2, another reader in PHF20, for dimethylated p53. Binding of the PHD finger to H3K4me2 is required for histone acetylation, accumulation of PHF20 at target genes, and transcriptional activation. Together, our findings establish a novel PHF20-mediated link between MOF HAT, p53 and H3K4me2-dependent cellular events and suggest a model for rapid spreading of H4K16ac-encriched open chromatin.

DESIGN
H1792 cells were transduced with shRNAs targeting PHF20 or control non-tareting shRNAs and selected with puromycin for 4-6 days. RNA-seq was then performed to identify differentially expressed genes among different conditions.
