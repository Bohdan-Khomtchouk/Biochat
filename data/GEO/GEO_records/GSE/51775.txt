Association of CREB3L1 with promoters in MDA-MB-435 cells

SUMMARY
The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in response to hypoxia-induced stress such as in the tumor microenvironment.  This study examined the role of CREB3L1 (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 1), a member of the UPR, in breast cancer development and metastasis.  Initial experiments identified the loss of CREB3L1 expression in metastatic breast cancer cell lines compared to low- or non-metastatic cell lines.  When metastatic cells were transfected with CREB3L1 they demonstrated reduced invasion and migration in vitro, as well as a significantly decreased ability to survive under non-adherent or hypoxic conditions.  Interestingly, in an in vivo rat mammary tumor model, CREB3L1 expressing cells not only failed to form metastases compared to CREB3L1 null cells but regression of the primary tumors was seen in 70% of the animals as a result of impaired angiogenesis.  Microarray and ChIP on Chip analyses identified changes in the expression of many genes involved in cancer development and metastasis, including a decrease in those involved in angiogenesis.  These data suggest that CREB3L1 plays an important role in suppressing tumorgenesis and loss of expression is required for the development of a metastatic phenotype. CREB3L1 is a member of the unfolded protein response family of proteins. CREB3L1 expression is lost from metastatic breast cancer cells. We wanted to determine the promoters of genes that CREB3L1 bound to.

DESIGN
Idenification of promoters to which CREB3L1 is bound following ChIP with a HA antibody in MDA-MB-435 cells.
