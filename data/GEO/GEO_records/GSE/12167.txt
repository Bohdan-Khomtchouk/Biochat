TITLE
TJ1081)fer-15(b26)II; daf-16(m26)I) vs. BA713(fer-15(b26)II)

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To identify changes in gene expression in daf-16 mutants, we compared expression in fer-15 young adults to expression in fer-15(b26); daf-16(m26) young adults grown at 25?C.  At Stanford University, four samples of fer-15 and five samples of fer-15; daf-16 animals were prepared.  At the University of Colorado, seven samples of fer-15 and six samples of fer-15; daf-16 was prepared. Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments Place of growth: At Stanford vs Colorado Genotype: mutant strains vs wt (N2) mixed stage; some expts are reverse dye (wt in channel 2)
