TITLE
Differential gene expressions in the heart of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential gene expressions were constructed through expression profiling of a total of 20,127 genes in the heart tissue of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients, then 1799 significant differential genes were filtered based on the criteria (p < 0.05 and fold change > 1.5), respectively.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, human hypertrophic heart tissue samples were obtained from patients previously diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, undergoing septal myectomy surgery (n=5). Control samples were obtained from normal heart donor left ventricles (n=4). The heart tissues were collected and performed transcriptome analysis by RNA-sequencing. Compared to normal heart, 1799 significant differentially expressed genes (filtering criteria p < 0.05, fold change > 1.5) were identified 7-days or 28 days post-Ang II infusion.
