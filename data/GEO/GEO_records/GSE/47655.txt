TITLE
Genomic responses in blood during acute human anaphylaxis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression was profiled in peripheral blood samples collected over three time points from patients during acute anaphylaxis and from healthy controls. Patients presented to the Emergency Department (ED) at Royal Perth Hospital with acute, moderately severe anaphylaxis. Samples were collected at ED arrival (T0), 1 hour later (T1), and 3 hours post arrival (T2).

DESIGN
The study design consisted of 12 subjects, 3 time points, and 2 clinical states (acute anaphylaxis, healthy controls).
