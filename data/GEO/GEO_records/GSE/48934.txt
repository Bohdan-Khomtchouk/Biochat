TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of brain metastasis competent cell-derived exosomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective of this work was to characterize the miRNA profile of exosomes isolated from brain-homing cell lines (MDA-MB-231BR, CTC1BMSM, and 70W) with their respective parental non-brain metastatic cell lines (MDA-MB-231P, CTC1P and MeWo).

DESIGN
Exosomes derived from the six cell lines were isolated. Brain metastatic cell-derived exosomal miRNAs were compared with non brain metastatic cell lines (MDA-MB-231BR versus MDA-MB-231P, CTC1BMSM versus CTC1P, and 70W versus MeWo).
