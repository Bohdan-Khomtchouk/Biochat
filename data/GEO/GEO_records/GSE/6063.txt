TITLE
Molecular basis of gender and reproductive status in breeding zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Sexual reproduction is a complex process involving multiple pathways. In this study, we aimed at investigating gene expression profiles underlying gender specificity in the zebrafish. To do so, we analyzed the transcriptome of the gonads of breeding fish and queried the gene expression profiles for significant differences between the genders and also between stages of gonad development. Major differences in gene expression profiles between genders were encountered at the level of the gonads. In addition, we identified biological processes associated with stage of sexual development in female gonads. Keywords: gender and stage related gene expression
