TITLE
Identification of recurrence related microRNAs from bone marrow in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the role of miRNAs in patient bone marrow (BM) and explore the function of these molecules during HCC progression, we employed microarray-based profiling to analyze miRNA expression in the BM of patients with HCC.

DESIGN
MicroRNA expression in the BW of HCC patients was measured by using microarray-based profiling. BM cells were separated into 3fraction by cell surface markers as follows: CD45+(macrophage), CD14-/CD45+(lymphocyte) and CD14-/CD45-/EpCAM+(epithelial cell).
