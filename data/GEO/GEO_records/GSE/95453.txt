TITLE
Hyper-repression of HUSH target genes by over-expression of the R252W Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease mutant MORC2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By comparing wild-type SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells to cells over-expressing either wild-type or R252W mutant MORC2, the goal of the experiment was to assess the effect of MORC2 over-expression on the transcriptome.

DESIGN
Total RNA-seq of SK-N-SH cells in triplicate, either 1) mock transduced, 2) transduced with lentiviral vector encoding wild-type MORC2 or 3) transduced with lentviral vector encoding R252W MORC2.
