TITLE
MIA gene family-related signaling in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) gene family is novel tumor-associated molecules. Although MIA gene family has several tumor progressive and/or suppressive functions, the detailed relevant signaling partners are unclear and investigated. In this study, we investigated the detailed MIA gene family-associated signaling using human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.

DESIGN
Human oral squamous cell carcinoma-derived HSC3 cells were transfected with　control, MIA, MIA2, TANGO, MATE2, or LEMD1 siRNA. The effect on gene　knockdown was evaluated by cDNA microarray.
