TITLE
Upregulation of the mammalian X chromosome is associated with enhanced transcription initiation, MOF-mediated H4K16 acetylation, and longer RNA half-life

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Many animal species employ a chromosome-based mechanism of sex determination, which has led to coordinate evolution of dosage compensation systems. Dosage compensation not only corrects the imbalance in the number of X-chromosomes between the sexes, but is also hypothesized to correct dosage imbalance within cells due to mono-allelic X expression and bi-allelic autosomal expression, by upregulating X-linked genes (termed ‘Ohno’s hypothesis’). To identify molecular mechanisms of X upregulation in mammals we established genome-wide profiles for the initiation and elongation forms of RNA polymerase II (PolII), PolII-S5p (phosphorylated at serine 5) and PolII-S2p (phosphorylated at serine 2), and for histone modifications in mouse cell lines and tissues. We found that in addition to being enriched in PolII-S5p but not in PolII-S2p, X-linked promoters were also enriched in two epigenetic marks, H4K16ac and H2AZ, dependent on expression levels. To address the function of the H4K16 acetyltransferase MOF occupancy profiles were established and knockdowns of MOF and MSL1 were done in mouse ES cells. Our results support a conserved role for the MSL complex to enhance transcription initiation of X-linked genes.
