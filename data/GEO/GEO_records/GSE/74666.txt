TITLE
Comparation the mRNA Expression Profile of the MV4-11 Sorafenib Resistant Cells and the Parental Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our gene set analysis of MV4-11-R versus MV4-11 indicated decreased depolarization of mitochondria and mitochondrial membrane, mitochondrial dysfunction and anti-apoptosis as other top ranked molecular or cellular functions of differential gene sets. expression of most genes encoding glycolytic enzymes was up-regulated in MV4-11-R cells we revealed a metabolic alteration in sorafenib-resistant cell lines with mitochondrial respiration deficiency, leading to substantial decrease of mitochondria-derived ATP generation and a significant increase in glycolytic activity to maintain sufficient ATP production. Our study revealed a metabolic signature of sorafenib resistance and indicated that increase of glycolytic activity including upregulation of major glycolytic enzymes may be viewed as a marker for early detection of sorafenib resistance in AML patients with FLT3/ITD mutation and glycolytic inhibitors warrant further investigation as alternative therapeutic agents for sorafenib-resistant cells
