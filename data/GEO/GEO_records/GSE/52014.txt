TITLE
Microarray analysis of miRNAs involved in Porcine Alveolar Macrophages at the early stage of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection [LCS_miRPig_17]

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
By analyzing the changes of miRNAs of piglet PAMs 6h after PRRSV infection,we can find porcine miRNAs associated with viral infection and possible target sites in both PRRSV and pig genome and their roles in protection against viral infections. Then these targets will screened by bioinformatics methods to find the susceptibility genes, resistance genes and immune related genes, and formed molecular biology network of miRNAs at gene and protein level .

DESIGN
PAM cells were isolated from 60d old healthy piglets and  inoculated with HuN4,a strain of highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respitory syndrome  virus (HP-PRRSV) and were collected at 6h post-inoculation (pi). The uninfected cells served as mock-infected cells.The miRNA chip was according to the porcine miRNA sequences in Sanger miRBase Release 17.0 ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/mirna/ )added with some miRNAs we found in reference. Microarray hybridization and data analysis helps to find  the susceptibility genes, resistance genes and immune related genes, and formed molecular biology network of miRNAs at gene and protein level .
