TITLE
Oct4 and RNA Pol II target promoters in Ntera cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These samples are biological replicates from Ntera cells that were crosslinked on different days.  For each sample a matched total was produced in a parallel.  Amplicons were made from each and hybridized on human 1.5 kb promoter arrays from Nimblegen. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
Goal was determination of Oct4 and RNA Pol II target promoters in Ntera cells using ChIP-chip methodology.
