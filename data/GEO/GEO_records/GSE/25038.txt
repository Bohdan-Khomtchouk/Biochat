TITLE
Transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analysis of UV-B signaling in maize

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
This study looked for signals produced in UV-B irradiated leaves, and possibly induced in shielded leaves, that modulate physiological responses in maize.  Transcriptome and proteomics profiling tracked changes in exposed and shielded organs.  Metabolic profiling was examined for signaling molecules.  Exposure of just the top leaf substantially alters the transcriptome of both irradiated and shielded organs, with greater changes as an additional 1-2 leaves are irradiated.  Transcriptome, proteome and metabolome changes are UV-B regulated in shielded organs.  Early steps in signal transduction and possible signal molecules are identified utilizing a time course experiment. Keywords: UVB, maize, leaves, ears

DESIGN
Compared irradiated leaves in a time course, irradiated leaves versus shielded leaves, and shielded ears on plants with irradiated leaves.  Also compared different number of leaves being irradiated. Spike-in controls were included.
