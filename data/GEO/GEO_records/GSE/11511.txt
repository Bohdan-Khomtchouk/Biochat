TITLE
Identification of histone codes and crosstalk in fission yeast

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Aims: To map histone modifications with unprecedented resolution both globally and locus-specifically, and to link modification patterns to gene expression. Materials & methods: Using correlations between quantitative mass spectrometry and chromatin immunoprecipitation/microarray analyses, we have mapped histone post-translational modifications in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Results: Acetylations at lysine 9, 18 and 27 of histone H3 give the best positive correlations with gene expression in this organism. Using clustering analysis and gene ontology search tools, we identified promoter histone modification patterns that characterize several classes of gene function. For example, gene promoters of genes involved in cytokinesis have high H3K36me2 and low H3K4me2, whereas the converse pattern is found ar promoters of gene involved in positive regulation of the cell cycle. We detected acetylation of H4 preferentially at lysine 16 followed by lysine 12, 8 and 5. Our analysis shows that this H4 acetylation bias in the coding regions is dependent upon gene length and linked to gene expression. Our analysis also reveals a role for H3K36 methylation at gene promoters where it functions in a crosstalk between the histone methyltransferase Set2KMT3 and the histone deacetylase Clr6, which removes H3K27ac leading to repression of transcription. Conclusion: Histone modification patterns could be linked to gene expression in fission yeast.
