TITLE
Expression data from ependymal cell cultures treated with MLN4924.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified that Foxj1 is degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Foxj1 protein is stabilized by the cullin-RING ligase inhibitor MLN4924. We evaluated global changes to ependymal cell culture gene expression profiles during MLN4924 treatment.

DESIGN
Fully differentiated ependymal cell cultures (2 weeks old) were either treated with DMSO as a control or with 0.25 uM MLN4924 for 36 hours.
