TITLE
FGF2-regulated gene expression in cultured mouse spermatogonial stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) comparing control untreated SSCs with SSCs with exogenous FGF2 withdrawn and FGFR inhibitor SU5402 supplemented (-F+S). Results provide insight into the mechanisms of FGF2-supported in vitro self-renewal of SSCs.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, SSCs-F+S vs. SSCs. Biological replicates: 4 control replicates, 4 -F+S replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
