TITLE
Gene expression profiles of Schistosoma japonicum in four developmental stages

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
In the complex lifecycle of schistosomes, four developmental stages are closely associated with their definitive hosts: cercaria (infective stage), schistosomula and adult worm (parasitic stages), egg (pathogenic- and pathophoresis-stage). We have examined the gene expression profiles of Schistosoma japonicum in the four developmental stages. Genes with different expression patterns were identified and the information obtained will help indentify new anti-schistosomal intervention targets in the future.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates each of  eggs, cercariae, hepatic schistosomula, adult worm pairs, separated adult male and female worms were used. Two technical replicates each of eggs, cercariae, hepatic schistosomula, separated adult male and female worms were also included. A  12 x 135K array was designed and manufactured by NimbleGen for expression analysis.
