TITLE
Analysis of heart tissue from 2 and 15-16 month old Wt and Taut -/- Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Taurine is the most abundant free amino acid in heart muscle and protects against heart failure. In the present study, the consequences of hereditary taurine deficiency on cardiac gene expression were examined in 2 and 15-16 months old taurine transporter knockout (taut-/-) mice by using a mouse-specific DNA oligonucleotide microarray which was developed with probes for 251 genes with relevance for heart. Keywords: Comparison, knock out, wildtype

DESIGN
Heart tissue from 5 mice (2 month old) and from 4 mice (15ÃŸ16 month old) were used respectively. Dual channel analysis with dye swap was performed. The oligos were printed in duplicates and the grid was repeated twice on the array. Wt1-1 is the analysis for the first grid and Wt1-2 for the second grid. 2 month old mice: GSM108518 - GSM108527 15 - 16 month old mice: GSM108509 - GSM108517
