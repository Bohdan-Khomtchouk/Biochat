TITLE
Spore formation of Lentinula edodes

ORGANISM
Lentinula edodes

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles before and after spore formation of Lentinula edodes (L54)grown at sawdust. Keywords: time-course

DESIGN
SAGE were used to generate tags from RNA of fruit bodies of L. edodes. RNA were extracted from the fruit bodies before and after spore observed. Gene expression profiles of both stages were compared to screen out genes may relate to spore formation.
