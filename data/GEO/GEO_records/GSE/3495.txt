TITLE
Effects of methotrexate on S3 Drosophila cells and Drosophila ovaries

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcript abundance between control (untreated) and methotrexate treated S3 Drosophila cells and ovaries disected from female flies. Keywords: Stress response

DESIGN
S3 cells were exposed to 0 or 5.2 X 10^-8 M MTX for 4 days then harvested.  Flies were exposed to 0 or 5 ppm MTX for 5 days then ovaries were dissected.  RNA was extracted from S3 cells and ovaries.  4 S3 microarrays with one dye-swap and 2 ovary microarrays swapping dyes were hybridized to spotted cDNA microarrays.
