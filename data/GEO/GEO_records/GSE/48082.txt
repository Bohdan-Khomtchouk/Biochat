TITLE
Temperature-dependent alternative splicing of FLM controls flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
How plants control the transition to flowering in response to ambient temperature is only beginning to be understood. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the MADS-box transcription factor genes FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) have key roles  in this process. FLM is subject to temperature-dependent alternative splicing, producing two  splice variants, FLM-β and FLM-δ, which compete for interaction with the floral repressor SVP.  The SVP/FLM-β complex is predominately formed at low temperatures and prevents precocious flowering. In contrast, the competing SVP FLM-δ complex is impaired in DNA binding and acts as a dominant negative activator of flowering at higher temperatures. Our results demonstrate the importance of temperature-dependent alternative splicing in modulating the timing of the floral transition in response to environmental change.
