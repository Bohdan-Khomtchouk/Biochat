This series examines gene expression in the anterior midgut at several time points (2, 4, 8, & 16 h for males, 8 h for females) after topical application of juvenile hormone III (JHIII) or acetone (control) to adult beetles.  In addition, gene expression in male anterior midguts were examined 24 h after phloem feeding or in unfed beetles.
