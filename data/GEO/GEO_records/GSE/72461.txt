TITLE
Novel JAZ co-operativity and unexpected JA dynamics underpin Arabidopsis defence responses to Pseudomonas syringae infection

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Pathogens target phytohormone signalling pathways to promote disease. Plants deploy salicylic acid (SA) mediated defences against biotrophs. Pathogens antagonise SA immunity by activating jasmonate signalling, e.g. Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 produces coronatine (COR), a jasmonate (JA) mimic. This study found unexpected dynamics between SA, JA and COR and co-operation between JAZ jasmonate repressor proteins during DC3000 infection. JA did not accumulate until late in the infection process and was higher in leaves challenged with coronatine deficient P. syringae or in the more resistant JA receptor mutant coi1. JAZ regulation was complex and coronatine alone was insufficient to sustainably induce JAZs.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from leaves of wild type Col-0 or the jaz5/10 mutant plants from leaves 6, 8, 12 or 16 hours after challenged with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000.
