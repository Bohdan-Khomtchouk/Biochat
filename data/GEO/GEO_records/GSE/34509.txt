TITLE
TGFb receptor 1 (TGFBR1) inhibitor treatment of zebrafish embryos vs. controls

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The effect of transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1) inhibitor (LY-364947) treatment was compared to untreated embryos. Experimental details and analyzed data are available in Willaert et al. Human Molecular Genetics 2011; doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddr555

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, LY-364947 (40microM) treatment vs untreated controls. Biological replicates: 3 LY-364947 treatment replicates compared to a pooled sample of 3 untreated control replicates with dye swap.
