TITLE
Transient expression of Bcl6 is sufficient for oncogenic function and induction of mature B-cell lymphoma

SUMMARY
Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) of hematopoeitic stem/progenitor cells and mature B-cells from wild-type mice and mice transiently expressing Bcl6 under control of the Sca1 promoter.

DESIGN
CBAxC57BL/6J mice were engineered to transiently express a Bcl6 cDNA in hematopoeitic stem/progenitor cells under control of the Sca1 promoter and then delete the transgene by cre-mediated recombination upon expression of Cd79a (Sca1-BCL6Î”). Hematopoeitic stem/progentior cells (HSPC, Sca1+Lin-) from the bone marrow and mature B-cells (B220+) from the peripheral blood were isolated from these mice and wild-type CBAxC57BL/6J mice by fluorescence activated cell sorting. Cells from 6-9 mice were pooled, for a total of 4 experimental conditions. DNA was extracted for each condition and analyzed by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing.
