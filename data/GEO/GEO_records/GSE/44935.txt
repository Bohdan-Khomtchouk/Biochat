TITLE
The Role of Tet1 During Somatic Cell Reprogramming

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tet1 is a hydroxylase known for its role in the conversion of 5-methylcytosines (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC) involved in the possible active demethylation process and gene expression regulation. As somatic cell reprogramming involves the re-activation of pluripotency genes and the silencing of somatic ones, it remains unclear the role of Tet1 in the reprogramming process. Here, we performed hMeDIP-seq and RNA-seq during somatic cells reprogramming with Tet1 over expression to invest the effect of Tet1.

DESIGN
Examination of genome DNA hmC modifications in 2 conditions: individually overexpressed Tet1CD or Tet2CD during MEF reprogramming; Examination of mRNA levels in five different conditions: individually overexpressed DR or Tet1CD or Tet1CDmut or Tet2CD or Tet2CDmut, during MEF reprogrammig.
