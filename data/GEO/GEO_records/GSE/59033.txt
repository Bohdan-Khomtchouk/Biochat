TITLE
Early lineage restriction and regional segregation during mammalian heart development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cardiac development arises from two sources of mesoderm progenitors, the first (FHF) and the second heart field (SHF). Mesp1 has been proposed to mark the most primitive multipotent cardiac progenitors common for both heart fields. Here, using clonal analysis of the earliest prospective cardiovascular progenitors in a temporally controlled manner during the early gastrulation, we found that Mesp1 progenitors consist of two temporally distinct pools of progenitors restricted to either the FHF or the SHF. FHF progenitors were unipotent, while SHF progenitors, were either uni- or bipotent. Microarray and single cell RT-PCR analysis of Mesp1 progenitors revealed the existence of molecularly distinct populations of Mesp1 progenitors, consistent with their lineage and regional contribution. Altogether, these results provide evidence that heart development arises from distinct populations of unipotent and bipotent cardiac progenitors that independently express Mesp1 at different time points during their specification, revealing that the regional segregation and lineage restriction of cardiac progenitors occurs very early during gastrulation. We used microarrays to characterize the molecular mechanisms that control Mesp1 progenitor specification and lineage segregation during the early stage of cardiac mesoderm formation,

DESIGN
50 Mesp1 H2B-GFP+ or Mesp1 H2B-GFP- cells at E6.5 or E7.5 from mouse embryos were sorted for RNA extraction, amplification and hybridization on Affimetrix microarrays. Microaarrays were performed on Mouse Genome 430 PM strip Affymetrix array. The overall design was repeated in two different biological samples.
