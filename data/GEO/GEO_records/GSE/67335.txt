TITLE
Impact of Lef1 overexpression on follicular helper T (Tfh) differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptome between GFP-RV+ Th1 cells and Lef1-RV+ Th1 cells

DESIGN
B6 mice received GFP-RV+ or Lef1-RV+ LCMV gp specific TCRtg Smarta cells and were infected with LCMV. On four days after infection, splenocytes were collected to sort CXCR5- Th1 cells per genotype. Contributor: LIAI RNAi Center (LIAI)
