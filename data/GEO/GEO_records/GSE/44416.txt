TITLE
Genome-wide binding of TEAD4 in gastric cancer cell lines MKN28 and SNU216

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To access target binding sites of TEAD4 in gastric cancer, TEAD4 binding was investigated using MKN28 and SNU216 cell lines by ChIP-seq.

DESIGN
MKN28 and SNU216 cell lines were cross-linked with formaldehyde, fractionated by sonication and immunoprecipitated by TEAD4 antibody. Immunoprecipitated DNA was prepared by generating libraries and sequenced by massive parallel sequencing.
