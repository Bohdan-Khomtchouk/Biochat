TITLE
Expression data from RAW264.7 murine macrophages infected with Toxoplasma gondii and subsequently stimulated with interferon-gamma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Toxoplasma strains are known to inhibit the expression of several interferon-gamma induced genes, and a type II strain was shown to dysregulate genome-wide responses to interferon-gamma in human fibroblasts (Kim et al., 2007, J Immunol.).  In this study we aimed to determine the effect of infection with three clonal lineages of Toxoplasma, type I, II, and III strains on genome-wide interferon-gamma induced transcription in murine macrophages.  We also assessed the effect of the two main Toxoplasma modulators of mouse macrophage transcription, ROP16 and GRA15 (Jensen et al., 2011, Cell Host Microbe). We used Affymetrix microarrays to analyze host cell transcription after Toxoplasma infection and interferon-gamma stimulation.

DESIGN
RAW264.7 murine macrophages were left uninfected or infected with type I (RH), type I ∆rop16 (RH ∆rop16), type II (Pru), type II ∆gra15 (Pru ∆gra15), or type II (CEP) parasites at an MOI ~5 for 18 hours and subsequently stimulated with murine IFN-γ for six hours.  Plaque assays were done to assess parasite viability.  Total RNA was isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse 430A 2.0 gene chips.
