TITLE
Suz12, EZH2 and H3me3K27 binding sites in F9 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Suz12 samples are biological replicates from F9 cells crosslinked on different days.  EZH2 and H3me3K27 samples are from the same batch of crosslinked cells as Suz12 replicate 2. For each sample matched total was prepared in parallel. Amplicons were made and hybridized on custom genomic tiling arrays. Keywords: ChIP-chip
