TITLE
Gene expression from H69M versus H69 SCLC cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
H69M cells derive from H69 small cell lung cancer cells subjected to prolonged treatment with HGF. Among the whole population of cells, a subset of more fibroblastic cells was isolated (H69M-mesenchymal). In this experiment we compared expression profiles of both cell lines Keywords: Expression Profiling by array

DESIGN
We analyzed 3 arrays from each condition:H69 versus H69M SCLC cell lines
