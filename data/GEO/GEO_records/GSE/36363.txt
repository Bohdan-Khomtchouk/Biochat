TITLE
Human lung adenocarcinoma DNA copy number profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung adenocarcinoma’s genomic alterations exhibit vast variation.  Lung adenocarcinoma also has previously described intrinsic gene expression subtypes (Hayes et al. 2006, PMID: 17075127).  This study’s aim was to detect and validate subtype-specific alterations.  A portion of these specimens were also assayed for genomewide transcription in GSE26939.

DESIGN
103 tumor samples and 30 normal samples were quantified for DNA copy number using Affymetrix SNP microarrays.
