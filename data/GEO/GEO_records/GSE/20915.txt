TITLE
Bortezomib resistance in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) is associated with plasmacytic differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bortezomib-induced resistant MCL cell lines (HBL2 BR and JEKO BR) were generated by continuous cultured of corresponding parental cell lines (HBL2 PT and JEKO PT) with increasing bortezomib concentrations The IC50 of bortezomib of BR cell lines was 80 fold higher than the IC50 of the parental clone for HBL2-BR and 40 fold higher for JEKO-BR.RNA was isolated from cells collected at different time points within the period of one month in triplicate for HBL2 and in duplicate for JEKO subclones. This material was used for gene expression analysis using Affymetrix platform. Keywords: RNA

DESIGN
Comparision of gene expression profiling in matched pairs of PT and BR cell lines

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
