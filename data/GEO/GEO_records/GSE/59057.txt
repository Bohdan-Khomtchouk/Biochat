TITLE
A newly identified spliced isoform of metadherin differently regulates the global transcriptomic profile in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The current study analyzed the metadherin (MTDH)-mediated altered gene expression profiles in ER negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Some of these altered gene expressions were further inter connected to various pathways which may eventually be recognized as drug targets or biomarkers in those breast cancers where MTDH plays a role in cancer progression/metastasis.

DESIGN
To understand the global differential gene expression profile in MTDH-wild type and a newly identified MTDH-isoform knock down in metastatic breast cancer cells. This data was compared to untreated breast cancer cells.
