TITLE
Gene expression profile of stage I lung adenocarcinoma and matched multi-site non-tumor lung samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, a unique geographical tissue sampling collection was obtained from patients that underwent curative lobectomy for stage I pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Tumor and non-tumor lung samples located at 0, 2, 4, and 6 cm away from the tumor were collected. Whole genome gene expression profiling was performed on all samples (n = 5 specimens x 12 patients = 60). Analyses were carried out to identify genes differentially expressed in tumor compared to adjacent non-tumor lung tissues at different distances from the tumor as well as to identify stable and transient genes in non-tumor tissues with respect to tumor proximity.

DESIGN
Gene expression was performed in stage I adenocarcinoma and matched non-tumor lung tissues located at 0, 2, 4, and 6 cm away from the tumor in 12 patients (n = 5 specimens x 12 patients = 60). One tumor sample and two non-tumor specimens located at 0 cm failed QC and were excluded. A total of 57 samples are thus include in this dataset (n = 4-5 specimens x 12 patients).
