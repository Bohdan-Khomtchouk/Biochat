TITLE
Differential expression of genes in Streptococcus sanguinis nox mutant and its complemented strain

ORGANISM
Streptococcus sanguinis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Streptococcus sanguinis nox mutant and its complemented strain compared to the wild-type SK36.

DESIGN
Two experiments:nox mutant vs. SK36, nox complemeted strain vs. SK36. Biological replicates: triplicates, independently grown and harvested. Four replicate per array.
