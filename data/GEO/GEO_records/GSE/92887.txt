TITLE
Impact of HypERrlnc Knockdown on the human pericyte transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pericytes are essential for vessel maturation and endothelial barrier function. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate endothelial cell function, but their role in pericyte biology remains unexplored. Here we characterize the human pericyte transcriptome following knockdown of lncRNA HypERrlnc (RP11-65J21.3).

DESIGN
To investigate the impact of the knockdown of long noncoding RNA HypERrlnc on the pericyte transcriptome. HypERrlnc was silenced by LNA GapmeRs, controls were treated with scramble LNA GapmeR control. HypERrlnc was silenced in 3 independent experiments and total, ribosomal depleted RNA was subsequently analyzed via RNA deep sequencing. Mouse pericytes were kept in pre-equilibrated culture medium in a hypoxic incubator (Labotect) with humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2, 1% O2, 37Â°C. Mouse Pericytes were subjected to hypoxia for 24 h. Hypoxia was verified with measurement of culture medium pO2 levels with a hypoxia sensing probe (Oxford Optronix) as described elsewhere (Zehendner et al Plos One 2013).
