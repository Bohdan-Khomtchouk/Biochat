TITLE
Expression data from preadipocytes isolated from laying hen II

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Adipogenesis is one of the most intensively studied models of cellular differentiation, and transcriptional activities involved in the process have been extensively investigated. We analyzed transcripts differentially expressed between hen preadipocytes treated with adipogenic cocktail containing 500 nM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 20 µg/mL insulin and 300 μM OA (DMIOA) and non-treated control cells and transcripts differentially expressed between preadipocytes treated with DMIOA alone and those treated with a combination of DMIOA and 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol (DMIOA + 20(S)) using Affymetrix GeneChip® Chicken Genome Array containing 28,000 transcripts.

DESIGN
Preadipocytes were isolated from hen abdominal tissue, cultured and treated with DMIOA, DMIOA+Retinoic Acid

PLATFORM
GPL3213 [Chicken] Affymetrix Chicken Genome Array
