TITLE
The naked endosperm genes encode duplicate ID domain transcription factors required for maize endosperm differentiation

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
The objective of the current study is to unravel the gene regulatory networks controlled by the nkd genes during maize endosperm developent. We compared wild type (B73) vs. nkd mutant (introgressed into B73 background) transcriptomes in aleurone vs. starchy endosperm cell types captured by laser capture microdissection technology.

DESIGN
We performed RNA seq analysis of mid-mature (15DAP) endosperm in two cell types [aleurone (A) and starchy endosperm (S)] of wild type B73 (B) and nkd mutant (N) kernels with three independent biological replicates.
