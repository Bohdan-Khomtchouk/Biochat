TITLE
Modulation of the transcriptional response to recombinant IFN-β by Acetaminophen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the effect of acetaminophen (APAP) on the transcriptional response induced by interferon-β (IFN-β). Transcript levels from total RNA isolated rom murine livers were determined using G4121B whole genome arrays. Keywords: Pharmakinetics, drug treatment

DESIGN
6-8 week male CD-1 mice were administered vehicle alone, APAP, IFN-β or IFN-β + APAP (n=5 per treatment per time point 40 animals total) and were euthanized at 1.5 or 4 hours post-treatment. Agilent 22k whole genome arrays were used to measure changes in mRNA transcripts in the liver mRNA. Stratatagene Universal Mouse RNA was used as a reference.

PLATFORM
GPL2881 Agilent-013326 Mouse Oligo Microarray (V2) G4121B (Feature Number version)
