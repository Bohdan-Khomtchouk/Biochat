TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of tumor regression upon K-RAS inactivation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed expression profiling on micro-dissected lung tumors derived from a doxycycline-inducible K-RAS mouse model in order to gain mechanistic insight into K-RAS-mediated tumor maintenance. In this model, the tumors were induced with doxycycline for 11 weeks (in order to obtain lung tumors). At this point the doxycyline was withrawn from the food of the mice and consequently K-RAS inactivated. Thus, the genome-wide analysis was performed on tumors at timepoints 0, 24h and 48h after K-RAS inactivation.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from mouse lung tumors at time 0 and 24h or 48h after K-RAS inactivation.

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
