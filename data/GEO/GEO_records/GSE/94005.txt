TITLE
Small RNA sequencing of wild-type and Mrpp3 knock out mouse heart mitochondria

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Small RNA sequencing was used to examine RNA degradation products in mitochondria from mice lacking the nuclease subunit of the mitochondrial RNase P (MRPP3).

DESIGN
RNA from purified mouse mitochondria from wild-type and Mrpp3 knock out mouse hearts was sequenced using Illumina TruSeq Small RNA Library methods.

PLATFORM
