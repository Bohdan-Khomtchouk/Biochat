TITLE
Expression data from pancreatic stellate cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
tumor-stroma crosstalk drives pancreatic carcinogenesis we used time-resolved genome-wide transcriptional profiling to analyse changes caused by co-exposure of pancreatic tumor and stellate cells

DESIGN
Primary pancreatic Stellate cells (PSC) were treated with  a cumulative supernatant of pancreatic tumor cell lines (n=8) and harvested at 1-7, and 24 hours post exposure for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The 8 tumor cell lines are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma lines: AsPC1, BxPC3, Capan1, Colo357, MiaPaca2, Panc1, Su8686, and T3M4
