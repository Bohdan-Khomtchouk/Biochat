TITLE
In vitro differentiation of human low threshold mechanoreceptive (LTMR) neurons from embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic stem cells were differentiated into peripheral sensory neurons via the intermediate generation of neural crest like cell (NCC). Using various markers we identified these cells as LTMR. We then analyzed there complete transcriptional profile in comparison to the intermediate neural crest like cells.

DESIGN
mRNA expression data of human ESC-derived sensory neuron clusters (10-20 cells) and human ESC-derived neural crest like cells (~100 cells) was generated by illumina deep sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
