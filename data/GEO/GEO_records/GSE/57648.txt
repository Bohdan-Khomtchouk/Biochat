TITLE
Effect of Rps5 heterozygous deletion on embryonic stem cells transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using wild-type and Rps5 heterozygous embryonic stem cells, we isolated RNA from polyribosomal fractions in order to get insights into transcriptional and translational defects of such deletion.

DESIGN
Input, monosomes and polysomes extracted RNA samples from wild-type and Rps5 heterozygous clones (undifferentiated and differentiated, total number of samples = 12), were subjected to sequencing.
