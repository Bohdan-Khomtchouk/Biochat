TITLE
Genome-wide DHS study to unravel the function of EBF1 C-terminus domain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the function of the C-terminus domain, DnaseI hypersensitivity assay was performed by transducing Empty, Ebf1wt and Ebf1ΔC expressing vectors into Ebf1-/- progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Freshly prepared Ebf1−/− c-Kit+ fetal liver cells were transduced with  pmys-Empty-IRES-GFP, pmys-EBF1wt-IRES-GFP or pmys-EBF1ΔC-IRES-GFP. EBF1wt- or EBF1ΔC-transduced cells were sorted as pro-B cells (GFP+CD19+). vector-transduced cells were sorted as only GFP+.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
