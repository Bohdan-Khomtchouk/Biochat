TITLE
Global survey of miRNA microarray of MCF-7 cells with or without estrogen (E2) treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the effect of E2 treatment for the miRNA expression in human MCF-7 cells, MCF-7 cells were treated with or without E2 (100 nM) for 4 hr or 24 hr.

DESIGN
Four group experiments; E2 (100 nM) treatment for 4 hr (MCF-7 E2 4h_1, MCF-7 E2 4h_2), vehicle (ethanol) treatment for 4 hr as Mock control (MCF-7 Mock1, MCF-7 Mock2), E2 (100 nM) treatment for 24 hr (MCF-7 E2 24h_1, MCF-7 E2 24h_2, MCF-7 E2 24h_3), vehicle treatment for 24 hr as Mock control (MCF-7 Mock_3, MCF-7 Mock_4, MCF-7 Mock_5).
