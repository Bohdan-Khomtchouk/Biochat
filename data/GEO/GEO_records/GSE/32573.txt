TITLE
Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC13032 Cells: Control (Wild-Type) vs cg0196 Deletion Mutant

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Corynebacterium glutamicum cells comparing wild-type cells with cg0196 deletion mutant cells by site-specific gene deletion using the non-replicable integration vector. cg0196 is gene conding transcriptional regulator related carbon metabolism.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Wild vs. Î”cg0196 cells. Independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
