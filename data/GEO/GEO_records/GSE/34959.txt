TITLE
Expression profiling of primary wild type (WT), Ezh2-null and Eed-null murine MLL-AF9 AML

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We evaluated gene expression changes in murine leukemia caused by retroviral overexpression of MLL-AF9. We compared wild-type (WT) leukemia cells with mutant leukemia cells after cre-mediated inactivation of homozygous conditional alleles for Ezh2 or Eed, both of which are components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex2.

DESIGN
For WT cells, 3 biological replicates were hybridized. For Ezh2-null cells, 4 biological replicates were hybridized. For Eed-cells, 3 biological replicates were hybridized.
