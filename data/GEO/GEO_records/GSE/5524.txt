TITLE
Gene Expression During Recovery from Freezing

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Freezing causes physiological changes even in a hardy, cold-acclimated wild type. During recovery from freezing, gene expression will reflect the induction of damage-repair processes distinct from the damage-prevention associated with cold acclimation. This will be detected by observing the wild-type transcriptome at two time points during recovery from a freezing episode. The appropriate control is the unfrozen, cold-acclimated wild type.
