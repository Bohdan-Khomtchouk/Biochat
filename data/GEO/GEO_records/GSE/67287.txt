TITLE
The effect of age on alternative splicing in different tissues of wild-type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exon level expression analysis for the physiological aging study data set to analyze the effect of age on alternative splicing in different tissues and age groups of wild-type mice Analysis of the effect of age on alternative splicing (AS) using exon microarrays to interrogate the differential exon usage  of the entire genome of aging wild-type male C57BL/6J mice (4- and 18-month-old) in five tissues (skin, skeletal muscle, bone, thymus, and white adipose tissue) and in an additional 28-month-old age group, which allowed for age-related AS analysis of the skin, skeletal muscle and bone tissues. We found AS genes with age in all tissue, we show that the number of AS genes increased with age and that AS genes across all tissues are involved in RNA processing. Note: This dataset is one of the 2 datasets in the overall study. An additional data set series is available with exon expression analysis of HGPS mice to analyze the effect of progerin expression on alternative splicing. The two datasets are linked together in the SuperSeries GSE67289. A link to the SuperSeries is available at the bottom of this page.

DESIGN
65  tissue samples from wild-type male  C57BL/6J mice; from  5 different tissues (ventral skin, skeletal muscle, bone, muscle, and white adipose tissue) and from 3 different age groups: 4, 18 and 28 months  (for skin skeletal muscle and bone ) and from 2 different age groups: 4 and 18 months (for ventral skin, skeletal muscle, bone, thymus and white adipose tissue)
