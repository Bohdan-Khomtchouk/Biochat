TITLE
Expression data from adipose tissue of 19 healthy obese individuals at three time-points during one-year weightloss intervention

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the temporal changes occurring in adipose tissue gene expression during a one-year weightloss intervention, adipose tissue biopsies were collected from 19 healthy obese individuals at three time points. We used microarrays to elucidate the gene expression changes occuring in adipose tissue during weightloss.

DESIGN
Adipose tissue biopsies were collected from 19 obese healthy participants(Baseline (T0), fifth month (T1) and twelfth month (T2)) to understand the gene expression changes occurring in adipose tissue during weight loss.
