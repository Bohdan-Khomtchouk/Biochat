TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of mouse liver after short-term in vivo exposure (up to 56 days) of C57BL-mice to carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic chemicals

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further our investigations for early biomarkers of non-genotoxic carcinogenesis, groups of mice were treated with a range of known or suspected non-genotoxic carcinogens for a period of 28 or 56d and liver tissue harvested for expression profiling. Control groups were treated with appropriate vehicles.

DESIGN
Group size was 5 mice (mus musculus, C57BL/6J, randomly assigned); all chemicals were of the highest quality available, and were administered by experienced personnel.

PLATFORM
