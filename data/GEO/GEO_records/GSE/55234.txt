TITLE
Global expression profiles of the wild-type and overexpression of OsNMD3ΔNLS transgenic plants

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Plants have mechanisms that coordinate protein synthesis and gene transcription, although they operate at different cellular sites. The altered translational efficiency may have a feedback effect on gene expression. To determine the global changes in ribosome biogenesis, we used an Illumina RNA sequencing approach to investigate the global expression profiles of the wild-type,OsNMD3ΔNLSL1,and OsNMD3ΔNLSL2 plants.These expression profiles suggested that overexpression of OsNMD3ΔNLS affected ribosome biogenesis and certain basic pathways, leading to pleotropic abnormalities in plant growth.

DESIGN
The mRNA profiles of the 2nd internodes of development-matched wild-type and overexpression of OsNMD3ΔNLS transgenic plants.
