TITLE
Gene-expression profiling between segmental vitiligo, generalized vitiligo and healthy individual

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigate the gene expression change in the blood of segmental vitiligo, generalized vitiligo and healthy individual.

DESIGN
In the study, a consecutively operated, well-defined cohort of 60 samples in total, followed by pooling every 5 samples, was used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 31,741 probes.
