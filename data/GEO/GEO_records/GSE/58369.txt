TITLE
Leishmania major infection-induced changes in the small RNA transcriptome of host macrophages.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania are the causative agent of leishmaniasis, one of the 13 most important tropical diseases. Leishmania persists as endo-parasite in host macrophages, where it uses multiple strategies to manipulate the microbicidal host cell functions and to escape from the host immune system. Understanding how Leishmania interacts with host macrophages during uptake, differentiation, intracellular replication, and release might be the key to develop new drugs in target-directed approaches to treat patient with leishmaniasis. Short non-coding RNAs are known to regulate the expression of protein-coding genes at post-transcriptional level. Characterization of these processes during Leishmania infection provides deeper insight in the interaction between host and parasites.

DESIGN
Here, we generated miRNA expression profiles from bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) at 4h and 24h post infection (p.i.) with Leishmania major and respective controls.
