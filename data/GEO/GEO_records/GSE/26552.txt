TITLE
Genome-wide binding of STAT3 and STAT5 under Th17 conditions (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Interleukin 2 (IL-2), a cytokine linked to human autoimmune diseases, limits IL-17 production. We show that deletion of Stat3 in T cells abrogates IL-17 production and attenuates autoimmunity associated with IL-2 deficiency. While STAT3 induces IL-17 and RORγt and inhibits Foxp3, IL-2 inhibited IL-17 independently of Foxp3 and RORγt. We found that STAT3 and STAT5 bound to multiple common sites across the Il17 genetic locus. The induction of STAT5 binding by IL-2 was associated with a reduction in STAT3 binding at these sites and the inhibition of associated active epigenetic marks. Titrating the relative activation of STAT3 and STAT5 modulated TH17 cell specification. Thus, the balance rather than the absolute magnitude of these signals determines the propensity of cells to make a key inflammatory cytokine.

DESIGN
The genome-wide binding of STAT3 and STAT5 under Th17 conditions was investigated by CHIP-seq.
