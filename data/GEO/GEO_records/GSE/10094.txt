TITLE
Gene expression analysis of SMARTA in response to LCMV or Lm-gp61 infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Following infection with LCMV, CD4+ SMARTA TCR transgenic cells (specific for the gp61-80 epitope of the LCMV glycoprotein) rapidly expand, become effector cells, and go on to form a long-lived memory population.  Following infection with a recombinant Listeria monocytogenes expressing the LCMV epitope gp61-80, SMARTA cells also expand but display defective effector differentiation and fail to form memory.  In an attempt to understand the signals required for CD4 T cell memory differentiation, we compared gene expression by SMARTA cells at the peak of the primary response following either Lm-gp61 or LCMV infection. Keywords: response to LCMV or Lm-gp61 infection

DESIGN
SMARTA cells were purified at day 7 post-infection with either LCMV or Lm-gp61.  SMARTA cells were sorted on the basis of Thy1.1 expression using a FACSAria.  Cells were sorted through the machine twice to enhance purity.  Two biological replicates of each group are provided.  Each replicate represents the results of SMARTA pooled from three animals.
