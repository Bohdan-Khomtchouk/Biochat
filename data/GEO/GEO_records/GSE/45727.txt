TITLE
NLRP7 promotes trophoblast lineage differentiation, YY1 binding and alters CpG methylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of hESC in the untransduced, scrambled control and with knockdown of NLRP7 in undifferentiated and BMP4 differentiated states using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip. Several genomic sites exhibit altered methylation upon knocking down NLRP7.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from 3 replicates of untransduced, scrambled control and NLRP7 knockdown in the undifferentiated and BMP differentiated groups were hybridised to the Illumina Human Methylation 450 Beadchip.

PLATFORM
