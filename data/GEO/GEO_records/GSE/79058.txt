TITLE
Assessment of tumor heterogeneity, as evidenced by gene expression profiles, pathway activation, and gene copy number, in patients with multifocal invasive lobular breast tumors [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) comprises approximately ~10-20% of breast cancers. In general, multifocal/multicentric (MF/MC) breast cancer has been associated with an increased rate of regional lymph node metastases. Tumor heterogeneity between foci represents a largely unstudied source of genomic variation in those rare patients with MF/MC ILC.

DESIGN
We characterized gene expression and copy number in 2 or more foci from 11 patients with MF/MC ILC (all ER+, HER2-) and adjacent normal tissue. RNA was extracted from 3x1.5mm cores from all foci. Gene expression (730 genes) was measured using the Nanostring PanCancer Pathways Panel. Linear mixed models were employed to compare expression in tumor versus normal samples from the same patient, and to assess heterogeneity (variability) in expression among multiple ILC within an individual.
