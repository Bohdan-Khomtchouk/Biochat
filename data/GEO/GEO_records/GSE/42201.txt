TITLE
Chromatin immunoprecipitation of MADS29 to find the cis regulatory regions and targets of this transcription factor

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
A ChIP-seq analysis revealed 378 targets of OsMADS29, which include genes involved in cytokinin metabolism and auxin signaling, carbohydrate metabolism, transporters and a large number of transcription factors, reflecting on its functional diversity.

DESIGN
Chromatin Immunonoprecipitation of MADS29 using antiMADS29 antibody was done using rice 9 DAP seed tissue with total input chromatin and mock immunoprecipitated chromatin as controls

PLATFORM
GPL9147 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Oryza sativa)
