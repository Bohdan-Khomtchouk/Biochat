TITLE
Gene expression profiling in the Cynomolgus macaque Macca fascicularis shows variation within the normal birth range.

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
To understand the effect of an adverse early life environment within  the normal birth range we have utilised a non human primate model Macca fascicularis and employed microarray. We have identified 1973 genes which were differentially expressed in the three tissue types namely umbilical cord, neonatal liver, and skeletal muscle.
