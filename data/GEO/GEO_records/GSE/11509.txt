TITLE
comparison of virulence factors and expression of specific genes of UPEC and APEC in vivo and in vitro

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
To gain further information of the correlation and pathogenisis of UPEC and APEC, the in vivo expression of 152 specific genes in both murine urinary tract infection (UTI) model and chicken challenge model were compared to that of UPEC U17 and APEC E058 grown statically to exponential phase in rich medium, respectively.

DESIGN
DNA microarrays were applied to analyze the transcriptomes of UPEC U17 and APEC E058 grown under both in vivo and in vitro conditions.  The source for in vivo-grown bacterial RNA was obtained from bacteria of the infected chicken and inoculated mice, and the source for in vitro-grown bacterial RNA was cultures of UPEC U17 and APEC E058 grown statically to mid-exponential phase at 37Â°C in LB.
