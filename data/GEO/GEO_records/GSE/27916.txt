TITLE
Human subcutaneous adipose tissue gene expression (SOS Sib-pair study, offspring cohort)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Obesity has considerable effects on morbidity and mortality, and the prevalence of obesity has been increasing rapidly worldwide during the past two decades. Even if obesity affects the entire individual, adipose tissue plays a central role in the development of obesity. Expression profiling of adipose tissue may give insights into the mechanisms contributing to obesity and obesity-related disorders. The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) Sib-Pair Study consists of 154 nuclear families with BMI-discordant sib pairs (BMI difference more than 10 kg/m2) resulting in a study population consisting of 732 subjects. The full SOS Sib-Pair study offspring cohort consists of 425 subjects. Microarray expression analysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue was performed in 375 subjects (262 women and 113 men) of the SOS Sib-Pair offspring cohort.

DESIGN
Microarray expression analysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue was performed in women (n=262) and men (n=113) of the SOS Sib-Pair offspring cohort.
