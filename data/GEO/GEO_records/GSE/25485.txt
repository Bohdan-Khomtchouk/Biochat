TITLE
Gene expression data in Bone Marrow Derived Dendritic Cells (BMDC) following nanoemulsion adjuvant exposure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Antigen uptake, processing and presentation by dendritic cells are regulated by complex intra- and inter-cellular signalling events.  Typical vaccine adjuvants lead to the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which relate to immune induction. We used microarrays to detail the global expression of genes in BMDC underlying emulsion internalization and DC activation with a non-inflammatory nanoemulsion adjuvant.

DESIGN
BMDC were incubated with 0.001% v/v  naomeulsion (W805EC) or media alone for  6 hours.  Total RNA was extracted per sample using RNA easy (Qiagen).
