ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of FACS sorted GFP+ve cells from sexed gonads of transgenic pSF1-eGFP mice Keywords: Time course and comparison of sexes

DESIGN
Experiment is both a time course and an assesment of sex specific expression in SF1+ve somatic gonadal cells. Each time point and sex has been profiled in triplicate
