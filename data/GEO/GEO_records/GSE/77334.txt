TITLE
ChIPseq to profile CDK9 and Hes1 occupancy in bone marrow-derived macrophages from C57BL/6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We characterized the CDK9 and Hes1 occupancy on gene loci in conditions of unstimuated and LPS stimualtion in BMDMs

DESIGN
BMDMs were left untreated or stimulated with LPS for 1 hour. CDK9 or Hes1 ChIP was performed and the DNA products were subject to ChIPseq

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
