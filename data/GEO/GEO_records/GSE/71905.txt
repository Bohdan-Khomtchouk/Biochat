TITLE
Study of microRNA associated with metforminâ€™s anti-tumor effect in cholangiocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The miRNAs expression was markedly altered with the treatment of metformin in vivo and various miRNAs induced by metformin also may contribute to tumor growth of cholangiocarcinoma in vivo.

DESIGN
Using a custom microarray platform, we analyzed the expression levels of 985 human miRNA probes in the tumorous tissues in vivo that was treated with and without metformin.
