TITLE
Effect of Rho-associated kinase inhibitor on cryopreservation of hES cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
After thawing, the mechanism of apoptosis advancing in human ES cells was invesitigated mainly by Gene conpath analysis. As time passed after thawing, nuclear fragmented cells increased more and more in cR-/mR- and cR+/mR-, but in cR+/mR+ and cR-/mR+, thawed cells formed cluster markedly, which was seen among three cell lines. Flow cytometry using TUNEL assay supported final colony formation ratio, which defined that such cell death was due to apoptosis.  Gene map analysis 12 hours later after thawing of cR-/mR- showed activation of IL-1β & its receptor IL-1R and TGF-β & its receptor ACVR1C required for activation of caspase-8, initiation of caspase-8 and 10 and marked activation of ARHGDIB promoting actin reorganization comparing to cR+/mR+.  Recovered cell lines in any condition did not lose proliferation and pluripotency regardless of ROCK inhibitor treatment.　These results showed apoptotic events after thawing were more marked in cR- and advanced through autoenhanced cascaded mechanism followed by initiation of self-cytokain activity, and were suppressed by ROCK inhibitor Y-27632.

DESIGN
To investigate the protective mechanism caused by a novel cryo-technique of human embryonic stem (hES) cells using ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 against the cell death due to cryopreservation and thawing with Gene map analysis in addition to estimations of survival rate, apoptosis, undifferentiated states and pluripotency, the dissociated hES cells were cryopreserved in a freezing container in the following four conditions: addition of 10µM of Y-27632 to 1: cryoprotection solution and post-thawing medium (cR+/mR+), 2: only addition to cryoprotection (cR+/mR-), 3: only addition to post-thawing medium (cR-/mR+), 4: no addition to any medium (cR-/mR-).
