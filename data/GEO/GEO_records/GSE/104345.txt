TITLE
FoxP3 scanning mutagenesis reveals functional variegation and mild mutations with atypical autoimmune phenotypes [microarray]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray profiles of M176, M354 and WT FoxP3 -transdued (in vitro) and -Treg from mice

DESIGN
DAPI-CD4+Thy1.1high T cells for in vitro transduction or DAPI-CD4+CD25high Tregs were double sorted from treated mice. Total RNA was prepared using Trizol method followed by amplification and cDNA preparation. cDNA was hybridized to Affymetrix ST1.0 microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
