TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of parental mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) and HMBA-resistant (MEL-R) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have previously isolated a murine erythroleukemia cell line refractive to re-enter a cell differentiation program as opposite to the progenitor cell line. We use RNA-seq to identify differentially expressed genes in both cell lines

DESIGN
Gene expression levels from MEL DS19 and MEL-R cell cultures were compared by next generation sequencing using standard RNA-seq protocols

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
