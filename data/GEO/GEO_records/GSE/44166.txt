TITLE
Expression Data from Normal or ErbB2 Tumor Fibroblasts With or Without Ets2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mechanisms involved in epithelium-stroma interactions remain poorly understood, despite the importance of the microenvironment during tumorigenesis.  Here, we studied the role of Ets2 transcrpiton factor in tumor associated fibroblasts in the MMTV-ErbB2 mammary tumor model.  Inactivation of Ets2 specifically in fibroblasts using Fsp-cre significantly reduced tumor growth, in contrast to Ets2 inactivation in epithelium in which no differences in tumor growth were observed. Microarray analysis on isolated fibroblasts demonstrated the important role of Ets2 in remodeling of the extracellular matrix and angiogenesis in these cells.  Tumors lacking Ets2 in fibroblats had diminished blood vessels.  Our tumor specific gene signature was also represented in the stroma of human breast cancer patients.  Collectively, our results suggest Ets2 uniquely contributes to angiogenesis from fribroblasts in the tumor microenvironment.

DESIGN
Primary mammary fibroblasts were isolated from mice with no oncogene with or without Ets2 and with the ErbB2 oncogene with or without Ets2, RNA was extracted and samples were submitted for Affymetrix gene expression arrays
