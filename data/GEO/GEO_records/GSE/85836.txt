TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of MAT2A-associsted regions in bovine blastocysts

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), that catalyzes the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) from ATP and methionine, is involved in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (OCM) that is essential for preimplantation embryos in terms of both short-term periconceptional development and long-term phenotypic programming beyond the periconceptional period. SAM is the universal methyl donor for epigenetic methylation of DNA and histones. In the context of the long-term phenotypic programming by the modulation of OCM during periconceptional period, possible interactions between MAT2A and epigenetic status of specific genes during this period are of particular interest. MAT2A has been proposed to interact with many chromatin-related proteins and be recruited to their specific target genes to constitute gene-regulatory complexes. Thus, in the aim of addressing the possible interaction of MAT2A with specific genomic DNA regions in periconceptional period, we performed a ChIP-seq analysis using MAT2A antibody against bovine blastocysts.

DESIGN
In vitro produced bovine blastocysts were processed to ChIP-Seq using MAT2A antibody with corresponding Input and IgG control. The same procedures were duplicated using total of 669 and 677 blastocysts, respectively, for each replicate.
