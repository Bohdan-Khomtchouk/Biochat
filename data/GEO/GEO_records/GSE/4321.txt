TITLE
Time course analysis of genes regulated by E. coli sigma 32 (rpoH) after overexpression

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
DNA microarray analysis of genes regulated by the alternative sigma factor, sigma 32 (rpoH). Sigma 32-dependent genes were initially identified by comparing a wild type (wt) E. coli K-12 strain that has a low level of sigma 32, with a strain over-expressing sigma 32 (following induction of rpoH from an inducible promoter by IPTG). We monitored changes in gene expression in 4 separate time-courses. Because sigma 32 is negatively regulated, its activity decreases 10 min after overexpression. Consequently, to identify genes regulated by sigma 32 we analyzed the expression data for 10 min after overexpression using SAM (Statistical Analysis of Microarrays). We identified 105 genes organized in 66 separate transcription units. This study is detailed in Nonaka et al 2006 (submitted). Keywords: time course
