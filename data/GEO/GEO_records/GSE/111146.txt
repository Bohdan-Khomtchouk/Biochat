TITLE
Identification of a novel role of MTF2 in the regulation of H3K27me3 by PRC2 (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The epigentic mechnism establised by PRC2 silece the target genes by H3K27me3. H3K27me3 ChIP-seq was performed in the core PRC2 components knockded down cells.

DESIGN
Examination of the H3K27me3 changes in the PRC2 knocked down cells.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
