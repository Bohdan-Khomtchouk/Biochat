TITLE
Genome wide gene expression analysis BQ.Ncf1.m1J mutated and BQ wild type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Whole blood and spleen tissue was collected from naïve untreated mice. We compared the gene expression profiles of naïve autoimmunity prone BQ.Ncf1.m1J mutated mice and wild type BQ mice. The samples from specific pathogen-free animal facility were collected in two sample sets (marked I and II respectively) and the germ-free facility samples (marked GF / germ free) formed the third analyzed batch. The data revealed a pronounced type I interferon signature in the Ncf1.m1J mutated mice housed in both conditions.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated and globin removal was performed for all samples. The cells were not stimulated or selected ex vivo.
