TITLE
Human Gastric Cancer Cell line MKN45: Non-Target shRNA vs. SET/I2PP2A targeting shRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of MKN45 cells comparing control stably expressing Non-Targeting shRNA  cells with stably expressing SET/I2PP2A targeting shRNA cells. Goal was to determine the effects of SET knockdown on MKN45 gene expression.

DESIGN
Comparison between stably expresing cells: Non-Targeting shRNA vs. SET/I2PP2A shRNA cells.

PLATFORM
