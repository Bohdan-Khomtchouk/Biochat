TITLE
Gene expression variation among eight maize inbreds

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Expression profiling analyses for eight maize inbreds reveals extensive transcriptional variation.  Many genes exhibit presence-absence variation among the inbred lines. Keywords: Genotype comparison series

DESIGN
Affymetrix expression profiling was used to study gene expression in aerial tissue from 11-day seedlings of maize. Three biological replicates were performed for eight different inbred lines; B37, B73, B84, Mo17, Oh43, B14a, Wf9 and W22.
