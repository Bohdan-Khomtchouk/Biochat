TITLE
Genomic Loss of Penicillin-Binding Protein 3 in Burkholderia pseudomallei Confers Clinical Resistance to Ceftazidime

ORGANISM
Burkholderia pseudomallei

SUMMARY
Array-CGH analysis and Burkholderia pseudomallei isolates pre and post ceftazidime relapse.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from both the parental strains and variant strains were labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent dyes and hybridized onto a customized microarray with probes designed from the reference Bp K96243 genome. Log2 signal ratios of parental strain over the variant strains were then computed after normalization to find genomic loss or gain in the variant strains.
