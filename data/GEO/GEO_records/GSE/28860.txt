TITLE
WU-BC 3, 4, and 5 PAM50 Subtypes with Passage and Gene Expression Comparison Between Xenografts and Primary Tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Whole genome expression studies were performed on Xenograft panels with multiple passages from 3 different patient tumors.  We assessed the global gene expression concordance from passages to passage and from passage to primary tumor when available and performed PAM50 subtype classification.  These results were examined within the context of 40  PAM50 prototype experiments.

DESIGN
Thirteen experiments representing different tumor passages from WU-BC 3, 4, and 5 were compared using unsupervised hierarchical clustering and PAM50 Subtype Classification.  These experiments were analyzed within the context of previously published PAM50 Prototypes (GSE26082).

PLATFORM
