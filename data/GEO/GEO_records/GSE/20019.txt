TITLE
ChIP-chip from the follicular lymphoma cell line RL with H3K4me3, H3K37me3 and Suz12

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We conducted genome-wide bisulfite sequencing analysis of the follicular lymphoma cell line RL and found that a large amount of methylated genes are polycomb target genes in ES cells. We therefore conducted a ChIP-chip experiment to determine the methylated genes that are bound by the polycomb protein Suz12. Although 28% of MRIs are PRC2 target genes in ES cells, our ChIP-on-Chip analysis showed that only 13% of MRIs are associated with H3K27Me3 marks and only 5% of the MRIs are bound by Suz12 in RL cells in vivo.

DESIGN
Comparison of DNA methylation with histone modifications in RL cells.
