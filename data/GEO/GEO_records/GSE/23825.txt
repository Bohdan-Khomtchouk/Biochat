TITLE
non-M1 covRS-intact and -mutant GAS vs  M1 controls

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
Microarray was performed on RNA extracted from mid-logarithmic phase in vitro grown non-M1 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, with either intact or mutant covRS operons. These isolates were compared with corresponding M1 covRS intact and mutant forms to link the expression prolfiles of these non-M1 isolates with invasive pathogenesis.

DESIGN
A dye-swapped cyclic design was used in this study in order that each strain could be compared across all samples in silico. For each strain treated, 2 biological replicates were each analysed in dye-swapped technical replicates, giving a total of n=4 peplicates for each strain.

PLATFORM
