TITLE
Human Cactin interacts with DHX8 and SRRM2 to assure efficient pre-mRNA splicing and sister chromatid cohesion.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed whole PolyA+ RNA from human osteosarcoma U2OS cells depleted for human Cactin or transfected with a control shRNA.

DESIGN
Two independent shRNAs targeting human Cactin (shCac_C and shCac_D), a control shRNA (shCtrl), a single cell line (U2OS)

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
