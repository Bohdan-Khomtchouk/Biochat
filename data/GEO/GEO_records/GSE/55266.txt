TITLE
A composite map of copy number variable (CNV) regions in the horse genome and the discovery of CNVs involved in equine XY disorders of sexual development

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
38 horses from 16 diverse breeds and Przewalski's Horse were used to generate a composite CNV map of equine genome. This map was used to detect novel copy number variation in six horses affected with disorder of sexual development (DSD).

DESIGN
38 horses from 16 diverse breeds and Przewalski's Horse, at least one male and one female were taken from each breed, six DSD 'Sex-reversal' samples. Male and DSD samples were hybridized with Thoroughbred1, and female samples were hybridized with Thoroughbred2
