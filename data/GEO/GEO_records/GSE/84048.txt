TITLE
Development of gene expression profiles for murine breast tumours treated with Sunitinib

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to establish a profile of gene expression of tumours treated with sunitinib, 4T1 breast tumours were allowed to establish in Balb/C mice for 1 week. The mice were then treated with 40 mg/kg Sunitinib in PBS and 3.72% DMSO (treatemt group) or PBS-DMSO vehicle alone (no treatment group), daily for the period of the experiment, after which the tumours were resected homogenised and subjected to CD31 microbead separation of endothelial cells and bulk tissue, both of which were subjected to agilent microarray analysis. Treated tumours greater than 250 mm3 (by caliper measurement) after 8 days of treatment were considered resistant to treatment, those smaller than this were considered sensitive to sunitinib treatment.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from each tumour sample using the Qiagen miRNAeasy kit, processed into cRNA using the Agilient low input, one colour labelling kit, hybridised onto the 8 x 66k whole mouse genome expression microarrays. Data was normalised in R64 and comparison matrices between treated and untreated endothelum and bulk fractions were constructed. Genes whose expression was significantly altered by sunitinib treatement were taken forward for further analysis.
