TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of  Streptomyces natalensis HW-2 to fungal elicitor using RNA-sequencing

ORGANISM
Streptomyces natalensis

SUMMARY
To characterize the differentially expressed genes between adding fungal elicitor and without  fungal elicitor on Streptomyces natalensis HW-2

DESIGN
The elicitor was added to the fermentation medium of S. natalensis HW-2 after fermentation for 24 h at 28oC with the shaking of 180r/min.using RNA-sequencing,we determine the difference of gene expression in different time of fungal elicitor on Streptomyces natalensis

PLATFORM
GPL24797 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Streptomyces natalensis)
