TITLE
p120ctn mouse expression data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss of p120ctn results in dysplasia and invasive cancer in the mouse esophagus and squamous forestomach. We used microarray expression analysis to identify gene expression changes in pre-tumorigenic esophagus samples and in tumors of the squamous forestomach.

DESIGN
L2-Cre/p120 flox/flox tissue samples were compared to L2-Cre tissues.  Epithelium was separated from whole tissue samples by dispase treatment and used for analysis.
