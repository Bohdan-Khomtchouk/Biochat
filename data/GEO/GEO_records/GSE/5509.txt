TITLE
Expression data from Rat liver 48 hours after treated with different toxic compounds.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat has been treated with different compounds with the purpose of investigating toxicological mechanisms. But toxic and non-toxic compounds has been administered. 3 toxic (ANIT, DMN, NMF) 3 non-tox (Caerulein, dinitrophenol(DNP), Rosiglitazone) in 5-plicates (30 arrays in all) and 9 untreated (control), 39 samples in all. The array data was used to identify genes with biomarker potential for detecting toxic properties of compounds. Keywords: other

DESIGN
Rats was treated with different compounds and RNA from liver was extracyed after 48 hours. Microarrays (GeneChip Rat230 version 2) was run on the RNA
