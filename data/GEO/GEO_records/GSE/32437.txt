TITLE
Gene profiles during vestibular compensation in unilateral labyrinthectomized rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used to examine the expression of genes upregulated or downregulated in the ipsilateral vestibular nucleus at 1 and 7 days following unilateral labyrinthectomy. Changes in gene expression during the chronic phase of vestibular compensation following unilateral labyrinthectomy in rats

DESIGN
Three conditioned experiment: nl:control with sham operation, 1day:1day after labyrninthectomy, 7day:7day after labyrinthectomy

PLATFORM
GPL7294 Agilent-014879 Whole Rat Genome Microarray 4x44K G4131F (Probe Name version)
