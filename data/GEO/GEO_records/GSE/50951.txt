TITLE
EZH2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation mediates neurodegeneration in ataxia-telangiectasia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The symptoms of ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) include a progressive neurodegeneration caused by ATM protein deficiency. We previously found that nuclear accumulation of histone deacetylase-4, HDAC4, contributes to this degeneration; we now report that increased histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) mediated by polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) also plays an important role in the A-T phenotype. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a core catalytic component of PRC2, is identified as a new ATM kinase target, and its S734 phosphorylation reduces protein stability. Thus, PRC2 formation is elevated along with H3K27me3in ATM deficiency.  ChIP-sequencing shows a significant increase in H3K27me3 ‘marks’ and a dramatic shift in their location. The change of H3K27me3 chromatin-binding pattern is directly related to cell cycle re-entry and cell death of ATM-deficient neurons. Lentiviral knockdown of EZH2 rescues Purkinje cell degeneration and behavioral abnormalities in Atm /  mice, demonstrating that EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 is another key factor in A-T neurodegeneration.

DESIGN
Two samples each were run of brain total RNA from Atm+/+ and Atm-/- mice.
