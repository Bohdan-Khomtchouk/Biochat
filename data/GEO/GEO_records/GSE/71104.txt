TITLE
Transcriptomes of lineage-specific Drosophila neuroblasts profiled via genetic targeting and robotic sorting

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
A brain consists of numerous distinct neurons arising from a limited number of progenitors, called neuroblasts in Drosophila.  Each neuroblast makes a specific neuronal lineage.  To unravel the transcriptional networks that underlie the development of distinct neuroblast lineages, we marked and isolated lineage-specific neuroblasts for RNA sequencing.  We labeled particular neuroblasts throughout neurogenesis by activating a conditional neuroblast driver in specific lineages using various intersection strategies.  The targeted neuroblasts were efficiently recovered using a custom-built device for robotic single cell picking.  Transcriptome analysis on the mushroom body, antennal lobe, and type II neuroblasts besides non-selective neuroblasts, neurons, and glia revealed a rich repertoire of transcription factors expressed among neuroblasts in diverse patterns.  In addition to those likely pan-neuroblast transcription factors, there exist many transcription factors selectively enriched or repressed in certain neuroblasts.  The unique combinations of transcription factors present in different neuroblasts may govern the diverse lineage-specific neuron fates
