TITLE
Methylome analysis reveals alterations in DNA methylation in the regulatory regions of left ventricle development genes in human dilated cardiomyopathy (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression have been implicated in the development of human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In this study, we analyzed DNA methylomes (Infinium 450K HumanMethylation BeadChip) and transcriptomes (Infinium HT-12 v4) to characterize differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the left and right ventricles of human DCM.

DESIGN
Illumina 450K array and HT-12 v4 array for the left, right ventricles

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
