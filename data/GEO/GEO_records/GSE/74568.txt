TITLE
The long noncoding RNA ASNR suppresses Bcl-2 mRNA degradation in apoptosis through affecting nuclei-cytoplasmic transportation of AUF1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Many long noncoding transcripts are involved in cancer progression. Here, we utilized high-throughput microarray to compare the transcriptome alterations between the Lnc_ASNR knockdown or control in RKO cell lines. Two independent siRNAs were designed against the Lnc_ASNR cDNA sequence. Thus, we identified 111 genes which were expressionally changed. Moreover, GSEA analysis suggested apoptosis related pathway were markedly associated with Lnc_ASNR-reuglated genes. The present study indicated that Lnc_ASNR regulated specific genes in cancer progression.

DESIGN
RKO cells with Lnc_ASNR knockdown and control. Three biological replicates of each condition were analyzed on Agilent microarray.
