TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of differential genetic expression under CosR-knockdown condition compared with wild-type

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
We perfomed the transcriptomic analysis of differential genetic expression in the CosR-knockdown condition with a DNA microarray. CosR-specific antisense-PNA was used for CosR-knockdown. The results revealed that CosR significantly affected the expression of several genes involved in various cellular function in Campylobacter. Final goal of this study is to figure out the importance and the role of CosR in Campylobacter by identification of the CosR regulons.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, WT vs. CosR-knockdown. Biological replicates: 3 wild type (control) replicates, 3 CosR-knockdown replicates.  For preparing the total RNA, C. jejuni cells were grown at 42°C in MH broth supplemented with 1.5 μM CosR-PNA for CosR knockdown to the mid-exponential phase for approximately 8 hr with shaking.
