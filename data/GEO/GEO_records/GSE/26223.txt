TITLE
Genomic Library Enrichment for n-Butanol tolerance in E. coli. Samples vs Reference

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Genomic Library Enrichment to determine the n-Butanol Tolerant related genes in E. coli.  The samples involves a series of batch transfers to increasing concentrations of n-butanol and controls (always grew in absence of the solvent)

DESIGN
Two technical replicas.  Samples 1, 3, 5, and 7 are the serial transfers (samples 15, 13, 11, and 9 are their respective replicas).  Samples 2, 4, 6 and 8 are the controls grown in absence of n-butanol (samples 16, 14, 12 and 10 are their respective replicas)

PLATFORM
GPL8984 Biodesign Inst. at ASU Escherichia coli Agilent-020097 array
