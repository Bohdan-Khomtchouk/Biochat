TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed microRNAs from a male sterile Ponkan mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco) and its fertile wild type by small RNA and degradome sequencing

ORGANISM
Citrus reticulata

SUMMARY
High-throughput small RNA and degradome sequencing were performed to identify a large number of miRNAs and their targets. Differential expression of several miRNAs reveals that miRNA regulatory network was closely linked to gametophyte development and male sterility in Ponkan mandarin. The expression profiles of miR156 and miR167 as well as their targets demonstrated their contribution in male sterility in the Ponkan seedless type. This study provides valuable information for better understanding of miRNAs network in plant anther development and lays a foundation to future research on male sterility in citrus and even other species.

DESIGN
small RNA and degradome sequencing of seedy ‘Egan No.1’ and its male sterile and seedless mutant ‘Qianyang seedless’

PLATFORM
GPL18076 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Citrus reticulata)
