TITLE
Chromatin remodeling enzyme Brg1 is required for mouse lens fiber cell terminal differentiation and their denucleation [eyeball tissue]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide approach to identify the cell-autonomous role of Brg1 in lens fiber cell terminal differentiation. Differential gene expression was analyzed in Brg1 lens-conditional knockout and wildtype newborn mouse eyeballs, with subsequent comparison of  this data  with the dnBrg1 mouse lenses expression data. Keywords: Differential gene expression

DESIGN
Three biological replicate experiments were performed.
