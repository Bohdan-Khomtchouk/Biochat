TITLE
Environmental Enrichment Induces Pericyte and IgA-Dependent Wound Repair and Lifespan Extension in a Colon Tumor Model (RNAseq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Environmental enrichment (EE) replicates mind-body therapy by providing complex housing to laboratory animals to improve their activity levels, behavior and social interactions. Using a Tcf4Het/+ ApcMin/+-mediated model of colon tumorigenesis, we found that EE vastly improved the survival of tumor-bearing animals, with differential effect on tumor load in male compared to female animals. Analysis of Tcf4Het/+ ApcMin/+ males showed drastically reduced expression of circulating inflammatory cytokines and induced nuclear hormone receptor signaling, both of which are common in the wound repair process. Interestingly, EE provoked tumor wound repair resolution through revascularization, plasma cell recruitment and IgA secretion, replacement of glandular tumor structures with pericytes in a process reminiscent of scarring, and normalization of microbiota. These EE-dependent changes likely underlie the profound improvement in survival of colon-tumor-bearing Tcf4Het/+ ApcMin/+ males. Our studies highlight the exciting promise of EE in the design of future therapeutic strategies for colon cancer patients.
