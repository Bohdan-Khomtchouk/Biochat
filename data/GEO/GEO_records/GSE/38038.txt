TITLE
Profiling Chung rat model for neuropathic pain

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This program addresses the gene signature associated with DRG in the Chung rat model for neuropathic pain.

DESIGN
The Chung neuropathic pain profiling data was analyzed by identifying genes that were up- and down-regulated at selected p value and fold change in DRG of the Sprague Dawley rats following spinal nerve ligation compared to the sham-operated controls.
