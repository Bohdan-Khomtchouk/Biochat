TITLE
PACAP dependency of genes regulated in adrenal gland

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of PACAP knock out on the transcriptosome profile of adrenal gland. A 35,546-clone mouse cDNA microarray was used to investigate transcriptional changes Keywords: transcript identification design
