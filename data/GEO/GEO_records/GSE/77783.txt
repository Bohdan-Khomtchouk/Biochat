TITLE
Converting self-renewal in naïve pluripotency to naïve endoderm [I]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A novel strategy to generate bipotent primitive endoderm cultures from murine embryonic stem cells in vitro.

DESIGN
ESCs (ESC) were differentiated for 7-8 days in the presence of Activin/CHIRON/LIF (Diff). Differentiated cultures were passaged as nEnd, and several different passages are analysed here- passage 7-10 are defined as mid-passage (Mid), passage 14-15 are defined as late passage (Late). XEN cells were included as controls. In the case of nEnd cultures, each replicate is from a different experimental set of differentiatiations and passages. In all cases except for XEN, the double reporter line HRHnG was used.
