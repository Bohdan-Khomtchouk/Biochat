TITLE
Affymetrix gene expression of Transitional Type-1 B-cells from Wild-type (CBA), Xid and Btk KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Splenic Transitional Type-1 B-cells from CBA wild-type mice, X-linked immunodeficiency mice and Bruton's tyrosine kinase knock-out mice. Two replicates where run on Affymetrix 420 2.0 arrays for CBA wild-type,  Xid samples and the Btk KO samples. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase important for B-lymphocyte maturation. Mutations in Btk give rise to the primary immunodeficiency disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in man and X-linked immunodeficiency (Xid) in mice. Recent studies have subdivided the mouse immature, or transitional, B-cells into two distinct subsets according to their respective surface markers. Transitional type 1 (T1) and transitional type 2 (T2) cells are also located in distinct anatomic locations. Based on a limited number of markers it has previously been reported that the earliest phenotypic sign of Btk deficiency is manifested at the T2 stage in mice. Here, we report on distinct genome-wide transcriptomic signature differences found in T1 B-lymphocytes from Btk-defective compared to normal mice and demonstrate that Btk deficiency is visible already at this stage.

DESIGN
2 replicates of T1 B-cells from CBA (WT), Xid samples and the Btk KO samples
