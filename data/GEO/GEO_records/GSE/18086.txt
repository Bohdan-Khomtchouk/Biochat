TITLE
Focused DNA microarray to differentiate Clostridium botulinum type A strains

ORGANISM
Clostridium botulinum A str. ATCC 3502

SUMMARY
Strains were differentiated on the basis of hybridization to probes representing strain variable regions in C. botulinum strain ATCC 3502. Probes for selected genes (eg. toxin genes) were also featured on the microarray to allow detection of other serotypes/subtypes.
