TITLE
Focused DNA microarray to differentiate Clostridium botulinum type A strains

ORGANISM
Clostridium botulinum ; Clostridium botulinum A str. ATCC 3502

SUMMARY
Strains were differentiated on the basis of hybridization to probes representing strain variable regions in C. botulinum strain ATCC 3502. Probes for selected genes (eg. toxin genes) were also featured on the microarray to allow detection of other serotypes/subtypes.

DESIGN
27 strains were evaluated for selected gene detection and/or strain differentiation. DNA from strain ATCC 3502 was used as a control as the featured probes were based on the ATCC 3502 genome sequence.
