TITLE
Expression data from Ly6G+ and Ly6G- dendritic cells (DC)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the functional properties of Ly6G+ DC,  we employed GeneChip analysis to compare the gene expression profiles between Ly6G+ DC and Ly6C- DC.

DESIGN
Crude bone marrow (BM) cells prepared from C57BL/6 mice were cultured in the presence of GM-CSF. On day 6, CD11c+/MHC II+/Ly6G+ cells and CD11c+/MHC II+/Ly6G- cells were simultaneously sorted from the same cultures by FACSAria. Total RNA were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
