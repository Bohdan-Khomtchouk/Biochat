TITLE
MicroRNA expression profile in TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant H460 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated H460 cells with acquired TRAIL resistance by exposing the parental  sentisitve cells to subtoxic concentrations of TRAIL for 6 months. Then we compared the microRNA expression profile in the sensitive versus  resistant cells.

DESIGN
H460 cells were treated with subtoxic concentrations of TRAIL for 6 month. After confirmation of the resistance, the RNA was extracted and the microRNA expression profile was analyzed using the NanoString technology.
