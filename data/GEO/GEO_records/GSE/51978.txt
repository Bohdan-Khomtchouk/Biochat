TITLE
Gene expression profiling in neuroblastoma cells upon CHAF1A silencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used an inducible ShRNA system and microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying neuroblastoma differentiation upon CHAF1A silencing . CHAF1A is a subunit of the Chromatin Assembly Factor-1 (CAF1) and regulates H3K9-trimethylation. High expression of CHAF1A strongly correlates with neuroblastoma poor prognosis and  loss-of-function drives neuronal differentiation in vitro and in vivo.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated using RNAeasy kit from IMR32 cells transduced with inducible CHAF1A ShRNA. Gene expression profiling was performed in neuroblastoma cells upon CHAF1A silencing over time course (0, 5, and 10 days) in triplicate.
