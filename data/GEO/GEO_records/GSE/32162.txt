TITLE
RIPSEQ DNMT1 HL60

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of the all RNA species associated with DNMT1. Using a comparative genome-scale approach we identified and correlated the RNA species physically associated with DNMT1 and proximal to the annotated genes to the methylation status of the corresponding loci and expression levels of the respective genes. This comparative approach delineated the first -DNMT1 centered- 'epitranscriptome' map, a comprehensive map cross-referencing DNMT1-interacting transcripts to (i) DNA methylation and (ii) gene expression profile.

DESIGN
Relationship between DNMT1-RNA interactions, DNA methylation and gene expression
