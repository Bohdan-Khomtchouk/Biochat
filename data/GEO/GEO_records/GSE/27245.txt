TITLE
Expression data from Top2β KO cells as well ICRF-193 treatment of in vitro derived neurons and cortical glutamatergic neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of from Top2β knokout and ICRF-193 treated neurons reveals a significant number of genes that are transcriptionally deregulated

DESIGN
Gene expression in the Top2β knocnout ES, NP and TN stages of stem cell differention to the corresponidng wild type cells. In vitro derived neurons and cortical glutamatergic neurons were either treated with DMSO or ICRF-193 and were compared to reveal differentially expressed genes.
