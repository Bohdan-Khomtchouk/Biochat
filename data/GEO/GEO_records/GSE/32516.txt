TITLE
Comparison of the global gene expression profiles between wild-type and lsg1 null strains

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
To determine the range of genes whose expression is regulated by CTDK-I under nitrogen starvation, comparison of gene expression profiles between a wild-type strain and a deletion mutant of lsg1, which encodes the gamma subunit of CTDK-I.

DESIGN
Cells of the wild-type (JY450) and lsg1Î” (JT659) fission yeast strains were grown to the mid-log phase in liquid MM and shifted to nitrogen-free MM-N. The cells were harvested 2.5 h after this shift. RNA was prepared from each sample and analyzed on a DNA microarray covering 4,997 genes.
