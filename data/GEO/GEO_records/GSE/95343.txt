TITLE
mRNAseq of Huntington's disease and control patient iPSC-derived neural cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study are to compare the transcriptomic profile (mRNA-seq) of HD  and control patient iPSC-derived neural cells to identify alterations in gene expression Methods:  RNA were isolated from HD and control iPSC-derived neural cells. mRNAseq using Illumina Truseq mRNA PolyA+ v2 lib prep and Hiseq 2000. Statistical difference in mRNA levels were calculated with subsequent GO and pathway analysis Results: mRNAseq and statistical analysis revealed 1869 differentially expressed genes between HD and control iPSC-derived neural cells. Conclusions: Our study shows 1869 differentially expressed genes between HD and control iPSC-derived neural cells, and reveals gene networks that relevant to the mechanism of HD pathogenesis.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of HD and control iPSC-derived neural cells were generated by mRNAseq, in duplicate, using Illumina Truseq mRNA PolyA+ v2 and Illumina Hiseq 2000.
