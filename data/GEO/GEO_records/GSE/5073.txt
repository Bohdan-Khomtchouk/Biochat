TITLE
Effect of Trimethyltin on PC12 cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12  cells were cultured in complete DMEM till 80% confluence, then placed at 5000 cells per squared cm. Cells were then plated in 24-well plates for cell viability assay and in T75 flasks for RNA isolation. Medium was replaced with serum-free fresh medium for 12 hours prior to TMT treatment. Gene expression patterns were then analysed using Rat Expression Array 230A Keywords: dose response, affymetrix chip

DESIGN
In this study we analize gene expression patterns in PC12 cells treated with Trimethyltin (TMT). We utilized control cells (untreated) and two different concentration (1 and 5 uM) We used three biological replicates, for the three concentration tested, according to MIAME guidelines (total 9 chips were used in this study).
