TITLE
ADAM9 Up-regulates N-Cadherin via MiR-218 Suppression in Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Brain metastasis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in lung cancer. CDH2 (N-cadherin, a mesenchymal marker in epithelial-mesenchymal transition) and ADAM9 (a member of type I transmembrane proteins) have been reported relating to lung cancer brain metastasis, however, it is still not clear whether any interaction between them to mediate lung cancer brain metastasis. Since microRNAs were discovered to regulate many biological functions and disease processes (e.g., cancer) by down-regulating their target genes, microRNA microarrays were used to identify ADAM9 regulated miRNAs that target CDH2 in aggressive lung cancer cells. Luciferase assays and immunoblotting proved that CDH2 was a target gene of miR-218. The expression of miR-218 was generated from pri-mir-218-1, located in SLIT2, in low invasive lung adenocarcinoma while it was inhibited in aggressive lung adenocarcinoma. Down-regulation of ADAM9 could up-regulate SLIT2 and miR-218, thus down-regulate CDH2 expression. This study elucidated the mechanism of ADAM9 activating CDH2 may be due to release the inhibition of miR-218 on CDH2 in lung adenocarcinoma.

DESIGN
For each of the cell lines bm#2, bm#7, and F4, one microarray was analyzed.
