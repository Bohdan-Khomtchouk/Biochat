TITLE
Expression data from developing mouse livers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Roles of mesothelial cells (MCs) are poorly understood during liver development and injury. We identified podoplanin (Pdpn) as a cell surface markers for mesothelial cells in E12.5 mouse developing liver. To identify genes uniquely expressed in MCs, we isolated MCs from E12.5 mouse livers by FACS using anti-Pdpn antibodies and performed microarray analysis.

DESIGN
The E12.5 liver was digested with trypsin-EDTA and incubated with antibodies against Pdpn.  MCs were isolated as Pdpn+ population by FACS. Total RNA was extracted with RNAqueous Micro (Ambion) and the probes for the microarray were synthesized using the Ovation RNA amplification system V2 and FL-Ovation cDNA Biotin module V2 (Nugen). The labeled probes were hybridized with GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix) and signals were analyzed with Genomic Suite software (Partek).
