TITLE
Gene expression signatures following nerve injury in a rat model (0d-14d)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to distinguish the gene expression differences among different time points after injury.

DESIGN
We generated L4-6 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) tissues and proximal sciatic nerve (SN) tissues (0.5cm) at 0d, 1d, 4d, 7d and 14d after sciatic nerve resection.
