TITLE
Comparision of gene expression profiles between female germline stem cells and spermatogonia stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used the microarray analysis to compare the globe gene expression profiles of female germ line stem cells (FGSCs) and spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs).

DESIGN
The study is the first attempt to compare morphological and molecular characters (including comparing the globe gene expression profiles of FGSCs and SSCs)between FGSCs and SSCs. FGSCs and SSCs were isolated from ovaries of 3 days old mice and testes of 6 days old mice, respectively.
