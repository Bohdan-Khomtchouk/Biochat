TITLE
Role of Fibroblast Growth Factor-5 on the Proliferation of Human Tonsil-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Filtering differentially expressed gene probes between samples (A1-4, B1-4, T1-4) - Fold change, LPR test    A:Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells, B: bone marrow-derived MSC, T: palatine tonsil-derived MSC) Hierarchical clustering (Eudlidean method, complete Linkage), venn-diagrm

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 12 MSCs (4 T-MSCs, 4 A-MSCs, 4 BM-MSCs) to compared the gene expression level ( T-MSC vs A-MSC, T-MSC vs BM-MSC)
