TITLE
The androgen receptor induces a distinct transcriptional program in castration resistant prostate cancer in man

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The androgen receptor (AR) is the major transcriptional driver of prostate cell growth in man. For the first time, we define AR targets in prostate cancer (PC) tissue representing progression from treatment-naive to castrate-resistant disease (CRPC). We employed chromatin immunoprecipitation with high through-put sequencing (ChIP-seq) in human tissue, with cell-line and xenograft studies. We uncovered an AR transcriptional network not observed in cultured cells, with significant over-representation of MYC, E2F and STAT binding sites, progenitor cell gene signatures and targets which regulate metabolism, cell cycle and steroid biosynthesis. We identified AR targets unique to CRPC tissue, with a subset over-expressed in CRPC and predictive of clinical outcome, highlighting persistence of AR signalling. Our data support a model whereby endocrine and paracrine signals converge on the AR in PC tissue to drive oncogenic transcriptional programs, highlighting the critical role of cellular context in the regulation of target selection and gene expression.
