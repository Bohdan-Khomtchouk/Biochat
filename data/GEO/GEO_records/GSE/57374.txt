TITLE
Genome-wide RNA-seq analysis during carbon catabolite repression in Trichoderma reesei reveals a multilevel control of cellulase production and action

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
The ascomycete Trichoderma reesei is one of the most well studied cellulolytic fungi and widely used in the biotechnology industry, as in the production of second-generation bioethanol. Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) mechanism adopted by T. reesei is mediated by the transcription factor CRE1 and consists in the repression of genes related to the production of cellulase when a readily available carbon source is present in the medium. Using RNA sequencing this study aims to contribute to understanding of CCR during growth in cellulose and glucose, by comparing the mutant strain of T. reesei Δcre1 with its parental, QM9414.

DESIGN
T. reesei (QM9414 and Δcre1) was grown in Mandels-Andreotti medium, supplemented with 1% of cellulose or 2% of glucose. The cultures were incubated on an orbital shaker (200 rpm) at 28°C for 24, 48 and 72 hours using cellulose as carbon source and for 24 and 48 hours with glucose as the carbon source. All experiments were performed in three biological replicates. The resultant mycelia were collected by filtration, frozen and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. After growth, total RNA was isolated from the mycelia using TRIzol® reagent. RNA-seq experiments were performed by LGC Genomics GmbH (Berlin/Germany) using the platform Illumina/HiSeq2000. The samples from the parental strain QM9114 were previously submitted in GSE53629.
