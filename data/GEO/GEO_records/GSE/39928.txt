TITLE
Murine livers post DEN treatment: c-Jun f/f vs. c-Jun Dli [35MM]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver carcinogenesis induced by DEN closely mimics the pathologies observed during human liver tumor initiation and progression. DEN treatment triggered c-Jun expression lasting up to at least 1 week in mouse livers as measured by Western blots and immunohistochemical staining. DEN-induced liver tumorigenesis was also dramatically reduced in Alfp-cre+/c-jun f/f mice, in which c-Jun is constitutively deleted in hepatocytes around birth. These data unambiguously demonstrate that c-Jun is specifically required during liver cancer initiation. We searched for cell death effectors downstream of c-Jun operating in cancer initiation. Expression profiling revealed that several cell death-associated genes were deregulated by comparing Alfp-cre+/c-junf/f and Alfp-cre-/c-jun f/f livers. Mouse livers were collected before and 48hours after diethylnitrosamine treament (100mg/kg body weight). Whole genome expression profiles were analyzed using total RNAs extracted from the whole liver samples.

DESIGN
By comparison of the gene expression profiles of these samples, genes with significantly altered expression levels will be selected and further characterized for their roles in DEN-induce liver cell death in tumor initiation.
