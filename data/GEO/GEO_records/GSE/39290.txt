TITLE
Effects of maternal choline intake on placental gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the influence of maternal choline intake on placental gene expression, we employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes that were differentially expressed in placental tissues obtained from  women consuming two different doses (480 vs. 930 mg/d) of choline throughout the third trimester of pregnancy. Healthy third trimester (gestational week 26-29) pregnant women were randomized to a 12-week choline controlled feeding study. The participants consumed either 480 (n=6) or 930 (n=6) mg choline/d. Full thickness placental samples were collected at delivery to extract RNA and perform the arrays.
