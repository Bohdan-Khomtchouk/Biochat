TITLE
In vitro transcriptional profiling of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in lactose, galactose and human milk oligosaccharides

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

SUMMARY
Investigation of the overall in vitro response of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to human milk oligosaccharides. Comparison with response to MM-lactose and MM-galactose (Analysis performed using as a baseline datasets GSM301635 and GSM301637 corresponding to Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron response in MM-Glucose)

DESIGN
In vitro transcriptional profiles of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron obtained from biological duplicate cultures taken: (i) at middle log phase in minimal media galactose (MM-Gal) and minimal media lactose (MM-L) and (ii) at two timepoints during log phase in minimal media human milk oligosaccharides (MM-HMO).
