TITLE
Diurnal gene expression in rosette leaves of the phosphoglucomutase mutant (Col-0)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
How do transcript levels of leaf-expressed genes change in a normal day-night cycle of the phosphoglucomutase (pgm) mutant? The interest is in genes that are regulated by the circadian clock and the diurnal component (i.e. light, metabolite changes). Plants were grown on soil in a 12/12 h light/dark rhythm at 20Â°C day and night. 5 weeks after germination the rosettes of the non-flowering plants were harvested, 15 plants per sample. Plants were harvested in series at 6 times every 4 hours, beginning with the end of the night (still in darkness). Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
A diurnal time series (8 times) was analyzed.
