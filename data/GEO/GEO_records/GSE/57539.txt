TITLE
lncRNA and mRNA expression of cytokine treated MDA-MB-231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with PBS, LPS, IL1b, TNFa, IL6, and TGFb respectively and expression profile were assayed by Arraystar human lncRNA array 2.0

DESIGN
We designed this experiment to screen for lncRNAs whose expressions are responsive to inflammatory stimuli.

PLATFORM
GPL15314 Arraystar Human LncRNA microarray V2.0 (Agilent_033010 Probe Name version)
