TITLE
Physical mapping of genes in somatic cell radiation hybrids by comparative genomic hybridization to cDNA microarrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Somatic cell mutants can be informative in the analysis of a wide variety of cellular processes. The use of map- based positional cloning strategies in somatic cell hybrids to analyze genes responsible for recessive mutant phenotypes is often tedious, however, and remains a major obstacle in somatic cell genetics. To fulfill the need for more efficient gene mapping in somatic cell mutants, we have developed a new DNA microarray comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) method that can rapidly and efficiently map the physical location of genes complementing somatic cell mutants to a small candidate genomic region. Here we report experiments that establish the validity and efficacy of the methodology. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set

DESIGN
Using regression correlation
