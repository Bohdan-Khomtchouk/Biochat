TITLE
The Effect of Translocation-Induced Nuclear Re-organization on Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the effect of balanced chromosomal rearrangements on gene expression, we compared the transcriptomes of cell lines from control and t(11;22)(q23;q11) individuals. This translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 is the only recurrent constitutional non-Robertsonian translocation in humans. The number of differentially expressed transcripts between the translocated and control cohort is significantly higher than that observed between control samples alone, suggesting that balanced rearrangements have a greater effect on gene expression than normal variation. Altered expression is not limited to genes close to the translocation breakpoint suggesting that a long-range effect is operating. Indeed we show that the nuclear position of the derivative chromosome is altered compared to the normal chromosomes. Our results are consistent with recent studies that indicate a functional role for nuclear position in regulating the expression of some genes in mammalian cells. They may also have implications on reproductive separation, as we show that reciprocal translocations not only provide partial isolation for speciation but also significant changes in transcriptional regulation through alteration of nuclear chromosomes territories.
