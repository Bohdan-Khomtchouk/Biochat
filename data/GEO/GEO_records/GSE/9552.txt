TITLE
Alterations in gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster embryo exposed 500µGy gamma rays at 22.4mGy/h

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To determine what genes are affect to the reduction in mutation frequency by 500µGy gamma irradiation of Drosophila melanogaster. The  strain is w[1118] (a loss of function mutant of compound eye pigment gene white with Canton-S background). Keywords: time course
