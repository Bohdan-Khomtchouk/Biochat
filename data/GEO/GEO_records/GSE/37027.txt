TITLE
Cell type-specific gene expression profiling of Drosophila neurons [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of nuclei isolated from genetically defined neuronal subpopulations of the adult Drosophila brain.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were generated from nuclei isolated from all neurons (R57C10-GAL4), Kenyon cells (OK107-GAL4), and octopaminergic (Tdc2-GAL4) neurons in the adult Drosophila head using a method similar to INTACT (Deal and Henikoff, 2010; Steinner et al., 2012). Sequencing was performed with an Illumina HiSeq 2000.
