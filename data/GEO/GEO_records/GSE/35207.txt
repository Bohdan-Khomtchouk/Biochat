TITLE
Expression analysis of Epstein-Barr virusâ€“transformed human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) between male and female.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of human X-linked imprinted gene. Comparing pooled RNA of lymphoblastoid cell lines from normal human male and female, identify the genes expressed with sex spesific manner.

DESIGN
Expression array study with total RNA extracted from pooled male and female LCLs with eight 60-mer probe per gene. 47633 exemplar genes representing a total of 63780 transcripts/variants.

PLATFORM
GPL15143 NimbleGen Human Expression Array [2006-08-03_HG18_60mer_expr]
