TITLE
Yeast X-Chromosome Associated Protein 5 (Xap5) Functions with H2A.Z to Suppress Aberrant Transcripts [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Functional characterization of the Xap5 protein using epistatic genetic interaction analysis (E-MAP), RNA-seq and ChIP-chip along with other growth experiments.

DESIGN
wild type and mutant cells were grown at 37C in EMM50 and RNA was extracted from exponentially growing cells. Strand specific libraries were constructed with random primers. Ribo zero was used to remove r-RNA. For ChIP-chip Agilent 60mer array was used to analyze DNA recovered by chromatin immunoprecipitation of Xap5 from fission yeast culture.
