TITLE
Expression Data from E. faecalis V583 under exposure to 10ug/ml vancomycin

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis V583

SUMMARY
The vancomycin resistant strain V583 was exposed to therapeutical dose of vancomycin in order to understand the cell response to the antibiotic besides the induction of the vanB genes

DESIGN
E. faecalis V583 cells were collected at 10 minutes and 30 min after vancomycin addition and without vancomycin, for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The cells were collected when at 0.4. For each condition were made replicates.
