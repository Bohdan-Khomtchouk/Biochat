TITLE
Deep sequencing analysis of the murine transcriptome response to different virulent parenthood B. melitensis infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we employed the Illumina Genome Analyzer platform to perform a Digital Gene Expression (DGE) analysis of the peritoneal macrophages genome-wide transcriptome response to B.melitensis infection. Common changes in gene expression were observed among Brucella app. infected macrophages suggesting similar strategies were employed for their survival and replication, inducing anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic. A total of 1019 differentially expressed (DE) transcripts were identified in the macrophages 4 hours after differ virluent B.melitensis infection, especially genes participated lysosome pathway and MAPK pathway. Our findings demonstrate previously unrecognized changes in gene transcription that are associated with B.melitensis infection in the macrophages, and many significant pathways (cascades) identified in the study clearly merit further investigation. Our data provide new clues to understand the molecular attenuation mechanism of M5-90 and a firm foundation for reducing vaccine residual virulence, enhancing vaccine efficacy.
