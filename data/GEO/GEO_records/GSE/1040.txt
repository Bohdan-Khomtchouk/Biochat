TITLE
Halobacterium NRC-1 UV repair

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
This project was conducted by Nitin S. Baliga of the Halobacterium group at the Institute for Systems Biology in collaboration with Jocelyne Diruggiero of University of Maryland.  Halobacterium NRC-1 cell pellets were resuspended in an isotonic buffer at a low density, placed on ice and exposed to 200J/m2 of UV-C irradiation, returned to the growth medium and allowed to recover at 42oC in dark (D) or light (L).  Total RNA was collected from each sample at 30 minutes (D30 and L30) and 60 minutes (L60 and D60). The control (C) was processed in a manner to identical to L60 except that it did not suffer any UV-C insult. The reference RNA was prepared from an aliquot of the same culture just prior to UV-C irradiation.  Therefore the reference was also exposed to initial perturbations prior to UV-C irradiation such as change of growth medium to buffer and change of temperature from 42oC to ice.
