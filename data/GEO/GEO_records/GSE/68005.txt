TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles between FRA1 knockdown and vector control Bel-7402 cells by RNA-sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment is to search for the transcriptional target of FRA1.

DESIGN
We subjected FRA1 knockdown and vector control Bel-7402 cells to RNA-sequencing, and analyzed the genes that were shown to be differentially expressed between the two groups.
