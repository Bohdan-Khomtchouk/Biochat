TITLE
Inter-ethnic differences in lymphocyte  sensitivity to glucocorticoids reflect variation in transcriptional response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glucocorticoids (GCs) are steroid hormones widely  used as pharmaceutical interventions, which act mainly by regulating gene expression levels. A large fraction of patients (~30%), especially those of African descent, show a weak response to treatment. To interrogate the contribution of variable transcriptional response to inter-ethnic differences, we measured  in vitro lymphocyte GC sensitivity (LGS) and transcriptome-wide response to GCs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from African-American and European-American healthy donors. We found that transcriptional response after 8hrs treatment was significantly correlated with variation in LGS within and  between populations. We found that NFKB1, a gene previously found to predict LGS within populations, was more strongly downregulated in European-Americans on average.  NFKB1 could not completely explain population differences, however, and we found an additional 177 genes with population differences in the average log2 fold change (FDR < 0.05), most of which also showed a weaker transcriptional response in AfricanAmericans. These results suggest that inter-ethnic  differences in GC sensitivity reflect variation in transcriptional response at many genes, including regulators with large effects (e.g.  NFKB1) and numerous other genes with smaller effects.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from paired aliquots of peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with dexamethasone or vehicle (EtOH) for 8 and 24 hours.
