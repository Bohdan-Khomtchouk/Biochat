TITLE
A gene expression signature of PDGF-stimulated fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated fibroblasts. Results provide insight into novel pro-tumorigenic factors induced by PDGF-activation of fibroblasts.

DESIGN
1.2 x 10e6 BJ-hTERT fibroblasts were cultured in 10cm dish with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco Life Technologies, Gergy-Pontoise, France) containing 1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 ng/ml) at 37ÂºC in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere during 24h. Cultures were stimulated with or without 20ng/mL PDGF-BB (Peprotech, New Jersey, USA) for another 24h prior to harvest. Unstimulated fibroblasts were used as control samples. Cultures of both unstimulated and stimulated fibroblasts were done in triplicate.
