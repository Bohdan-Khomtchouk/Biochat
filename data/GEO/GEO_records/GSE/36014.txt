TITLE
Global changes in gene expression in primary keratinocytes after KLF9 overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify putative target genes of the transcription factor Klf9 in primary keratinocytes we over-expressed Klf9 in these cells using a lentiviral delivery system. We detected several hundred genes that show differential expression levels following ectopic Klf9 expression including several genes that are involved in proliferation and cell cycle control. These results allow insights into the mechanisms by which Klf9 regulates proliferation in primary keratinocytes.

DESIGN
Primary human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes were infected with equal viral titers of a GFP and KLF9 expression construct, respectively. Cells were harvested 2,4 and 7 days after infection and total RNA was used to perform whole genome microarray analysis.
