Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This series represents the data set of Array CGH from the paper (submit for publication): “Homozygous deletions localize novel tumor suppressor genes in B-cell lymphomas. Mestre et all. ” and it's web supplement. The molecular nature of many secondary events in the pathogenesis of B-cell non Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) remains unknown. We used high-resolution CGH to BAC microarrays to characterize the genomes of 48 B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) cell lines of different origins. Array CGH identified, on average, 20 genomic alterations per cell line, including regional gains and losses as well as previously uncharacterized aberrations.  Different genomic patterns were observed among the B-NHL subtypes. To search for possible oncogenic target genes, gene expression profiling was performed in the cell lines models. Integrative genomic and gene expression analyses have identified amplified oncogenes in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), but the capability of such technologies to localize tumor suppressor genes within homozygous deletions remains unexplored. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and gene expression microarray analysis of 48 cell lines derived from patients with different B-NHLs delineated twenty homozygous deletions at seven chromosome areas, all of which contained tumor suppressor gene targets. Further investigation revealed that only a fraction of primary biopsies presented inactivation of these genes by point mutation or intragenic deletion, but instead some of them were frequently silenced by epigenetic mechanisms. Our microarray strategy has identified novel candidate suppressors inactivated by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that substantially vary among the B-NHL subtypes.
