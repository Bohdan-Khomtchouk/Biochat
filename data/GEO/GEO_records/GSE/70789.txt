TITLE
Identification of genes characteristic of Zfp423-expressing perivascular cells in mouse epididymal adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Committed perivascular preadipocytes were genetically labelled in transgenic mice expressing GFP under the control of the locus (BAC) for Zfp423, a gene controlling preadipocyte determination.  The overall goal was to identify genes differentially expressed between perivascular (PDGFRbeta+) GFP+ cells and perivascualar (PDGFRbeta+) GFP-  cells from mouse epididymal adipose tissue.

DESIGN
Adipose stromal vascular fraction from epididymal fat of 5 week-old male Zfp423-GFP mice was labeled with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies recognizing PDGFRbeta, CD31, and CD45.  Pdgfrbeta+; CD45/CD31- (herein Lin-) cells were then separated on the basis of GFP expression. GFP+ and GFP- from the PDGFRbeta+ Lin- perivascular population were collected by FACS into separate tubes. Triplicate biological samples were collected for RNA extraction and  Illumina analysis.
