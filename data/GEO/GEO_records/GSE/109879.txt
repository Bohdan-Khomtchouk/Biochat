TITLE
High-throughput sequencing  identify miRNAs involved in exosomes of MDA-MB-231 cocultivated with or without mature 3T3-L1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify miRNAs involved in exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cultivated with mature 3T3-L1, small RNA libraries from exosomes stored at 20 Â°C for 0 and 24 h were constructed. A total of 432 small RNA sequences were generated, and 88 known and 1224 new candidate miRNAs were obtained. Among them, 85 miRNAs were up-regulated and 300 were down-regulated in exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cultivated with mature 3T3-L1.

DESIGN
exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cultivated with mature 3T3-L1

PLATFORM
GPL15520 Illumina MiSeq (Homo sapiens)
