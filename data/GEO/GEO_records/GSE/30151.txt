TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of the OsDIS1 overexpression plants under normal and drought stress conditions

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To identify genes involved in the OsDIS1-mediated drought-responsive pathway, we performed microarray analysis of the OsDIS1 overexpression and wild-type plants under both normal and drought stress conditions using the Agilent rice Genechip. Seven-day-old plants of the OsDIS1 overexpression line 9-4-2 as well as the wild-type plants were used in the drought treatment. OsLEA3 was used as a positive control for the drought treatment. Genes with more than two-fold changes in the overexpression plants compared with the wild-type plants were selected. The expression pattern of some differentially expressed genes was further confirmed by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
The OsDIS1 overexpression 9-4-2 plants and the wild-type plants were cultured on 1/2 MS medium plus 3% sucrose for seven days. About half of the plants were sampled as the untreated control for RNA isolation, and the rest were transferred with 1/2 MS medium onto filter papers to induce drought stress. When the leaves of the OsDIS1 overexpression plants began to show drought stress phenotypes, we collected leaves for RNA isolation. OsLEA3 was used as a positive control for the drought treatment.
