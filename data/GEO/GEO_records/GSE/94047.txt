TITLE
Differences of miRNA expression associated with ΔNp63β overexpressing OSCC cell line SQUU-B

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent reports have revealed that EMT is involved in cancer invasion and progression including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Previously, we have also studied on the association of p63 gene, a homolog of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, with EMT in OSCC cells. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that down-regulation of ΔNp63 accompanied with EMT and that re-expression of ΔNp63β by stable cDNA transfection in OSCC cell lines reverted the EMT phenotype.  However, the detail mechanisms of ΔNp63β-mediated EMT remain to be unclear. Recent studies have shown that several microRNAs (miRNAs) are also involved in EMT process of human cancer by targeting EMT-related transcription factors. We thus sought to identify responsible miRNA associated with ΔNp63β-mediated EMT using miRNA microarray analyses.

DESIGN
As samples for miRNA microarray, we used two clones established from an OSCC cell line SQUU-B, which lacks ΔNp63 expression and displays EMT phenotypes.  One is SQUU-BO cell overexpressing ΔNp63β, and another is SQUU-BC cell transfected with empty vector. In addition, SQUU-B EL cells with low expression of E-cadherin were also  used to identify the miRNA associated with E-cadherin expression strongly.
