TITLE
Peroxidasin is essential for eye development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mutations in Peroxidasin (PXDN) cause severe inherited eye disorders in humans, such as congenital cataract, corneal opacity, and developmental glaucoma. The role of peroxidasin during eye development is poorly understood. Here we describe the first Pxdn mouse mutant which was induced by ENU (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea) and led to a recessive phenotype. Sequence analysis of cDNA revealed a T3816A mutation resulting in a premature stop codon (Cys1272X) in the peroxidase domain. This mutation causes severe anterior segment dysgenesis and microphthalmia resembling the manifestations in patients with PXDN mutations. The proliferation and differentiation of the lens is disrupted in association with aberrant expression of transcription factor genes (Pax6 and Foxe3) in mutant eyes. Additionally, Pxdn is involved in the consolidation of the basement membrane and lens epithelium adhesion in the ocular lens. Lens material including Î³-crystallin is extruded into the anterior and posterior chamber due to local loss of structural integrity of the lens capsule as a secondary damage to the anterior segment development leading to congenital ocular inflammation. Moreover, Pxdn mutants exhibited an early-onset glaucoma and progressive retinal dysgenesis. Transcriptome profiling revealed that peroxidasin affects the transcription of developmental and eye diseases-related genes at early eye development. These findings suggest that peroxidasin is necessary for cell proliferation and differentiation and for basement membrane consolidation during eye development. Our studies provide pathogenic mechanisms of PXDN mutation-induced congenital eye diseases.
