TITLE
Creation of Drosophila cell lines by overexpression of Ras

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
RasV12 was used to drive the generation of cell lines from primary cultures.  Lines have been passaged for over a year, indicating that they are true lines. Keywords: genetic modification, cell type comparison

DESIGN
RasV12 drove the creation of cell lines from primary culture.  The array datasets were created from passage 11 cells and compared to datasets of established cell lines, as well as embryonic, imaginal disc and whole-fly sets.

PLATFORM
GPL72 [DrosGenome1] Affymetrix Drosophila Genome Array
