TITLE
Gene expression of paired samples of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and hepatocyte cell culture (HCC) treated with conditioned media of HSC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
All living cells rely on the communication with other cells to ensure their function and survival. Molecular signals are sent among cells of the same cell type and from cells of one cell type to another. In cancer, not only the cancer cells themselves are responsible for the malignancy, but also stromal (non-cancerous) cells and the molecular signals they send to cancer cells are important factors that determine the severity and outcome of the disease. Therefore, the identification of stromal signals and their influence on cancer cells is important when looking for novel treatment strategies. We have generated gene expression profiles of both stromal (HSC), and liver cancer (HCC) cells treated with HSC conditioned medium to elucidate cell communication from HSC to HCC cells.

DESIGN
15 HSC samples, 15 HCC samples treated with conditioned medium of the HSC samples, 4 control hep samples without treatment
