TITLE
Transcriptional response to drug-induced oligomerization of the AIM2-like receptors IFI16, PYHIN1, and MNDA.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We explored ALR function in a ligand-independent manner using a drug-inducible dimerization system in which ALRs were tagged with two FV domains that rapidly oligomerize upon addition of the drug AP1 We found that oligomerization of IFI16, PYHIN1, or MNDA did not result in any significant gene expression changes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from BFP, IFI16-2xFV, PYHIN1-2xFV, or MNDA-2xFV-expressing THP1 cells mock-treated or treated with 30nM AP1 dimerizer drug for 4 or 12 hours.
