TITLE
Sorted Bulk and KK10-specific CD8+ T cells from HLA-B*2705 HIV chronic progressors before and after KK10 peptide stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD8+ T cells from HLA-B*2705 HIV+ chronic progressors Hi and Lo samples are CD8+ T cells bound by an HLA-B*2705 tetramer specific for the Gag p24 peptide KK10

DESIGN
PBMCs were incubated in the presence and absence of KK10 peptide for 6 days, and CD8+ and KK10-specific CD8+ T cell were sorted by flow cytometry

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
