TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression in response to mating pheromones in S. pombe

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Fission yeast cells undergo sexual differentiation in response to nitrogen starvation. In this process haploid M and P cells first mate to form diploid zygotes, which subsequently enter meiosis and sporulate. Prior to mating, M cells secrete M-factor and P-cells secrete P-factor, and these diffusible mating pheromone can activate a signal transduction pathway in the opposite cell type. The pheromone response orchestrates mating and is also required for entry into meiosis. Here we use DNA microarrays to identify genes that are induced by M-factor in P cells and by P-factor in M-cells. The use of a cyr1 genetic background allowed us to study pheromone stimulation independently of nitrogen starvation. We identified a total of 163 genes that were consistently induced more than two-fold by pheromone stimulation. As expected, there was a substantial overlap between the genes induced by M- and P-factor. Surprisingly, we found that pheromone control extended to genes fulfilling their function well beyond the point of entry into meiosis, including numerous genes required for meiotic recombination. A direct comparison of the M- and P-factor induced expression pattern allowed us to identify cell-type specific transcripts, including three new M-specific genes and one new P-specific gene. Finally, our results support the notion that Ste11 is the key transcription factor activated by pheromone signalling. Keywords: dose response
