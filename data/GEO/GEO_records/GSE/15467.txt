TITLE
Transcriptional response of Drosophila cells to FHV RNA1 replicon expression (replicon experiment)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Virus infections induce cellular gene up and down regulation, and these changes often provide clues to cellular pathways utilized by viruses. We used microarrays to examine the transcriptional responses of cultured Drosophila S2 cells to Flock House virus (FHV) replicon induction.

DESIGN
Cultured S2 cells stably transfected with either a control replicon (pS2F1fs) or an FHV RNA1 replicon (pS2F1) were induced with 1 mM copper and we measured global transcript levels at 18 h after induction using Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 microarray chips.
