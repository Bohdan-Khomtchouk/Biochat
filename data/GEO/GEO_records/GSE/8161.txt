TITLE
Drought stress in 7 Solanaceae species, replicate 1 and 2

ORGANISM
Capsicum annuum ; Solanum lycopersicum ; Nicotiana tabacum ; Nicotiana benthamiana ; Petunia x hybrida ; Solanum melongena ; Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Seven different Solanaceae species, Potato (Solanum tubersosum), Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), Eggplant (Solanum melongena), Pepper (Capsicum annuum), Tobacco (Nicotiana tabaccum), Petunia and Nicotiana benthiamana were subjected to drought stress. Drought stress was applied by stopping watering of the plants, control plants were normally watered with nutrient solution. Samples were collected at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 days after the first application of the drought stress. RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy. Keywords: Direct comparison

DESIGN
