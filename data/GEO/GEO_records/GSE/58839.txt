TITLE
Expression data from murine eGFP+ relfl/flCg1-Cre and eGFP-Cg1-Cre splenic germinal center B cells purified by fluorescent activated cell sorting.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of murine eGFP+ relfl/flCg1-Cre and eGFP− Cg1-Cre splenic germinal center B cells identifies genes regulated by the transcription factor c-REL in germinal center B cells.

DESIGN
Germinal center B cells from 12-week old relfl/flCg1-Cre and Cg1-Cre littermate mice immunized with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were isolated at day 7 after immunization by flow cytometric sorting from splenic mononuclear cells. RNA was isolated. Following a cDNA amplification step, labeled cRNA was hybridized to microarrays and genes specifically expressed in eGFP+ relfl/flCg1-Cre and eGFP− Cg1-Cre samples were identified by supervised analysis.
