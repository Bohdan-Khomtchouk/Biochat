TITLE
Long-term maintenance time-course of cardiomyocytes differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells and comparison to human heart

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of culture-induced changes in cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) over a time-period of 8 weeks, and comparison of these samples to human atrial and ventricular tissue

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from differentiated in-vitro samples at the indicated time-points and of human heart in-vivo tissue
