TITLE
The sexually antagonistic genes of Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Differences in the selective pressures experienced by males and females are believed to be ubiquitous in dioecious organisms and are expected to result in the evolution of sexually antagonistic alleles, thereby driving the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Negative genetic correlation for fitness between the sexes has been documented, however, the identity, number and location of loci causing this relationship are unknown. Here we show that a large proportion of Drosophila melanogaster transcripts are associated with the interaction between genomic haplotype and gender and that at least 8% of loci in the fly genome are currently evolving under sexually antagonistic selection.

DESIGN
We measured gene expression of adult males and females of Drosophila melanogaster from 15 hemiclone lines, showing either high-male/low-female fitness, high-female/lowmale fitness or average fitness in both sexes. Data from four replicates for each sex/line are presented, giving a total of 120 arrays.
