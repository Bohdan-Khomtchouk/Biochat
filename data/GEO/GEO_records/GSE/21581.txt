TITLE
Expression data from lung adenocarcinoma mouse tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify altered signal transduction pathways involved in the progression and metastases of Lkb1 deficient lung  tumors, we have performed an unbiased microarray analysis of primary and metastatic mouse lung tumors We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying metastatic progression
