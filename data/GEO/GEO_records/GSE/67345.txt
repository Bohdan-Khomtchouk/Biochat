TITLE
Identification of Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus E2 protein regulated genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analyses of RNA from C33a cells after induction of CRPV E2 expression by doxycycline

DESIGN
C33a cells were established that carry the doxycycline-inducible pRTS-CRPV E2 vector. We analyzed 3 biological replicates (induced/uninduced) using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
