TITLE
Expression data from rice lamina joint development

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Identification of factors regulating leaf inclination reveal a complex regulatory network of lamina joint development, however, the dynamic transcriptional programming of it remain to be elucidated. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression profiles at different developmental stages of lamina joint and identified distinct classes of differentially expressed genes during this process, characterized the regulating factors of rice lamina joint development.

DESIGN
Four developmental stages (stage 2, 4, 5, 6) of lamina joints of last leaf, last second leaf and last third leaf were selected. 0.5cm adjacent part of lamina joint of the last third leaf was harvested as leaf control at stage 4. Totally thirteen samples were collected and each sample has two biological replicates.
