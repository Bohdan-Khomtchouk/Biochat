TITLE
Malva sylvestris anti-inflammatory activity in oral human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of human epithelial cells The activity of Malva sylvestris extract and fractions infected by A. actinomycetemcomitans were investigated using an adapted dual chamber model, oral human epithelial cells were used in the co-culture model. One microgram of RNA was converted in cDNA using RT2 First Strand Kit. 84 genes were analyzed using inflammatory response & Autoimmunity Array RT2 profiler (Qiagen Sabiosciences, Valencia, CA, USA) with buffers supplied by the manufacturer

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. Oral human epithelial cells were infected by A. Actinomycetemcomintans and treated with Malva sylvestris extract and fractions prior to gene expression analysis.
