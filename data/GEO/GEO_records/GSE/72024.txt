TITLE
Cre-ERT mediated antiviral induction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this work, we aimed at studying the impact of microRNAs on     antiviral responses, using inducible deletion of one or two copies of     Dicer1 (in Dicer-floxed x EsrCRE+ MEFs). Unexpectedly, we discovered     that Cre-ERT activation by hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) alone, independent of     Dicer1 deletion, had a strong impact on antiviral responses. These     microarrays were performed on SV40 immortalized Dicer1 fl/fl EsrCRE+     MEFs, Dicer1 fl/wt EsrCRE+ MEFs, 96 h after initial OHT treatment, and     SV40 immortalized Dicer1 wt/wt EsrCRE+ MEFs, Dicer1 wt/wt EsrCRE-neg     MEFs (Wild Type MEFs), 48 h after initial OHT treatment. These analyses     revealed the strong induction of several antiviral genes (Rsad2,     Cxcl10...), following Cre-ERT activation.

DESIGN
SV40 immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts from various genotypes were stimulated 24h with 500nM hydroxytamoxifen, and further expanded for 24 or 72h. Each sample was analyzed on Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray Each sample is in simplicate - no biological replicates; sample 1-4 were processed/analyzed on a different microarray slide to 5-8 (different day/operator)
