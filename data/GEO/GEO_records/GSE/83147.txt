TITLE
RNA expression profiles in fibroblast-like synoviocytes from rheumatoid arthritis patients and  trauma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LncRNA and mRNA microarrays were performed to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in fibroblast-like synoviocytes from rheumatoid arthritis patients compared with fibroblast-like synoviocytes from trauma patients.

DESIGN
Fibroblast-like synoviocytes were isolated from synovial tissues. LncRNA and mRNA microarrays were performed using fibroblast-like synoviocytes at passage 3.
