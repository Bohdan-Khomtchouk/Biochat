TITLE
Expression data from 3 week old Rat liver (F1)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Developmental Origins of Health and Disease Hypothesis (DOHaD) all emphasized that maternal nutrition plays an important role on the growth and development of offspring. More and more attention has been paid on the effect of maternal high fat diet and overnutrition during pregnancy on the susceptibility of offspring metabolic diseases. So we aim to build the rat model of maternal high fat diet which may induce steatohepatitis and change of lipid metabolism in the early life of offspring, and explore their possible mechannisms.And then to investigate the influence of maternal high fat diet on the expression of hepatic metabolic genes in the early life of offspring. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying fatty acid liver and identified distinc distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Rat liver were selected at 3 week of age for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.We sought to obtain the results we need so we chose the timing of 3 week old (at weaning) offspring in order to emphasize on the possible biochemical mechanisms of maternal effect.
