TITLE
Expression data comparing TMNK-1 to HMEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are an endothelial subtype specific to the liver with unique functions when compared to other endothelial subtypes.  We have demonstrated that supernatants from an immortalized LSEC line (TMNK-1) control HCV viral replication in vitro.  Supernatants from a human microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC) did not control viral replication suggesting this anti-viral effect is unique to LSECs. We used microarray to analyze the transcriptional differences between these cell lines to further shed light on their differential effects on HCV replication in vitro

DESIGN
TMNK-1 cells or HMEC were cultured for 48h without stimulation; total RNA was then harvest to determine transcriptional differences.
