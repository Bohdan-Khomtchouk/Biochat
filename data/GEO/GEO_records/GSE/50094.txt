TITLE
Gene expression profiling of injured skeletal muscle in the presence or absence of CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A comparative analysis of gene expression of injured skeletal muscle from wild-type (Foxp3-DTR-) and Treg-depleted (Foxp3-DTR+) mice showed that Treg cells are critical for effective repair and regeneration of acute injury of skeletal muscle.

DESIGN
Foxp3-DTR+ and Foxp3-DTR- mice were injured with cardiotoxin in TA muscle at day 0 and treated with diphtheria toxin every other day from day 0 until dissection on day 4 or 8. TA muscle was flash-frozen and RNA was extracted using Trizol. RNA from whole tissue samples was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
