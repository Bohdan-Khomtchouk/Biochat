TITLE
Integrin alpha6-beta4 control the expression of genes associated with cell motility, invasion and metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to determine the gene expression changes mediated by the alpha6beta4 integrin using MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cell line under normal culturing conditions (10% FCS in DMEM). Keywords: Transfection (stable)

DESIGN
Comparison of clones of MDA-MB-435 cells transfected with the integrin beta4 subunit (which results in cell surface expression of the integrin apha6beta4 integrin; clones 3A7 and 5B3) to those transfected with vector (mock; 6D2 and 6D7) only.
