TITLE
Gene expression from bronchial epithelial cell samples of current and never smokers.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA expression was assayed from bronchial epithelial cells collected via bronchoscopy from healthy current and never smoker volunteers in order to determine relationships between microRNA and mRNA expression in bronchial epithelial cell samples across current and never smokers and within the same individual. Keywords: Global mRNA expression profiling

DESIGN
Bronchial epithelial cells were collected from current and never smokers via bronchoscopy. High molecular weight RNA ( > 200 nucleotides) was isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST microarrays to obtain mRNA expression from the airway epithelial cells of current and never smokers, which could be correlated to microRNA expression from the same samples.
