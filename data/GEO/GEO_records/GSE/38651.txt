TITLE
Dnmt3a protects active chromosome domains against cancer-associated hypomethylation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The results of the study uncover conserved features of cancer methylomes and provide a mechanistic explanation for the tumor-promoting effects of Dnmt3a mutations.

DESIGN
Whole genome methylation analysis of Mus musculus. Five samples were analyzed, one control sample containing normal healthy lung tissue, two samples containing big (WTB) or small (WTS) Dnmt3a WT tumors, two samples containing big (KOB) or small (KOS) Dnmt3a knock-out tumors

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
