TITLE
An H5N1 virus-encoded atypical microRNA is a major contributor to cytokine storm and mortality

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An H5N1 virus-encoded microRNA directly targets mammalian poly(rC) binding protein 2 and is a major contributor to H5N1-associated ‘cytokine storm’ and mortality.

DESIGN
Small RNA profiles of A549 cells infected with H5N1 influenza A virus infected were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina Genome Analyzer.

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
