TITLE
X-radiation (XR) resistant HCT116-Clone2: XR at 0 and 4 Gy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
cDNA microarray study of X-radiation (XR) resistant HCT116-Clone2 cells without XR, 10 minutes, 6 hours, or 24 hours after XR at 4Gy versus unirradiated HCT116-Clone10 cells. HCT116-Clone10 cells have similar XR response with parental HCT116 cells. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
