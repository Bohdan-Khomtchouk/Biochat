TITLE
Over-expression of hsa-miR-221 in JSC1 cells and identification of miRNA targets expressed in a panel of B-cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
1) To identify changes in gene expression upon over-expression of hsa-miR-221 in JSC1 cells. 2) To identify human miRNA targets expressed in a panel of B-cell lines. Gammaherpesvirus and host cell microRNAs (miRNAs) together modulate gene expression in normal and malignant cells. Using microRNA microarrays, we determined the expression of mature viral and host cellular miRNAs in a series of B cell tumours that include Kaposi’s Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infected Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infected Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL) cell lines. We show that 35 host miRNAs were constitutively expressed in all the B cell lymphomas and differences in viral miRNA expression were evident between herpesvirus positive tumour types. Furthermore, we show that in PEL, miR-221 and miR-222 expression is defective due to a lack of transcript expression rather than mutation in the miRNA encoding loci. Absence of miR-221 and miR-222 resulted in the enhanced expression of the known target gene p27 (CDKN1B) and reintroduction of miR221 in PEL reduces p27 protein expression.
