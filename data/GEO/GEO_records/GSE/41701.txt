TITLE
Epigenomic alterations in localized and advanced prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we used Illumina NGS for high-throughput profiling of the DNA methylome in seven human benign prostate tissues, seven human primary prostate cancer and six human castration resistant prostate cancer patient samples. These data were used to profile the CpG cytosine methylation pattern at single base resolution in each sample and to determine differentially methylated cytosines and regions among samples.

DESIGN
Enhanced Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (ERRBS, MspI,150â€“400 bp size fractions) of 20 human prostate tissues (benign prostate tissues, localized and metastatic prostate cancer)
