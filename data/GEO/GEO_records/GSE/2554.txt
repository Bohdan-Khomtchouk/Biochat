SUMMARY
Activation of murine CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes leads to dramatic remodeling of N-linked glycans. Na√Øve and activated CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells and B cells were compared for their N-linked glycan structures by MALDI-TOF MS profiling and for expression of glycan transferase genes to assess the biosynthetic basis for any change observed.  The major change observed in activated CD4 and CD8 T cells was dramatic reduction of sialylated bi-antennary N-glycans carrying the terminal NeuGc?2-6Gal sequence, and corresponding increase in glycans carrying the Gal?1-3Gal sequence.  This change was accounted for by a decrease in the expression of the sialyltransferase ST6Gal, and increase in the expression of the galactosyltransferase ?1-3GalT.  Conversely, in B cells no change in terminal sialylation of N-linked glycans was evident, and the expression of the same two glycosyltransferases were increased and decreased, respectively.
