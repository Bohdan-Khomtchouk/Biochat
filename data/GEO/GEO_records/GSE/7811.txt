TITLE
Developmental analysis of Aedes aegypti gene expression

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
This analysis defines the adult female and developmental specific transcriptomes of Aedes aegypti. Keywords: Aedews aegypti, development, gene expression

DESIGN
Here we compare gene expression between the adult female and a pool of an equal amount of RNA from each developmental stage (embryo, larvae, pupae).
