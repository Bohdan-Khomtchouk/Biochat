TITLE
Gene expression profiles of HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells treated with HDAC inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate gene expression. Inhibition of class I HDACs has been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth. Largazole, a new potent HDAC inhibitor, shows strong antitumor activity, presumably by modulating transcription of cancer relevant genes. We used microarray analysis of human HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell line to determine the gene expression profile after largazole treatment in comparison with other HDAC inhibitors (FK228 and SAHA). The goal was to identify regulated genes that can be linked to the antiproliferative effects of these HDAC inhibitors in HCT116 cells.

DESIGN
To characterize the genes regulated by Largazole, SAHA and FK228, genome-wide gene expression analysis was carried out. Human HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells (400,000) were seeded per well (6-well dish) and one day later treated with Largazole, SAHA, FK228 and vehicle control. 10 h later, total RNA was extracted and processed for hybridization to an Affymetrix Human Genome U133 2.0 GeneChip. Global alterations in transcript levels upon Largazole, SAHA and FK228 treatment were determined through comparison with data derived from cells treated with vehicle control. The experiment was carried out in duplicate.
