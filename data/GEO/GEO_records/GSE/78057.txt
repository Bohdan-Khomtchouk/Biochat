TITLE
Expression data from IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation in miR-146a-/- and C57BL6J mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miR-146a acts as a negative feedback regulator of inflammation. To investigate the role of miR-146a  in psoriasis  psoriasiform skin inflammation was indeuced in Mir-146a-/- and  wild type mice (C57BL6J) by topical applciation of imiquimod (IMQ)-cream (Aldara). Gene expression profiling (Affymetrix) was used to identify transcriptomic changes associated with psoriasis-like skin inflammation in wild type vs. miR-146a -/-mice.

DESIGN
A daily topical dose of 31.25 mg of Aldara cream (5% IMQ) was applied on the right ear of miR-146a -/- and C57BL/6 mice on three consecutive days to induce psorisis-like skin inflammation. Mice were sacrificed at day 4. Ear flaps were collected for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymatrix GeneTitan plate format Gene ST 2.1 (mouse).
