TITLE
Expression profiling of murine DCIS and invasive ductal breast carcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine healthy tissue samples, DCIS and invasive mammary tumors were analyzed in order to identify marker genes which show enhanced expresssion in DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas. Using this approach, we were able to identify a set of genes which might allow a better detection of DCIS and invasive carcinomas in the future.

DESIGN
Samples consists of: 5 wild type breast tissue samples 5 healthy breast tissue sapmles of WAP-TNP8 mice 5 samples of mice one month, 5 samples of mice two month, 5 samples of mice three month, 5 samples of mice four month, and 5 samples of mice five month after activation of the SV40 oncogene 5 invasive tumors
