TITLE
Similarities and differences between human activated macrophages II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compare, in human macrophages, stimuli considered to induce M1 or M2 type of activation, also termed classical and alternative activation. This dataset highlights key differences between the M1 and M2 stimuli pointing to the need of a revision of the paradigm. Macrophages were left untreated or stimulated with IL-4 and IL-13 (prototypic M1 stimuli), Dexamethasone (Glucocorticoid receptor agonist) which has been hitherto considered M2, IL-10 which also falls under the M2 umbrella, and LPS and Interferon Gamma considered M1 stimuli.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from autologous serum monocyte-derived macrophages exposed to: SAMPLE 1	Untreated SAMPLE 2	Dexamethasone 100nM SAMPLE 3	LPS 10 ng/ml SAMPLE 4	IL-10 20 ng/ml SAMPLE 5	IL-13 20 ng/ml SAMPLE 6	IL-4 20 ng/ml SAMPLE 7	IFNy 20 ng/ml
