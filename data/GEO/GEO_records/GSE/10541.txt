TITLE
Polycomb CBX7 represses expression of tumor suppressor genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Polycomb CBX7 was stably expressed in embryonal carcinoma cells in order to identify target genes.  The study was specifically geared toward unveiling gene targets that are susceptible to DNA hypermethylation in adult cancer.  A number of CBX7 target tumor suppressor genes were thereby identified and used in further studies to characterize the mechanism surrounding CBX7 mediated gene suppression. Keywords: CBX7 target gene identification

DESIGN
A cDNA encoding the ORF of polycomb CBX7 under the control of EF1alpha promoter was transfected into the Tera-2 embryonal carcinoma cell line.  Empty vector was used to transfect control cells.  The cells were subject to stable selection using puromycin and a pooled population of CBX7 overexpressing cells was established.  Gene expression analysis was performed by comparing the gene expression profile of CBX7 cells to empty vector control cells.
