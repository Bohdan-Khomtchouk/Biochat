TITLE
Activating c-KIT mutations confers oncogenic cooperativity and rescue RUNX1-ETO induced DNA-damage in human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
REtr causes genomic instability in U937 cells. Activated forms of c-KIT, like c-KIT(N822K), rescues the Retr induced genomic instability by increasing the rate of DNA repair by homologous recombination

DESIGN
Human U937 cells were transduced with retroviral vectors encoding REtr or c-KIT(N822K), expanded in culture and FACS selected prior to molecular analysis
