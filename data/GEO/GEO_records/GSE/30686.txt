TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Kc cells from Drosophila melanogaster during ecdysone treatment and CP190 knockdown

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This study examines the changes in genes expression that occur in Drosophila melanogaster during the ecdysone response as well as during RNAi knockdown of the insulator protein, CP190.  Analysis was performed in Kc cells after 0, 3, and 48 hours of ecdysone treatment in the presence of either control or CP190 knockdown.

DESIGN
Six conditions were analyzed, and each condition was performed for 2 biological replicates making a total of 12 chips.  Each chip measures the expression level of 16,637 genes from D.melanogaster with eight, 60-mer probes per gene.
