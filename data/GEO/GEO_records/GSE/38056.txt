Novel long non-coding RNAs are involved in cellular response to angiotensin II signaling

SUMMARY
Angiotensin II (AngII) is a polypeptide hormone that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of blood pressure. In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), AngII signaling results in hypertrophy, proliferation, contraction, and migration, which ultimately promote atherosclerosis and hypertensive cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have shown that fundamental biological processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation are mediated in part by the activities of long non-protein-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). In this study, we sought to identify lncRNAs that are involved in the response to AngII-signaling. Genome-wide analysis of de novo assembled transcripts from rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) identified novel lncRNA as well as protein-coding transcripts which have not been previously annotated. The majority of the genomic loci from which these novel transcripts are transcribed are enriched for histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation and histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation, two chromatin modifications that are closely associated with actively transcribed regions, further supporting these as bona fide transcripts. Compared with previously annotated rat transcripts, these novel lncRNA transcripts, on average, are shorter in length and are less abundant, consistent with reports from mice and humans. Expression analyses of transcripts from control and AngII-stimulated VSMCs reveal that AngII signaling affects the abundance of both protein-coding transcripts as well as lncRNAs transcripts. Altogether, these data provide new insights into the global effects of AngII signaling and reveal potential novel therapeutic targets for treatment of AngII-associated cardiovascular diseases.
