TITLE
Transgenerational gene expression down the male line in pig

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We investigated the nutritional effects on gene expression in a three generation Large White pig feeding experiment. A group of experimental (E) F0 boars were fed a standard diet supplemented with high amounts of methylating micronutrients whereas a control (C) group of F0 boars received a standard diet. These differentially fed F0 boars sired F1 boars which then sired 60 F2 pigs. Gene expression profiles showed significant twofold differences in mRNA level between 8 C F2 offspring and 8 E F2 offspring for 79, 64 and 53 probes for muscle, liver and kidney RNA, respectively. We found that in liver and muscle respective pathways of lipid metabolism and metabolic pathway were over-represented for the differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
Gene expression in three tissue types of F2 offspring from differentially fed F0 boars were measured. F0 boars received either a standard diet or a standard diet supplemented with methylating micronutrients. These boars produced the F1 males that received exclusively the standard diet. The F2 generation was then produced with these F1 boars. Gene expression was measured in liver, skeletal muscle and kidney of 8 F2 pigs derived from F0 boars that received the standard diet and of 8 F2 pigs derived from those F0 boars that received the standard diet supplemented with methylating micronutrients.
