TITLE
Arabidopsis cold regulated transcriptome, translatome and CSP1 RNA regulon

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptome, translatome, and CSP1 RNA regulon analysis of 25-d-o Arabidopsis rosettes exposed to 12h low temperature (4C) treatment.

DESIGN
38 samples, 3 genotypes (35S:HF-RPL18, 35S:AtCSP1-FH#11, and atcsp1-1), 2 conditions (non-stress and cold), 3 RNA pools (total, polysomal, and CSP1 associated mRNAs), 2-3 biological replicates
