TITLE
microRNA expression profiles in bone marrow fractions from gastric cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Both disseminated tumor cells and noncancerous host cells contributed to cancer progression cooperatively in bone marrow. Bone marrow samples were obtained from 4 gastric cancer patients, and were separated into 3 fractions (CD45 positive, CD45 negative/EpCAM positive, and CD14 positive fractions) by the automagnetic-activated cell separation (AutoMACS) system using CD45, EpCAM, and CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). microRNA expression profiles in each fractions were evaluated in order to identify candidate prognostic markers for gastric cancer patients.
