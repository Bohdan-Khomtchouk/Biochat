TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in cultured eutopic and ectopic endometrial stromal cells (expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiles were investigated in isolated endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) from eutopic and ectopic endometrium. The profiles were quite different between eutopic ESC and ectopic ESC, whereas no clear dfference was recognized between eutopic ESC with and without endometriosis.

DESIGN
Total RNA from three cultured endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) from eutopic endometria without endometriosis, three ESCs with endometriosis and three ESCs from chocolate cysts were hybridised to the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
