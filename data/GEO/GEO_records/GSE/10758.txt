TITLE
Gene expression variation increase in trisomy 21 tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Congenital development disorders with variable severity occur in trisomy 21. However, how these phenotypic abnormalities develop with variations remains elusive. We hypothesize that the difference in euploidy gene expression variation among trisomy 21 tissues are perturbed by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 and this may contribute to the phenotypic variations in Down syndrome. Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
We used DNA microarray to measure the differences in gene expression variance (representing variation) between four human trisomy 21 amniocytes and six human euploid amniocytes.
