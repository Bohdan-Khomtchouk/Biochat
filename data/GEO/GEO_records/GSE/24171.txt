TITLE
Prostate Cancer Field Effect

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, comparison of gene expression profiles in benign epithelia from men with prostate cancer to those of men without prostate cancer reveal differences in several genes associated with prostate cancer.

DESIGN
Custom Agilent 44K whole human genome expression oligonucleotide microarrays were used to profile benign epithelium from prostate needle biopsies from 15 men with high grade(Gleason 8-10) prostate cancer and 14 age- and BMI-matched controls. All samples were laser-capture microdissected and total RNA isolated and amplified prior to hybridization against a common reference pool of prostate tumor cell lines
