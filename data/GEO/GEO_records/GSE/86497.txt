TITLE
miR-93 Targets in Human Endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-93-5p controls endothelial glycolysis and proliferation

DESIGN
For identification of miR-93 targets and affected biological functions, HUVECs were transfected with miR-93-5p mimic and inhibitor and respective controls. In addition, mock transfection and non-treated cells were prepared as control samples. RNA-seq was performed in duplicate or triplicate.

PLATFORM
