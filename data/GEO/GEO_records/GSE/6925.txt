TITLE
BW25113 ymgB and W/T in LBglu 24h biofilm cells

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
For the microarray experiments, 10 g glass wool (Corning Glass Works, Corning, N.Y.) were used to form biofilms (30) in 250 mL in 1 L Erlenmeyer shake flasks which were inoculated with overnight cultures diluted that were 1:167.  The cells were shaken at 250 rpm and 37Â°C for 24 hours to form biofilms on the glass wool, and RNA was isolated from the suspension cells and the biofilm. Keywords: E. coli biofilm
