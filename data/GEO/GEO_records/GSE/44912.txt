TITLE
Effect of maternal treatment on gene expression differences in Bacillus thuringiensis infected pooled larvae

ORGANISM
Tribolium castaneum

SUMMARY
This study examines gene expression differences between infected larvae from different maternal infection backgrounds to try to understand the immunological basis of invertebrate immune priming. Female Tribolium castaneum beetles were either jabbed with sterile saline, heat killed Bt, or left naïve. 15 Offspring from the first and second broods were infected with Bt and 24 hours later pooled by treatment and flash frozen Beetles from saline and primed maternal backgrounds are compared to naïve infected

DESIGN
Pooled whole larvae, custom array for T. castaneum, 1 replicate per treatment comparison. Same naïve sample used for both arrays

PLATFORM
GPL16756 Agilent-030593 Tribolium castaneum array
