TITLE
The developmental life cycle of the enteric parasite Entamoeba invadens: transcriptome analysis reveals a crucial role for phospholipase D in stage conversion

ORGANISM
Entamoeba invadens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was performed on encysting and excysting E. invadens, a parasite of reptiles that is used as a model system to study stage conversion in Entamoeba species, including the human pathogen E. histolytica. The goal of the project was to identify changes to the transcriptome during development, in order to better understand the mechanisms of development.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from trophozoites, from encysting parasites (at 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours after transfer to encystation media) and from excysting parasites (2 and 8 hours after induction of excystation), converted to cDNA, and sequenced on a SOLiD platform. RNA-seq data was used to refine gene models, find potential unannotated genes, and identify genes that are developmentally regulated.

PLATFORM
