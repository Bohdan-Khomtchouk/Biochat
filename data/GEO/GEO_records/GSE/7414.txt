TITLE
Developmentally regulated piRNA clusters implicate MILI in transposon control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nearly half of the mammalian genome is composed of repeated sequences. In Drosophila, PIWI proteins exert control over transposons. However, mammalian PIWI proteins, Miwi and Mili, partner with piRNAs that are depleted of repeat sequences, raising questions about a role for mammalian PIWIs in transposon control. A search for murine small RNAs that might program PIWI proteins for transposon suppression revealed developmentally regulated piRNA loci, some of which resemble transposon master control loci of Drosophila. We also find evidence of an adaptive amplification loop in which PIWI catalyzes formation of piRNA 5â€™ ends. Mili mutants de-repress L1 and IAP and lose DNA methylation of L1 elements, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved role for PIWI proteins in transposon suppression. Keywords: small RNA profile, piRNA
