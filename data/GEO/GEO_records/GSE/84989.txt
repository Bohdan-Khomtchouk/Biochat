TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the transcriptional and alternative splicing landscape in intestinal organoids undergoing nutrient starvation or ER stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our study represents the first detailed analysis of the transcriptional and alternative splicing landscape of intestinal organoids undergoing stress, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. We report significant changes in the expression of genes involved in inflammation, proliferation and transcription, among others. Splicing events commonly regulated by both stresses affected genes regulating splicing and were associated with nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), suggesting that splicing is modulated by an auto-regulatory feedback loop during stress.

DESIGN
Murine intestinal organoids were stimulated in triplicate with conditions for either ER stress or nutrient starvation and RNA-seq was conducted to analyze global changes in both gene expression at the transcriptional level and alternative splicing
