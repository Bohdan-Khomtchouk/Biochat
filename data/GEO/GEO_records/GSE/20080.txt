TITLE
Epigenome analysis of normal and preinvasive cervical smear samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and preinvasive cervical smear samples infected with the human papilloma virus (HPV) The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in liquid based cytology (LBC) cervical smear samples. Samples included 19 normal smears without HPV, 11 normal smears with HPV infection, and 18 smears with HPV and exhibiting dysplasia. email: a.teschendorff@ucl.ac.uk Keywords: DNA methylation

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 48 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
