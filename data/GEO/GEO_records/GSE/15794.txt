TITLE
Gene expression profiles of E13 bladder neck/urethral compartments. (GUDMAP Series ID: 25)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing bladder.  The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of micro dissected tissues and FACS sorted cells plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing urogenital system. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. The data submitted here delineates the gene expression profiles of the mesenchymal and epithelial compartments of the E13 mouse bladder neck/urethral compartment.

DESIGN
FVB/N mice were time mated. At embryonic day 13 mice were euthanized by decapitation and the bladders were microdissected and cut just below the ureters. Since the EDTA dissociation was ineffective, the bladder neck and urethra were collected and treated with 1 mg/ml trypsin in Tyrode's solution for 20 minutes at 37°C. The layers were separated using a fine needle and rimming. The samples were placed in RLT and stored at -80°C. RNA was prepared and the Epicentre 2-round amplification scheme described under the Lessard Group Protocols on the GUDMAP pages were performed. The amplified RNA was examined with the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
