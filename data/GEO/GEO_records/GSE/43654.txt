TITLE
Dynamics of TRIM33 binding in macrophages and effects of TRIM33 deletion on chromatin state during activation of primary macrophages.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To get insight into TRIM33 functions, TRIM33 ChIP-seq was carried out in murine macrophage cell line (RAW) and in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). The results showed that, in addition to its role in hematopoietic differentiation, TRIM33 may modulate PU.1 transcriptional activity during macrophage development and/or activation.To characterize the role of TRIM33 in macrophages, we bred TRIM33fl/fl mice with Lyz-Cre mice where the Cre recombinase gene is under the regulatory sequences of the Lyz gene that is expressed only in mature myeloid cells. Bone marrow cells from  LyzCre/Trim33+/+ mice and LyzCre/Trim33flox/flox mice were differentiated in macrophages and treated during 0h, 4h, 12h and 24h with LPS. Using ChIP-seq, we provide a link between TRIM33 binding and H3K4me3 spreading on inflammatory genes in macrophages.

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitations of TRIM33 and H3K4Me3 followed by multiparallel sequencing performed in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM).
