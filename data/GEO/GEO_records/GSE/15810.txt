TITLE
The global responses of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to baculovirus transduction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are a promising cell source for regenerative medicine and can be genetically modified with viral vectors, yet how hMSCs respond to viral vector transduction remains poorly understood, leaving the safety concerns unaddressed. Hereby we explored the responses of hMSCs against an emerging DNA viral vector, baculovirus (BV), and uncovered that BV transduction perturbed the transcription of 816 known genes associated with several signaling pathways.

DESIGN
Both experimental group (e.g. BV-transduced hMSCs) and control group (e.g. mock-transduced hMSCs) have four replicates respectively.
