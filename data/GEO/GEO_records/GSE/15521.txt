TITLE
Genetic and immunohistochemical analysis in a case of pleuropulmonary blastoma with renal tumor and small bowel polyps

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The genetic cause for PPB in association with renal tumor and small bowel polyps remains to be identified. Activation of components of the mTOR signalling pathway in the disease lesions suggests that this signal transduction route may be involved in disease pathogenesis and that rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, might be effective in the treatment of PPB and associated lesions.
