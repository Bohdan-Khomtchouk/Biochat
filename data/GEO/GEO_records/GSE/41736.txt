TITLE
Murine HIV-gagP24 CD8 T cells: bone marrow vs Lymph node

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling to examine differences resulting from priming of virus-specific CD8 T cells in draining lymph node and in bone marrow, following intradermal injection of modified virus Ankara (MVA)-HIV gag. Transcriptional profiling of mouse pentamer H2kD-AMQMLKETI (HIV-gagP24) CD8 T cells from draining lymph nodes(LN) and bone marrow (BM ) 5 days following intradermal injection of MVA-HIV gag, and compared to naive (CD62L Hi CD44 int) CD8+ T cells from lymph node of naive mice (NTc).

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, BM, LN and NTc. Experimental replicates: 5 BM, 5 LN, 5 NTc, RNA pooled from 3 independant experiments of 5 mice each.

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
