TITLE
Gene expression C. elegans age-1 mutants with neuron- or intestine-restricted age-1 activity

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to identify transcripts regulated non-autonomously by age-1 activity in neurons or intestine.  Comparisons of gene expression were made between age-1(mg44) null adults and CY251 (age-1(mg44); bvIs2) and CY262 (age-1(mg44); bvIs1); all were relative to wildtype (N2).  The integrated transgenes, bvIs2 and bvIs1, carry the age-1 cDNA expressed from the neuronal ric-19 promoter (bvIs2) or intestinal ges-1 promoter (bvIs1). Transcripts upregulated in age-1(mg44) adults compared to wildtype ( > =1.5 fold; p < 0.05) or downregulated ( < 0.6 fold; p < 0.05) were considered to be age-1 target genes.  Rescue in CY251 or CY262 was determined by change in the transgenic background versus age-1(mg44) (all relative to N2 wildtype).  Non-autonomous rescue of a target gene was usually determined by transcript levels that were at least 50% rescued compared to wildtype.
