TITLE
Bcl11b maintains quiescent mammary repopulating units

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This gene expression microarray analysis is to test how induced Bcl11b expression affect the overall gene expression profile of Comma D Beta Cells in the progenitor (sca1+) and differentiated (Sca1-) population. Comma D beta Cell line was cultured DMEM F12+2% FBS+1% PSA+5ug/ml insulin+10ng/ml EGF in 175 cm2 culture flask overnight, followed by 100ng/ml Doxycycline treatment for 1 day. Then, cells were trypsinized and subjected for flow sorting of Sca1+ and Sca- population. RNA was then extracted and subjected to microarray gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
Sca1+ and Sca1- cells in the presence or absence of Doxycycline.
