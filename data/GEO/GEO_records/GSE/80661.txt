TITLE
Non-overlapping control of transcriptome by Promoter and Super-Enhancer-Associated Dependencies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The relationship between promoter proximal transcription factor-associated gene expression and super-enhancer-driven transcriptional programs are not well-defined. Some level of their distinct genomic occupancy may suggest a mechanism with specific target gene control. We explored the transcriptional and functional interrelationship between E2F transcription factors and BET transcriptional co-activators in multiple myeloma. Global chromatin analysis reveals distinct regulatory axes for E2F and BETs, with E2F predominantly localized to active gene promoters of growth/proliferation genes and BETs disproportionately at enhancer- regulated tissue specific genes. Depletion of E2F selectively down-regulates its regulatory axis and is generally synergistic with BET inhibition. In vivo, combined inhibition of BETs and E2F strongly reduces tumor growth, implicating E2F as a myeloma dependency that is potently leveraged with BET inhibition.
