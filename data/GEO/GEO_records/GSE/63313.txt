TITLE
transcriptome of Amycolatopsis mediterranei U32 in the Bennet medium with or without nitrate

ORGANISM
Amycolatopsis mediterranei U32

SUMMARY
We reported transcriptome profiles of rifamycin SV-produced strain Amycolatopsis mediterranei U32 in the Bennet medium with or without 80 mM nitrate in different cultivation stage. By comparative analysis of  genome-wide gene expression in these conditions, we found that the mechanism of high production of rifamycin SV induced by nitrate could be elucidated.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 time-course transcription in 2 different nitrogen source conditions

PLATFORM
GPL19434 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Amycolatopsis mediterranei U32)
