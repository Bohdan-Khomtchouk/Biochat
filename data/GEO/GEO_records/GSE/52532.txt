TITLE
Generation of Rdp1-independent primary siRNAs

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We tested whether we could increase the population of Rdp1-independent primary siRNAs in fission yeast by overexpressing the Dcr1 ribonuclease. We found that in addition to generation of centromeric siRNAs, which was expected, Dcr1 overexpression also resulted in generation of genome-wide primary siRNAs, mapping to many open reading frames.

DESIGN
