SUMMARY
Gene expression of adherent cells in a coculture of the human bone marrow stromal cell line HS-27a and peripheral blood monocytes (CD14+ cells) was compared to HS-27a cultured alone. Microarray  experiments were conducted using CD14+ cells from 7 healthy donors over a period of > 7 months. Monocytes were isolated by ficoll separation of whole blood, followed by labelling cells with CD14 monoclonal antibody Tuek4 and magnetic bead selection (Milteny rat anti mouse IgG2a+2b beads) on an AutoMacs. HS27a cells were plated in T75 flasks at approximately 80% confluence. The next day 1.5x10E6 freshly isloated human CD14+ cells were added to the culture. At 3 days the cultures were washed 3x with Hank’s buffer to remove nonadherent monocytes. Co-cultures and HS27a cultured alone were harvested by brief trypsinization followed by pelleting of the cells. All RNA isolation was accomplished with Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit reagents. The RNA (25 ug) was annealed with 5 ug oligo dT12-18, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase for 2h at 42ºC in the presence of 0.5mM dGTP, 0.5mM dCTP, 0.5mM dATP, 0.3mM dTTP, 0.2mM amino-allyl dUTP.  After hydrolysis of RNA in 0.2M NaOH, Tris was removed from the reaction with a Microcon-30 concentrator. The cDNA from HS27a and HS27a-monocyte cocultures was covalently coupled separately with Cy5 and Cy3 monoreactive fluors, respectively, in 50mM sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.0, followed by quenching with 2.7M hydroxylamine. The Cy5 and Cy3 labelled cDNAs were combined and purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit and suspended in 36 ul of 3X SSC and 0.8 mg/ml of poly-A for hybridization to the microarray. Fluorescent array images were collected for both Cy3 and Cy5 with a GenePix 4000A fluorescent scanner and image intensity data were extracted and analyzed with GenePix Pro 3.0 analysis software. After background correction and removal of flagged values, log base 2 expression ratios were mean centered and linear transformed to obtain the log and linear values given in the data tables.
