TITLE
cDNA array 2304 genes (OSPE) - HaCaT J10 3h - 0.5 & 2 Gy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human HaCaT keratinocytes were cultured to confluence (day10). Differentiated confluent cells were irradiated at 0.5 Gy or 2 Gy. RNA from irradiated cells was compared to RNA from non-irradiated reference cells in a dye swap hybridization procedure 3 h after irradiation. Keywords = Human keratinocytes, gamma irradiation Keywords: dose response
