TITLE
L1CAM overexpression in mouse lung endothelial cells (lECs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In an attempt to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the multiple roles of L1 in endothelium, we checked whether manipulating its expression affected the transcriptome of lECs. To this purpose, we compared the gene expression profiles of L1-overexpressing and control lECs by Affymetrix, which revealed a remarkable effect of L1 overexpression on lECs transcriptome.

DESIGN
Mouse lung-derived EC (lECs), kindly provided by E. Dejana (Milan, Italy), were stably transfected with a pcDNA3.1/Hygro(-) vector containing mouse LICAM full length or with and empty  pcDNA3.1/Hygro(-) vector as control. Three independent experimental replicates were performed.
