TITLE
MicroRNAs in a multicellular green alga Volvox carteri

ORGANISM
Volvox carteri

SUMMARY
We identified 174 miRNAs expressed in Volvox carteri. Some of Volvox miRNAs are highly enriched in gonidia or somatic cells. Subsequently, we predicted the targets of Volvox miRNAs and found many of target genes were regulated through mRNA degradation. Conservation analysis suggests the common origin of miRNA between Volvox and Chlamydomonas and high frequency of birth and death of Volvox miRNAs.
