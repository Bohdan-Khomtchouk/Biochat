TITLE
Cluster analysis reveals differential transcript profiles associated with resistance training-induced human skeletal muscle hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Overall, the widely disparate transcriptomes identified prior to RT among the three clusters support the notion that at least some of the inter-individual heterogeneity in propensity for RT-induced myofiber hypertrophy is likely pre-determined.

DESIGN
Baseline comparisons of skeletal muscle transcript profiles from 44 subjects previously clustered (K-means cluster analysis) as non-, modest-, and extreme-responders (Non, n=15; Mod, n=14; Xtr, n=15) based on the magnitudes of change in vastus lateralis myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) following 16-wk, 3-d/wk, high-intensity RT.
