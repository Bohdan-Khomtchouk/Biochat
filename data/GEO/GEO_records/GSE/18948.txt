TITLE
Personalized medicine in psoriasis: developing a genomic classifier to predict histological response to Alefacept

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alefacept treatment is highly effective in a select group patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, and is an ideal candidate to develop systems to predict who will respond to therapy. A clinical trial of 22 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis treated with alefacept (7.5mg weekly i.v. x12 weeks) was conducted in 2002-2003, as a mechanism of action study. Patients were classified as responders or non-responders to alefacept based on histological criteria. Microarray data from PBMCs of 16 of these patients was analyzed to generate a treatment response classifier. We used a discriminant analysis method that performs sample classification from gene expression data, via nearest shrunken centroid method''.  A disease response classifier using 23 genes was created to accurately predict response to alefacept (12.3% error rate in favour of responders). This preliminary study may provide a useful tool to predict response of psoriatic patients with alefacept. Keywords: class prediction

DESIGN
Microarray data from 16  patients was analyzed to generate a treatment response classifier. We used a discriminant analysis method that performs sample classification from gene expression data, via nearest shrunken centroid method.
