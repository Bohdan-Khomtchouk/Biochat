TITLE
Gene expression analysis of jmj30 jmj32 mutant grown at 29°C under long day conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of loss-of-function mutants of JUMONJI30 (JMJ30) and JMJ32 in Arabidopsis thaliana (Col). JMJ30 and JMJ32 encode the histone demethylases that contain the catalytic JmjC domain. The trimethylation of Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) plays a key role in gene repression and developmental regulation. It is actively and dynamically deposited and removed in plants. However, while the H3K27 methyltransferases had been extensively studied, findings on the H3K27 demethylase were few. Here, we show that JMJ30 and JMJ32 encode H3K27me3 demethylases, and genes down-regulated in jmj30 jmj32 mutant are enriched for H3K27me3 targets.

DESIGN
Columbia wild-type (Col WT) and jmj30 jmj32 mutant were grown at 29°C, and seedling samples were collected at 13 day-after-germination (DAG). Two independent sets of WT and jmj30 jmj32 seedling mRNA samples were used for this array.
