TITLE
Cell type-specific translation profiling reveals a novel strategy for treating fragile X syndrome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Excessive mRNA translation downstream of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu1/5) is a core pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome (FX), however the differentially translating mRNAs that contribute to altered neural function are not known. We used Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) and RNA-seq to identify mistranslating mRNAs in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the FX mouse model (Fmr1-/y) hippocampus, which exhibit exaggerated mGlu1/5-induced long-term synaptic depression (LTD). In these neurons, we find the Chrm4 transcript encoding muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (M4) is excessively translated, and synthesis of M4 downstream of mGlu5 activation is mimicked and occluded. Surprisingly, enhancement rather than inhibition of M4 activity normalizes core phenotypes in the Fmr1-/y, including excessive protein synthesis, exaggerated mGluR-LTD, and audiogenic seizures. These results suggest that not all excessively translated mRNAs in the Fmr1-/y brain are detrimental, and some may be candidates for enhancement to correct pathological changes in the FX brain.

DESIGN
6 biological replicates of total hippocampal mRNA (Input) from WT and Fmr1 KO littermate pairs and CA1-TRAP-IP (IP) from the same 6 WT and KO littermate pairs.
