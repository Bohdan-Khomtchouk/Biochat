TITLE
Identification of genes regulated by the RANK IVVY motif in macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of genes regulated by RANK RVVY motif in macrophages by gene expression analysis of TNFR1-/-R2-/- BMMs expressing a chimeric receptor consisting of the external domain of mouse TNFR1 linked to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of mouse RANK (WT) and NFR1-/-R2-/- BMMs expressing a chimeric receptor consisting of the external domain of mouse TNFR1 linked to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of mouse RANK bearing inactivating mutations in the IVVY motif (Mu).

DESIGN
two groups: mutant (mu) and wildtype (wt) three replicates: rep1, rep2, and rep3

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
