TITLE
Development of gene sets after deleting Rb and Pten in p53 null background primary prostate cells [Rb and Pten]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our findings suggested that cytokines were upregulated in p53 null primary prostate cells after deleting Rb and/or Pten. Rb and Pten deletion are important for prostate cancer progression.

DESIGN
p53-/- Rbf/f vs p53-/- Rb∆f/∆f primary prostate cells. Three independent experiments were performed.  p53-/- Rbf/f vs p53-/- Rb∆f/∆f Pten∆f/∆f primary prostate cells. Four independent experiments were performed.
