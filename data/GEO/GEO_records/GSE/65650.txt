TITLE
Transcriptional correlates of FOXP3 expression in suppressive and non-suppressive primary human Treg cell clones.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptional correlates of FOXP3 expression in suppressive and non-suppressive primary human Treg cell clones. Individual CD4+CD25High or Cd4+CD25- T cells were isolated from human PBMCs and expanded in vitro. After 3 weeks of expansion, individual clones were analysed for FOXP3 expression and in vitro suppressive activity against freshly sorted allogeneic effector T cells. This study analyses the total RNA isolated from FOXP3+ clones with suppressive potency to their non-suppressive counterparts. The resutls of this study should provide insights into the molecular pathways linking FOXP3 expression to distinct aspects of Treg phenotype and function.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from individual clones of primary human regulatory and effector CD4+T cells.
