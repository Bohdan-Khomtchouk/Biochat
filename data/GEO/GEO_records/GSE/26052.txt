TITLE
Mutation Mapping of 31 Streptococcus suis strains

ORGANISM
Streptococcus suis

SUMMARY
Identification of Genes and Genomic Islands Correlated with High Pathogenicity through Tilling Microarray-Based Comparative Genomics in S. suis. Streptococcus suis is an important zoonotic pathogen that can cause meningitis and sepsis in both pigs and humans. S. suis isolates have been categorized into groups of different levels of pathogenicity, with sequence type (ST) ST1 clonal complex strains having a higher degree of virulence than other STs. However, the genetic basis of the differences in pathogenicity is still poorly understood. In this study, a comprehensive genomic comparison of 31 S. suis strains from different clinical sources with the genome sequence of the high pathogenicity (HP) strain GZ1 was conducted using NimbleGenâ€™s tilling microarray platform.

DESIGN
Comparative genomic analysis on the 31 S. suis strains of different serotypes and ST types through tilling arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL11315 ICDC Streptococcus suis GZ1 tilling arrays (MAP01, MAP02)
