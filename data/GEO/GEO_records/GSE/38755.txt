TITLE
miRNA regulation in the early development of barley seed

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
small RNA and degradome sequencing was carried out on samples isolated from developing barley grains. The datasets were analysed to identify putative miRNAs and their target mRNAs

DESIGN
Samples were whole grain tissue (pericarp, embryo and endosperm) from developing barley grains. Three samples were used that pooled 1 to 5, 6-10 and 11-15 days post anthesis grains. For each sample a small RNA library and a degradome library (using the PARE method) was constructed and sequenced using the Illumina platform

PLATFORM
GPL15701 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Hordeum vulgare)
