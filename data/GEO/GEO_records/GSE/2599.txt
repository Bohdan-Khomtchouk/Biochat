TITLE
Chronic contusion spinal cord injury in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Excerpt from a larger study which characterized the transcriptional effects of a spinal cord contusion injury in rats.  This is the data from the almost chronic contusion state (35 days) at the injury site (Thoracic 8) - where we saw significant changes in several areas, including cholesterol metabolism genes.  Other spinal cord areas (rostral, caudal) and time-points (3 hours, 24 hours, 7 days and 35 days) were analyzed as well and are discussed in our paper and at www.crpf.org/microarray. Keywords = Spinal Cord Injury Keywords = chronic Keywords = thoracic Keywords = cholesterol Keywords: repeat sample
