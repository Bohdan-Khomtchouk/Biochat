TITLE
T (Brachyury) gene duplication confers major susceptibility to familial chordoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using high-resolution array-CGH, we identified unique duplications of a region on 6q27 in four multiplex (≥ with ≥ 3 cases) families of chordoma, a cancer of presumed notochordal origin.

DESIGN
comparison of test samples from chordoma families to a reference DNA sample
