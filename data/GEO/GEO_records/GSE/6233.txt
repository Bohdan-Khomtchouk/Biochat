TITLE
Expression data in ezrin-knockdown ec109 cells(PSE1) and control(PS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ezrin belongs to the ezrin¨Cradixin¨Cmoesin (ERM) family proteins, which cross-link actin cytoskeleton and plasma membrane, and is actively involved in regulating the growth and metastatic capacity of cancer cells. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most fatal malignancies in the world and the expression of ezrin in ESCC has been described only recently, but its roles and mechanism still remained unclear. we have used the pSUPER RNAi system to stably suppress the expression of the ezrin gene in EC109, an esophageal squamous carcinoma  cell line, and then cDNA microarray was performed to explore some changed genes with ezrin silence. Keywords: Gene expression after RNAi
