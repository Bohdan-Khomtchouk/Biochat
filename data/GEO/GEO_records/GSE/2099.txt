TITLE
control-ethanol liver RNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
cRNAs were hybridized with HumU133A oligo arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) which contain 22,283 probe sets. Preliminary studies indicated that Affymetrix Human GeneChips detected more than 60% of pig liver transcripts. All Affymetrix data were filtered for those genes with fluorescent intensity value of less than 100. Genes whose expressions in livers from the folate deficient and ethanol fed groups were either increased or decreased by 2-fold or more (p < 0.05) compared to those in livers from the control group were considered significantly changed. GeneChip cRNA probes used in GeneChip expressions were obtained by following a protocol from the manufacturer. First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of 8 Î¼g total RNA with superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and T7-oligo (dT) 24 primer (Genset Oligos, Boulder, CO), followed by second strand cDNA  synthesis. Biotin-labeled cRNA probes were generated by reverse transcription of double stranded cDNA using BioArray High yield RNA transcript labeling kit (ENZO Life Sciences, Inc., Farmingdale, NY). The cRNA probes were purified from unincorporated nucleotides by RNeasy mini column (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), fragmented and hybridized overnight at 680 C to the Human GeneChip array (HG U133A, Affymetrix). Keywords: parallel sample
