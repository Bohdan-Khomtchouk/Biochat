TITLE
Gene expression profiling of tuberculosis patients from India

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome microarray expression profiling was employed to identify differential gene expression profiles characteristic of tuberculosis patients in the South-Indian cohort. Whole blood samples were extracted from tuberculosis patients at the time of diagnosis and from healthy controls. The experiment served to validate computational predictions from a meta-analysis study of host transcriptional profiles in tuberculosis.

DESIGN
Gene expression in human blood was measured from TB patients immediately after diagnosis and from corresponding healthy controls
