TITLE
Immunosignatures can predict vaccine efficacy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were immunized with either formalin fixed Influenza A/PR/8/34 (Killed PR8), the 2006-2007 seasonal influenza vaccine, the 2007-2008 seasonal influenza vaccine, a sublethal infection (live PR8) or mock immunized (PBS).  Array data was used to distinguish the immunogens from each other and predict which of the three inactivated vaccines would be protective against A/PR/8/34 challenge.

DESIGN
two replicates of each peptide was printed on 1 CIM_10kv3 peptide microarray. One microarray were tested for each sample. Image was qualified using in-house metrics for quality assurance.

PLATFORM
GPL17830 CIM10Kv3
