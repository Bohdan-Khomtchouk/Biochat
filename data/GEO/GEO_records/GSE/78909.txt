TITLE
Expression data from cleaved CD95L treated human Th17 and Treg cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Th17 and Treg cells show a different infiltration and migrations pattern in inflamed skin from systemic lupus erythematosus patients. This distribution strongly correlates with the plasm levels of cleaved CD95L (cl-CD95L). To identify the mechanisms that underly this difference in migration, we used microarrays to identify differences in RNA expression induced by cl-CD95L treatment on Th17 and Treg cells from healthy donors.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from Th17 and Treg cells cultured for 8h in RPMI medium supplemented with 8% FCS and treated with 100 ng/ml cleaved CD95L (treatment) or vehicle only (control) and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Th17 and Treg cells were of obtained from buffy coats of healthy donors and sorted using the CD4+CD25+CD127dim/- Regulatory T Cell Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi biotec, Germany)  and the Human Th17 cell enrichment kit (Stemcell technologies, Canada) according to the manufacturersâ€™ instructions. Cell enrichment was assessed with flow cytometry.
