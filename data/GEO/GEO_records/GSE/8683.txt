TITLE
Gene expression in 3T3-L1 mouse tissue (preadipocytes) treated with Trans-10,Cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid(t10c12 CLA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Trans-10, Cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12 CLA) causes fat loss in mouse white adipose tissue (WAT) and 3T3-L1 adipocyte tissue culture; however in preadipocyte tissue (this series) the UPS/ISR and fat loss is not detected. The early transcriptome changes in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte tissue culture were analyzed using high-density microarrays to better characterize the signaling pathways responding to t10c12 CLA.  Their gene expression responses between 4 to 12 hr after treatment do not show a set of genes indicative of an integrated stress response (ISR). Keywords: control/treatment time course
