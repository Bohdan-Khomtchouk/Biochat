TITLE
Differentially expressed genes between oncogene-transformed and non-transformed fetal liver progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The activation of different oncogenic signals may primarily contribute to the heterogeneity of cancer cells. However, the exact mechanisms underlying different oncogenic transformation are still unclear. We used the c-Myc, H-Ras and Akt transformed liver cell model to define mRNA expression profiles in the non-transformed and the three types of oncogene-transformed cells

DESIGN
Purified p53-/- mouse fetal liver progenitor cells were transformed by three oncogenic genetic factors, c-Myc, H-RasV12 and myristoylated-AKT1(myr-Akt). The gene expression profilings of transformed cells and control cells were analyzed through microarray.
