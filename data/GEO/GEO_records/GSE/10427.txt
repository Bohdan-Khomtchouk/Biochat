TITLE
Drought stress: Analysis of FDH (Formate dehydrogenase) insertion mutants in response to drought stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
adt04-03_fdh_drought - drought stress - What is the role of the mitochondrial formate dehydrogenase in the response to drought?								 - Wild type and mutant arabidopsis plants were grown in soil for 6 weeks under short days. Each lot of plants is shared into 2 groups, one of which was watered normally (arr) whislt the other half was not watered for a week (sech). Keywords: gene knock out,treated vs untreated comparison

DESIGN
7 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL5337 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.1
