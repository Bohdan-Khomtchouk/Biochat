TITLE
Root transcriptional profile of tomato Fe-deficient plants in response to supply with natural chelating agents.

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Tomato, a Strategy I model plant for Fe deficiency, is an important economical crop. The transcriptional responses induced by Fe deficiency in tomato roots were previously described (Zamboni et al., 2012). The changes in trascriptome caused by the supply of Fe to plants starved fro 1 week were described in relation to the different nature of chelating agents (Fe-WEHS, Fe-CITRATE and Fe-PS).

DESIGN
Transcriptional profile obtained by roots (27-d) of 21-d-old tomato plants starved of iron (0 μM Fe-EDTA) for 1 week and supplied for 1 h with 1 μM of Fe as Fe-WEHS (supply_Fe_WEHS), Fe citrate (supply_Fe_CITRATE) and Fe-PS (supply_Fe_PS). Tomato plants were hydroponically grown in all three case of Fe supply. Three different biological replicates were used for each sample repeating the experiment three times. All samples were obtained pooling roots of six plants (27-d-old).
