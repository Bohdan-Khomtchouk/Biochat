Probiotic and Prebiotic Supplementation of Antiretroviral Therapy Improves Gastrointestinal Immunity in SIV-infected Macaques

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIV infection results in damage to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, microbial translocation and immune activation, which are not completely ameliorated with suppression of viremia by antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Furthermore, increased morbidity and mortality of ARV-treated HIV-infected individuals is associated with these dysfunctions. Thus, in order to enhance GI tract immunity, we treated SIV-infected pigtail macaques with ARVs supplemented with probiotics and prebiotics or with ARVs alone. In the colon, this synbiotic treatment resulted in increased expression of genes associated with antigen presenting cells (APCs), increased frequency and functionality of APCs, enhanced reconstitution and functionality of CD4+ T-cells and reduced fibrosis of lymphoid follicles. Thus, supplementing ARV treatment with synbiotic treatment in HIV-infected individuals may improve GI tract immunity and thereby mitigate inflammatory sequelae, ultimately improving prognosis.
