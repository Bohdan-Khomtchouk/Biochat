TITLE
Transcriptomes From the Deep Cones During FIbroproliferative Cutaneous Healing in the Duroc/Yorkshire Porcine Model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal was to obtain the differential transcriptome in the deep cones between shallow and deep wounds and between the Yorkshire and Duroc breeds over time.

DESIGN
We made shallow and deep wounds on the backs of 3 Yorkshire and 3 Duroc pigs, biopsied the wounds at 1 2 3 12 and 20 weeks, extracted and amplified the RNA from the deep cones, and hybridized the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ®. We compared wound depth by breed over time; the system included 3 factors (depth, breed and time). The system also included repeated measures since the same pigs were used at each time. It also included paired data since the shallow and deep wounds compared were located on the same pig.
