TITLE
Overcoming cetuximab resistance in HNSCC: The role of AURKB and DUSP proteins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Unraveling the underlying mechanisms of cetuximab resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is of major importance as many tumors remain non-responsive or become resistant. Out microarray results suggest that resistant cells still exhibit RAS-MAPK pathway signaling contributing to drug resistance, as witnessed by low expression of DUSP 5 and DUSP6, negative regulators of ERK1/2, and increased expression of AURKB, a key regulator of mitosis. Therefore, interrupting the RAS-MAPK pathway by an ERK1/2 inhibitor  (apigenin) or an AURKB inhibitor (barasertib) might be  a new strategy for overcoming cetuximab resistance in HNSCC

DESIGN
4 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines were treated with either 15 nM cetuximab or PBS during 13 hours. For each cell line, differential gene expression was assessed between cetuximab and PBS treatments.
