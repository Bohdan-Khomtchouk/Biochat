TITLE
THE GENE EXPRESSION PROFILE CHANGES OF HUMAN MEIBOMIAN GLAND EPITHELIAL CELLS UNDER DIFFERENTIATION

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profile changes of immortalized human meibomian gland epithelial cells under differentiation. Results provide important information of the response of human meibomian gland epithelial cells to different differentiation media, such as serum containing medium, serum-free medium, serum-free medium with 1.2mM Ca2+.
