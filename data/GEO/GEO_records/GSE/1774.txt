TITLE
Suppression of MT1-MMP in Human Fibrosarcoma Impair Tumor Angiogenesis and Enlargement

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To define the role of MT1-MMP in the tumor progression, we suppressed its expression in human fibrosarcoma cell line, HT1080, using RNAi technique. The gene expression pattern was then compared betweent the two experimental cell groups with contrasting MT1-MMP expression level. Keywords: other
