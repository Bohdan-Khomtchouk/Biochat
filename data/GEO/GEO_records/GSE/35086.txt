TITLE
Characterization of Nicotiana attenuata plants with reduced expression of HSPRO (ir-hspro plants).

ORGANISM
Nicotiana attenuata

SUMMARY
Identification of transcripts that change expression in roots of Nicotiana attenuata plants with reduced expression of HSPRO and in association with Piriformospora indica.

DESIGN
Gene expression in roots of Nicotiana attenuata wild type and ir-hspro seedlings was measured at 14 days after inoculation with Piriformospora indica. Three independent experiments were performed with wild type plants and three independent experiments were performed with ir-hspro plants.
