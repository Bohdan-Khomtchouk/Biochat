synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Placental insufficiency leading to intrauterine growth restriction demonstrates perturbed gene expression affecting placental angiogenesis and nutrient transfer from mother to fetus. To understand the post-transcriptional mechanisms underlying such placental gene expression changes, our objective was to identify key non-coding microRNAs that express biological function. To this end, we undertook microarray targeting microRNAs in placentas of appropriate (AGA, n=3) versus small for gestational age (SGA, n=3) weight infants and observed upregulation of 97 miRs in SGA versus AGA. In a larger cohort of samples, we validated by qRT-PCR, differential expression of three specific microRNAs that target genes mediating angiogenesis and nutrient transfer. This dataset was used to verify initial studies. We performed a second microarray on a small cohort of samples in order to validate differential expression in pathways involved with angiogenesis and nutrient transfer, essential processes for placental function that when perturbed, may result in intrauterine growth restriction.
