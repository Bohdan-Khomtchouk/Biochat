TITLE
RPL12A/B double deletion strains: Control vs. Wt RPL12B or Mutant RPL12B-R66K Transformed

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptional and translational profiling of RPL12A/B double deletion comparing control untransformed RPL12B strains with transformed with a pESC-RPL12B wild type or muated RPL12B-R66K gene. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Transcriptional experiments from total mRNA and Translational experiments from polysomal mRNA from three strains including deleted RPL12A/B, retransformed WT RPL12B and mutated RPL12B-R66K strain. Biological replicates: independently grown and harvested. double, triple or more replication per array.

PLATFORM
GPL7767 Agilent Yeast Oligo Microarray 4x44K G2519F (condensed)
