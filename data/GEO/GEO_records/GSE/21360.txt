TITLE
Whole-genome microarray analysis of primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary memory CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of naive OT-I T cells was compared to memory CD8 T cells after 1, 2, 3, or 4 infection with ovalbumin expressing Listeria monocytogenes (LM-OVA).

DESIGN
Naive Thy1.1 OT-I T cells were adoptively transferred into Thy1.2 naive hosts prior to infection with LM-OVA. The resulting memory CD8 T cell population was again adoptively transferred into naive hosts and the recipient mice were again infected with LM-OVA. The adoptive transfer was repeated up to four times to generate memory CD8 T cells with up to four consecutive antigen stimulations. Three individual mice were analyzed for each group. For quaternary memory CD8 T cells, spleens from two to three mice were pooled for each sample. Naive OT-I T cells served as control samples. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2010.06.014
