TITLE
A Wnt-Bmp feedback circuit controls inter-tissue signaling dynamics in tooth organogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of the epithelial and mesenchymal compartments of the developing mouse tooth using Laser Capture Microdissected (LCM) or enzymatic treatment with Dispase to isolate the dental epithelial and mesenchymal tissue, over a developmental period from E10.0-E14.5. The data is also accessible from http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/ToothCODE/

DESIGN
The aim of the study is to investigate the the mode of epithelial-mesenchymal (E-M) interaction through analyzing global gene expression patterns.   We collected wildtype spatiotemporal gene expression data and perturbation data from transcription factor knockouts and signaling molecule treatments to identify differentially regulated genes and reconstruct a gene regulatory network controlling E-M interaction in early tooth development.
