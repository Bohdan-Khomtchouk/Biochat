TITLE
Expression data from small intestinal Lin-c-Kit+Sca-1- cells and Lin-c-Kit-Sca-1- cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Small intestinal innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are known to regulate intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis and to help prevent pathogenic bacterial infections, by producing IL-22. However, other functions of these cells and the lineal relationship between ILCs and lymphoid or myeloid cells have not been clear. We performed a global gene expression analysis to examine which genes are highly expressed by small intestinal ILCs (Lin-c-Kit+Sca-1- cells) compared with non-ILCs (Lin-c-Kit-Sca-1- cells).

DESIGN
To examine the gene expression profiles of ILCs within the small intestinal lamina propria (LP), we isolated Lingeage (Lin)-c-Kit+Sca-1- cells [consisting of NKp46+ ILC22 (Lin-c-Kit+Sca-1-NKp46+ cells) and LTi-like ILC (Lin-c-Kit+Sca-1-CD4+ cells)] as the ILC population, and Lin-c-Kit-Sca-1- cells as the non-ILC population, from the small intestinal LP of 8 week-old mice by FACS, then compared the gene expression profiles between these two populations by microarray analysis.
