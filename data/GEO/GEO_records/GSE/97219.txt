TITLE
The putrescine production in Enterococcus faecalis is transcriptionally induced by tyrosine.

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis

SUMMARY
The aim was to study the transcriptional profiling of the E. faecalis V583 in presence and absence of tyrosine. We compared the expression profile of the strains grown in M17 medium with glucose as carbon source (GM17)  and suplemented with agmatine in presence and absence of tyrosine.

DESIGN
E. faecalis V583 cells grown with 15 mM tyrosine (test) compared with E. faecalis V583 cells grown without tyrosine (reference). Both strains grown in GM17 medium suplemented with 5 mM agmatine.
