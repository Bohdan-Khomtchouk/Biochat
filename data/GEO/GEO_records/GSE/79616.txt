TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of CycG1-/- and CycG2-/- knockout deficientÂ mouse embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine if lack of CycG1 or CycG2 causes genome-wide alterations of gene expression, we performed DNA microarray analysis on G1KO and G2KO MEFs at their logarithmic growth phase.

DESIGN
Microarray analyses were performed as dye-swapped regarding among WT, G1KO and G2KO.

PLATFORM
