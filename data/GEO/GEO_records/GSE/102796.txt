TITLE
Mutant p53 Shapes the Enhancer Landscape of Cancer Cells in Response to Chronic Immune Signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We establish a mechanism by which chronic TNF-a signaling orchestrates a functional interplay between mutant p53 and NFkB that underlies altered patterns of cancer promoting gene expression.

DESIGN
examination of various histone mark accumulation; mutp53, NFkB, RNAPII binding; and nascent transcription upon chronic TNF signaling in SW480 colon cancer cells

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
