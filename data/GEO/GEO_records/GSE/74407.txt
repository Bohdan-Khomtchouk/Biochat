TITLE
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor inhibition triggers Type 1 Interferon signature in human keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)/ligand system is centrally involved in multiple homeostatic functions of the epithelia. Epithelial cells are the primary targets of humanized antibodies and small molecule inhibitors against this system, whereby the constellation of skin-specific side effects of these drugs stems from a profound disturbance of keratinocyte biology. So far, the molecular mechanisms underlying these toxic events have been investigated only broadly. Here we show that keratinocyte response to anti-EGFR drugs comprises the development of a type 1 interferon (IFN) molecular signature including enhanced expression of IFN-kappa. Mechanistically, nuclear accumulation of IRF1 precedes this signature as well as the enhanced expression of a chemokine cluster we previously identified as a relevant pro-inflammatory component of EGFR inhibition. In fact, either silencing of IRF1 transcript expression, or antibody-mediated blockade of type 1 IFN receptor function and consequent abrogation of STAT1 activation, leads to impairment of this gene transcription profile. High levels of IRF1 and IFN-kappa can be clearly observed in the early skin lesions of patients treated with cetuximab. Type 1 IFN signaling could be crucially implicated in the triggering of the inflammatory mechanisms active in the skin of patients under treatment with anti-EGFR drugs.

DESIGN
Normal human keratinocyte cultures were treated with Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) alpha (50 ng/ml) alone (SAMPLES #4-6), or with  the concomitant administration of the small-molecule EGFR inhibitor PD168393 (2 microM) (SAMPLES #7-9) for 6 hours. Cultures were performed in triplicate and include untreated controls (SAMPLES #1-3).
