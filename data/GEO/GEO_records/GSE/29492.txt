TITLE
Combinatorial effects of microRNA to suppress the myc oncogenic pathway (mRNA data)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA importance in the myc pathway in Burkitt lymphoma.

DESIGN
Gene expression data of Burkitt lymphoma samples and non-tumoral controls. 6 Burkitt lymphomas were compared with 16 non-tumoral controls. Universal Human Reference RNA was used as the reference sample. Significantly deregulated miRNAs were computed using the Significant Analysis of Microarray (SAM) analysis from the TM4 pathway and the limma package.
