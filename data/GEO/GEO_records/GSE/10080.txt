TITLE
IL-23 100ng/ml Treatment of CD3 CD28 Stimulated PBMCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cryopreserved human PBMCs from six donors were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads in the presence or absence of 100ng/ml IL-23 for 22 hours. RNA samples were assessed for consistency with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and quantified by a Nanodrop® ND 1000 Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, USA). Expression array data was quantile normalised, detection above background statistical testing performed, comparison between activated un-stimulated versus activated IL-23 stimulated conditions performed as a paired test using the Illumina Custom differential expression algorithm (all implemented in Illumina BeadStudio GeneExpression Module v3.2). Two sample groups were compared, each with 6 biological replicates. Group 1 was stimulated with CD3CD28 antibody coated beads as a control group for 22hours. Group 2 was stimulated as the control group and treated with IL-23 100ng/ml for the same time period. Keywords: Cytokine Treatment

DESIGN
Genome wide association studies have recently identified common risk variants in IL23R, encoding a subunit of the heterodimeric interleukin-23 receptor, associated with Crohn’s disease, psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. IL-23 is a critical cytokine for the development of pathogenic TH17 cells, and drives intestinal and dermal inflammation in animal models. The influence of IL23R genetic variation on human immune responses is not known. Here, we have correlated disease associated IL23R genotypes (for nine markers reaching genome wide significance in the initial Crohn’s disease report) with responses to IL-23 in anti-CD3/CD28 activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 40 genotyped healthy donors. IL-23 stimulation induced leucocyte IL-10 secretion and IL17F mRNA expression. Leucocytes of IL23R rs11209032 AG genotype had higher IL-23 stimulated IL-10 secretion (P=0.00030) and IL17F mRNA expression (P=0.026) than those of GG genotype. Lower IL23R mRNA expression (P=0.046) was observed by quantitative PCR assay in leucocytes of GG genotype. Disease associated IL23R variants lead to gain of function in human cells, by a mechanism involving increased IL23R expression, suggesting novel therapeutic strategies should aim to block IL-23 receptor signalling.
