TITLE
IL-23 100ng/ml Treatment of CD3 CD28 Stimulated PBMCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cryopreserved human PBMCs from six donors were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads in the presence or absence of 100ng/ml IL-23 for 22 hours. RNA samples were assessed for consistency with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and quantified by a NanodropÂ® ND 1000 Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, USA). Expression array data was quantile normalised, detection above background statistical testing performed, comparison between activated un-stimulated versus activated IL-23 stimulated conditions performed as a paired test using the Illumina Custom differential expression algorithm (all implemented in Illumina BeadStudio GeneExpression Module v3.2). Two sample groups were compared, each with 6 biological replicates. Group 1 was stimulated with CD3CD28 antibody coated beads as a control group for 22hours. Group 2 was stimulated as the control group and treated with IL-23 100ng/ml for the same time period. Keywords: Cytokine Treatment
