TITLE
Gene expression profile of G93A-SOD1 mouse spinal cord, blood and muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the usefulness of gene expression as diagnostic biomarkers, we compared whole genome expression profiles of lumbar spinal cord with profiles of peripheral blood and tibialis anterior muscle in 16 mutant G93A-SOD1 mice and 15 wild type littermates.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from blood, tibialis anterior muscle and lumbar spinal cord of G93A-SOD1 mice compared to wild type littermates.

PLATFORM
