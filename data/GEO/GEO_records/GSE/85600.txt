TITLE
Pax5 drives the metabolic shift in the development of pB-ALL as a result of BCR/ABLp190 susceptibility

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate gene expression changes in tumor-bearing  Sca1-BCR/ABLp190 and Sca1-BCR/ABLp190+Pax5+/- mice. We also analyze gene expression changes in preleukemic Sca1-BCR/ABLp190 and Sca1-BCR/ABLp190+Pax5+/- mice

DESIGN
Tumor-bearing bone marrows of seven Sca1-BCR/ABLp190+Pax5+/-  and two Sca1-BCR/ABLp190 mice compared with B220+ bone marrow B cells from five WT mice. Preleukemic proB and preB cells of bone marrows of three Sca1-BCR/ABLp190+Pax5+/- and three Sca1-BCR/ABLp190 mice compared with proB and preB cells of bone marrows of three WT mice
