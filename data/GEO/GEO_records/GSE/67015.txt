TITLE
RNAseq Analysis of Transcriptome expression profiles in E13.5 Foxf2-/-Osr2RFP/+ and control palatal mesenchymal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose:  The purpose of this study is to compare the transcriptome expression profiles of E13.5 Foxf2-/-;Osr2RFP/+ and control palatal mesenchyme by using RNA-seq analysis. Methods: Foxf2+/- female mice were crossed with Foxf2+/-;Osr2RFP/+ male mice.The embryos were harvested at E13.5. The pair of palatal shelves were dissected from each Osr2-RFP+ embryo. The RFP+ palatal mesenchyme cells were isolated by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RNA-seq analysis was carried out using the FACS-isolated palatal mesenchyme from Foxf2-/-;Osr2RFP/+, Foxf2+/-;Osr2RFP/+ and Osr2RFP/+embryos, respectively.

DESIGN
The transcriptome expression profiles of E13.5 control and Foxf2-/-Osr2RFP/+ palatal mesenchyme by using RNA-seq analysis,  in duplicates, using Illumina HisEq 2000.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
