TITLE
Expression data from Mus musculus Myc-null heart at E13.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We created mice, which are deficient for Myc specifically in cardiac myocytes by crossing crossed Myc-floxed mice (Mycfl/fl) and MLC-2VCre/+ mice.  Serial analysis of earlier stages of gestation revealed that Myc-deficient mice died prematurely at E13.5-14.5.  Morphological analyses of E13.5 Myc-null embryos showed normal ventricular size and structure; however, decreased cardiac myocyte proliferation and increased apoptosis was observed.  BrdU incorporation rates were also decreased significantly in Myc-null myocardium.  Myc-null mice displayed a 3.67-fold increase in apoptotic cardiomyocytes by TUNEL assay. We examined global gene expression using oligonucleotide microarrays. Numerous genes involved in mitochondrial death pathways were dysregulated including Bnip3L and Birc2. Keywords: wildtype vs Myc-null
