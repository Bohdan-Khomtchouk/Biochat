TITLE
Expression data from Mus musculus Myc-null heart at E13.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We created mice, which are deficient for Myc specifically in cardiac myocytes by crossing crossed Myc-floxed mice (Mycfl/fl) and MLC-2VCre/+ mice.  Serial analysis of earlier stages of gestation revealed that Myc-deficient mice died prematurely at E13.5-14.5.  Morphological analyses of E13.5 Myc-null embryos showed normal ventricular size and structure; however, decreased cardiac myocyte proliferation and increased apoptosis was observed.  BrdU incorporation rates were also decreased significantly in Myc-null myocardium.  Myc-null mice displayed a 3.67-fold increase in apoptotic cardiomyocytes by TUNEL assay. We examined global gene expression using oligonucleotide microarrays. Numerous genes involved in mitochondrial death pathways were dysregulated including Bnip3L and Birc2. Keywords: wildtype vs Myc-null

DESIGN
Hearts were taken from wide type and Myc-null Mouse embryos at E13.5 under the dissecting scope.  Cardiac myocyte RNA was isolated using TRIZOL®Reagent  Total RNA (100 ng) was hybridized to the Sentrix® MouseRef-8 Expression BeadChip that contains probes for ~24,000 transcripts.  GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A.  The data were analyzed with Illumina Inc. BeadStudio version 1.5.0.34 and normalized by rank invariant method.
