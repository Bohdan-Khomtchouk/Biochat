TITLE
Genome-wide maps of HLH-1 binding in muscle-enriched embryos.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To investigate the structure of the bodywall muscle differentiation network, we sought to both identify what role HLH-1 binding has in this regulation. We mapped the relationship between the regulatory targets and HLH-1 binding, as measured by ChIP-seq in animals enriched for bodywall muscle tissue through RNAi feeding. While regulatory targets are enriched for HLH-1 binding, the majority of HLH-1 binding actually occurs away from genes that are affected by hlh-1 loss of function. Nevertheless, HLH-1 binding is associated with both the expected E-box and, near genes belonging to specific regulatory subgroups, novel motifs that may serve as binding sites for cooperative transcription factors.
