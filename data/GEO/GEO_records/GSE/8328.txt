TITLE
Matrix metalloproteinase-3 mediates cardiac differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recently, it was shown that the Bmp antagonist Noggin could strongly induce cardiomyocyte differentiation by transient treatment of undifferentiated ES cells. In order to determine how Noggin may induce cardiac differentiation, we compared differentially expressed genes during Noggin treatment of ES cells using microarray analysis and found that matrix metalloproteinase (Mmp)-3 is the only gene whose expression is increased by Noggin treatment. Keywords: embryonic stem cells, cardiac differentiation, matrix metalloproteinase-3, Noggin
