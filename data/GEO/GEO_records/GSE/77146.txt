TITLE
Genome-wide binding of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) in cancer cells and human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the genome wide binding of endogeneous TERT in various cell types. The binding signature is highly overlapping with RNA polymerase III components.

DESIGN
Examination of TERT genome wide binding in seven cell lines
