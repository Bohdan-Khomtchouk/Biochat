TITLE
Characterization of PPAR-α regulated miRNAs in HCV infected hepatoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to characterize changes in hepatic miRNA expression associated with inhibition of PPAR-α signaling.

DESIGN
Huh7.5 hepatoma cells were infected with a cell culture adapted JFH1 strain (JFH-1T; MOI = 0.1) of hepatitis C virus.  48 hours post-infection, cells were treated with 25 μM 2-chloro-5-nitro-N-(pyridyl)benzamide (or BA), a PPAR-α antagonist.  24 hours post- drug treatment, cells were lysed.

PLATFORM
