TITLE
Bile stress response in probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus rhamnosus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG mid-exponential pH-controlled bioreactor cultures before and after exposure to bovine bile (0.2% ox gall). Keywords: bile, stress response

DESIGN
Cell samples from four biological replicates were harvested right before (time point 0 min) and 10, 30 and 120 min after bile treatment. Each sample was compared to a common reference sample (time point 0 min, mid-exponential growth phase Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG cultures). A total of 12 hybridizations were performed using balanced dye-swap design. Dyes were balanced between compared sample pairs and between biological replicates.

PLATFORM
