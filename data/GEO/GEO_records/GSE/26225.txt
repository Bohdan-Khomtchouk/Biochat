TITLE
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in AxB mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Spontaneous insulin resistance and NAFLD emerged in AxB F1 male mice with parent-of-origin effects such that AB6F1 (AJ dam x B6 sire) were susceptible whereas B6AF1 (B6 dam x AJ sire) were resistant. We used microarrays to correlate gene expression with the NAFLD phenotype in 9-month-old male AB6F1 (affected) versus B6AF1 (unaffected) mice.

DESIGN
Whole liver slices from two 9-month-old AB6F1 and B6AF1 males were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
