TITLE
Small molecule screen identifies de novo nucleotide synthesis as a vulnerability of cells lacking SIRT3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is an NAD+-dependent deacetylase downregulated in aging and age-associated diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration, and high fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic disorders. Thus, we performed a small molecule screen and identified an unexpected metabolic vulnerability associated with SIRT3 loss.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing in SV40T immortalized SIRT3 WT (triplicates) and SIRT3 KO MEF (duplicates) lines under normal conditions.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
