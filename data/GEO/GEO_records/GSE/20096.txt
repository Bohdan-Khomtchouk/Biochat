TITLE
Strains of increasing genetic divergence to the reference strain

ORGANISM
Burkholderia cenocepacia

SUMMARY
comparative genomic hybridization between Burkholderia cepacia sequenced strains to determine what are the limits to strain relativity in order to still provide accurate estimations of gene content
