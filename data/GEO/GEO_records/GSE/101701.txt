TITLE
Nonmuscle myosin IIB regulates epicardial integrity and epicardium-derived mesenchymal cell maturation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nonmuscle myosin IIB (NMIIB; heavy chain encoded by MYH10) is essential for cardiac myocyte cytokinesis. The role of NMIIB in other cardiac cells is not known. Here, we show that NMIIB is required in epicardial formation and functions to support myocardial proliferation and coronary vessel development. Ablation of NMIIB in epicardial cells results in disruption of epicardial integrity with a loss of E-cadherin at cell-cell junctions and a focal detachment of epicardial cells from the myocardium. NMIIB-knockout and blebbistatin-treated epicardial explants demonstrate impaired mesenchymal cell maturation during epicardial epithelial-mesenchymal transition. This is manifested by an impaired invasion of collagen gels by the epicardium-derived mesenchymal cells and the reorganization of the cytoskeletal structure. Although there is a marked decrease in the expression of mesenchymal genes, there is no change in Snail (also known as Snai1) or E-cadherin expression. Studies from epicardium-specific NMIIB-knockout mice confirm the importance of NMIIB for epicardial integrity and epicardial functions in promoting cardiac myocyte proliferation and coronary vessel formation during heart development. Our findings provide a novel mechanism linking epicardial formation and epicardial function to the activity of the cytoplasmic motor protein NMIIB.
