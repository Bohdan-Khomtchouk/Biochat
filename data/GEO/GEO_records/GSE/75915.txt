TITLE
Gene expression profile of two colorectal cancer HT29 and DLD-1 cell lines treated with single or fractionated ionizing radiation doses under 3D cell culture conditions.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor cell response to irradiation also depends on their microenvironment. Therefore ongoing investigation of three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models provide researchers with essential data studying and remodeling radiotherapeutic implications in cancer treatment. 3D culture models were shown to mimic in vivo cell microenvironment more accurately than the standard two-dimensional cell monolayer (2D) cultures. Growing evidence suggests that 2D and 3D cultured cell gene expression pattern discrepancies following irradiation is highly dependent on cell-ECM interactions.  It has been shown that laminin-rich-extracellular matrix (lr-ECM) used in 3D cultures not only alters cancer cell phenotype and response to external stimuli but also affects their differentiation, migration and survivability. Thus, a change in these fundamental cell properties demands us to reconsider data previously collected using 2D in vitro models.

DESIGN
RNA was harvested from two colorectal cancer cell lines cultivated under 3D cell culture conditions, 4h after treatment of single (2 Gy or 10 Gy) or fractionated (5x2 Gy) ionizing radiation dose.
