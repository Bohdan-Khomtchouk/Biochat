TITLE
Himalaya v 292

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Himalaya v 292 Keywords: Mutant Analysis

DESIGN
Four biological replicates were used for the comparison and the dyes were swapped among the test and control samples for labeling two of the replicates. For each replicate, 50 ?g of total RNA was used for both the Cy3 and Cy5 dyes (Amersham Pharmacia, UK), following the two-step labeling method of Schenk et al. (2000). The control plant, 'Himalaya' was labeled with Cy3 in the un-swapped replicates. The dyes were reversed among the replicate experiments to minimize any bias in cDNA incorporation and photo-bleaching of the fluorescent dyes. The pre-hybridization of the microarray slides, hybridization of samples and subsequent washing of the slides to remove unbound target was performed as per the supplied protocol for the CMT-GAPSTM coated microscope slides (Corning USA). The slides were scanned with a GenePix 4000A microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Union, CA, USA). The features were analyzed using the GenePix Pro 4 software and unsatisfactorily segmented features were either manually adjusted or discarded to ensure the integrity of the data obtained.
