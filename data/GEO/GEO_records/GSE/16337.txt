TITLE
Foreskin Melanocyte: control vs. treated with pIC/pIC+PEI

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Foreskin Melanocyte comparing control untreated cells with cells treated with 1ug/ml of polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (pIC) or 1ug/ml of pIC with polyethyleneimine (PEI) for 4 or 10 hours.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment, Foreskin Melanocyte untreated vs. Foreskin Melanocyte treated with pIC/pIC+PEI at 4 and 10 hours. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
