TITLE
Microarray profiling of total testicular transcriptome in mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression during spermatogenesis is highly variable and this differential pattern is very important for the successive culmination of different stages of the process, leading to production of the male gamete. Taking the time window of first wave of spermatogenesis, we did a microarray profiling of total testicular transcriptome in mouse and found several significant patterns of variable gene expression, forming upregulated and downregulated clusters among the three stages analyzed here.

DESIGN
Mouse testis tissue were taken at three stages, 8 days, 16 days and 24 days, during first wave of spermatogenesis for RNA extraction and hybridization on the  Affymetrix microarrays. Three biological replicates per age group were included and comparisons were done as 16 days vs 8 days, 24 days vs 16 days and 24 days vs 8 days testis transcriptome profile.
