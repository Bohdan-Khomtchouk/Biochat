TITLE
Epigenetic reprogramming in relapsed childhood ALL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reversing gene expression signatures in relapsed patient may restore chemosensitivity. We demonstrate that the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat not only reprograms the aberrant gene expression profile of relapsed blasts but is synergistic when applied prior to chemotherapy in primary patient samples and leukemia cell lines

DESIGN
Primary patient samples were collected from patients treated at the New York University Medical Center and from the Childrenâ€™s Oncology Group (COG) cell bank,RNA was isolated from three primary patient samples and three B-lineage leukemia cell lines with or without treatment with vorinostat for 24 hours.
