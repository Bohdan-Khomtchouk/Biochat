TITLE
Extended suppression of Mek1/2 impairs the developmental potential of mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Simultaneous inhibition of Gsk3α/β and Mek1/2 activity in the presence of LIF (2i/L) induces a naïve state in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that resembles the inner cell mass (ICM) of the pre-implantation embryo. Since the ICM exists only transiently in vivo, it remains unclear how extended propagation of naïve ESCs in vitro affects their stability and functionality. Here we show that extended culture of male ESCs in 2i/L results in the progressive erosion of genomic imprints, loss of H2A.X binding, and accumulation of chromosomal aberrations. Consistent with these observations, we find that the developmental potential of ESCs cultured in 2i/L is impaired. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Mek1/2 inhibition is predominantly responsible for these effects, in part through downregulation of DNA methyltransferases. Additionally, we demonstrate that female ESCs cultured in conventional serum/LIF media phenocopy male ESCs cultured in 2i/L, including the aforementioned epigenetic and developmental abnormalities. Finally, we show that replacement of the Mek1/2 inhibitor with a Src inhibitor preserves the epigenetic and genomic integrity as well as developmental potential of ESCs. Taken together, our data suggest that, while short-term suppression of Mek1/2 in ESCs maintains an ICM-like epigenetic state, prolonged suppression results in irreversible changes that compromise their developmental potential.

DESIGN
Gene expression patterns of mouse ESC lines cultured in multiple culture conditions were compared using RNA-seq.
