TITLE
A Genomic Score Prognostic of Outcome in Trauma Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Physiological, anatomical, and clinical laboratory analytic scoring systems (APACHE, Injury Severity Score (ISS)) have been utilized, with limited success, to predict outcome following injury. We hypothesized that a peripheral blood leukocyte gene expression score could predict outcome, including multiple organ failure, following severe blunt trauma.
