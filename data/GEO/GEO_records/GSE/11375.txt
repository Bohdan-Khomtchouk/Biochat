TITLE
A Genomic Score Prognostic of Outcome in Trauma Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Physiological, anatomical, and clinical laboratory analytic scoring systems (APACHE, Injury Severity Score (ISS)) have been utilized, with limited success, to predict outcome following injury. We hypothesized that a peripheral blood leukocyte gene expression score could predict outcome, including multiple organ failure, following severe blunt trauma. Contributor: The Inflammation and the Host Response to Injury Large Scale Collaborative Research Program Keywords: expression profiles

DESIGN
cRNA derived from whole blood leukocytes obtained within 12 hours of hospital admission provided gene expression data for the entire genome that were used to create a gene expression score for each patient. Expression profiles from healthy volunteers were averaged to create a reference gene expression profile which was used to compute a difference from reference (DFR) score for each patient. This score described the overall genomic response of patients within the first 12 hours following severe blunt trauma. Regression models were used to compare the association of the DFR, APACHE and ISS scores with outcome.
