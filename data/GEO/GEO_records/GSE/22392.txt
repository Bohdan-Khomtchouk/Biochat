TITLE
Expression data from hESCs, hiPSCs and human fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Detailed analysis comparing hiPSC lines that were newly generated and compared them to already established hiPSC lines We used microarrays to detail various hiPSC lines to confirm faithful reprogramming.

DESIGN
hESCs, hiPSCs and human fibroblasts for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix arrays.
