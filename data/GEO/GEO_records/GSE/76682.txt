TITLE
RNA-seq expression data from EB-HSPC after AM580 treatment compated to DMSO-trated and FL-HSPCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RA signalling regulated endothelial to hematopoietic transition and HSC generation.

DESIGN
EB- or FL-derived HSPC were profiled before (d0) or after (d6) 6 days of treatment with 0.2uM AM580 on OP9, and after 6 additional days of expandion of OP9 (d12) without treatment.
