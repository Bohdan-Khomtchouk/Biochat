Mesenchymal stem cell labelings with ferritin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) omplexed to different transfection agents (R60, R200, DOSPER, jetPei, Pulsin). Two MSC populations (h21 and h24) and two passages (P2 and P4) were tested with different labelings. In a direct design experiment each sample was compared to its unlabeled control sample. Keywords: Human gene expression study
