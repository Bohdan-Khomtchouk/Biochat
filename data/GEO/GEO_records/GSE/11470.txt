TITLE
Mesenchymal stem cell labelings with ferritin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) omplexed to different transfection agents (R60, R200, DOSPER, jetPei, Pulsin). Two MSC populations (h21 and h24) and two passages (P2 and P4) were tested with different labelings. In a direct design experiment each sample was compared to its unlabeled control sample. Keywords: Human gene expression study

DESIGN
Reference design with unlabeled cells in the Cy3 reference channel, and labeled cells in the Cy5 channel.

PLATFORM
GPL6865 Homo sapiens 2.3K oncogene and clock gene oligo array
