TITLE
Expression profiles in WT and MLL1-KO MEF at two different circadian time point

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that a H3K4 specific histone methyltransferase MLL1, a mammalian homologue of Drosophila trithorax, is essential for circadian transcription. MLL1 is in a complex with CLOCK:BMAL1 and contributes to their rhythmic recruitment to circadian promoters and cyclic H3K4 tri-metylation. To analyze the function of MLL1 on circadian gene regulation, we performed comparative microarray analysis of global gene expression levels in WT and MLL1-deficient MEF, at two different circadian time points (CT18 and CT30). This analysis identified several genes whose expression levels were remarkably changed between CT18 and CT30 in WT and MLL1-KO MEF. Typical clock-regulated genes such as Per2, Per3, Bmal1, or Dbp were found to be changing in WT but not in MLL1-KO MEFs.

DESIGN
Wild-type and MLL1-KO MEF at two circadian time point (CT18 and 30), three replicates for each hour.
