TITLE
Effects of PCB 153 on genome-wide gene expression in the liver of Atlantic Cod (Gadus murhua)

ORGANISM
Gadus morhua

SUMMARY
Genome-wide gene expression assay was used to map the genes affected in the liver of Atlantic cod treated with the persistent environmental pollutant polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (PCB 153) (0.5, 2 and 8 mg/kg body weight).

DESIGN
Analyzed samples from each of control, 0.5, 2 and 8 mg/BW PCB 153 treated group (n = 3 for 2mg/kg group, and n = 4 for each of the other groups). Liver total RNA from each fish was reverse transcribed and Cy3-labled and hybridized.
