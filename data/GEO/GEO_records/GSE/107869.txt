TITLE
Sexual Regeneration RNAseq

ORGANISM
Schmidtea mediterranea

SUMMARY
Sexual Schmidtea mediterranea Trunk Regeneration. Sexual biotype Schmidtea mediterranea trunk fragments were sequenced at 0 day, 3 day, 5 day and 7 day post amputation along with whole worm juvenile animals in order identify sexual specific transcripts. Juvenile worms lack sex organs, testes and ovaries present in D0 trunk fragments. Days 3-7 represent time points of degeneration and regeneration of the sexual organs, testes and ovaries.

DESIGN
Day 0 trunk fragments, Day3, Day 5 and Day 7 regenerations and intact juvenile animals

PLATFORM
GPL15553 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Schmidtea mediterranea)
