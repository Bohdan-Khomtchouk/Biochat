TITLE
Interferon-γ response against C. burnetii of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the development of chronic Q fever

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Q fever is caused by the Coxiella burnetii, an intracellular bacterium that infects mononuclear cells. In some individuals, it causes a persistent cardiovascular infection (chronic Q fever). The aim of present study was to investigate the C. burnetii-induced IFN-γ response in chronic Q fever patients. Methods: IFN-γ was measured in supernatants of C. burnetii-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients. Gene-expression profiles of the IFN-γ pathway in PBMCs after incubation with C. burnetii were compared between chronic Q fever patients and control individuals. Results: IFN-γ production by PBMCs of chronic Q fever patients incubated with C. burnetii in vitro, was significantly higher compared to controls. In transcriptome analysis, genes downstream of IFN-γ were strongly upregulated in patients. Conclusion: Present study showed that IFN-γ production and the response to IFN-γ seems to be intact in chronic Q fever patients.

DESIGN
PBMC were purified from Q fever patients (n=6) or healthy volunteers (n=4), and then stimulated by Coxiella burnetii, LPS or left untreated (NS)
