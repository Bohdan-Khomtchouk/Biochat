TITLE
Riboflavin depletion regulates cell proliferation and cell cycle progression‑associated genes in HEK293T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of RNA samples from riboflavin-depleted HEK293T cells. Riboflavin is an essential component of the human diet and its derivative cofactors have an established role in oxidative metabolism. Riboflavin deficiency has been linked with various human diseases. In this study, we have modelled riboflavin deficiency in HEK293T cell line, shown remarkable increase of cell proliferation. The aim of the present study is to develop a cell culture model of riboflavin depletion and analyze its molecular mechanism of acceleration cell proliferation. So, we used Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 to identify genes that were differentially expressed upon riboflavin-depleted HEK293T cells.

DESIGN
Human embryonic kidney SV40 transformed cell line, HEK293T, was grown in culture and treated to riboflavin depletion. Cells sub-cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) or riboflavin-deficient DMEM medium for 25 generations and isolated RNA subjected to microarray analysis. No technical replicates were performed.
