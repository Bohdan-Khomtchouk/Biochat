TITLE
Essential role of EBF1 in B cell immunity by controlling the generation and function of distinct mature B cell types

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor EBF1 is essential for lineage specification in early B cell development. Here we demonstrate by conditional mutagenesis that EBF1 was required for B cell commitment, pro-B cell development and subsequent transition to pre-B cells. Later in B cell development, EBF1 was essential for the generation and maintenance of distinct mature B cell types. Marginal zone and B-1 B cells were lost, whereas follicular and germinal center B cells were reduced in the absence of EBF1. Activation of the B cell receptor resulted in impaired intracellular signaling, proliferation and survival of EBF1-deficient follicular B cells. Immune responses were severely reduced upon Ebf1 inactivation, as germinal centers were formed but not maintained. ChIP- and RNA-sequencing of follicular B cells identified EBF1-activated genes that code for receptors, signal transducers and transcriptional regulators implicated in B cell signaling. Notably, ectopic expression of EBF1 efficiently induced the development of B-1 cells at the expense of conventional B cells. These gain- and loss-of-function analyses uncovered novel important functions of EBF1 in controlling B cell immunity.
