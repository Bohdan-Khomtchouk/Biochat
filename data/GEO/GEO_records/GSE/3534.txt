TITLE
Role of DNA methylation in stable gene repression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The experiment was designed to study the effects of the Dnmt1 gene knockout on gene expression, as well as to analyze the effects of TSA treatment on both WT (p53-/-) and knockout (p53-/-Dnmt1-/-) cells The effect of TSA treatment on knockout and WT cells was  tested at two different time points (24 and 48 hs), as well as two weeks after removal of TSA Keywords: Effect of demetyhlation and/or reacetylation on gene expression

DESIGN
Seven hybridizations were performed: 1. p53-/- untreated (control), 2. p53-/- +TSA  harvested after 24hs of exposure to TSA, 3. p53-/- +TSA 48hs, 4. p53-/-Dnmt1-/- untreated, 5.p53-/-Dnmt1-/- +TSA  24hs 6.p53-/-Dnmt1-/- +TSA 48hs 7.p53-/-Dnmt1-/- two weeks after removal of TSA
