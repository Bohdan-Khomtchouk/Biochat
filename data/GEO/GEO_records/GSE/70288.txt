TITLE
A transcriptome atlas of embryonic skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We co-isolated hair follicle placode and dermal condensate cells along with other specific cell types from E14.5 embryonic mouse skin. With next-generation RNA-sequencing we defined gene expression patterns in the context of the entire embryonic skin.

DESIGN
FACS was used to isolate specific cell types from E14.5 embryonic mouse skin.
