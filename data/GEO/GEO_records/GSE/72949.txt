TITLE
Identification of HS memory-associated genes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify genes associated with the heat stress (HS) memory, transcript profiling using Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays was performed to compare Col-0 seedlings after the priming stimulus with control plants (unprimed).

DESIGN
The experiment was designed to identify genes associated with HS memory. For the priming HS, seedlings were subjected to a heat regime of 1.5 h, 37°C; 1.5 h recovery at 22°C; and 45 min, 44°C. After the priming HS treatment, seedlings were returned to normal growth condition and harvested after 4, 8, 24 and 48 h, respectively.
