TITLE
Identification of rust-induced genes in poplar using Populus 4.6K cDNA macroarray

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa x Populus deltoides

SUMMARY
cDNA macroarray expression profiling was carried out in poplar leaves upon infection with rust in order to identify genes expressed during tree defense response. For this purpose, we inoculated detached leaves of the interamerican hybrid poplar Populus trichocarpa x Populus deltoides 'Beaupré' grown in greenhouse either with spores of avirulent strain 93ID6 (incompatible interaction, I) or spores of virulent strain 98AG31 (compatible interaction, C) of the pathogenic rust fungus Melampsora larici-populina. Besides, we mock-inoculated 'Beaupré' leaves with water (control condition, T). Detached leaves were maintained in vitro in controled conditions to allow fungal infection and colonization of plant tissue. Leaves were sampled at 12, 24 and 48 hours post-inoculation (hpi) in a time-course experiment before (12 hpi) and after (24 and 48 hpi) that the fungus attempt to penetrate plant cells in mesophyll.
