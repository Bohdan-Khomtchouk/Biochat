TITLE
Whole genome transcriptional profile of PyMT/SIRT6 vs PyMT mammary tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the transcriptional profile of mammary tumors spontaneously developed in PyMT transgenic mice either bearing or not additional copies of the endogeneous SIRT6 gene.

DESIGN
We crossed genetically-engineered mice overexpressing functionally competent SIRT6 protein (Sirt6BAC mice) (Anderson et al., 2015) to PyMT mice. PyMT-transgenic females either bearing Sirt6BAC allele or wild-type were sacrified at 12 weeks of age. Mammary tumors spontaneously developd in these mice were excised and subject to micorarray analysis.
