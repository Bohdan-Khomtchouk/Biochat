TITLE
A panel of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines recapitulates the molecular subtypes of the human disease: A model for targeted drug development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA expression patterns of liver cell lines were compared to those of liver tumors to determine the suitability of cell lines as a model for drug development studies.  The cell lines appear to recapitulate liver tumors.

DESIGN
Gene expression of 20 individual liver cell lines relative to a liver cell line reference mix containing equal amounts of 19 liver cell lines.  The expression data was correllated with expression in liver tumors.
