Co-hybridization of Adenovirus type 40 and 41

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Co-hybridization of Adenovirus type 40 and 41 to test probe specificity for closely related viral targets. ATCC strains of Adenovirus type 40 and 41 were hybridized to the array as a control run and a proof of concept. Degree of cross hybridization between polio nucleic acid and non-adenovirus 40 and 41 probes was evaluated. Specificity of the probe design was determined between closely related members of the same virus family. Keywords: control study: target detection and specificity
