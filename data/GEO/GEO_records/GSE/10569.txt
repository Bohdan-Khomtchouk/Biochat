TITLE
Co-hybridization of Adenovirus type 40 and 41

ORGANISM
Human adenovirus 41 ; Human adenovirus 40

SUMMARY
Co-hybridization of Adenovirus type 40 and 41 to test probe specificity for closely related viral targets. ATCC strains of Adenovirus type 40 and 41 were hybridized to the array as a control run and a proof of concept. Degree of cross hybridization between polio nucleic acid and non-adenovirus 40 and 41 probes was evaluated. Specificity of the probe design was determined between closely related members of the same virus family. Keywords: control study: target detection and specificity

DESIGN
2 lab strains of adenovirus (type 40 and 41) were extracted directly from ATCC samples. Viral DNA was was extracted and labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes for Adenovirus type 40 and 41 respectively.
