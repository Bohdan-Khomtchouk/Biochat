TITLE
Gene expression profiling of MYC-amplified medulloblastoma cell lines treated by JQ1, a BET bromodomain inhibitor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MYC-amplified medulloblastomas are highly lethal tumors. BET bromodomain inhibition was recently described to downregulate MYC-associated transcriptional activity in various cancer subtypes. To investigate whether JQ1, a BET bromodomain inhibitor is downregulation MYC and MYC-associated transcriptional activity, we performed global gene expression profiling of five medulloblastomas MYC-amplified patient-derived cell lines treated by JQ1 and the inactive form of JQ1.

DESIGN
Five medulloblastomas patient-derived MYC-amplified cell lines were treated with the active and the inactive form of the drug (JQ1S or JQ1R, respectively, 1Î¼M for 24 hours) followed by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
