TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of rice salt sensitive 1 (rss1) mutant

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
RSS1 is required for maintenance of meristematic activity under salinity conditions in rice. We carried out transcriptome analysis using shoot basal tissues in wild type and rss1-2 grown under non-stress and salt-stress conditions.

DESIGN
WT (-NaCl), WT (+NaCl), rss1-2 (-NaCl), rss1-2 (+NaCl). Three biological replicates.
