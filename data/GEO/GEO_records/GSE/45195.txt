TITLE
Exon arrays from HT-29, MCF10A, and MDA-MB-436 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data from HT-29 cells treated with IFN-Î³ for 24 hr, MCF10A cells, and MDA-MB-436 cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Sense-strand cDNA synthesis, terminal labeling, and hybridization were performed using Ambion WT Expression Kit (Applied Biosystems, P/N 4425209).

PLATFORM
