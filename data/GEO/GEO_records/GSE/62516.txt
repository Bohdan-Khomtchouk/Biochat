TITLE
The RSC Complex localizes to coding sequences to regulate Pol II and histone occupancy (Affymetrix)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers regulate chromatin structure during multiple stages of transcription. We report that RSC, an essential chromatin remodeler, is recruited to the open reading frames (ORFs) of actively transcribed genes genome-wide, suggesting a role for RSC in regulating transcription elongation. Consistent with such a role, Pol II occupancy in the ORFs of weakly transcribed genes is drastically reduced upon depletion of the RSC catalytic subunit Sth1. RSC inactivation also reduced histone H3 occupancy across transcribed regions. Remarkably, the strongest effects on Pol II and H3 occupancy were confined to the genes displaying the greatest RSC ORF enrichment. Additionally, RSC recruitment to the ORF requires the activities of the SAGA and NuA4 HAT complexes and is aided by the activities of the Pol II CTD Ser2 kinases Bur1 and Ctk1. Overall, our findings strongly implicate ORF-associated RSC in governing Pol II function and in maintaining chromatin structure over transcribed regions. In these experiments, we have analyzed Sth1 (catalytic subunit of the RSC chromatin remodeling complex) enrichment to the transcribing genes.

DESIGN
The cells (WT and gcn4Î”) harboring STH1-MYC allele were treated by SM for 20 minutes to induce Gcn4 regulated genes. The chromatin extracts were prepared and subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc antibodies. The ChIP DNA as well the corresponding input DNA were biotinylated and hybridized to the Affymetrix tiling Arrays. Chromatin samples from two different cultures were used in this analysis.
