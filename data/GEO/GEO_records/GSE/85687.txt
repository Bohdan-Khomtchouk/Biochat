TITLE
microRNA profiling of four DLD1 colorectal cancer cell derivatives that recapitulate EMT/MET transitions during metastasis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA profiling of a cellular model of colorectal cancer progression, which is based on four defined derivates of a CRC cell line that resulted from EMT/MET transitions and phenotypically recapitulate the metastatic cascade: epithelial-like primary tumor, mesenchymal-like tumor cells growing in soft agar or as colonospheres, and mouse xenografts of the latter resulting in lung-metastasis comprised of epithelial-state cells.

DESIGN
Colorectal cancer cell line DLD1 and its derivatives were maintained in McCoy`s 5A Medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin.
