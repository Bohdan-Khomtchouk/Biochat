TITLE
LKB1 regulates the transcriptome of immortalized endometrial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
List of differentially-expressed transcripts following LKB1 knockdown with two non-overlapping shRNA constructs.

DESIGN
Immortalized endometrial cells were stably transfected with two non-overlapping shRNA constructs (408-shRNA1, 409-shRNA2) and a non-target reference control (NT).  RNA was harvested from dividing cells and loaded onto the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
