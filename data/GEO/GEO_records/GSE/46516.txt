TITLE
The permanent reduction of TIA proteins molds expression transcriptome in HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study provides, for the first time, TIA1 and TIAR linked-transcriptomic analysis by using RNA-Seq next-generation sequencing technology. Illumina RNA-Seq was used to survey transcriptome profiles from permanent TIA1- and TIAR-(shRNA-mediated) deficient HeLa cells. Analysis of the transcriptomes with the Cufflinks tool revealed that differentially expressed genes, isoforms produced by alternative splicing and/or promoter usage as well as microRNAs generated a great transcriptomic heterogeneity which might reflect the complexity linked to these cell phenotypes. The data of differential expression were validated by using genome-wide microarrays and QPCR analysis. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes term enrichment analysis revealed over-representation of genes associated with cell differentiation, multicellular organismal development, signal transduction, axon guidance and cell adhesion and under-representation of genes associated with positive regulation of migration, cell adhesion, response to organic substance, prostaglandin metabolic process and blood coagulation. Taken together, these results indicate that differential gene expression, alternative pre-mRNA isoforms, promoter usage and microRNA profiling contribute to define the molecular expression phenotypes implied in the progression of proliferative phenotypes associated to the absence of TIA proteins and prioritize candidates for future study.

DESIGN
Each library was run on one RNASeq Multiplex of 76 bp using sequencing from Illumina Genome Analyzer (GAIIx). Three samples were analyzed in this manner, taken from control, TIA1 and TIAR shRNA-depleted HeLa cells.
