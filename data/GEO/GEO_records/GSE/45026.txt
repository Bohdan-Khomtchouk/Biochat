TITLE
MicroRNA Expression of Mouse Cochleae during Aging

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify which miRNAs are involved in the onset and progression of age-related hearing loss in the mammalian cochlea We used miRNA microarrays to screen miRNAs which exhibit the differential expression in the expressing levels during aging of the cochlea

DESIGN
The organ of Corti (OC), one of the major pathological sites of presbycusis in cochlea, was collected separately at 3 timepoints during the life span. Two strains were selected: C57BL/6J and CBA/J. The selected time points were: Postnatal 21 days (P21), 3 month (3m) and 9 month (9m) for C57 mice, and P21, 9m, 16m for CBA mice.
