TITLE
ATM deficiency in the absence of T cells promotes the development of NF-kB-dependent B cell lymphomas [aCGH]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our model removes T cells as targets for lymphomagenesis as well as eliminating T cell-dependent immune surveillance. These mice  exclusively develop early onset IgM+ B cell lymphomas that histologically and genetically resemble the activated B cell-like (ABC) subset of human diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). This dataset includes the array CGH  of B-cell lymphomas (tumors) from ATMKO.CD3eKO mice.

DESIGN
A total of 23 ATMKO.CD3ÎµKO B cell lymphoma cell lines were established from tumor-bearing spleen cells. DNA was extracted and labeled according to manufacturer's protocols. DNA from normal spleens was used as a reference DNA for these experiments.
