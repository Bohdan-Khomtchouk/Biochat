TITLE
Role of Capicua in metabolic system

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CIC is a HMG box-containing transcriptional repressor evolutionarily conserved from C. elegans to human. It's known to associate with various types of cancer but physiological function of CIC remain largely unknown. In this study, we characterized Cic hypomorphic (Cic-L-/-) mice and identified critical roles for of CIC in drug metabolism and bile acid homeostasis.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated liver tissue of Cic-L-/- mouse compared to liver tissue of normal mouse
