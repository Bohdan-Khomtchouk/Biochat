TITLE
Trancriptional comparison of Zbtb32-deficient and -sufficient NP-specific memory B cells at day 7 of recall response [memory B cells]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Memory B cell responses are more rapid and of greater magnitude than are primary antibody responses. The mechanisms by which these secondary responses are eventually attenuated remain unknown. We demonstrate that the transcription factor ZBTB32 limits the rapidity and duration of antibody recall responses. ZBTB32 is highly expressed by mouse and human memory B cells, but not by their naïve counterparts. Zbtb32-/- mice mount normal primary antibody responses to T-dependent antigens. However, Zbtb32-/- memory B cell-mediated recall responses occur more rapidly and persist longer than do control responses. Microarray analyses demonstrate that Zbtb32-/- secondary bone marrow plasma cells display elevated expression of genes that promote cell cycle progression and mitochondrial function relative to wild-type controls. BrdU labeling and adoptive transfer experiments confirm more rapid production and a cell-intrinsic survival advantage of Zbtb32-/- secondary plasma cells relative to wild-type counterparts. ZBTB32 is therefore a novel negative regulator of antibody recall responses.

DESIGN
CD45.2 wild type and Zbtb32-/- splenocytes from NP-CGG-immune donors were transferred into CD45.1 recipients and challenged with NP-CGG. CD45.2 donor NP-specific memory B cells were isolated from the spleen 7 days later. 5-6 biological replicates of each genotype were performed.
