TITLE
SNP array analysis of neuroblastoma tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromosome 1p LOH was seen in one-third of cases. LOH events on chromosomes 11q and 1p were generally accompanied by copy number loss. The one exception was on chromosome 11p, where LOH in all 4 cases was accompanied by normal copy number or diploidy, implying uniparental disomy. Amplification of MYCN was also noted, and also, amplification of a second gene, ALK, in a single case. Keywords: SNP array analysis

DESIGN
We analyzed paired blood and primary tumor samples from 22 children with high-risk neuroblastoma for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and DNA copy number change.
