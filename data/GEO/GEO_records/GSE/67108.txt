TITLE
Genome-wide p53-occupancy in colorectal cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to comprehensively identify genes directly regulated by p53, a genome-wide chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP) followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed after activation of a conditional p53 allele in SW480 cells.

DESIGN
SW480/pRTR-p53-VSV cells were subjected to ChIP-Seq analysis after 16 hours doxycycline-treatment.

PLATFORM
