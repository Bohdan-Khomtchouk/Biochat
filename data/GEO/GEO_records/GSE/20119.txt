TITLE
Interferon signaling related gene expression and clinical outcome of chronic hepatitis C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chronic hepatitis C (CH) frequently developed liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma without suitable treatment. However, peginterferon(IFN) and ribavirin therapy (combination therapy), which is present standard therapy, is imperfect effect because of several side effect. We attempt to catalog IFN related gene expression profile according to the response of combination therapy in to predict the outcome of drug-response before administration and establish the adequate treatment according to the individual clinical information.

DESIGN
Chip1 [GPL9960-related Samples]: We quantified expression profile of 200 IFN related genes by microarray in the liver biopsy specimen from 88 CH patients without history of anti-viral therapy, 10 fatty liver patients without HCV infection and 5 normal livers were also enrolled. Chip2 [GPL9962-related Samples]: We quantified expression profile of 37 IFN related genes by microarray in the liver biopsy specimen from 88 CH patients without history of anti-viral therapy, 10 fatty liver patients without HCV infection and 5 normal livers were also enrolled.
