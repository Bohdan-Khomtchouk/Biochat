TITLE
mRNA Expression Data from Murine Hearts of Pcyt2+/- Male and Female Mice at 8 Months of Age

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hearts were collected from Pcyt2+/- male and female mice at 8 months of age The microarray approach allows the investigation of gene expression changes of all genes in Pcyt2+/- male and female hearts.

DESIGN
There are a total of 8 samples, 4 from Pcyt2+/- males 8 months old and 4 from  Pcyt2+/- females 8 months old.

PLATFORM
GPL17400 [MoGene-2_1-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.1 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
