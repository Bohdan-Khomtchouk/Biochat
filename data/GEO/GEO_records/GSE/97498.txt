TITLE
Comparison of the RNA expression profiles of CD14+ monocytes from human peripheral blood with derived macrophages (MACs) and osteoclasts (OCs) obtained by exposure with M-CSF and M-CSF/RANKL, respectively, during 5 and 20 days

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression profiles of RNA of human CD14+ monocytes were compared with derived macrophages (MACs) and osteoclats (OCs) following M-CSF and M-CSF/RANKL incubation for 5 and 20 days using the SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression Array (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). This platform allows the interrogation of > 36,000 transcrits and variants per sample. The samples were hybridized in the array following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated by standard procedures from CD14+ cells (total monocytes, MOs) corresponding to three sets of samples of monocytes (MOs) and derived MACs and OCs  following incubation with M-CSF or M-CSF/RANKL for 5 and 20 days.

PLATFORM
GPL13607 Agilent-028004 SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
