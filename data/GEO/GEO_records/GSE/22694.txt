TITLE
Copy number profiling of gastric cancer cell lines and gastric tumor tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number profiling of 27 gastric cancer cell lines and 105 gastric tumor tissues. we hypothesized that a detailed fine-scale survey of genomic CNAs might reveal potential genes disrupted by fusion events in gastric cancer. We inferred the locations of likely chromosomal breakpoints by identifying regions where closely-spaced microarray probes exhibited striking transitions in copy number.

DESIGN
27 gastric cancer cell lines and 105 gastric tumor tissues were profiled by Agilent 244K microarray.
