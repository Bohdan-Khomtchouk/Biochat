Microarray Analysis of Murine IEL Subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse small intestine intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) that express a ab TCR and CD8aa homodimers are an enigmatic T cell subset, as their specificity and in vivo function remain to be defined.  To gain insight into the nature of these cells, we performed global gene expression profiling using microarray analysis, combined with PCR and flow cytometry to determine the level of expression of selected genes. Using these methods, TCR ab+ CD8aa IEL were compared to their TCR ab+ CD8b+ and TCR gd+ counterparts. Keywords: Cell type comparison
