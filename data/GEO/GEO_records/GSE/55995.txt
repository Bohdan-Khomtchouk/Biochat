TITLE
Global murine neutrophil response to highly and less virulent influenza A (H3N2) virus infections at 3 and 9 h post-infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Array analysis of total RNA obtained from MPRO neutrophils collected at 3 and 9 h post-infection with highly and less virulent influenza A (H3N2) viruses. Viruses (designated as LVI, HVI and MPI) were derived from influenza strain virus A/Aichi/2/68 (Aichi68). LVI is Aichi68 propagated in eggs, HVI is mouse adapted Aichi68, and MPI is HVI propagated in MDCK.

DESIGN
Infection: lung homogenate (mock), LVI, HVI and MPI; time of sample collection: 3 and 9 h post-infection; two biological replicates for each group.

PLATFORM
