TITLE
WDLPS and DDLPS aCGH case 73

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
these are successive array CGH analyses of a case of retroperitonaeal well-differentiated liposarcoma and its four successive dedifferentiated liposarcoma relapses. We observed differences and similarities between the 5 components

DESIGN
The samples were extracted from fresh or formalin fixed-paraffine embedded fragments and were analysed by arrayCGH with nimblegen CGX or Agilent SureTag method. We compared whole genome profiles.
