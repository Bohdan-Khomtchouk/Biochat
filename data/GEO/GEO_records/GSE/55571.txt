TITLE
DNA methylation analysis during in vitro myogenic differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation has been considered to play an important role in myogenic differentiation. In terminal differentiation of myoblasts, a chronological pattern of DNA methylation changes has been poorly understood. Using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips, we obtained and evaluated the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of human myoblast differentiation in vitro.

DESIGN
DNA methylation profiles of human myoblasts (day1, day3, day8, day15), human mesenchymal stem cells (1 sample) and human skeletal muscle tissues (2 samples) were obtained using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips (Illumina).
