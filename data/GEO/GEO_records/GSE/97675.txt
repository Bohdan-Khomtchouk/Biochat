TITLE
General method for genome-wide mapping of nucleotide excision repair: application to UV and benzo[a]pyrene-induced DNA damage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, is the major cause of lung cancer. It forms covalent DNA adducts after metabolic activation and induces mutations. We have developed a method capturing oligonucleotides carrying bulky base adducts, including UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and BaP diol epoxide-deoxyguanosine (BPDE-dG), which are removed from the genome by nucleotide excision repair. The isolated oligonucleotides are ligated to adaptors and after damage-specific immunoprecipitation the adaptor-ligated oligonucleotides are converted to dsDNA with an appropriate translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymerase followed by PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to generate genome-wide repair maps. This method, which we have named translesion eXcision Repair-sequencing (tXR-seq) does not depend on repair/removal of the damage in the excised oligonucleotides and hence it is applicable to essentially all DNA damages processed by nucleotide excision repair. Here, we present the excision repair maps for CPDs and BPDE-dG adducts generated by tXR-Seq for the human genome. Additionally, we observe novel sequence specificity of BPDE-dG excision repair by using tXR-seq.

DESIGN
We performed tXR-seq for UV-induced CPD and BPDE-dG repair in GM12878 cell line. We also compared our tXR-seq data with our published dataset from XR-seq for CPD and (6-4)PP (GEO accession: GSE67941).
