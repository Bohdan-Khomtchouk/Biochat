TITLE
Whole transcriptome of Lewis lung carcinoma cells of Mus musculus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To study the alteration of whole transcriptome of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells after the decreasing of malignant properties of tumor by treatment of tumor-bearing mice with RNase A. Methods: Whole transcriptome profile of Lewis lung carcinoma before and after RNase A treatment were generated by deep sequencing using SOLiD 5.5. The sequence reads were mapped by Bioscope 1.3 software, differential expression was evaluated by Cufflinks v.2.0.1 package. Results: Difference in expression was found for 966 genes.  Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of alteration of transcriptome of Lewis lung carcinoma after the decrease of malignant prtoperties of the tumor (proliferation and invasion) by RNase A.

DESIGN
Whole transcriptome profile of Lewis lung carcinoma before and after RNase A treatment were generated by deep sequencing using SOLiD 5.5.
