TITLE
Expression data from the Arabidopsis with freezing treatment following the inhibitors of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the roles of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in plant gene network that controls plant tolerance to freezing treatment, we used Affymetrix GeneChips ATH-121501 to analysis. For microarray analysis, Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) seedlings grew in four types of sterile growth medium: no any other modifying agents, added 7g/ml 0.5 M aza-dC in water (DNA methylation inhibitor), added TSA in methanol (histone deacetylation inhibitor), both aza-dC and TSA, all for 16 day in growth chamber (16-h day length at 70% relative humidity, 23 °C) , then all seedlings were cold treated at 0 °C for 24 h in growth chamber (16-h day length at 70% relative humidity). A total of 3305 genes expression were statistically analysized. Our study provides some clues that the transcript levels of some cold-responsive genes regulated by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. This will be valuable for understanding gene regulation by epigenetic modifications under freezing stress.  Keywords: Cold Stress response, DNA methylation, histone deacetylation

DESIGN
Three replicates for aza-dc and TSA treatment, and two replicates for Mock and both aza-dc and TSA treatment. All samples were treated 0°C 24h.
