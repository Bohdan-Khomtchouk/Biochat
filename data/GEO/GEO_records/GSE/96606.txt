TITLE
Microarray expression profiling of mRNAs using RNA extracted from miR-151a-overexpressing and miR-NC overexpressing U87 glioma cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using microarray technology, we aimed to produce a list of genes that are downregulated in miR-151a-overexpressing U87 glioma cells in comparison with these overexpressing miR-NC.

DESIGN
Microarray expression profiling of mRNAs  were conducted using RNA extracted from miR-151a-overexpressing and miR-NC overexpressing U87 glioma cells.

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
