TITLE
Sex-specific gene expression in the mouse heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study cDNA microarrays were used to identify genes with sex-biased expression in mouse whole hearts of two age classes (2 months and 8 months of age). Keywords: cDNA microarray hybridization, sex-specific expression

DESIGN
A total of 24 male and female C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed at two and eight months of age, respectively (n=6 per group). Isolated total RNAs were pooled according to sex and age and hybridized on Agilent cDNA microarrays (age-matched, male vs. female or vice versa). Four technical replicates were carried out with exchanged dye-labelled RNA probes (dye-swap) on two of them.
