TITLE
Comparison of Gene expression pattern between heat-killed M.leprae and live M. leprae-infected peritoneal macrophage in vivo model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our goal is to discriminate specific genes in live M.leprae-infected peritoneal macrophages in comparison to heat-killed M.leprae infected peritoneal macrophages using microarray.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Heat-killed M.leprae infected macrophage vs. Live M.leprae infected macrophage. Biological replicates: 16 mice (control), 8 heat-killed M. leprae mice (sample 1), and 8 live M. leprae infected mice (sample 2). Independently grown and harvested from isolator. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
