TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in partial Dnmt3a deleted colon mucosa cells of APC(Min/+) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in partial Dnmt3a deleted colon mucosa cells of APC(Min/+) mice. In the present study the influence of Dnmt3a deletion on colonic tumorigenesis, gene expression and DNA methylation was analyzed. Results provide important information about the role of Dnmt3a in colonic tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from colonic mucosa cells of APC(Min/+), Dnmt3a(2lox/2lox), Fabp-Cre+ mice (Dnmt3a deletion in 30-50% of mucosa cells) compared to APC(Min/+), Dnmt3a(2lox/2lox), Fabp-Cre- control mice
