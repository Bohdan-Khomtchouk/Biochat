TITLE
FRT thyroid cells: 2D monolayers vs. 3D follicles

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of the Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells comparing polarizing cells grown as a confluent two-dimensional monolayer (2D culture system) with cells grown in matrigel where they acquire a three-dimensional follicular structure (3D culture system).The goal was to identify regulators of 3D epithelial thyroid polarization and follicle formation.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, 3D vs. 2D FRT cell cultures. Biological replicates: 4 for both conditions. A pool of the 2D replicates was compared with each 3D replicate. One dyeswap replicate comparing 2D pool with 3D pool.

PLATFORM
