TITLE
Genome-wide transcription factor binding maps of  glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger 3 (Gli3) in Second Heart Field (SHF) cells disected from Mouse Embryos.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the heart development, the data were generated to examine the genome-wide Gli3 binding  in SHF disected from Mouse Embryos.

DESIGN
Gli3 ChIP-Seq was compared to the input in SHF from mouse embryonic cells at E9.5.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
