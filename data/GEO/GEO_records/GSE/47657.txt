TITLE
Differentially expressed genes by anti tumor treatment in human cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes by anti cancer treatments (microRNAs, siRNAs and chemical compounds) in human cancer, several cell lines (prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma) were subjected to Agilent whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Human cancer cell lines (PC3, DU145, LNCap, A498, 786-O, FaDu and SAS) were treated with miRNAs (miR-145, miR-375, miR-23b, miR-24, miR-27b and miR-29a), siRNAs (si-CAV2, si-LAMB3 and si-GOLM1) and chemical compunds (genistein, wogonin and CXCL10).
