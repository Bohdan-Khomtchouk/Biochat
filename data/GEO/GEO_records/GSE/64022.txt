TITLE
Two contrasting genotypes of Theobroma cacao differ in their transcriptional response and in accumulation of reactive oxygen species in response to treatment with salicylic acid

ORGANISM
Theobroma cacao

SUMMARY
In order to identify variety-specific differences in defense response induction, Scavina 6 (Sca6) and Imperial College Selection 1 (ICS1) cacao plantlets were treated with 2mM SA or water as control and leaves of three developmental stages (A,C, E) were collected. This process was repeated 3 times yielding 32 samples, (Stage E ICS1 and Stage A Sca6 were collected only twice.) Averaging across developmental stages within each genotype, ICS1 had 436 up- and 601 down-regulated genes and Sca6 had 490 up- and 447 down-regulated genes (Benjamini-Hochberg p-value < 0.05). Analysis of gene annotations and Gene Ontology terms revealed that more PR genes and genes associated with defense response were up-regulated in ICS1, the more pathogen-susceptible genotype, while Sca6 had more genes associated with photosynthesis and energy generation.
