TITLE
Breast tumor miRNA profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of miRNA expression profiles in breast tumors clinically annotated for ErbB2, ER, and PR expression, as well as additional parameters. Keywords: Expression profiling of breast tumor biopsies

DESIGN
MicroRNA was extracted from 500 ng of Trizol extracted total RNA from fresh frozen sections of breast tumor biopsies using the mirVana miRNA Isolation kit from Ambion.  10 ng of enriched miRNA was amplified using the SenseAmp Plus protocol for miRNA from Genisphere Inc.  500 ng of amplified miRNA was labeled using the Array900 miRNA RT kit from Genisphere and hybridized to custom miRNA microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL3238 miRNA microarray
