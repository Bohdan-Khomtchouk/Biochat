TITLE
Effect of knock down of LASP-1 on basal-like breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nuclear LASP-1 has a direct correlation with the overall survival of breast cancer patients. Gene expression analysis of MDA-MB-231S (sorted for high surface expression of  CXCR4) and MDA-Bone-Un (Mouse bone metastasized MDA-MB-231 cells) human basal-like breast cancer cells cultured in 3D-Matrigel was performed. Changes in transcript levels of key microRNAs 29B1 and 29B2, miRLet7F1, miR519A1, MMP9, MMP1, FAM75D4, Interferons a7 and a17, Glycine receptor a3, CADM2 and claudin12

DESIGN
Non-silencing (control) and LASP-1 knock down MDA-MB-231-S and MDA-Bone-Un cells were cultured on 3D-Matrigel, total RNA was extracted and analyzed - 1 biological replicate each
