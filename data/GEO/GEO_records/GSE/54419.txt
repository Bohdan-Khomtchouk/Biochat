TITLE
Host transcripts detected in exosomes derived from M.tb infected murine RAW264.7 macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation to study mRNA transcripts present in exosomes from M.tb infected cells and how they compare to those derived from uninfected cells. Transcripts were also studied in donor macrophages as controls The gene expression study identified unique transcripts as well as differentially expressed transcripts present in exosomes released from infected macrophages

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from exosomes or donor macrophages was converted to cDNA, labeled and hybridized onto whole mouse genome arrays from Nimblegen MM8_60mer_expr.ndf. Four sample each with three experimental replicates were included in the study.
