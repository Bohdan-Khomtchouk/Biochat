TITLE
Chromium stress response in rice roots: effects on transcriptome proﬁles and signalling pathways responsive

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Chromium (Cr) is an important environmental contaminant and also a genotoxic metal ion at high concentration, but its molecular mechanisms and signalling pathways of action in plants is still poorly unraveled. To help characterize the mechanism of molecular and signalling of rice, we present the large-scale, transcriptomic analysis of rice root responses to Cr(VI). We examined the possible involvement of reactive of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium in Cr(VI) signaling transduction pathways, as well as the effect of Cr (VI) on CDPK and MAPK activity. Specially, we used the microarray assay to assess different stage Cr (VI) induced alteration in rice gene expression. This gene discovery effort will help expand our understanding of cellular responses to Cr (VI) treatment, and will identify candidate genes for enhancement of Cr resistance in crop.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, short exposures and long exposures. Comparison of mock control and rice seedlings treated with 50 μM Cr(VI) during short (pooled from 1- and 3-h treatments), as compared to long (24 h) exposures.; Biological replicates: 3 control replicates (short and long exposures), 3 Cr(VI)-treated replicates (short and long exposures).
