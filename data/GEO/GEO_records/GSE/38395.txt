TITLE
ChIP-Seq for NIPBL for SMC1 in human lymphoblastoid cells (hLCLs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gene expression program is regulated by a cell-type specific chromosome architecture. The connection between enhancer and promoter regions is dependent on a protein complex containing Nipbl, Mediator and Cohesin. To gain insights into the chromosome architecture of human differentiated cells, we profiled NIPBL and SMC1 in lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs).

DESIGN
DNA was enriched from hLCLs and chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIPs) were analyzed by Solexa sequencing. ChIPs were performed using an antibody against NIPBL and SMC1. Whole cell extract is provided for background.
