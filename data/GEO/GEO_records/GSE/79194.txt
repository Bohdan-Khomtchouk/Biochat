TITLE
Expression data from murine GVH-SSc skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine GVH-SSc dorsal scapular skin samples were analyzed to determine the effect of IFNAR-1 inhibition on gene expression at day 14 and day 28.   Gene expression in GVH-SSc skin from mice treated with a neutralizing IFNAR-1 antibody was compared to that in  GVH-SSc skin from mice treated with isotype IgG, with skin from syngeneic graft controls as reference.

DESIGN
For each timepoint, the following samples were analyzed: syngeneic control (n=4); GVH-SSc isotype (n=4); GVH-SSc anti-IFNAR-1 (n=4)
