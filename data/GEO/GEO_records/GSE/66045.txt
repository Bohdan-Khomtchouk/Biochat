TITLE
Expression analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 fatty acid synthesase II (FASII) deletions complemented by excess or limited expression of FASII genes accD, fabG, and fabF1

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 regulated complemented FASII deletions, compared under conditions of excess and limited expression of the complementing copies.  The mutations engineered into this strain render it dependent on lac-regulated expression of the complementing gene copies on the extrachromosomal plasmid pUCP24. The mutants analyzed in this study are further described in Wallace et al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, vol 9, 2015

DESIGN
A twelve chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa regualted complemented FASII gene deletions under excess IPTG (high level expression of complementing gene copy) and three separate cultures under limited IPTG (low level expression of complementing gene copy).  Each chip measures the expression level of 5,553 genes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1-LAC (ATCC47085)  with fourteen 24-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with probes on the array five times.  Two biological replicates were done for each sample for a total of 12 chips.
