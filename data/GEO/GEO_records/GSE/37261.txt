TITLE
Tracing the conversion process for primordial germ cells to pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The overall gene expression profiles revealed by this system provide novel insight into how pluripotency is acquired in germ-committed cells.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, we employed FACS sorting to purify pluripotent candidate cells during the culture period
