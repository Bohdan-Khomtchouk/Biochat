TITLE
5-aza-2'-cytidine and trichostatin A effect to gene expression of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of 5-aza-2'-cytidine and trichostatin A effect to gene expression of human LCLs. LCLs estabulished from patients with genetic dissease are commonly used for mRNA or protein analysis of disease related genes.  However, ofen times the gene of interset is not expressed in LCL. Epigenetic modification could be overcome this problem.

DESIGN
Expression array study with total RNA extracted from normal male derived LCLs with eight 60-mer probe per gene. 47633 exemplar genes representing a total of 63780 transcripts variants.

PLATFORM
GPL15143 NimbleGen Human Expression Array [2006-08-03_HG18_60mer_expr]
