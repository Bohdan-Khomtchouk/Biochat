TITLE
Dark and light - Analysis of the effect of NAD concentration on the transcriptome

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs08-02_nad. Dark and light. Establish which transcripts are affected by changes in NAD concentration, and whether this depends on light/dark. Three genotypes: Two lines of Arabidopsis transformed to overexpress QPRT, an enzyme involved in NAD synthesis (NadC4.11 and NadC15.3) and a third control line transformed with an empty vector (162). Leaf discs from the two lines of the QPRT+ plants were incubated with quinolinate, the QPRT substrate, to boost leaf NAD. Discs from the empty vector control were incubated on a buffer withour quinolinate. The experiment was performed in the light and the dark. The aim is to compare the QPRT+ quinolinate samples with the empty vector samples, both for the sample series generated in the light and that generated in the dark. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
