TITLE
Dissecting the rice genes responsible for long time changes of nitrogen supply forms and nitrogen starvation

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
In comparison with provision of either ammonium or nitrate alone, simultaneously supplying both forms of N results in superior growth and yield for the majority of plants including rice. Using a rice 22K oligo-array, we performed transcriptome analysis to identify genes of rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) responsive to change of N-supply forms and N-starvation. Using the supply of ammonium nitrate (one to one molar ratio) as control, the total number of root genes that were equal or more than two fold up- or down- regulated was 445, 324, and 781 by upon supply of either ammonium or nitrate or continuous N starvation, respectively for 96 h. In the shoot the equivalent numbers were much smaller only 32, 58, and 165, respectively. Clustering of the rice genes associated with different environmental stresses revealed substantial organ specificity of the root and shoot to N starvation, and also to the N supply form. Genes encoding transporters for ammonium and nitrate, nitrate reductase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and aspartate amino transferase, showed great response to change of the N supply form, especially to N starvation. Some of the genes involved in chlorophyll metabolism, carbon fixation and assimilation, were enhanced by ammonium supply only, but significantly suppressed by N-starvation. In the shoot there was increased expression of more general stress genes under nitrate when compared to ammonium nutrition. In the root the reverse situation was true with more apparent stress under ammonium nutrition. The microarray approach has revealed new levels of complexity in the response of rice to the form of N supply.
