TITLE
The gene expression pattern of mice fed the resveratrol-enriched rice DJ526 was very different from mice fed either resveratrol or Dongjin rice alone

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The gene expression profiling analyses by DNA chip showed that the gene expression pattern of mice fed resveratrol-enriched rice DJ526 was very different from mice fed either resveratrol or Dongjin rice alone, respectively, modifying expression of genes related to aging regulation, cell differentiation, extracellular matrix, neurogenesis, or secretion.

DESIGN
(1) Ctrl (The control mice fed a NFD in which the carbohydrate source was corn starch and sucrose), (2) RS (resveratrol mice fed a NFD in which the carbohydrate source was corn starch and sucrose except containing resveratrol), (3) DJ (Dongjin mice fed a NFD in which the corn starch and sucrose were replaced with Dongjin rice), and (4) DJ526 (DJ526 mice fed a NFD in which the corn starch and sucrose were replaced with the resveratrol-enriched rice DJ526)

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
