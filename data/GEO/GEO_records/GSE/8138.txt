TITLE
A transcript profile of Medicago truncatula 2HA tissue culture with auxin treatment

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
Leaf explants of the superembryogenic Medicago truncatula line 2HA were treated with auxin (1-naphthaleneacetic acid) for one week to induce the formation of roots (Imin et al J Exp Bot 58:439-451). Gene expression in the leaves and the NAA treated tissue cultures was compared to identify transcripts expressed during the commitment to root formation in tissue culture. We have used the Affymetrix Medicago Genome Array GeneChip to compared gene expression in Medicago truncatula leaves and leaf explants that have been cultured for one week on NAA, to identify genes expressed during the commitment to root formation in tissue culture. Keywords: Cell type comparison

DESIGN
Medicago truncatula 2HA leaves and leaf explants treated with NAA for one week were collected; total RNA was extracted and used for hybridization to Affymetrix arrays

PLATFORM
GPL4652 [Medicago] Affymetrix Medicago Genome Array
