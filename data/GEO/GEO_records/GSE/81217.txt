TITLE
Gene expression data from MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells treated with prolactin and/or bufexamac

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The hormone prolactin is implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, and a subset of prolactin-induced gene expression is mediated by HDAC6 activity. The NSAID, bufexamac, is a fairly specific inhibitor of HDAC6 and HDAC10. We used bufexamac in combination with prolactin treatment in MCF7 cells to determine differential expression under these conditions.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were serum starved for 24 hours prior to treatment with bufexamac and/or prolactin, and subsequent RNA extraction.
