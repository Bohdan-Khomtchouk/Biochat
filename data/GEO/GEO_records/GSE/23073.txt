TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of genes regulated by RXR and its partners in monocyte-derived dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD14+ human monocytes differentiating into DCs in the presence of IL4 and GM-CSF were treated with agonists for RXR and its partners or vehicle 18 hours after plating (experiment with RXR and permissive partners, donor 1-3) or 14 hours after plating (experiment with nonpermissive partners, donor 4-6). Cells were harvested 12 hours thereafter. Experiments were performed in biological triplicates representing samples from three different donors.  In this study all probable RXR-signaling pathways induced by agonists for RXR, LXRs, PPARs, RAR and VDR were identified in differentiating human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.

DESIGN
In the experiments, differentiating dendritic cells were treated for 12 hours with one of the following compounds (ligands): vehicle (DMS:EtOH 1:1) LG268 (RXR agonist) 9-cis retinoic acid (9cisRA, agonist of RAR and RXR) GW3965 (LXRalpha/beta panagonist) rosiglitazone (RSG, PPARgamma agonist)  GW1516 (PPARdelta agonist) AM580 (RARalpha agonist) 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VDR agonist)
