TITLE
To integrated functional genomics and craniofacial morphogenesis with in FaceBase Consortium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Congenital malformations in facial bones significantly impact the overall representation of face. Establishing a correlations between gene expression and morphogenesis of craniofacial structures may lead to new discoveries of molecular mechanisms of craniofacial development. Thus in the present investiation we will generate gene expression profile of different facial bones at different time intrevals over a period of 5 years to establish their roles in regulating craniofacial development

DESIGN
To perform global gene expression profiling analysis of mandible and maxilla development and integrate these datasets with cell lineage and quantitative 3D dynamic imaging analyses. In collaboration with the ontology group within the FaceBase consortium, we will define anatomical landmarks and morphometric parameters of the developing mandible and maxilla.
