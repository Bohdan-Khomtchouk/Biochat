TITLE
B-myb is Essential Regulator of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Myeloid Progenitor Cell Development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The B-myb (MYBL2) gene is a member of the MYB family of transcription factors and is involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA replication and maintenance of genomic integrity. However, its function during adult development and hematopoiesis is unknown. We show here that conditional inactivation of B-myb in vivo results in depletion of the HSC pool, leading to profound reductions in mature lymphoid, erythroid and myeloid cells. This defect is autonomous to the bone marrow and is first evident in the HSCs, which accumulate in the S and G2/M phases. B-myb inactivation also causes defects in the myeloid progenitor compartment and results in an accumulation of GMPs. Microarray studies indicate that B-myb null LKS+ cells differentially express genes that direct myeloid lineage development and commitment, suggesting that B-myb is a key player in controlling cell fate. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that B-myb is essential for HSC and progenitor maintenance and survival during hematopoiesis. Total RNA was isolated from FACS purified LKS+ cells isolated from pIpC-treated control and B-myb floxed-MxCre mice.

DESIGN
Each sample is derived from a pool of 3-5 mice. 2 samples were analyzed for each genotype.
