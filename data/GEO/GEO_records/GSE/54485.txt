TITLE
Comparison between GT and ntcA-overexpressing strains of cyanobacteria [nitrogen-replete conditions]

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
NtcA regulates primary in a unicelluar cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. We constructed an ntcA-overexpressing strain, named NOX10, by introducing the ntcA genes fusing psbAII promoter by homologous recombination. The transcript profiles of parental wild-type strain GT and NOX10 were compared by microarray CyanoChip (Takrara bio.). Experiments were performed three times with biologically independent RNA.

DESIGN
Total RNAs from three independent wild-type (GT) and three independent ntcA-overexpressing strains were differently labeled by Cy3 or Cy5, followed by hybridization on CyanoChip.

PLATFORM
GPL13193 CyanoChip Ver.1.6 (Takara bio.)
