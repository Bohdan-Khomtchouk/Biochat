TITLE
shld1 effect on 3T3 cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NIH3T3 cells were cultured in medium containing 1 uM, 100 nM, 10 nM and 0 nM (serve as control) shld1  for 24 hours. Three independent cultures were obtained for each drug concentration.  Total RNA from experimental samples were extracted using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Mouse RNA pooled from 11 cell lines (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as reference. Cy5-dUTP and Cy3-dUTP, were used to label the experimental cDNA and the reference samples, respectively, and hybridized to the Mouse Exonic Evidence Based Oligonucleotide (MEEBO) arrays ( ). The hybridizations were performed by Stanford Functional Genome Facility using its standard protocol (Oligo Array Hybridization protocol, ). A compound treatment design type is where the response to administration of a compound or chemical (including biological compounds such as hormones) is assayed. Keywords: compound_treatment_design
