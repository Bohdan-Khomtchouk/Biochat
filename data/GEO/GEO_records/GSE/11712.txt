TITLE
Gene expression level of six rice lineages

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Towards understanding gene expression variation among related rice lineages on a genome-wide scale, we sought to assess global gene expression in the heading-stage panicle using a whole genome oligonucleotide microarray designed to represent 36,926 annotated indica genes.

DESIGN
Using a loop-design, we interrogated gene expression patterns in six related rice lineages, including O. sativa (two Asian cultivars indica and japonica), O. nivara (Asian annual wild rice), O. rufipogon (Asian perennial wild rice) and O. glaberrima (African cultivated rice).
