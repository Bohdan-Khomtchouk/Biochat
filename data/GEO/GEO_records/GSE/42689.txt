TITLE
mek-1 and mlk-1 in fed or fasted condition

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Intermittent fasting is one of the most effective dietary restriction regimens that extend life-span in C. elegans and mammals. Fasting-stimulus responses are key to the longevity response; however, the mechanisms that sense and transduce fasting-stimulus have remained largely unknown. Through a comprehensive transcriptome analysis in C. elegans, we have found that along with the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, AP-1 (JUN-1/FOS-1) plays a central role in fasting-induced transcriptional changes. KGB-1, one of the C. elegans JNKs, acted as an activator of AP-1, and was activated in response to fasting. KGB-1 and AP-1 were involved in intermittent fasting-induced longevity. Fasting-induced upregulation of the components of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex via AP-1 and DAF-16 enhanced protein ubiquitination, and reduced protein carbonylation. Our results have thus identified a fasting-responsive KGB-1/AP-1 signaling pathway, which, together with DAF-16, causes transcriptional changes that mediate longevity partly through regulating proteostasis.

DESIGN
We synchronized mek-1 and mlk-1 mutants and collected them at 2 day adult, and move them to the new plate with (Fed) or without food (Fasting). Two days later, we collected moved animals and extracted total RNA and subject them to microarray.
