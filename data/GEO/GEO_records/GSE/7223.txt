TITLE
Genes regulated by the processed form of AIbZIP/CREB3L4 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Androgen-induced bZIP (AIbZIP) is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that is encoded by the CREB3L4 (cAMP responsive element binding protein 3-like 4) gene. In humans, AIbZIP mRNA is most abundant in the prostate but it is also present, albeit at much lower levels, in the pancreas and other tissues. The full-length AIbZIP protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and the available data suggest that AIbZIP is processed to its transcriptionally active form by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). To define the transcriptional programme that is initiated by AIbZIP, we generated LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines that conditionally express the processed form of AIbZIP. The recombinant protein consists of the first 290 amino acids of AIbZIP fused to a C-terminal HA epitope. Conditional expression was achieved using the RheoSwitch expression system. Clone number 7-11 was exposed to the inducing agent (RSL1) for 6 and 24 hr and Affymetrix microarrays were used to identify AIbZIP-regulated transcripts. Candidate genes were identified by comparing the probe set intensities of RSL1-treated cells and control cells (cells exposed to vehicle). Forty-eight genes were then validated by Northern blot analysis. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Clone 7-11 cells (passage 42) were plated in 24 10-cm culture dishes. Sixteen dishes were cultured in medium containing RSL1 (500 nM) and eight dishes were cultured in medium containing an equivalent amount of the RSL1 vehicle (DMSO). Eight RSL1-treated dishes were harvested 6 hr after addition of RSL1 and another eight dishes were harvested 24 hr after addition of RSL1. At each time point, the dishes were pooled two by two to yield a total of 12 individual samples i.e. 4 controls, 4 exposed to RSL1 for 6 hr, and 4 exposed to RSL1 for 24 hr. One sample of each group was processed to nuclear extracts to assess the levels of recombinant AIbZIP by immunoblotting. The three other samples of each group were processed separately to cRNA probes which were then hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays (Batch nos. 4003850 and 4003847).
