Genes regulated by the processed form of AIbZIP/CREB3L4 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells

SUMMARY
Androgen-induced bZIP (AIbZIP) is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that is encoded by the CREB3L4 (cAMP responsive element binding protein 3-like 4) gene. In humans, AIbZIP mRNA is most abundant in the prostate but it is also present, albeit at much lower levels, in the pancreas and other tissues. The full-length AIbZIP protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and the available data suggest that AIbZIP is processed to its transcriptionally active form by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). To define the transcriptional programme that is initiated by AIbZIP, we generated LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines that conditionally express the processed form of AIbZIP. The recombinant protein consists of the first 290 amino acids of AIbZIP fused to a C-terminal HA epitope. Conditional expression was achieved using the RheoSwitch expression system. Clone number 7-11 was exposed to the inducing agent (RSL1) for 6 and 24 hr and Affymetrix microarrays were used to identify AIbZIP-regulated transcripts. Candidate genes were identified by comparing the probe set intensities of RSL1-treated cells and control cells (cells exposed to vehicle). Forty-eight genes were then validated by Northern blot analysis. Keywords: time course
