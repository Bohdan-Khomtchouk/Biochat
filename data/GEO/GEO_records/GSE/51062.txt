TITLE
Expression data from human GBMs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of human glioblastoma multiforme tumors revealed genes that are upregulated in tumors expressing EGFRvIII compared to those expressing wild-type EGFR

DESIGN
We examined gene expression in 52 primary GBM tumors, which were stratified based on the presence or absence of EGFRvIII expression using EGFRvIII-specific RT-PCR (Tykocinski et al., 2012).  The extracted RNA samples from these tumors were subjected to microarray analysis using HG-U133 2.0 Plus Affymetrix gene chips.  Average expression of all transcripts were compared between EGFRvIII-positive and -negative GBMs.
