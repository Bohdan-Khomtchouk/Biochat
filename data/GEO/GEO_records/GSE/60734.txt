TITLE
DNA methylation analysis of the U937 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation profiling of gene promoters in the human myeloid cell line U937.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from wildtype U937 cells was hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip to determine the methylation pattern of the U937 cell line.

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
