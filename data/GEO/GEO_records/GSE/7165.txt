TITLE
Time course of the mRNA expression in wild-type Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain grown on a rich medium (labeling:ENZO)

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of wild-type Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain grown in a rich (TT) medium at 70oC. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Three wild-type T. thermophilus HB8 strains were pre-cultured at 70oC for 16 h in 3 ml of TT medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH.  The cells (2 ml) were inoculated into 1 liter of the same medium and then cultivated at 70oC.  Cells were collected after 180, 240, 300, 360, 420, 480, 540, 600, 680, and 760 min, and then crude RNA was extracted.  The expression of each mRNA at each time point was analyzed on a GeneChip as described under Sample Description Sheet of each sample in this website.
