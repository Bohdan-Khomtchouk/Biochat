TITLE
Gene expression of Streptomyces turgidiscabies pathogenicity island

ORGANISM
Streptomyces turgidiscabies

SUMMARY
Gene expression in Streptomyces turgidiscabies pathogenicity island was studied after transferring cells into thaxtomin A inducing medium OBB using Agilent 60mer oligonucleotide array with probes designed for S.scabies and S.turgidiscabies. Gene expression study was used to confirm results of gene prediction.

DESIGN
Time course gene expression experiment with two replicates

PLATFORM
GPL9345 Potato bacteria 19586 pathogenicity island array
