TITLE
Gene expression of Streptomyces turgidiscabies pathogenicity island

ORGANISM
Streptomyces scabiei

SUMMARY
Gene expression in Streptomyces turgidiscabies pathogenicity island was studied after transferring cells into thaxtomin A inducing medium OBB using Agilent 60mer oligonucleotide array with probes designed for S.scabies and S.turgidiscabies. Gene expression study was used to confirm results of gene prediction.
