TITLE
NR4A orphan nuclear receptor family members, NR4A2 and NR4A3, regulate neutrophil number and survival

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Defects in neutrophil number and survival are common to both hematologic disorders and chronic inflammatory diseases. At sites of inflammation, neutrophils respond to multiple signals that activate protein kinase A (PKA) signalling, which positively regulates neutrophil survival. We aimed to study the transcriptional responses to several stimuli in human neutrophils. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes, which pointing to a key role of NR4A receptors in regulation of neutrophil lifespan and homeostasis.

DESIGN
Homo sapiens neutrophil total RNA extracts were produced after 4h incubation in each specific treatment (i.e. GMCSF, hypoxia,  TLR4 agonist, PKA agonist and negative control LPS media, from the latter we also collected supernatant). These were converted to cDNA and cDNA from 5 donors was pooled prior hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.
