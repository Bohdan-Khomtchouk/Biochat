TITLE
Inhibition of DNA methylation promotes breast tumor sensitivity to netrin-1 interference [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Results provide the animal proof of concept that inhibition of DNA methylation can sensitize solid tumors to antibodies mediating tumor cell apoptosis.

DESIGN
RNAseq of untreated cells, or DAC treated HMLER and MDA-MB-231 cells.

PLATFORM
