TITLE
The S. cerevisiae histone demethylase Jhd1 fine-tunes the distribution of H3K36me2

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Histone methylation plays important roles in the regulation of chromatin dynamics and transcription. Steady state levels of histone lysine methylation are regulated by a balance between enzymes that catalyze either the addition or removal of methyl groups. Using an activity-based biochemical approach, we recently uncovered the JmjC domain as an evolutionarily conserved signature motif for histone demethylases. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Jhd1, a JmjC domain-containing protein in S. cerevisiae, is an H3K36-specific demethylase. Here we report further characterization of Jhd1. Similar to its mammalian homolog, Jhd1-catalyzed histone demethylation requires iron and alpha-ketoglutarate as cofactors. Mutation and deletion studies indicate that the JmjC domain and adjacent sequences are critical for Jhd1 enzymatic activity, while the N-terminal PHD domain is dispensable. Overexpression of JHD1 results in a global reduction of H3K36 methylation in vivo. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled microarray (ChIP-chip) studies reveal subtle changes in the distribution of H3K36me2 upon overexpression or deletion of JHD1. Our studies establish Jhd1 as a histone demethylase in budding yeast and suggest that Jhd1 functions to maintain the fidelity of histone methylation patterns along transcription units. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
H3K36me2 ChIPs were performed on wild type, jhd1 knockout, and JHD1 overexpression yeast strains.
