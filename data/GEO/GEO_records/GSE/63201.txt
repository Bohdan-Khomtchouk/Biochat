TITLE
Identification of genes suppressed by miR-483-5p and miR-551a in a colon cancer cell-line (study 2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-483-5p and miR-551a were over-expressed in a colon cancer cell-line LvM3b to identify genes that are down-regulated by the miRNAs over-expression.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from miR-483-5p or miR-551a over-expressing LvM3b cells as well as control LvM3b cells.
