TITLE
Gene expression profiling in wild type and In(3LR)sep larval brain tissue (Drosophila)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We performed a series of microarray expression profile experiments in central brain tissue from 3rd instar larvae, interrogating expression differences between wild type and In(3LR)sep strains. Since our 4C data ( ), demonstrated dramatic changes in nuclear organization of PcG target genes residing on In(3LR)sep. Keywords: mRNA expression profiling by oligonucleotide arrays

DESIGN
Changes in mRNA expression were recorded on oligonucleotide arrays representing the transcribed genome. Replicate experiments were performed including dye swaps.
