TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human gastric tissues at different pathological stages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gastric cancer is characterized by prolonged, well-defined precancerous stages. In our study, we performed the whole genome gene expression mircroarray of 22 gastric tissues at different pathological stages. We aim to find genes that closely related to the changes of TCR repertoire during gastric carcinogenesis. By integrative analysis of the microarray data and TCR variation degrees, we identified a 11-gene module that can predict the overall survival of gastric cancer patients.

DESIGN
A total of 22 gastroscopic biopsy tissue samples from 19 patients were profiled by Agilent SurePrint G3 Human GE  8x60K Microarray .
