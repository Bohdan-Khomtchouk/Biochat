TITLE
Alternative splicing in genes encoding adhesion- and motility-related proteins in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, combining 1) RNA-Sequencing on MCF-7 cell line, 2) a new computational approach to identify splice isoforms and 3) an extensive experimental validation (in vitro - on MCF-10, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 – and ex vivo – on human breast cancer tissues) we investigated simultaneously gene expression and alternative splicing in genes encoding for adhesion and motility-related molecules-, including Semaphorins and their receptors and co-receptors.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiles of MCF7 cell line were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Hi-Seq Illumina

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
