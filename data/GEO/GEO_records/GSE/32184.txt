TITLE
MIWI catalysis is required for piRNA amplification-independent LINE1 transposon silencing [deep sequencing]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we show that MIWI is a small RNA-guided ribonuclease (Slicer) that requires extensive complementarity for target cleavage in vitro. Disruption of its catalytic activity in mice by a single point mutation results in male infertility and displays increased accumulation of LINE1 transposon transcripts.

DESIGN
MIWI-associated piRNAs from different genotypes were sequenced. Total RNA from purified round spermatids were subjected to Ribozero purification and strand-specific RNAseq lib prepared. Global 5' RACE library was prepare from indicated genotypes.
