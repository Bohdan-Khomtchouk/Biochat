TITLE
Expression data from glioblastoma tissue and matched adjacent normal tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary malignancy of the central nervous system in adult. In order to improve the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of GBM, the details of molecular mechanisms underlying the tumorigenesis and development needs to be clarified. This is a nalysis of glioblastoma tissues and matched adjacent normal brain tissues from 3 patients. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the non-coding and coding genes interactions in glioblastoma. 3 human GBM tissues and the matched adjacent normal brain tissues were analyzed using microarray. The aberrant lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs between the 2 groups were detected.

DESIGN
A total of 3 GBM tissues and the matched adjacent normal brain tissues were obtained for RNA extraction and hybridization from patients who underwent primary surgical treatment according to clinical protocols. No chemotherapy or radiotherapy was performed on the patients before therapeutic resection. All cases were reviewed by two neuropathologist for confirming the diagnosis of GBM as per 2007 World Health Organization criteria. We sought to obtain the aberrant lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs between tissues and the matched adjacent normal brain tissues.
