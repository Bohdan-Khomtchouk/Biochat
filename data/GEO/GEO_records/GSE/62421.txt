TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Bacillus subtilis OKB105 in response to rice seedlings

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are soil beneficial microorganisms that colonize plant roots for nutritional purposes and accordingly benefit plants by increasing plant growth or reducing disease. But it still remains unclear which mechanisms or pathways are involved in the interactions between PGPR and plants. To understand the complex plant-PGPR interactions, the changes in the transcriptome of typical PGPR standard Bacillus subtilis in responding to rice seedlings were analyzed.

DESIGN
We compared and anylyzed the transcriptome changes of the bacteria Bacillus subtilis OKB105 in response to rice seedings for 2 h.  Total RNA was extracted and Random priming cDNA synthesis, cDNA fragmentation and terminal labeling with biotinylated GeneChip DNA labeling reagent, and hybridization to the Affymetrix GeneChip Bacillus subtilis Genome Array.
