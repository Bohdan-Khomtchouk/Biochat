TITLE
Expression in myocardial tissues of Great Dane dogs with cardiomyopathy

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Oligonucleotide microarray analysis of left ventricular tissues from 3 Great dane dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy and 3 control dogs was performed.  Three hundred and twenty three differentially expressed transcripts were detected.  The transcript demonstrating the highest degree of upregulation was FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) and the transcript with the greatest amount of down regulation was triadin.  Both of these transcripts are critical to proper functioning of the cardiac ryanodine receptor.  Abnormalities of both calstabin2 and triadin have been reported in humans with heart disease.  Further investigation into the role of calstabin2 and triadin in canine cardiomyopathy is warranted, and the canine disease may serve as a model of human disease. Keywords: control vs diseased

DESIGN
