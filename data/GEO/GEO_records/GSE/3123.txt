TITLE
RNase G complementation of rne null mutation identifies functional interrelationships with RNase E

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The Escherichia coli endoribonucleases RNase E (Rne) and RNase G (Rng) have sequence similarity and broadly similar sequence specificity. Whereas the absence of Rne normally is lethal, we show here that E. coli bacteria that lack the rne gene can be made viable by overexpression of Rng. Rng-complemented cells accumulated precursors of 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the RNA component of RNase P (i.e. M1 RNA), indicating that normal processing of these Rne-cleaved RNAs was not restored by RNase G; additionally, neither 5S rRNA nor M1 RNA was generated from precursors by RNase G cleavage in vitro. Using DNA microarrays containing 4405 Escherichia coli open reading frames (ORFs), we identified mRNAs whose steady-state level was affected by Rne, Rng or the N-terminal catalytic domain of RNase E. Most transcript species affected by RNase E deficiency were also elevated in an rne deletion mutant complemented by Rng. However, approximately 100 mRNAs that accumulated in Rne-deficient cells were decreased by rng-complemention, thus identifying targets whose processing or degradation may be the basis for RNase E essentiality. Remarkably prominent in this group were mRNAs implicated in energy-generating pathways or in the synthesis or degradation of macromolecules.
