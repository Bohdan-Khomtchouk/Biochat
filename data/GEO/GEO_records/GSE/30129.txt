TITLE
AIRE-deficient CD8+CD28low regulatory T lymphocytes fail to control experimental colitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor AutoImmune REgulator (AIRE) are responsible for the ‘Autoimmune PolyEndocrinopathy Candidiasis Ecodermal Dystrophy’ syndrome. AIRE directs expression of tissue restricted antigens in the thymic medulla and in lymph node stromal cells and thereby substantially contributes to induction of immunological tolerance to self-antigens. Data from experimental mouse models showed that AIRE-deficiency leads to impaired deletion of autospecific T cell precursors. However, a potential role for AIRE in the function of regulatory T cell populations, which are known to play a central role in prevention of immunopathology, has remained elusive. Regulatory T cells of CD8+CD28low phenotype efficiently control immune responses in experimental autoimmune and colitis models in mice. We here show that CD8+CD28low Treg from AIRE-deficient mice are transcriptionally and phenotypically normal, exert efficient suppression of in vitro immune responses, but completely fail to prevent experimental colitis in vivo. Our data therefore demonstrate that AIRE plays an important role in the in vivo function of a naturally occurring regulatory T cell population.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from CD8+CD28low regulatory T lymphocytes isolated from wildtype and Aire-deficient C57BL/6 mice for comparison of gene expression profiles.
