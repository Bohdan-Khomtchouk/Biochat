TITLE
Expression data from ALL diagnosis and relapse pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There is a distinct signature of differentially expressed probes from diagnosis to relapse

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of pediatric patients with B-precursor ALL were compared to at 2 time points, diagnosis and relapse. The overall design was a comparison of gene expression at diagnosis and relapse within individual patients.  A subset analysis (comparing diagnosis to relapse expression within individuals), was done for early relapse (less than 36 months) cases only and late relapse (greater than 36 months) cases only.
