TITLE
Genome wide expression analysis of FVB/N Cd151-/- glomeruli

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of glomerular gene expression levels was performed in 3- to 4-week-old FVB/N Cd151-/-  mice and wild type controls. Identification of the  glomerular gene expression profile at this early stage of disease progression in FVB/N Cd151-/- mice provides insight into the molecular mechanisms associated with glomerular disease development, including thickening and splitting of the glomerular basement membrane

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from glomeruli isolated from 3-week-old Cd151-/- mice ( 4 mice) and compared to Cd151+/+ controls (4 mice) generated on the FVB/N genetic backgrounds

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
