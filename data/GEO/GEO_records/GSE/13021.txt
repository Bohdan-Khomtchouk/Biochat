TITLE
Copy number analysis of human glioblastoma multiforme

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number analysis of human GBM samples were performed, and a high frequency of deletions of the PTPRD gene on chromosome 9p23-24.1 were identified. Keywords: SNP microarray, glioblastoma multiforme, copy number, amplification, deletion

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from 58 GBM tumor samples were hybridized to Affymetrix 250K NspI Gene Chip Arrays and analyzed by dChip using the hg17 genome assembly.
