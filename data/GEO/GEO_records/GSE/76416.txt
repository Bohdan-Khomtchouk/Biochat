TITLE
The meiotic recombination activator PRDM9 trimethylates both H3K4 and H3K36 at recombination hotspots in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammalian genetic recombination is concentrated at hotspots, specialized 1-2 Kb sites separated by long stretches of DNA lacking recombination.  Mammalian hotspot locations depend on PRDM9, a zinc finger protein that binds at hotspots and uses its SET domain to locally trimethylate histone H3K4. Here we find that PRDM9 also locally trimethylates H3K36 at hotspots. Using ChIP-seq and immunoprecipitation data for H3K36me3 in murine spermatocytes, we show that H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 coincide only at hotspots in germ cells, and that this H3K4me3/H3K36me3-double-positive signature is almost entirely dependent on PRDM9.

DESIGN
We performed ChIP-seq with an antibody against H3K36me3, using chromatin extracted from murine spermatocytes, and compared it to previously generated ChIP-seq data for H3K4me3 in the same cell type. ---------------------------------- This dataset represents the H3K36 component only
