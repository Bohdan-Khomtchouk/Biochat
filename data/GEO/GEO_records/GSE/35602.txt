TITLE
microRNA and Gene expression profiles in colorectal cancer stromal tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using Laser Microdissection System (Leica Microsystems), RNA samples specific for stroma or epithelium were separately collected from thirteen colorectal cancer tissues and four normal tissues. Both microRNA microarray and gene expression microarray were performed in these samples.

DESIGN
Tissue samples from thirteen colorectal cancer tissues and  four normal tissues were microdissected using Laser Microdissection System (Leica Microsystems), and RNA samples specific for stroma or epithelium were separately collected.MicroRNA and Gene expression profiles obtained from cancer stromal tissues were compared with that of normal colon stromal tissues. we used the commercially available Human Whole Genome Oligo DNA Microarray Kit (Agilent Technologies) for gene expresson analysis and microRNA array for microRNA analysis.
