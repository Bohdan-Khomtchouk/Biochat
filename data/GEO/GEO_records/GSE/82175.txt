TITLE
Maternal exposure to bisphenol-A during pregnancy increases pancreatic beta-cell growth during early life in male mice offspring

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bisphenol-A is a widespread endocrine disruptor chemical. In utero or perinatal exposure to bisphenol-A (BPA), leads to impaired glucose metabolism during adulthood. To investigate the consequences  of the exposure to bisphenol-A during development  in pancreatic beta-cell growth We used microarrays to determine gene expression changes resulting from  exposure to bisphenol-A during pregnancy in  pancreatic islets of the male offspring at postnatal day 30.

DESIGN
Pregnant mice were treated with vehicle or bisphenol-A (10 or 100 mg/kg/day) from day 9 to 16 of gestation. Pancreatic islets were isolated from male offspring at postnatal day 30 (P30).  RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
