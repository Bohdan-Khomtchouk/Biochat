TITLE
Transcriptome analysis in flavonoid overaccumulating and lacking Arabidopsis.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
TranscriptoTranscriptome profiling using DNA microarrays of the aerial parts of the wild-type and other plants was conducted to examine if either MYB overexpression or flavonoid overaccumulation is responsible for the expression of stress-related genes involved in both the biotic and abiotic stress response.

DESIGN
Comparative transcriptome analysis using DNA microarray in flavonoid overaccumulating and lacking Arabidopsis.
