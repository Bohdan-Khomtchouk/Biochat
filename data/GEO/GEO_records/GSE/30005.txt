TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of isolated Escherichia coli mutants using VERT for the study of n-butanol tolerance

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of isolated mutants using the method Visualizing Evolution in Real-Time (VERT) for the study of n-butanol tolerance.  The samples were isolated from an evolution experiment picking samples at different times based in the evolution dynamics obtained with VERT.  Mutants were grown in chemostats at 0.8% (v/v) of n-butanol and compared with the expression of wild-type to the same concentration of solvent.

DESIGN
Three biological replicas. Each sample represents an isolated mutant. The reference for each mutant corresponds to wild-type, both exposed to the same concentration of n-butanol (0.8% (v/v)).
