TITLE
RNA sequencing of olfactory bulb projection neurons in neurotensin-GFP (NTS-GFP) mice at different developing time points

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of gene expression in neurons in developing olfactory bulb

DESIGN
Comparison of transcriptome profiles of GFP+ and GFP- cells derived from olfactory bulb of NTS-GFP at different developmetal time points (E13, E15, E17 and P0).
