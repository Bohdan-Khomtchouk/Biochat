TITLE
Effect of 3,OC12-HSL on the transcriptome of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor S238N

ORGANISM
Laccaria bicolor S238N-H82

SUMMARY
Bacteria use small diffusible molecules to communicate and to coordinate population response by a cell density-depend mechanism named quorum sensing (QS). If such a cross-talk was first described between bacterial species, it was recently evidenced that  bacterial QS signal molecules can also be sensed by eukaryotic organisms thus playing as inter-kingdom signalling molecules. Although ectomycorrhizal fungi interact physically and metabolically with myriads of bacterial species in soils, nothing is known about the ability of ectomycorrhiza-associated bacteria to produce QS molecules and the potential impact of these molecules in the interaction. While investigating the potential effect of these molecules on the physiology of the ectomycorrhizal fungus, we found that 3O,C12-HSL also induced an alteration of the transcriptome of L. bicolor S238N.

DESIGN
This study used the microarray design as follows: cDNA libraries from pure culture of Laccaria bicolor S238N mycelium and from three stages of L. bicolor S238N sporocarp development (Lb2 library: stipes and caps of 5–10 mm growing sporocarps; Lb3 library: caps of 30– 40 mm mature sporocarps), collected under Douglas ﬁr seedlings grown in a glasshouse, were constructed in the λTriplEx2 vector. The cDNA inserts from bacterial clones were PCR-ampliﬁed and 4992 cDNAs were arrayed from 384-well microtitre plates on Nylon membranes. Three independent biological replicates were performed for the treatment (3,OC12-HSL) and for the control (ethyl acetate)
