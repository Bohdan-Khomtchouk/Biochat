TITLE
A2B5/OTMP+ rat perineuronal oligodendrocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Oligodendrocytes are cells from the central nervous system that can be grouped into precursors, myelin-forming, and non-myelinating perineuronal. The function of perineuronal oligodendrocytes is unknown; it was suggested that they can ensheath denuded axons. We tested this hypothesis. Using cell-specific tags, microarray technology and bioinformatics tools to identify gene expression differences between these subpopulations allowed us to capture the genetic signature of perineuronal oligodendrocytes. Here we report that perineuronal oligodendrocytes are configured for a dual role. As perineuronal, they integrate a repertoire of transcripts designed to create a cell with its own physiological agenda. But they maintain a reservoir of untranslated transcripts encoding the major myelin proteins for – we speculate – a pathological eventuality. We posit that the signature molecules PDGFR-αβ, cytokine PDGF-CC, and the transcription factor Pea3 used – among others - to define the non-myelinating phenotype, may be critical for mounting a myelinating programme during demyelination. Harnessing this capability is of therapeutic value for diseases such as multiple sclerosis. This is the first molecular characterization of perineuronal oligodendrocytes. Keywords: developmental

DESIGN
Flow Cytometry was used to isolate A2B5/OTMP+ oligodendrocytes from postnatal day 7 rat brain.  4 bioloical replicates were obtained.  This data can be compared to the previously submitted oligodendrocyte expression data (GSE5940).
