TITLE
Expression analysis of Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 ∆hns/∆stpA from aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 ∆hns/∆stpA strain from exponental growth under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions. The results are further described in the article Genome-scale Analysis of E.coli FNR Reveals the Complex Features of Transcrtipion Factor Binding.

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA recovered from two separate cultures of Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 ∆hns/∆stpA mutant strain under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions. Each chip measures the expression level of 4,661 genes from Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 using a high-density tiling array consisting of ~385,000 60mer probes spaced every 12 bp.
