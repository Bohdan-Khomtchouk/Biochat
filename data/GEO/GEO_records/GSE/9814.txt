TITLE
RpoS regulation of gene expression during exponential growth of E. coli K-12

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
This study is to identify the RpoS regulon in MG1655 in early exponential growth. RNA samples from wild type or rpoS mutants were extracted using acidic hot phenol method and hybridized to Affymetrix E. coli Antisense Genome Array. Keywords: Define regulon of RpoS

DESIGN
A precise rpoS deletion mutant of MG1655 was constructed using the red recombinase method. Wild type and rpoS mutants were inoculated in triplicate into LB media at a starting OD of 0.0001 and grown aerobically at 37C. Cultures were harvested at an OD600 = 0.3 after being maintained in exponential phase for at least eight generations. For RNA extraction, cultures were mixed directly with a boiling lysis buffer containing SDS and EDTA followed by acidic hot phenol (65C) to minimize RNA degradation. RNA samples were hybridized to Affymetrix E. coli Antisense Genome Array according to Affymetrix's standard protocols.
