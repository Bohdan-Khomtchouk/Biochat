TITLE
A global view of the complexity of the porcine transcriptome using a full-sib pair with extreme phenotypes in growth and fat deposit by deep RNA sequencing (small RNA)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Pig is the important animal model for human obesity and diseases. However, the complexity of the porcine transcriptome is not yet fully elucidated. Here we have used massively parallel high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) to generate a high-resolution map of the porcine miRNA in liver (LI), longissimus dorsi (LD) and abdominal fat (AF) from a F2 female full-sib pair with extreme phenotypes on growth and fat deposit. Through small RNA sequencing and on the basis of miRbase15.0, we detected a total of 184 mature miRNAs and 164 unique porcine novel miRNAs. Some conserved miRNAs, such as miR-122, miR-1, miR-206 and let-7 family showed high expression level in this study. Finally, we identified 10, 20 and 63 differentially expressed miRNAs, respectively, in LI, LD and AF. This high resolution and comprehensive transcriptome analysis significantly enhances the current genome annotation of pigs.
