TITLE
Expression profiling of small RNAs in developing wheat grains

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs during wheat grain development by using high-throughput sequencing approach. Four small RNA libraries were constructed from wheat grains collected at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days post anthesis (DPA). A total of 165 known miRNAs and 37 novel miRNAs were identified in four small RNA libraries. Moreover, a miRNA-like long hairpin locus was first identified to produce 21~22-nt phased siRNAs. A comparison of the miRNAomes revealed that 55 miRNA families were differentially expressed during the grain development.

DESIGN
Examination of 4 different small RNA expression profilings in the 4 developmental stages of wheat grains.
