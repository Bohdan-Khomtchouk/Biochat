TITLE
Molecular pathways reflecting poor intrauterine growth are imprinted in Whartonâ€™s jelly derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells [set1]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify gene-expression patterns in mesenchymal stem cells associated with different birth weights and intrauterine growth parameters, we conducted comparative microarray gene expression experiments prior and post acute insulin stimulation

DESIGN
Samples were collected from umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC). 4 samples belong to SGA (Small for Gestational Age) and 4 samples belong to control group

PLATFORM
