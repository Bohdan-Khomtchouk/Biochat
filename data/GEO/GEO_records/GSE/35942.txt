TITLE
2 doses of ionising radiations (x-rays) -Transcriptomic analysis of effects of ionising radiation on Arabidopsis thaliana.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au09-03_gamma-irradiation - 2 doses of ionising radiations (x-rays)  - Metabolic pathways involved in the response of plants to ionising radiation treatment. - Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) seeds were grown in Petri dishes under sterile conditions until they had 2-rosette-leaves (on average 10 days). Then they received a dose of 10 or 40 gray of X-ray (Faxitron HP). Plant were harvested 2 and 26 hours after irradiation, immediatly frozen and stored at -80Â°C until RNA extraction (Rneasy plant mini Kit, Qiagen) . Experiment was carried in duplicates and a non irradiated control was done for each time.

DESIGN
8 dye-swap - dose response,time course

PLATFORM
