TITLE
The status of lymph node of resectable distant metastaticcolorectal cancer  (stage Ⅳ) as a prognostic predictor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Both the univariate analysis and multivariate analysis showed that the status of primary lymph node was the strongest predict factor. The subgroup analysis confirmed that the lymph node metastasis was associated to worse prognosis only in stage T3 and T4, rather than in stage T1 and T2. We firstly proposed the hypothesis that the status of lymph node reflected delayed diagnose of the disease, rather than the biological behavior of “seed”. The mRNA profile showed that there was minimal difference between lymph node positive and negative subgroups. The status of lymph node reflected delayed diagnose of the disease, rather than the biological behavior of “seed”.

DESIGN
15 patients registered in our center with resectable mCRC were selected to extract RNA for further analysis, with 7 patients in lymph node negative subgroup and 8 patients in lymph node positive subgroup. The mRNA profiles of all 15 patients were analyzed by Agilent microarray technology to explore the different expression between lymph node negative subgroup and lymph node positive subgroup.
