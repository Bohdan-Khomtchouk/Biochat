TITLE
The change of mRNA expression in murine immortalized podocyte after miR-26a silencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The change of mRNA expression in murine immortalized podocyte were analyzed after miR-26a silencing. These results provide a basical information of molecular pathology in podocyte biology.

DESIGN
Mouse podocytes immortalized by temperature sensitive SV40 were used. Podocyte cultures grown at 33 °C were trypsinized and then cultured with RPMI-1640 without antibiotics in 24-well plates at 60–70% confluence for 2 days. On day 3, an anti-miR negative control (40 pmol) or the miR-26a miRNA inhibitor (40 pmol) was transfected to podocytes. The cells were analyzed after culturing for 24 hour.
