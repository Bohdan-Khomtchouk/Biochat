TITLE
Expression of 50-500nt ncRNAs in silkworm Bombyx mori during development

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
With an experimental RNomics, we identified 194 novel ncRNAs in silkworm through four developmental stages (egg, larva, pupa and adult). Oligos of 132 ncRNAs were sucessfully designed, the expression of these ncRNAs were analyzed by dual-channel microarray, results showed that 36 ncRNAs had significantly differential expression during development.

DESIGN
The RNA from four samples (egg, larva, pupa and adult) were analyzed, the sample of larva was used as reference.
