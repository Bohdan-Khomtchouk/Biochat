TITLE
Stimulation of cell elongation by tetraploidy in hypocotyls of dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of diploid and tetraploid Arabidopsis dark-grown hypocotyls. The aim of this study was to identify ploidy-related genes involved in the determination of cell size. This study showed that a group of genes involved in lipid transport/localization/binding were downregulated in a defined region of the tetraploid hypocotyl when compared to the diploid hypocotyl.

DESIGN
Comparison of tetraploid vs diploid Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Col-0. Three biological replicates of 80 hypocotyl-segments each derived from the apical 4 mm region of 7-day-old dark-grown hypocotyls; the same tetraploid line was used.
