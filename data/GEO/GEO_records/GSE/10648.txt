TITLE
Stress-related gene expression of HK-2 cells exposed to GF/FAF HSA, GF HSA, AngII or AngII+Cand

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Proteinuria is pathogenic to proximal tubular cells (PTC) and linked with progression to renal failure. Angiotensin II (AngII) is also independently involved in the pathogenesis of progressive renal injury in varied kidney disease. The effects of human serum albumin (HSA) overload, AngII and candesartan, a specific inhibitor of AngII type 1 recptor, on the changes in gene protein expression stimulated by oxidative stress in PTC were assesed using cDNA microarrays. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Cells were growth arrested for 48 h in serum-free DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium with 5.5 mM glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine,100 U/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin, 20 mM Hepes. Media were refreshed and cells were incubated for 24h in conditioned media alone, or with media supplemented with 30mg/ml of different HSA preparations, 1 uM AngII or AngII in the presence of candesartan. After further 24 h under standard cell culture conditions (37C, 5% CO2) cells were subjected to RNA extraction.
