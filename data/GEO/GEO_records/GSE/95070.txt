TITLE
Comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed  miRNAs  in aged mice presenting with postoperative cognitive dysfunction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common postoperative complication observed in elderly patients. However, the underlying mechanisms of POCD remain unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) which are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, may also affect POCD. To identify the relevant potential mechanisms, in this study, we comprehensively compared the expression profiles of miRNAs in 5 hippocampal tissues from POCD mice and 5 hippocampal tissues from control mice by microarray. A total of 128 miRNAs, whose expression changed significantly, were identified. Four miRNAs were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 10 paired samples. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed to explore the principal functions of the deregulated genes. We predicted the potential targets of miRNAs by using bioinformatics methods. In summary, novel miRNAs were identified as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for POCD treatment.

DESIGN
In this study, we comprehensively compared the expression profiles of miRNAs in 5 hippocampal tissues from POCD mice and 5 hippocampal tissues from control mice by microarray. Mice from the POCD group were experienced tibia fracture surgery, mice from the control group did not receive any prior treatment or surgery.
