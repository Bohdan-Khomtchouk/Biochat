TITLE
Transcriptomes of mouse PGCLCs isolated from 6-day culture embryoid bodies were compared with transcriptomes of their precur cells (ESCs, iPSCs, and EpiLCs) and E12.5 in vivo mouse PGCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptomes of mouse E12.5 primordial germ cells (PGCs), primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) isolated from 6-day culture embryoid bodies,  and the precursor pluripotent stem cells [embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)] and epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs)

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from FACS-enriched, SSEA1+/CD61+ double-positive PGCs and PGCLCs. RNA was also isolated from ESC, iPSC, and EpiLC cultured without enrichment. Transcriptomes were determined using Affymetrix microarray.
