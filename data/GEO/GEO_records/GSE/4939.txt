TITLE
Cotton promoter discovery

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
Genomic approaches to the discovery of promoters for sustained expression in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) under field conditions: expression analysis in transgenic cotton and Arabidopsis of a Rubisco small subunit promoter identified using EST sequence analysis and cDNA microarrays. Keywords: Promoter Discovery

DESIGN
RNAs from 8-week old plants were compared to RNAs from 10-, 14-, 20- and 22-week old plants on separate arrays each with a dye swap. The 20 and 22 weeks hybridisations each had a biological replicate (each with a dye swap) as well as a second independent hybridisation (with dye swap) with one of the 22 week RNAs. One of the 22-week slides was of low quality and had to be discarded.
