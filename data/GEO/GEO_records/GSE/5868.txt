TITLE
Effect of oestrogen treatment on growth of human angiomyolipoma xenograft tumours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SV7tert AML cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM), glutamine (4mmol) and 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS). Two million SV7tertAML  cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice either with or without subcutaneous oestrogen pellets (n=4 per group); oestrogen was added using 0.36mg 60 day release oestrogen pellets implanted sub-cutaneously. Mice were housed in pathoflex isolators at 26Â°C, on 12 hour light / dark cycles. Irradiated RB2 diet and autoclaved water provided ad libertum. All oestrogen treated mice inoculated with SV7tertAML cells developed subcutaneous tumours which required termination of the animals at six weeks due to tumour load. These primary tumours were removed and fragments placed subcutaneously in further nude mice which went on to develop tumours both in the presence and absence of oestrogen. Mice were weighed weekly and their clinical condition closely monitored by a trained observer. Mice were terminated individually when the tumour cross-sectional area reached 250mm2 or sooner, which has previously been seen to be below the limit of 10% of initial body weight set by the UKCCCR guidelines. Tumours were removed and a portion flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted from five tumours from oestrogen treated and control animals. Equal quantities of RNA was pooled and quality checked by Agilent Bioanylyser.
