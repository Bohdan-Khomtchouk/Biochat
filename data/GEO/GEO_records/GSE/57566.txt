TITLE
Expression data from 1499 cells, a mouse ADM/PanIN1-derived pancreatic ductal cell line, and the mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) AH375 cell line.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In a Kras-driven mouse model of multistage pancreatic cancer progression, decreased p-ERK levels correlate with tumor initiation. In cells derived from this model, transformed cells with low p-ERK levels express markers of pluripotency and demonstrate phenotypes of tumor initiating cells, such as formation of free-floating tumor spheres. Here, a comparison of gene expression from the 1499 cell line, which are premalignant cells isolated from mouse ADM (acinar-to-ductal metaplasia) and PanIN1 (pancreatic intraepithelial lesions), and the AH375 cell line, established from mouse PDAC, was performed.

DESIGN
To establish the 1499 cell line, cells were isolated from premalignant pancreatic lesions (ADM and PanIN1) in a 9-week-old Pdx1-Cre;LSL-KRasG12D mouse. To establish the AH375 cell line, cells were isolated from PDAC in a 52-week-old Pdx1-Cre;LSL-KRasG12D mouse. These pancreatic ductal cells were propagated on surfaces coated with laminin and in a specific pancreatic medium. Total mRNA extracts were prepared in triplicates for both cell lines and sent to the Génome Québec Innovation Centre for RNA processing and data acquisition.
