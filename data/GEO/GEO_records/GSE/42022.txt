TITLE
Differential gene expression profiles between Parp-2-/- and wild-type hematopoietic stem/progenitors cell at basal and in response to 5 Gy gamma Irradiation (2.5 hours post-irradiation)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile between Parp-2-/- and wild-type hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells at basal and to the early response (2.5 hours) to 5 Gy total body irradiation

DESIGN
We analyzed 2 arrays from each condition. Each samples represent a pool of at least 3 mice

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
