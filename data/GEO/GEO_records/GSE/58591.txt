TITLE
Sex dependent gene expression in human pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
During early development before gonadal differentiation, sex chromosomes are the main difference  between males and females. We examined any genetically  driven sex dimorphisms  in human pluripotent stem cells focusing on Y chromosome contribution. In order to understand the consequence of these differences, human ES cells were differentiated  into EBs under the influence of Estrone (E1) and the global expression diffrences between male and females were examined.

DESIGN
Male and female ES cells were differentiated by EB formation under E1 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix GENE ST 1.0 microarrays (GPL6244). RNA was extracted  at 0d 3d and 11d
