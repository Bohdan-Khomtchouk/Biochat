TITLE
LncVSM (AK098656) up/down-regulation in Vascular Smooth Muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) in hypertensives and their mechanisms in regulating blood pressure still remain unexplored.  The aim of present study is to construct the profiles of LncRNAs in blood of patients with essential hypertension and healthy controls.   Methods and results, LncRNA microarray identified up-regulated, anddown-regulated LncRNAs, in hypertensives compared to their healthy controls. Among them, one vascular smooth muscle (VSM)-specific LncRNA AK096656 (LncVSM) was quantitated in plasma of patients with hypertension and their healthy controls using the real-time qRT-PCR.  LncVSM shows specific expression in human arterial vascular smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) and promote its proliferation and migration. Expression profiles and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that LncVSM activated Renin-Angiotensin Signaling (RAS). the overexpression of LncVSM would result hypertension related complications.

DESIGN
