TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of human ovarian cancer cells treated with ribonucleases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PE5 is a nuclear-directed human ribonuclease variant that exhibits selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Onconase is a natural cytotoxic ribonuclease that has reached advanced clinical trials for the treatment of different types of cancer. Onconase also posses established antiviral effects. In the present work, we have used global gene expression microarrays to study the effects caused by PE5 and onconase, and therefore elucidate the mechanism by which these ribonucleases induce cytotoxicity. Transcriptional profiling of human ovarian cancer cells treated with PE5 or onconase were compared with that of control untreated cells. The study were carried out with the multidrug resistance cell line NCI/ADR-RES and its parental cell line OVCAR8.

DESIGN
Two loop-design microarray experiments were performed, one for NCI/ADR-RES cell line and one for OVCAR8 cell line. Each loop contained six hybridizations (samples A-F and G-L) and three experimental conditions (control, PE5 treatment, and onconase treatment). Each loop employed four independent biological replicates.
