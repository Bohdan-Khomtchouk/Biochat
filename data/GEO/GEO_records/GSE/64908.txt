TITLE
Skeletal muscle profiling in HMDP (high-fat/high-sucrose diet)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identify genes in the skeletal muscle whose expression is under genetic regulation in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP).  The HMDP comprises classical inbred and recombinant inbred wild type mice.  The neqc-normalized values of genes were used for genome wide association.  These data are used to identify candidate genes at loci associated with obesity and dietary responsiveness.

DESIGN
GWAS for expression of skeletal muscle in inbred strains fed chow diet for 8 weeks followed by high-fat/high-sucrose diet 8 weeks

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
