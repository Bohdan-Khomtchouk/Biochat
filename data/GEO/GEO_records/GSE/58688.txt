TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of two 14-3-3 proteins Bmh1 and Bmh2 under osmotic and oxidative stresses in the entomopathogen fungus Beauveria bassiana by using RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Beauveria bassiana

SUMMARY
Bmh1 and Bmh2 contribute equally to mediating fungal stress tolerance of Beauveria bassiana , a determinant to the biocontrol potential of fungal entomopathogens. We characterize their functionsfor the first time and interaction by multi-phenotypic analyses of single-gene deletion mutants and double-gene mutants by RNAi, and to probe possible mechanisms involved in multi-phenotypic changes by analysis of Bmh1- and Bmh2-specific transcriptomes constructed under osmotic and oxidative stresses versus wild-type (BbWT) through using high throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq). Our transcriptional profiles revealed that numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which were many more effectors and signaling factors likely involved in morphogenesis and asexual development, multidrug resistance, transcription, transduction, cell rescue, defense and virulence, and carbohydrate metabolism , were significantly down-regulated in expression level by Bmh-delection.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from Bmh1 and Bmh2 disruption mutant subjected to 0.5 M NaCl and 40 mM H2O2 at  25Â°C for 1-h response compared to the wild type strain under the same stress treatment.
