TITLE
Expression from hemocytes misexpressing Idh-R195H vs. controls

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Expression profile for hemocytes from hml-Gal4, UAS-2xEGFP larvae were compared to hemocytes from hml-Gal4, UAS-2xEGFP; UAS-Idh-R195H larvae

DESIGN
We sought to determine which genes and pathways were upregulated or downregulated in hemocytes expressing Idh-R195H, the Drosophila homolog of the human cancer-associated IDH1-R132H mutant, in vivo.  We sought to obtain homogeneous populations of hemocytes from each genotype.  We compared larvae expressing Idh-R195H from the hml-Gal4 driver to larvae with the hml-Gal4 driver alone.
