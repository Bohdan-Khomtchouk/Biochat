TITLE
Gene expression data from mouse postnatal brain development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Mus spretus

SUMMARY
In development, timing is of the utmost importance, and the timing of various developmental processes are often changed during evolution. We measured the timing of gene expression changes in the brains of two species of mice throughout postnatal development.

DESIGN
Mus musculus and Mus spretus mice were bred at the MPI-EVA mouse facility. Whole brain samples were collected from mice of 3 different age classes: newborns, pups and young adults. RNA extracted from the dissected tissue was hybridized to Affymetrix MG-430 2.0 GeneChip arrays.
