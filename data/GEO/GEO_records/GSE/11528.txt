TITLE
Gene expression data from mouse postnatal brain development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In development, timing is of the utmost importance, and the timing of various developmental processes are often changed during evolution. We measured the timing of gene expression changes in the brains of two species of mice throughout postnatal development.
