TITLE
Characterization of tumor extracellular vesicle RNA cargo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparative RNA profiling between tumor cells and their secreted extracellular vesicles. Results revealed enrichment in genes involved in cellular migration and metastasis in extracellular vesicles, in agreement with their role as mediators of tumor progression.

DESIGN
Mice were orthotoplically transplanted with MDA-MB-231 Breast Adenocarcinoma cells. Cells and extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the resulting tumors were isolated. EVs were characterized by electron microscopy and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis before total RNA isolation for comparative analysis with cellular RNA. Three biological replicates were analyzed in (technical) duplicate.
