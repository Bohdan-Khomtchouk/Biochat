TITLE
Time course gene expression profiling of five diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines following JQ1 treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the molecular curcuits perturbed by BET bromodoman inhibtion we obtained gene expression profiling of five DLBCL cell lines, SU-DHL6, OCI-Ly1, OCI-Ly4, Toledo and HBL-1, which were treated with either 500nM JQ1 or DMSO for 0,2,6,12,24 and 48hr.

DESIGN
RNA samples from five DLBCL cell lines at baseline (time 0) or following treatment with 500nM of JQ1 or vehicle (DMSO) alone for 2, 6, 24 or 48 hours were profiled in triplicate on Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array.
