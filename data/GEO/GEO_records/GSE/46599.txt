TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of interferon-stimulated genes in primary cells and immortalized cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in various primary cells and immortalized cell lines, following type 1 interferon (IFN) treatment. Some cell types become resistant to HIV-1 infection following type 1 interferon treatment (such as macrophages, THP-1, PMA-THP-1, U87-MG cells and to a lesser extent, primary CD4+ T cells) while others either become only partially resistant (e.g., HT1080, PMA-U937) or remain permissive (e.g., CEM, CEM-SS, Jurkat T cell lines and U937); for more information see (Goujon and Malim, Journal of Virology 2010) and (Goujon and Schaller et al., Retrovirology 2013). We hypothesized that the anti-HIV-1 ISGs are differentially induced and expressed in restrictive cells compared to permissive cells and performed a whole genome analysis following type 1 IFN treatment in cell types exhibiting different HIV-1 resistance phenotypes.

DESIGN
48 samples; design: 9 cell lines, primary CD4+ T cells and primary macrophages, untreated and IFN-treated; 2 replicate experiments per cell line; 3 replicate experiments per primary cell type

PLATFORM
