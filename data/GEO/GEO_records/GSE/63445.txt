TITLE
miRNA expression of extracellular vesicles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further investigate the molecular mechanisms by which EVs mediated the abnormal localization of tight junction proteins and adherence junction protein, we performed miRNA microarray analysis of extracellular vesicles isolated from breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
miRNA expression in extracellular vesicles was collected from MDA-MB-231-D3H1, MDA-MB-231-D3H2LN, BMD2a and BMD2b breast cancer cell lines.
