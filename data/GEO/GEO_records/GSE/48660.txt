TITLE
An improved SELEX-Seq strategy for characterizing DNA-binding specificity of transcription factor: NF-κB as an example

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We provided an improved SELEX-Seq strategy for characterizing DNA-binding specificity of transcription factor. We valided the strategy by characterzing the DNA-binding specificty of NF-κB p50 dimer.

DESIGN
Proteins of the Nf-kappab family were bound to DNA oligonucleotides containing a degenerate region. The protein-DNA complexes were selected after one or multiple rounds of SELEX and the DNA molecules were deep sequenced.
