TITLE
Steady state chemostat cultures grown in different dilution rates and levels of phosphate feeding

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Wild type steady state chemostats cultures, in dilution rate of 0.3[1/hr] or 0.1[1/hr], and phosphate concentration in the feeding vessel of 0.3 or 0.1mM Pi

DESIGN
Wild type cells were grown in a chemostat at a dilution rate of 0.3[1/hr] or 0.1[1/hr], and phosphate concentration in the feeding vessel of 0.3 or 0.1mM Pi. Cells were allowed to reach steady state and then harvested. Total RNA was extracted using MasterPureâ„¢ Kit (Epicentre). The samples were amplified, labeled, hybridized to yeast dual color expression microarrays and scanned, all using standard Agilent protocols, reagents, and instruments. The scanned images were analyzed using SpotReader software (Niles Scientific).
