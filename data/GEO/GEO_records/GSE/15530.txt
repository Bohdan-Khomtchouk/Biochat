TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression perturbed by reptin shRNA in MCF7 subjected to normoxic and hypoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the role of reptin methylation on the expression of hypoxia-responsive genes across the whole genome, we performed a microarray analysis from RNAs isolated from MCF7 cells expressing either control shRNA (shRNA) or reptin shRNA (shreptin) in normoxic and hypoxic conditions.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with either non-specific shRNA or reptin shRNA in replicates. Cells were grown for 24 hours before being exposed to either normoxic (21% oxygen) or hypoxic (1% oxygen) conditions for 18 hours. Cells were then lysed and RNA was isolated.
