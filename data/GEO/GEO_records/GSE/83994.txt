TITLE
miRNA expression profiling divides follicular dendritic cell sarcomas into two groups, related to fibroblasts and myopericytomas or Castleman's disease

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiling divides 31 follicular dendritic cell (FDC) sarcomas into two subgroups, one group closely related to microdissected FDCs from CastlemanÂ´s disease, the other group closely related to fibroblasts and myopericytomas. miRNA was labeled with the Affymetrix FlashTag Biotin HSR RNA Labeling Kit
