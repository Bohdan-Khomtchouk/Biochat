TITLE
miRNA expression profiling divides follicular dendritic cell sarcomas into two groups, related to fibroblasts and myopericytomas or Castleman's disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiling divides 31 follicular dendritic cell (FDC) sarcomas into two subgroups, one group closely related to microdissected FDCs from CastlemanÂ´s disease, the other group closely related to fibroblasts and myopericytomas. miRNA was labeled with the Affymetrix FlashTag Biotin HSR RNA Labeling Kit

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiling was performed of 31 FDC sarcomas and appropriate reactive samples
