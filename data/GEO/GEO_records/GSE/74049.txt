TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis Identifies Linc-Yy1, A Novel Functional LincRNA During Myogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Little is known how lincRNAs are involved in skeletal myogenesis. Here we describe the discovery of a novel lincRNA, Linc-YY1 from the promoter of transcription factor (TF) Yin Yang 1 (YY1) gene. We demonstrate that Linc-YY1 is dynamically regulated during myogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Gain or loss of function of Linc-YY1 in C2C12 myoblast cells or satellite cells alters myogenic differentiation and in injured muscles impacts the course of regeneration. Further studies suggest LincYY1 may interact with YY1 through its middle domain to evict YY1

DESIGN
9 ChIP-seq and 4 RNA-seq experiments performed
