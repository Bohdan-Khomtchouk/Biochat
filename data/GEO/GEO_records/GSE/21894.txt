TITLE
Dynamic transcriptomic profiles of zebrafish gills in response to zinc depletion

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zinc deficiency is detrimental to organisms highlighting its role as an essential micronutrient contributing to numerous biological processes. To investigate the underlying molecular events invoked by zinc depletion we performed a temporal analysis of transcriptome changes observed within zebrafish gill. This tissue represents a model system for studying ion absorption across polarised cells as it provides a major pathway for fish to acquire zinc directly from water whilst sharing a conserved zinc transporting system with mammals. Zebrafish were treated with either zinc-depleted (water = 2.61 μg L-1; diet = 26 mg kg-1) or zinc-adequate (water = 16.3 μg L-1; diet = 233 mg kg-1) conditions for two weeks. Gill samples were collected at five time points and transcriptome changes analysed in quintuplicate using a 16K oligonucleotide array.

DESIGN
Global transcript levels were measured in zebrafish gills using a oligonucleotide array either zinc-depleted or zinc-adequate diet. Gill samples were collected at five time points and transcriptome changes analysed in quintuplicate using a 16K oligonucleotide array
