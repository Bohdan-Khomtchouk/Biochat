TITLE
Expression data from mouse aorta during and following transient hyperglycaemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Immediate and early effects of transient hyperglycaemia were examined using fully- reversible transgenic diabetic mice. Transient hyperglycaemia altered expression of 769 arterial genes, of which 200 did not reverse following  recovery from hyperglycaemia. Many such genes are known to promote atherogenesis, including several implicated in arterial calcification and inflammation. This supports the view that hyperglycaemia causes not only very early deleterious changes in arterial gene expression but that to a large extent these persist for some time after restoration of normal blood glucose levels in vivo. Together, results support the contention that avoiding excess CVD risk in diabetes requires very early correction of hyperglycaemia.
