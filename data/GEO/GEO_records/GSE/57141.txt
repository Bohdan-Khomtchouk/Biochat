TITLE
Defining key signaling nodes and therapeutic biomarkers in NF1-mutant cancers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The NF1 tumor suppressor encodes a RAS GTPase-Activating Protein (RasGAP).  Accordingly, deregulated RAS signaling underlies the pathogenesis of NF1-mutant cancers. However, while various RAS effector pathways have been shown to function in these tumors, it is currently unclear which specific proteins within these broad signaling pathways represent optimal therapeutic targets. Here we identify mTORC1 as the key PI3K pathway component in NF1-mutant nervous system malignancies and conversely show that mTORC2 and AKT are dispensable. We also report that combined mTORC1/MEK inhibition is required to promote tumor regression in animal models, but only when the inhibition of both pathways is sustained. Transcriptional profiling studies were also used to establish a predictive signature of effective mTORC1/MEK inhibition in vivo. Within this signature, we unexpectedly found that the glucose transporter gene, GLUT1, was potently suppressed but only when both pathways were effectively inhibited. Moreover, unlike VHL and LKB1 mutant cancers, reduction of 18F-FDG uptake measured by FDG-PET required the effective suppression of both mTORC1 and MEK. Together these studies identify optimal and sub-optimal therapeutic targets in NF1-mutant malignancies and define a non-invasive means of measuring combined mTORC1/MEK inhibition in vivo, which can be readily incorporated into clinical trials.
