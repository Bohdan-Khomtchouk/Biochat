TITLE
Monitoring response and resistance to the novel arsenical darinaparsin in an AML patient

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A patient diagnosed with AML with inversion of chromosome 3 inv(3)(q21q26.2) was treated with the organic arsenical darinaparsin on an experimental protocol. The patient underwent two treatment cycles. During the first, a stabilization of WBC counts was noted along with a marked improvement in subjective well-being. During the second cycle, the patient's WBC counts continued to increase suggesting the emergence of resistance. RNA was isolated from PBMCs before each cycle and after 48 hours of darinaparsin treatment in each cycle. Gene expression changes were determined by Agilent 8x60K array.

DESIGN
For cycle 1, one pre-treatment sample and one 48hr treatment sample was analyzed. Likewise for cycle 2, one pre-treatment sample and one 48hr treatment sample was analyzed.
