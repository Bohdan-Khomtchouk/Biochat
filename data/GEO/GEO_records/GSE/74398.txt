TITLE
A Dicer-Independent Route for Biogenesis of siRNAs that Direct DNA Methylation in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
DNA methylation directed by 24-nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) plays critical roles in gene regulation and transposon silencing in Arabidopsis. Twenty-four-nt siRNAs are known to be processed from double-stranded RNAs by Dicer-like 3 (DCL3) and loaded into the effector Argonaute 4 (AGO4). Here we report a distinct class of siRNAs independent of DCLs (sidRNAs). sidRNAs are present as ladders of ~20 to 60nt in length, often having same 5' ends but differing in 3' ends by 1-nt steps. We further show that sidRNAs are associated with AGO4 and capable of directing DNA methylation. Finally we show that sidRNA production depends on AGO4 and distributive 3'-5' exonucleases. Our findings suggest an alternative route for siRNA biogenesis: precursor transcripts are bound by AGO4 and subsequently subjected to 3'-5' exonucleolytic trimming for maturation. We propose that sidRNAs generated through this route are the initial triggers of de novo DNA methylation.

DESIGN
Small RNAs were profiled in Arabidopsis wild type (Col-0), dcl1/2/3/4 and other mutants by Illumina high-throughput sequencing, to identify siRNAs independent of DCLs (sidRNAs) and dissect their biogenesis pathway. DNA methylation was profiled in various mutants by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to establish a role for sidRNAs in DNA methylation
