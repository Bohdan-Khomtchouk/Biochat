TITLE
RNA changes induced by LEAFY COTYLEDON2 activity in Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
LEAFY COTYLEDON2 activity was induced via a LEC2-Glucocorticoid Receptor fusion protein in Arabidopsis seedlings. Keywords: Ordered

DESIGN
Transgenic plants carrying a 35S:LEC2-Glucocorticoid Receptor transgene were used for LEC2 induction.  Activity was induced in 8 day old seedlings for 1 or 4 hours with Dexamethasone application.  Controls include uninduced transgenic plants and non-transgenic plants treated with Dex. Two biological replicates per treatment.
