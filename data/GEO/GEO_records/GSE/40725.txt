TITLE
Genome-Wide Progesterone Receptor Binding: Cell Type-Specific and Shared Mechanisms in Uterine Fibroids and Breast Cancer (Expression BeadChip)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of genes regulated by RU486 (an progesterone antagonist) in human breast cancer T47D cells and human uterine leiomyoma smooth muscle cells. The hypothesis is that RU486 inhibits tumor growth by inactivating the transcription of multiple genes which trigger critical signaling pathways to induce tumorigenesis in both breast caner and uterine leomyoma.  Tissue-specific and common patterns of gene regulation may determine the therapeutic effects of antiprogestins in uterine leiomyoma and breast cancer. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from T47D cells subjected to RU486 treatment for 6 hours compared to vehicle (ethanol) treated cells. Total RNA isolated from uterine leiomyoma cells subjected to RU486 treatment for 6 hours compared to vehicle (ethanol) treated cells.
