TITLE
KCl depolarization-regulated genes in mouse cortical neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we used DNA microarray analysis to identify genes that are induced by neuronal activity in excitatory neurons at the time when inhibitory synapses are forming and maturing on them. Keywords: Primary neuron culture, depolarization, activity-dependent

DESIGN
We cultured cortical neurons for 7 DIV until the process of inhibitory synapse development was underway, and then depolarized the neurons with 50 mM of KCl to activate L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (L-VSCCs) for 0, 1 or 6 hours, the cells were lysed, mRNA isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix arrays. Data were collected from 3 independent experiments.
