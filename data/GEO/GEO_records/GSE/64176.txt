TITLE
Expression data from Treg subsets sorted from healthy human peripheral blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
All the sorted Treg cells are gated on CD4+CD25+CD127(low), followed by gating on various subsets using markers indicated in the sample names. All the sorted Teff cells are gated on CD4+CD25-CD127(hi), and further sorted for CD45RO- and CD45RO+ phenotype.

DESIGN
Each Treg and Teff cell subsets were sorted from three different donors. We sought to identify gene expression signature characteristic to specific Treg subsets
