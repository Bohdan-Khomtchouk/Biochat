TITLE
MiRNA Profiling of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors by Next Generation Sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have an impaired gene expression. As microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression we performed the first high-throughput miRNA profiling of 15 paired GIST formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples (tumor and adjacent normal tissue) using small RNA sequencing approach.

DESIGN
