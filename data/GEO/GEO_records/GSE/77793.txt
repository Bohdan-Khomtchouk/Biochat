TITLE
Feedback regulation of cholesterol metabolism by LeXis, a lipid-responsive non-coding RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Abstract: The LXR and SREBP transcription factors are key regulators of cellular and systemic cholesterol homeostasis. The molecular mechanisms that integrate these pathways are incompletely understood. Here we show that ligand activation of LXRs in liver not only promotes cholesterol efflux, but also simultaneously inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis. We further identify the long non-coding RNA LeXis as an unexpected mediator of this effect. LeXis is robustly induced in mouse liver in response to western diet feeding or pharmacologic LXR activation. Expression of LeXis in liver inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis and lowers plasma cholesterol levels. Reciprocally, knockdown of LeXis increases hepatic cholesterol content and raises plasma cholesterol levels. LeXis interacts with the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Raly and regulates its binding to cholesterol biosynthetic gene promoters. These studies outline a regulatory role for a non-coding RNA in lipid metabolism and advance our understanding of the mechanisms orchestrating systemic sterol homeostasis.

DESIGN
Global RNA expression from primary hepatocytes treated with or without GW3965 were compared by RNA-Seq.
