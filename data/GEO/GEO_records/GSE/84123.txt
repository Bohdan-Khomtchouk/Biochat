TITLE
Global analysis of dorsoventral patterning in the wasp Nasonia

ORGANISM
Nasonia vitripennis

SUMMARY
Using RNA interference, we dorsalized and ventralized Nasonia embryos.  By comparing transcriptomes from the RNAi cases to each other and to controls, we identify > 100 genes expressed along the embryonic DV axis

DESIGN
2 biological replicates of Toll signaling knockdown, BMP signaling knockdown, and water injected (control) were produced, and RNA was isolated and sequenced from resulting embryos

PLATFORM
GPL16488 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Nasonia vitripennis)
