TITLE
SIRT6 regulates redox homeostasis in human mesenchymal stem cells by the transactivation of NRF2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the effect of SIRT6-knockout on gene expression and H3K4me3 modification profile in human mesenchymal stem cells.

DESIGN
RNAs isolated from SIRT6+/+ and SIRT6-/- hMSCs at early and late passages were sequenced, respectively. And, H3K4me3 ChIP-seq was performed upon the SIRT6 deleted hMSC and WT at early stage, respectively.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
