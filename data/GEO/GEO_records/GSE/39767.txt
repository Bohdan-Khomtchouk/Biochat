TITLE
Expression data from OsRP1L1-overexpressing plant leaf in japonica rice (cv. Ishikari-shiroge (I-S))

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
A novel rice NBS-LRR gene was cloned and overexpressed to explore its function in bacterial blight (BB) resistance. Due to its similarity to the Rp1 gene in maize (Zea mays), it was designated as OsRP1L1. We used microarrays to detail the global reprogram of gene expression in OsRP1L1-overexpressing plants.

DESIGN
To find out pathways and genes related to this defense-related gene, microanalysis were carried out on OsPR1L1-overexpressing plants. Three independent replicates were perfomed for overexpressing plants and wild type plants.

PLATFORM
GPL2025 [Rice] Affymetrix Rice Genome Array
