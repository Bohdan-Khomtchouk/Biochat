TITLE
Gene expression profiling during Ara-C induced NB4 cell apoptosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As the most important antimetabolite used to induce remission in children and adults with acute leukemia, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) is widely used in consolidation therapy of APL to reduce the relapse rate. In order to better understand the molecular mechanism underlying Ara-C induced cell early apoptosis, we examined the mRNA level changes of NB4 cells after Ara-C treatment over the 12 h time course using a human whole genome oligo-array.

DESIGN
For each test and control sample at the 2, 4, 6, and 12 h time point, hybridization experiments were performed using a dye-swap strategy.
