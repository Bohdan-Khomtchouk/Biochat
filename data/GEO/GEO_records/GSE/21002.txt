TITLE
Gene expression analysis of genes differentially expressed between CD93-ko mice and wild-type mice in post ischemic mice brain tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further decipher CD93-dependent pathways, we compared global expression profiles of ischemic (ipsilateral)  hemispheres of CD93-deficient mice (CD93-ko) with expression profiles of wild-type mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from CD93-ko and WT mice at different time points after cerebral ischemia and from untreated brain tissue

PLATFORM
GPL6105 Illumina mouse-6 v1.1 expression beadchip
