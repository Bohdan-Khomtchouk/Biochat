TITLE
RNA-seq data of adipocytes co-cocultured with OVCAR5 in Boyden chamber (4d)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We indirectly cocultured OVCAR5-RFP cells using a 0.45 micron Boyden chamber with or without adipocytes for 4 days, collected the RNA from adipocytes, and performed RNA-seq

DESIGN
To identify potential changes in methylation and gene expression due to the 2-way communication between adipocytes and OC cells. In triplicate, SGBS adipocytes were indirectly cocultured with or without OVCAR5-RFP cells using a 0.45 micron Boyden chamber for 4 days. Then RNA-seq was performed on adipocytes.

PLATFORM
