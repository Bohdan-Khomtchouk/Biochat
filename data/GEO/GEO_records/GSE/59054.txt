TITLE
Detailed localisation of diet-induced changes in gene expression in the murine small intestine.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An increasing amount of evidence suggests that the small intestine may play an important role in the development of metabolic diseases, such as obesity and insulin resistance. The small intestine provides the first barrier between diet and the body. As a result, dysregulation of biological processes and secretion of signal molecules from the small intestine may be of importance in the regulation and dysregulation of whole body metabolic homeostasis. Changes in gene expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, cell cycle and immune response may contribute to the aetiology of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. In the current study we present a detailed investigation on the effects a chow diet, low fat diet and high fat diet on gene expression along the proximal-to-distal axis of the murine small intestine. The reported results provide a knowledge base for upcoming studies on the role of the small intestine in the aetiology of diet-induced diseases.

DESIGN
Mice were fed a chow diet, low fat diet, or high fat diet for 2 weeks whereafter the small intestine was isolated and divided in 10 equal parts. Epithelial cells were scraped off, RNA was isolated and subjected to whole genome expression profiling.
