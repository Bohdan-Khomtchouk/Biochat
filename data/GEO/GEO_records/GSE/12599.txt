TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of mouse glomerulus in lipopolysaccharide-induced proteinuria model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The pathogenic mechanisms of common kidney glomerular diseases, including the vast majority of cases of proteinuria, remain unknown. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of proteinuria development, we characterized the glomerular gene expression changes that accompany early stages of proteinuria induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice.

DESIGN
Nine-week-old female C57Bl6 mice were  allocated to LPS-treated group (n=6) or PBS control group (n=4), and subsequently treated either by a single intraperitoneal injection LPS or control buffer.
