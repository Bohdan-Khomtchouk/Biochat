TITLE
809094 Biomarker Identification in Fracture Healing (experiment #5200-5203 Jun 2015)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The specific genes that distinguish normal fracture healing from abnormal healing or nonunion in humans are unknown. This study was an exploratory investigation of peripheral blood from acutely injured fracture patients collected over multiple days to compare normal healers, slow healers, and nonunion outcomes. We used microarrays to do a global comparison between acutely injured (AI) subjects (AIS) vs. age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (HV) and chronic Nonunion (NU) patients.
