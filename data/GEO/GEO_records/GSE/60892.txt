TITLE
Gene expression analysis of choroid plexus tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression was assessed in a cohort of 40 choroid plexus tumors isolated from fresh-frozen tissue. We investigated unique expression patterns among tumor subgroups and refined the classification of choroid plexus tumors according to gene expression intensities.

DESIGN
Forty choroid plexus tumors (16 choroid plexus carcinomas, 16 choroid plexus papillomas and 8 atypical choroid plexus papillomas) were analyzed. No replicates were used.
