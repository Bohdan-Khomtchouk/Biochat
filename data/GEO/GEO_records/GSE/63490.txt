TITLE
Copy number analysis of liver metastases from colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Almost half of all patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer develop liver metastases. The potential role of intra-individual metastatic heterogeneity remains poorly characterized. By high-resolution DNA copy number analyses and a novel approach based on pair-wise genetic distance, we examined the genetic heterogeneity among multiple liver metastatic deposits obtained from 45 patients subject to curative liver resection. We found large variation in intra-individual metastatic heterogeneity. A high level of heterogeneity was associated with poor patient survival. Patients with metachronous metastases who received chemotherapy had significantly more heterogeneity than chemona√Øve patients.

DESIGN
Genome-wide copy number analysis was performed on fresh frozen tissue samples from 134 liver metastatic deposits and 6 primary tumors from 45 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Array
