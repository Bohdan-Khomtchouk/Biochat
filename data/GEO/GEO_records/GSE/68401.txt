TITLE
Enhancer activation during EGF response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the acetylation of H3K27, in normal condition and after stimulation of EGF and before or after the depletion of INTS11. Additionally, we examined transcription by sequencing the chromatin-bound fraction of RNA and by fractionating total RNA into polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated compartement.

DESIGN
Comparison of the genome wide profiles of H3K27ac and RNA in HeLa cells
