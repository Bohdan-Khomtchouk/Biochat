TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Salmonella enterica regulatory mutants.

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
The study aims to determine the effects of mutants and deletions of several known regulators on S. enterica gene expression.

DESIGN
Samples were hybridized on aminosilane coated slides with 70-mer oligos.  Each sample have biological replicates. Cells were grown in media LB or LPM and RNA harvest at log, mid log or stationary phase. Salmonella enterica strain 14028 is used as reference throughout the study.

PLATFORM
GPL10213 JCVI PFGRC Salmonella typhimurium 13K v8 array designed primarily based on strain 14028
