TITLE
Gene upregulation by the ATCE1 transcription factor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ATCE1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the CREB3 subtype of the ATF/CREB transcription factor family.  In order to get an indication of the potential promoters ATCE1 targets, a nuclear form was expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts via transfection and upregulated genes were sought after. Keywords: Potential promoter targeting

DESIGN
NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with either a pCMV-HA-ATCE1-C-del plasmid, driving the expression the nuclear form of ATCE1, or an empty pCMV-HA vector. The expression level of transcripts isolated from ATCE1 expressing cells was compared to transcripts obtained from cells transfected with an empty vector that was used as a control.
