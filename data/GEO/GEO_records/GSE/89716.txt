TITLE
A high-resolution map of transcriptional repression by Ikaros

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Ikaros is essential for early B cell development, which involves precise control of the transcription program. Gene repression is less well understood compared to gene activation. The purpose of this study was to characterise the chromatin changes mediated by Ikaros, which could shed light on how Ikaros mediates transcriptional silencing.

DESIGN
We carried out RNA polymerse II (RNAP2) chromatin immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) in B3 cells after 6h of control carrier ethanol (EtOH) treatment or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) treatment to induce Ikaros translocation. We also carried out MNase-seq in B3 cells after 6h of EtOH or 4-OHT treatment.
