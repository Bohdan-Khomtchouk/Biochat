TITLE
mRNA sequencing of whole 15 d old Oryza sativa shoots

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
The rice gene SUB1A-1 confers flooding tolerance restricting shoot growth during submergence.  Rice with SUB1A also show more rapid recovery after submergence ends, but mechanisms by which SUB1A improves recovery from submergence had not been examined.  In this study, the transcriptome was sequenced at five time points over a 24 hour submergence recovery period in near-isogenic rice genotypes with and without SUB1A.

DESIGN
36 samples, 2 genotypes:  M202 and 202(Sub1), 2 conditions:  unsubmerged and 3d whole shoot submergence, 5 time points:  desubmergence (at midday following 3d submergence), dusk, midnight, dawn, midday (24 hours after desubmergence). 3 bioreplicates.  Unsubmerged plants only sequenced for at desubmergence time point.

PLATFORM
GPL18525 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Oryza sativa Japonica Group)
