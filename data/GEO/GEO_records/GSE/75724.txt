Interleukin-23-induced transcription factor Blimp1 promotes pathogenicity of T helper 17 cells

SUMMARY
Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine required for the pathogenicity of T  helper 17 (Th17) cells but the molecular mechanisms governing this process remain  unclear. We identified the transcription factor Blimp-1 (Prdm1) as a key IL-23-induced  factor that drove the inflammatory function of Th17 cells. In contrast to thymic deletion  of Blimp-1, which causes T cell development defects and spontaneous autoimmunity,  peripheral deletion of this transcription factor resulted in reduced Th17 activation and  reduced severity of autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Furthermore, genome wide  occupancy and overexpression studies in Th17 cells revealed that Blimp-1 co-localized  with transcription factors RORγt, STAT-3 and p300 at the Il23r, Il17a/f and Csf2  cytokine loci to enhance their expression. Blimp-1 also directly bound to and repressed  cytokine loci Il2 and Bcl6. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Blimp-1 is an  essential transcription factor downstream of IL-23 that acts in concert with RORγt to  activate the Th17 inflammatory program.
