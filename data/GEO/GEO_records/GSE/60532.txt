TITLE
plant rabt n°1-Plant RABT n°1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
adt12-01_uprt - plant rabt n°1 - Impact of RNA labeling by Plant RABT on plant transcriptome - Determine the incidence of RNA marking by the RABT method Plantation on the plants transcriptome. In several studies Clearly et al. have described a method referred as " 4TU tagging " which can be use to study mRNA synthesis and decay either in a mixed population of cells or in a specific cell type (Cleary, Meiering et al. 2005, Zeiner, Cleary et al. 2008, Miller, Robinson et al. 2009, Rabani et al., 2011). Through the specific cell type expression in drosophila and mammalian cells of theToxoplasma gondii uracil PhosphoribosylTransferase activity and the metabolization of the uracil analog 4-thiouracil (4 TU), mRNA were selectively tagged, purified and used in microarray based analysis.

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison
