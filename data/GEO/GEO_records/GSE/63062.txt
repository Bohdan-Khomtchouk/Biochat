TITLE
Expression data from GNMT and MAT1A knockout models that develop all the stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease including hepatocellular carcinoma [MAT1A_15months]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver global gene expression patterns of 15-month-old MAT1A knockout mice histopathologically determined to have hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 5 samples are of tumoral tissue and 5 samples are of peritumoral tissue. All these have their respective wild type patterns. These were analyzed to define signatures to study the pathogenesis of NAFLD-derived HCC, explore which subtypes of cancers can be investigated using mouse models and define a signature of HCC differential survival that can be used to characterize HCC subtypes of different survival derived from mixed etiologies.

DESIGN
MAT1A-knockout mice liver tumoral and peritumoral tissue samples having hepatocellular carcinoma were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
