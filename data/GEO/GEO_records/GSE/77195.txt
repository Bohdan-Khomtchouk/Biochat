TITLE
IL-33 regulates metaplasia and macrophage polarization in the stomach.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Alternatively-activated macrophages (M2) are known to play a critical role in intestinalization of spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM), which is a precursor to gastric adenocarcinoma.  However, the precise mechanism(s) and critical mediators produced by M2 macrophages that lead to SPEM are unknown.  Using established murine models of metaplasia in the stomach, the aim of the present study was to determine how M2 macrophages induce intestinalized SPEM.  Macrophages from the stomach corpus of mice with SPEM (DMP-777-treated) or advanced intestinalized SPEM (L635-treated) were isolated and RNA sequencing was performed. IL-33 was the most upregulated cytokine in macrophages associated with intestinalized SPEM.  L635-treated IL-33 knock out mice did not develop metaplasia, suggesting that IL-33 is required for the induction of SPEM after acute parietal cell loss. While the loss of IL-33 did not reduce macrophage recruitment into the mucosa, infiltrating macrophages were not M2 polarized.  We conclude that IL-33 is necessary for both the induction of mucous metaplasia (SPEM) in the stomach and polarization towards M2 in recruited macrophages.   Our data suggest that the inflammatory pathway in the stomach after parietal cell loss resembles pathways associated with allergy-induced airway inflammation, which implicates novel treatment options for gastritis patients to prevent gastric cancer.

DESIGN
FAC sorted macrophages (F4/80 positive cells) isolated from the corpus in mice treated with DMP-777 and L635 to induce SPEM and intestinalized SPEM respectively for RNA sequencing.
