TITLE
miRNAs expression in spinal cords of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated as fine-tuning regulators controlling diverse biological processes at the level of posttranscriptional repression. Dysregulation of miRNAs has been described in various disease states, including inflammatory autoimmune diseases. By using high-throughput microRNA profiling analysis, we identified a series of miRNAs dysregulated in local inflammatory lesions of human patients with autoimmune diseases, as well as their relevant mouse models such as EAE.

DESIGN
We isolated the spinal cords pooled from six EAE mice or from six naïve control mice. Total RNA was extracted for the TaqMan® Low Density Assay v3.0

PLATFORM
GPL15466 TaqMan® Rodent MicroRNA Array v3.0 A/B
