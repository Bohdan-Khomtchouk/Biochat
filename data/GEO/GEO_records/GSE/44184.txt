TITLE
Genome scale analysis of host-virus mRNA differential expression in Helicoverpa zea insect cells infected by H. armigera baculovirus from early till late infection

ORGANISM
Helicoverpa zea

SUMMARY
A custom microarray, based on deep transcriptome sequencing ((GEO accession number: GSE34418), was used to simultaneously investigate expression of over 24,000 Helicoverpa zea insect transcripts and 134 H. armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) genes throughout the infection process at 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours post infection

DESIGN
A cutom 8x60,000 SurePrint Agilent expression slide (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA)  was used to analyzed eight samples, including biological replicates of HaSNPV-infected cultures at 0, 12, 24 and 48 hpi.The microarray probes included probes for 27,400 H. zea sequences that were validated previously (Nguyen et al., 2012. PLOS ONE, 7(5), e36324) and all 134 H. armigera single-capsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) genes (Accession: NC_002654).
