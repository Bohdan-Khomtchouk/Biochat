TITLE
β-catenin signaling is a critical event in ErbB2-mediated mammary tumor progression.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although ERBB2 amplification and overexpression is correlated with poor outcome in breast cancer, the molecular mechanisms underlying the aggressive nature of these tumors has not been fully elucidated. To investigate this further, we have used a transgenic mouse model of ErbB2-driven tumor progression (ErbB2KI model) that recapitulates clinically relevant events, including selective amplification of the core erbB2 amplicon. By comparing the transcriptional profiles of ErbB2KI mammary tumors and human ERBB2-positive breast cancers, we demonstrate that ErbB2KI tumors possess molecular features of the basal subtype of ERBB2-positive human breast cancer, including activation of canonical β-catenin signaling. Inhibition of β-catenin-dependent signaling in ErbB2KI-derived tumor cells using RNA interference impaired tumor initiation and metastasis. Furthermore, treatment of ErbB2KI or human ERBB2-overexpressing tumor cells with a selective β-catenin/CBP inhibitor significantly decreased proliferation and ErbB2 expression. Collectively, our data indicate that ERBB2-mediated breast cancer progression requires β-catenin signaling and can be therapeutically targeted by selective β-catenin/CBP inhibitors.

DESIGN
Common reference design. 9 samples (including 2 normal tissue, 2 NIC tumors, and 5 KI tumor tissue samples) replicated twice as dye swaps, generating a total of 18 arrays.
