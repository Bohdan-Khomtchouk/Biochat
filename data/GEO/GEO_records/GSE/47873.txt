TITLE
Gene expression profiles MCF-10A cells overexpressing MBD2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylated DNA binding protein 2 (MBD2) has been shown to bind specific methylated promoters and suppress transcription. Here we systematically investigate MBD2 suppression by overexpressing MBD2 in MCF-10A cells and generating gene expression profiles of overexpressing cells and normal MCF-10A cells.

DESIGN
MCF-10A cells were infected with MBD2 lentivirus in order to increase MBD2 expression. Total RNA was extracted from both infected and non-infected cells and hybridized to Affymetrix gene expression microarrays. Three technical replicates were hybridized for infected and non-infected cells.
