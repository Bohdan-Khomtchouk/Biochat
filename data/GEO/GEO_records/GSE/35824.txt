TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation study in bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were determined on a set of fresh 44 bladder cancer tissues using normal blood as control. DNA amplicons were prepared using Differential Methylation Hybridization (DMH) method, subsequently hybridized on to the Agilent Human CpG island Microarray. The goal was to unravel the DNA methylation patterns in different subgropus of bladder cancer along with finding markers for progresssion and early diagnosis.

DESIGN
44 bladder cancer tissues were profiled against commercially available normal human genomic blood DNA (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as a reference

PLATFORM
GPL4126 Agilent-014791 Human CpG Island ChIP-on-Chip Microarray 244K (G4492A) (Feature Number version)
