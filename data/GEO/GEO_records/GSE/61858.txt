TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of mouse lungs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
2 IL-15 KO AND 2 C57BL/6 mice were injected with 5X10^5 cells of the polyoma Middle T (pMT) primary breast tumor cell line intraveneously(IV).  2 days post injection, the lungs were harvested and one lobe of the lung was used to extract RNA from.  We then utilized the SABBiosciences RT^2 Profiler PCR Array for Mouse cytokines and Chemokines to determine levels of cytokine/chemokines that were different in these 2 mice at this time point.  We were interested in the immune responses that may change in response to tumor cells entering and establishing in the lung (as a model of metastasis) in the presence or absence of IL-15.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profilling performed on the lungs 2 IL-15 KO(test) and 2 C57BL/6 (control), 2 days post IV tumor cell injection.  Equal amounts of total RNA per subject were used in the assay.
