TITLE
RNA sequencing analysis of NGFR ablation in both p53-positive and negative non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the gene expression profiles by NGFR knockdown in H460 and H1299 cell lines and reveal that NGFR ablation activates p53 target gene expression.

DESIGN
We examined gene expression in two different non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines, one with wild-type p53 and the other without p53.

PLATFORM
