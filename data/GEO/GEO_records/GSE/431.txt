TITLE
pmr4 vs. wild-type (May, 2003)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
There were two genotypes: (1)	Columbia-0, wild-type (C) (2)	 pmr4-1 mutant (P), callose synthase deficient mutant (Vogel and Somerville (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 97: 1897). There were two treatments: (1)	uninoculated (U) (2)	3 days after inoculation with the powdery mildew pathogen, Erysiphe cichoracearum, race UCSC (I). There were four biological replicates, labeled 1, 2, 3 or 4. Examples of the sample labels are: CU1 = Columbia-0, uninoculated, replicate 1 CI2 = Columbia-0, 3 days after inoculation with powdery mildew, replicate 2 PU3 = pmr4-1, uninoculated, replicate 3 PI4 = pmr4-1, 3 days after inoculation with powdery mildew, replicate 4. In total, there were 16 Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips (2 genotypes x 2 treatments x 4 biological replicates). Keywords: repeat sample
