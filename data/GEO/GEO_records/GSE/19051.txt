TITLE
Gene expression based analysis of CroV infection of Cafeteria roenbergensis

ORGANISM
Cafeteria roenbergensis ; Cafeteria roenbergensis virus BV-PW1

SUMMARY
In this study, total RNA was extracted from cultures of Cafeteria infected with the Cafeteria roenbergensis virus BV-PW1 (CroV) and hybridised to a CroV microarray in order to determine the temporal expression profile during infection.

DESIGN
A straightforward measure of whether each spot was on or off was determined as the infection progressed starting at 0 h post infection (control), then 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h pi. Oligonucleotides 50-70 bp in length were designed for 452 predicted CroV ORFs and printed onto amino silane treated glass slides.
