TITLE
Profiling of Gene Expression in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial disease of unknown cause. It remains impractical to conduct early diagnosis and predict IPF progression just based on gene expression information. Moreover, the relationship between gene expression and quantitative phenotypic value in IPF keeps controversial. To identify biomarkers to predict survival in IPF, we profiled protein-coding gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We linked the gene expression level with the quantitative phenotypic variation in IPF, including diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and forced vital capacity (FVC) percent predicted. In silico analyses on the expression profiles and quantitative phenotypic data allowed for the generation of a set of IPF molecular signature that predicted survival of IPF effectively.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from PBMCs using standard molecular biology protocols without DNA contamination or RNA degradation. Sample processing (e.g., cDNA generation, fragmentation, end labeling, hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays) was performed per manufacturerâ€™s instructions. A total of 45 healthy controls and 70 IPF patients were included in the microarray analysis.
