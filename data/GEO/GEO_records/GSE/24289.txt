TITLE
Expression data from differentiating ES cells expressing miR-200c and miR-141

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ES cells express the miR-200 family which becomes down-regulated during the course of differentiation in serum.  We generated an ES cell line which expresses miR-200c and miR-141 upon addition of doxycycline. Microarrays were used to gain a global picture of differentiation when miR-200c and miR-141 expression were maintained throughout differentiation through the addition of doxycycline.

DESIGN
A2.miR200c ES cells, which express miR-200c/miR-141 upon addition of doxycycline, were differentiated as embryoid bodies in six petri dishes.  Half of the samples were treated with doxycycline on both days 2 and 4 of differentiation, and RNA was collected from all samples on days 3, 4, and 5.
