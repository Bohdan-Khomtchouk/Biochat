TITLE
Chronic nicotine exposure (kuo-affy-human-232930)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The long-term goal of this project is to establish whether and how chronic nicotine exposure affects nervous system function.  The biological targets of nicotine action are diverse members of the superfamily of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR).  nAChR play multiple, critical roles in chemical signaling throughout the brain and body.  They also must be involved in nicotine dependence, which drives tobacco product use responsible for tremendous economic and personal costs. To define changes in gene expression induced by nicotine exposure in a model neuronal cell lines expressing at least two nicotinic receptor subtypes. Nicotine exposure exerst at least some of its effects on nervous system function by altering gene expression. Cells of the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma will be exposed to an efficacious dose of nicotine or to control medium for two different periods. Keywords: time-course
