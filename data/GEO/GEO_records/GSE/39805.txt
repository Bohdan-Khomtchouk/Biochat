TITLE
Heterobasidion annosum gene expression from different tissues and mycelium grown on different substrates and under different biotic and abiotic stresses

ORGANISM
Heterobasidion annosum

SUMMARY
Transcript profiles of H. annosum from different tissues and mycelium grown on different substrates and under different stresses were analyzed. The array probes were designed from gene models taken from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI, Department of Energy) H. irregulare genome sequence version 1. One aim of this study was to compare gene expression profiles of H. annosum grown on different substrates and under different biotic and abiotic stresses.

DESIGN
We performed  hybridizations (NimbleGen) with samples derived from H. annosum grown in either liquid Malt Extract Medium at 20°C (three biological replicates), under NaCl stress (three biological replicates), under CaCl2 stress (three biological replicates), at 8°C (three biological replicates), at 27°C (three biological replicates), saprotrophic growth on Scots pine sapwood (three biological replicates), bark (three biological replicates) or heartwood (three biological replicates). Additional hybridizations were performed with RNA from necrotrophic growth of Heterobasidion on Scots pine xylem (three biological replicates), necrotrophic growth on Scots pine phloem (three biological replicates), under nutrient starvation (three biological replicates) or under oxidative stress (three biological replicates). The Heterobasidion irregulare custom-exon expression array (4 x 72K) manufactured by Roche NimbleGen Systems Limited (Madison, WI) ( ) contained five independent, non-identical, 60-mer probes per gene model coding sequence. For 12,199 of the 12,299 annotated protein-coding gene models, probes could be designed. For 19 gene models, no probes could be generated, and 81 gene models shared all five probes with other gene models. Included in the array were 916 random 60-mer control probes and labelling controls. For 2032 randomly chosen gene models, technical duplicates were included on the array.
