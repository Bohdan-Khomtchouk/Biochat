TITLE
Expression data from 2 wildtype and 8 C. elegans ETC mutants

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Utilizing C. elegans as a model of mitochondrial dysfunction provides insight into cellular adaptations which occur as a consequence of genetic alterations causative of human disease.  We characterized genome-wide expression profiles of hypomorphic C. ele Our goal was to detect concordant changes among clusters of genes that comprise defined metabolic pathways utilizing gene set enrichment analysis. Keywords: Wildtype vs mutant comparison as a method for studying contributors to disease processes
