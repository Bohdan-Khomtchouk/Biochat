TITLE
De novo characterization of alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) transcriptome shedding light on gene expression under potassium deprivation

ORGANISM
Alternanthera philoxeroides

SUMMARY
We use solexa sequencing technology to analysis root transcriptome of alligator weed during 7 d potassium deficiency. Further analysis suggested that 9,253 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were up-regulated and 2,138 DEGs were down-regulated after potassium deficiency for 7 days, including 121 transcription factors, 108 kinases, 146 transporters, and 178 genes that were related to stress. Our results afford a valuable resource for genetic and genomic research on plant potassium deficiency.
