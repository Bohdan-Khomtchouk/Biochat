TITLE
small RNA libraries from petals of Antirrhinum majus (sulf mutant and wild-type revertants)

ORGANISM
Antirrhinum majus

SUMMARY
Our aim was to study quantitative and qualitative small RNA differences between sulf and SULF+ plants. We used sulf-660 and its revertant, derived by transposon excision from the sulf-660 allele, to minimise background variation and highlight key differences associated with the SULF locus.

DESIGN
Four HD sRNA libraries were prepared; 2 from A. majus line JI660 (sulf) and 2 from JI661 (SULF+ Revertant). Each library comprised 5-6 corollas harvested from 2-3 plants (buds of 10-30 mm).
