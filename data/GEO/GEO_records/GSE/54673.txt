TITLE
Bile acid flux is necessary for normal liver regeneration

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Bile acid return from the intestine and attendant signaling is necessary for liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy or CCl4 injury

DESIGN
Three groups of rat liver were examined at 4 time points (0, 4h, 12h, 24h) after partial hepatectomy; RNA from whole rat liver was isolated and deep sequencing was performed using the Illumina TruSeq platform

PLATFORM
GPL14844 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Rattus norvegicus)
