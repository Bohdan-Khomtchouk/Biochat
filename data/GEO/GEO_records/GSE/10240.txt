TITLE
Primary Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells (HBEs) Stimulated with IL-22 and IL-17

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary HBE cells were stimulated with IL-22 and IL-17, and gene expression was studied using an Affymetrix platform microarray, in order to investigate which genes may be upregulated or downregulated in response to these cytokines.  Of particular interest was the host defense genes such as antimicrobial peptides, which have been shown to be upregulated by IL-22 and IL-17 in skin keratinocytes. Keywords: cytokine effect

DESIGN
There were 4 conditions to this study (media, IL-22, IL-17 and IL-22+17) and there were 3 biological replicates of each condition. Gene expression study using one timepoint of 24 hours after stimulating these primary cells with the above conditions
