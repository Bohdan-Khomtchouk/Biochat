TITLE
Differential Gene expression in CCR5+ versus CCR5- OT-I T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
OT-I T cells were exposed to CpG ODN-activated CCR5ko Lymph nodes for 6 h, stained for surface CCR5 and FACS-sorted into CCR5+ and CCR5- fractions

DESIGN
In the study presented here freshly isolated OT1 T cells were exposed for 6h at 37oC to teased-out CpG ODN-activated CCR5ko LNs in 96-well plates and stained for surface CCR5 before sorting into CCR5+ (Hua2) and CCR5- (Hua1) fractions. High quality total RNA isolated from each cell fraction using TRIZOL and Qiagen RNEasy kit per manufacture's recommendation was subjected to microarray analysis using the Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 1.0 array chip to discover differentially expressed genes.
