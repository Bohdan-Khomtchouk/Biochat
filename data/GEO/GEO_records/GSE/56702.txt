TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains deleted for the THSC/TREX-2 subunits Thp1, Sac3 and Sus1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcription is a major obstacle for replication fork progression and a cause of genome instability. Such instability increases in mutants with a suboptimal assembly of the nascent messenger ribonucleo-protein particle (mRNP), as THO/TREX and the NPC-associated THSC/TREX-2 complex. We used microarrays to analyze the global impact of THSC/TREX-2 in gene expression and found that Thp1 and Sac3 depletion has a functional impact in highly-expressed, long and G+C-rich genes regardless of their function

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae strains were grown in YPD liquid culture, total RNA was isolated and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays
