TITLE
Effect of Itolizumab on gene expression profiles of patients enrolled in phase 2 psoriasis clinical trial study (Study number: T1hAb‐CT1‐001‐07).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Punch biopsies of patients enrolled in phase II clinical trial study was obtained at various time points. Skin biopsies from 16 responders and 8 non responders and partial responders, chosen after the completion of clinical trial, was evaluated before Itolizumab treatment (Day 1) and at Day 57. Responders had a PASI improvement > 75% while non responders had a PASI improvement < 60%. The gene expression values at Day 57 were normalised with values obtained at Day 1 of the respective patient sample. The genes with a minimum fold change of 1.8 spontaneously clustered into predominantly responders and non responders.
