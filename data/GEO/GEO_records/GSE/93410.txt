TITLE
Expression data from radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (RIPF) is one of the most common side effects of lung cancer radiotherapy. In the mouse lungs developing RIPF, excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix and myofibroblasts with scar formation occurs. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying development of radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis and identified a variety of genes whose expression were up-regulated during this process.

DESIGN
Seven-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to thoracic irradiation. After 25 weeks, animals were euthanized and lung samples were harvested. Development of radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis was confirmed by western blotting for Î±-smooth muscle actin and hematoxylin and eosin staining.
