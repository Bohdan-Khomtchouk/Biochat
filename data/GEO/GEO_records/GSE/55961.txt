TITLE
MeDIP chip from ZOS and ZOSM osteosarcoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epigenetic change of genes expression, including hypomethylation-linked activation of oncogenes and hypermethylation-associated inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, can affect almost all the cellular signaling pathways that participate in cancer initiation and progression. Unlike genetic alterations, epigenetic changes are potentially reversible, making them attractive and promising targets for therapeutic intervention. Studies indicated that abnormal DNA methylation is involved in dysregulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation of osteosarcoma. However, epigenetic mechanisms of osteosarcoma metastasis remain largely unknown.

DESIGN
MeDIP chips are performed in ZOS and ZOSMâ€”two syngeneic primary human osteosarcoma cell lines with low and high metastatic potential which are established in our lab

PLATFORM
GPL16378 NimbleGen Human DNA Methylation 3x720K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Array [100718_HG18_CpG_Refseq_Prom_MeDIP]
