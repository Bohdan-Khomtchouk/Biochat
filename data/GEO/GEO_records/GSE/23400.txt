TITLE
Global gene expression profiling and validation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an aggressive tumor with poor prognosis.  Understanding molecular changes in ESCC should improve identification of risk factors in molecular subtypes and provide potential targets for early detection and therapy.  To better characterize molecular changes in ESCC, we followed up a previous cDNA array study with additional discovery and confirmatory studies in new ESCC cases using alternative methods.  We profiled global gene expression (Affymetrix U133A/B chip) for discovery and confirmation, and validated selected dysregulated genes with additional RNA (qRT-PCR, N=51) or protein studies (immunohistochemistry [IHC] of tumor tissue microarray [TMA], N=275).We also found genes associated with survival. The dysregulated genes should aid in identifying risk factors in ESCC, as well as potential targets for early detection, and outcome prediction and therapy.

DESIGN
53 ESCC samples and 53 matched normal samples were analyzed (samples AE43 and AE45 were not run on HG-U133B due to not having enough material). Contributors have chosen not to include the clinical phenotypes in their GEO submission.
