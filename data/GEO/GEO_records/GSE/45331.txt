TITLE
Expression array analysis of myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) muscle biopsies versus controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The hypothesis was that different genes are abnormally expressed in DM2 biopsies compared to controls.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from DM2 vastus lateralis biopsies and compared to vastus lateralis control biopsies.
