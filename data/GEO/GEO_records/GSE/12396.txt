Vitamin D3/Hoxa10 pathway supports Mafb function during the monocyte differentiation of human CD34++ hematopoietic cells

SUMMARY
Although a considerable number of reports indicate an involvement of the Hox-A10 gene in the molecular control of hematopoiesis, the conclusions of such studies are quite controversial since they support, in some cases, a role in the stimulation of stem cell self-renewal and myeloid progenitor expansion while, in others, implicate this transcription factor in the induction of monocyte - macrophage differentiation. To clarify this issue we analyzed the biological effects and the transcriptome changes determined in human primary CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors by retroviral transduction of a full length Hox-A10 cDNA. The results obtained clearly indicated that this homeogene is an inducer of monocyte differentiation, at least partly acting through the up-regulation of MafB gene, recently identified as master regulator of such maturation pathway. By using a combined approach based on computational analysis, EMSA experiments and luciferase assays, we were able to demonstrate the presence of a Hox-A10 binding site in the promoter region of the MafB gene, which suggested the likely molecular mechanism underlying the observed effect. Interestingly, stimulation of the same cells with the Vitamin D3 monocyte differentiation inducer resulted in a clear increase of Hox-A10 and MafB transcripts, indicating the existence of a precise transactivation cascade involving VDR, Hox-A10 and MafB transcription factors. Altogether these data allow to conclude that the Vitamin D3 / Hox-A10 pathway supports MafB function during the induction of monocyte differentiation.
