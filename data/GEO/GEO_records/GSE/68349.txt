TITLE
ChIPseq analyses in germinal center B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Germinal center B cells were isolated from human tonsil tissue and crosslinked. ChIP was performed on two distinct pools of germinal center cells, each obtained from 3-5 donors.

DESIGN
The experiment includes two biological replicates (germinal center cell pools from different donors). ChIP was performed on both pools and subject to library preparation and sequencing. Input DNA was sequenced for both pools.
