TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Drosophila neural stem cells reveals a transcriptional network for self-renewal.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila neuroblasts have emerged as a model for stem cell biology that is ideal for genetic analysis but is limited by the lack of cell-type specific gene expression data. Here, we describe a methodology to isolate large numbers of pure neuroblasts and differentiating neurons that retain both cell cycle and lineage characteristics. We determine transcriptional profiles by mRNA sequencing and identify 28 predicted neuroblast specific transcription factors, which can be arranged in a network containing hubs for Notch signaling, growth control and chromatin regulation. Overexpression and RNAi for these factors identify Klumpfuss as a regulator of self-renewal. We show that loss of Klu function causes premature differentiation while overexpression results in the formation of transplantable brain tumors. Our data represent a valuable resource for Drosophila developmental neurobiology and we describes methodology that can be applied to other invertebrate stem cell lineages as well.
