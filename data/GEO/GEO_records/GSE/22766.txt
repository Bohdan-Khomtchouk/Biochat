TITLE
Empty-vector control and transgenic 35S-PaWRKY1 Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of genes regulated by PaWRKY1 transcription factor A PaWRKY transcription factor from orchid plants is expressed in Arabidopsis, and the PaWRKY-regulated genes are studied

DESIGN
Comparison of empty-vector control and transgenic 35S-PaWRKY1 Arabidopsis Affymetrix GeneChip assay were performed by the Affymetrix Gene Expression Service Lab ( ), supported by Academia Sinica, Taiwan
