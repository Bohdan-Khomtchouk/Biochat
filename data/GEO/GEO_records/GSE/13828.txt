TITLE
Induced pluripotent stem cells from a spinal muscular atrophy patient

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the most common inherited forms of neurological disease leading to infant mortality.  Patients exhibit selective loss of lower motor neurons resulting in muscle weakness, paralysis, and often death.  Although patient fibroblasts have been used extensively to study SMA, motor neurons have a unique anatomy and physiology which may underlie their vulnerability to the disease process.  Here we report the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from skin fibroblast samples taken from a child with SMA.  These cells expanded robustly in culture, maintained the disease genotype, and generated motor neurons that showed selective deficits compared to those derived from the childâ€™s unaffected mother.  This is the first study to show human iPS cells can be used to model the specific pathology seen in a genetically inherited disease.  As such, it represents a promising resource to study disease mechanisms, screen novel drug compounds, and develop new therapies.

DESIGN
A total of 10 samples were hybridized to the human genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip arrays carrying 54,675 probe sets (Affimetrix). H1L, H7, H9, H13B, and H14A embryonic stem cells are controls for the iPS cells iPS(SMA) 3.5 and iPS(SMA)3.6 are from the patient. The clone iPS(SMA) 4.2. is from the parent.
