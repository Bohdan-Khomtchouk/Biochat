TITLE
Differential Gene Expression and Alternative Isoform Regulation in caper mutant embryos compared to wild-type

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We find that Caper dysfunction leads to differential expression of many genes associated with neural development, as well as alternative exon usage, as compared to control embryos.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq was performed on Drosophila OreR and caperCC01391 embryos using 3 biological replicates. Differential gene expression and alternative isoform regulation was performed.

PLATFORM
GPL17275 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
