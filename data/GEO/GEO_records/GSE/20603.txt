TITLE
MicroRNA miR-16 is anti-proliferative in enterocytes and exhibits diurnal rhythmicity in intestinal crypts

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This is the first report to document circadian rhythmicity of specific microRNAs in rat jejunum. Our data provide a link between the anti-proliferative microRNA miR-16 and the intestinal proliferation rhythm and point to miR-16 as an important regulator of proliferation in jejunal crypts. This function may be essential to match proliferation and absorptive capacity with nutrient availability.

DESIGN
Time course data with 7 time points and 3 replicates per time point. Each 2-color array is hybridized against a reference from time point 0, and dye swaps are included.

PLATFORM
GPL10124 Exiqon miRCURY LNA microRNA array v.8.1
