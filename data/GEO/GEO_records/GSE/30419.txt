TITLE
Mesenchymal stem cells and neural crest stem cells from adult bone marrow: characterization of their surprising similarities and differences

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The generation of neuronal cells from stem cells obtained from adult bone marrow is of significant clinical interest in order to design new cell therapy protocols for several neurological disorders.  The recent identification in adult bone marrow of stem cells derived from the neural crests (NCSCs) might explain the neuronal phenotypic plasticity shown by bone marrow cells.  However, little information is available about the nature of these cells compared to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), their similarities and differences.  In this paper, using transcriptomic as well as proteomic technologies, we have compared NCSC to MSC and stromal nestin-positive cells, all of them isolated from adult bone marrow.  We demonstrated that the nestin-positive cell population, which was the first to be described as able to differentiate into functional neurons, was a mixed population of NCSC and MSC.  More interestingly, we demonstrated that MSC share with NCSC the same ability to truly differentiate into Tuj1-positive cells when co-cultivated with paraformaldehyde-fixed cerebellar granule neurons.  Altogether, those results suggest that both NCSCs and MSCs can be considered as important tools for cellular therapies in order to replace neurons in various neurological diseases.

DESIGN
Two sets of samples (NCSC and MSC), three biological replicates. This submission represents the gene expression component of the study.
