TITLE
Gene transcription signature of obesity in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Obesity is thought to contribute to worse disease outcome in breast cancer as a result of increased levels of adipocyte-secreted endocrine factors, insulin, and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) that accelerate tumor cell proliferation and impair treatment response. We examined the effects of patient obesity on primary breast tumor gene expression, by profiling transcription of a set of tumors for which the patients’ body mass index (BMI) was ascertained. Sample profiles were stratified according to patients’ obesity phenotype defined as normal (BMI < 25), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), or obese (BMI > 30).  Widespread alterations in gene expression were evident in breast tumors from obese patients as compared to tumors from other patients, allowing us to define an obesity-associated cancer transcriptional signature of 662 genes. Keywords: two group comparison

DESIGN
Primary breast tumor specimens were obtained from patients. Study volunteers completed questionnaires used to define historically normal (BMI < =24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), or obese (BMI > =30) patient categories according to established WHO criteria.
