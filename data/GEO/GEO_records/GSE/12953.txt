TITLE
Identification of the calcium-responsive genes dependent on CrzA in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used to identify the calcium-responsive genes dependent on CrzA in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. In order to identify such genes, we conducted the two types of experiment. One was a comparison between  wild type with calcium treatment and wild type without calcium treatment. Another was a comparison between wild type with calcium treatment and crzA mutant with calcium treatment. From a comparison between the results of these experiments, we could identify the genes whose expression was induced or repressed in response to calcium in a manner dependent on CrzA. KEY WORD; Aspergillus nidulans, calcium response, crzA
