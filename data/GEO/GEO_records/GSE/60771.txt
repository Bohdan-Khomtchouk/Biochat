TITLE
Testing gene expression changes in VCaP upon depletion of the mutated ETS transcription factor ERG

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
VCaP cells expressing inducible shRNAs for either ERG or a non-targeting control were treated with Doxycycline for 1, 3, 7 and 10 days prior to collection This experiment is designed to see which genes and pathways are modulated by ERG knockdown

DESIGN
VCaP cells stably expressing a Doxycycline (dox)-inducible control nontargeting shRNA (Pak4) or an ERG shRNA (2217) were exposed to 100ng/ml Dox for the noted days.
