TITLE
Identification of candidate neuroblastoma genes by combining genomic and expression microarrays: expression data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis was performed on 30 Neuroblastomas to identify genes whose transcription is significantly altered by recurrent chromosomal alterations. Genomic copy number losses and gains had been delineated in the tumours using FISH and SNP arrays. We have identified genes significantly altered by 7 recurrent alterations: 1p, 3p, 4p, 10q and 11q loss, 2p and 17q gain, and genes co-amplified and over-expressed as a result of MYCN amplification. Identifying genes whose expression is consistently altered by chromosomal gains or losses is an important step in defining genes of biological relevance in a wide variety of tumour types. However, additional criteria are needed to discriminate further among the large number of candidate genes identified. This is particularly true for neuroblastoma, where multiple genomic copy number changes of proven prognostic value exist. We have used Affymetrix microarrays and a combination of fluorescent in-situ hybridisation and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays to establish expression profiles and delineate copy number alterations in 30 primary neuroblastomas. Keywords: Disease State Analysis

DESIGN
30 neuroblastomas were obtained from patients of all stages (10 patients - stage 1, 2, 3 or 4s disease, 20 patients - stage 4 disease). RNA samples were extracted and analysed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. Patient were treated according to the United Kingdom Childrenâ€™s Cancer Study Group [UKCCSG], European Neuroblastoma Study Group and Localised Neuroblastoma European Study Group protocols.
