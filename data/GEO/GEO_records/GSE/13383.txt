TITLE
Expression data from 1h red light versus dark 7-day-old Arabidopsis whole seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Red light can affect a variety of responses in Arabidopsis.  We characterize the early gene expression patterns of seedlings exposed to 1 hour of red light using a small sized sample of 5, 7-day-old seedlings and also performed dark controls. Methods that were developed for tissue extraction and labeling for microarrays were tested using these samples Keywords: 1 time point

DESIGN
Only 5, 7 day-old dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings were treated as described and harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We pooled samples from one Petri plate with MS medium 2% sucrose.  Treatment was 1 hour of red light 630 nm (max) and dark controls
