TITLE
Expression data from 1h red light versus dark 7-day-old Arabidopsis whole seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Red light can affect a variety of responses in Arabidopsis.  We characterize the early gene expression patterns of seedlings exposed to 1 hour of red light using a small sized sample of 5, 7-day-old seedlings and also performed dark controls. Methods that were developed for tissue extraction and labeling for microarrays were tested using these samples Keywords: 1 time point
