TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of vitamin D receptor (VDR) target genes in THP-1 monocytic leucemia cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of primary target genes of vitamin D receptor (VDR) in an immune-related cellular model (THP-1 cells) to study, in conjunction with VDR binding data from ChIP-seq, the genome-wide mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by VDR.

DESIGN
THP-1 cells were treated 4 h either with 0.1% ethanol (vehicle, control) or 1Î±,25(OH)2D3 (1,25D)

PLATFORM
GPL6102 Illumina human-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
