TITLE
Epigenetic natural variation in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Ecotype-specific differences in genome methylation were assayed in Arabidopsis Col and Ler variations using genomic tiling microarrays. Comparative genome hybridization was also performed so that the contribution of ecotype-specific amplifications and deletions could be estimated and integrated into the analysis of differential DNA methylation. Keywords: methylation analysis and comparative genome hybridization

DESIGN
Methylation analysis of the two ecotypes as well as the CGH was performed in independent experiments consisting of 3 replicated dye reversal experiments each for a total of 6 measurements per probe per experiment.
