TITLE
Novel antioxidative peptides with potential to reduce psoriatic changes in PBMCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oxidative damage contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. We recently developed antioxidative peptides (UPF peptides) activating the endogenous glutathione system (GSH). In the present study, we analyzed gene expression profiles in the samples of psoriasis patients to find if these peptides could reduce oxidative damage during psoriasis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with psoriasis and from healthy controls were collected and cultivated. Cultured PBMCs were incubated with two different UPF peptides for 12 hours. Gene expression analysis was performed with Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays and with quantitative real-time PCR. Gene expression profile in the PBMCs of patients with psoriasis indicated significant up-regulation of the immune response pathway. Treatment with UPF peptides normalized the gene expression pattern in psoriasis samples. Therefore, treatment with antioxidative drugs have potential anti-psoriatic activity.

DESIGN
5 healthy controls (C1-5), 5 psoriasis patients (P1-5), 2 different drugs (upf17 peptide, upf1 peptide) and a control drug. Overall, 30 samples and six groups: PSOR, PSORUPF1, PSORUPF17, CON, CONUPF1, CONUPF17.
