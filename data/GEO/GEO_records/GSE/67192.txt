TITLE
Role of AcsR in expression of the acetly-CoA synthetase gene in Vibrio vulnificus

ORGANISM
Vibrio vulnificus

SUMMARY
VarS/A is one of the global factors regulating diverse aspects of metabolism and virulence of bacteria including pathogenic Vibrio spp. An experiment to identify VarS/A-regulon in V. vulnificus revealed that a putative LuxR-type transcriptional regulator was down-regulated in Î”varA mutant. To investigate the roles of this regulatory cascade from VarS/A to a LuxR-type regulator in V. vulnificus, the target gene regulated by a LuxR-regulator was identified and its expression was characterized.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment, Mo6 vs acsR, Mo6 vs VarA. Biological replicates: 9 wild-type strain, 4 acsR deletion mutant strain, 5 varA deletion mutant strain, independently grown and harvested. Please note that 'wild-type Mo6 vs acsR mutant replicate 1' sample was hybridized to the 30K platform chip while the others were hybridized to the 15K platform Therefore, the 'MO6 vs acsR_1.gpr' has 30,755 data rows (while  the other files have 16,355). The 30K platform chip is made of duplication of the 15K platform chip with the same probes.

PLATFORM
GPL19927 Vibrio vulnificus MO6-24_30K
