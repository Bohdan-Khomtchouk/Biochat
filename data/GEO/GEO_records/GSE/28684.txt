TITLE
Affymetrix 500K SNP array data for Primary Effusion Lymphoma samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix 500K array was used to determine gross genomic aberrations in a panel of Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL) cell lines, specifically focusing on chromosome 10, which includes the Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN) locus.

DESIGN
10 PEL cell lines were hybridized to the Affymetrix 500K array where non-PEL B-cell lymphoma cell lines BJAB and DG75 were used as controls. The data was analyzed using Partek Genomic Suite software and compared to normal tonsil controls.
