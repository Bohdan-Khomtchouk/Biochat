TITLE
Acute (2 hr) response to rxLeptin injection in preoptic area/hypothalamus/pituitary of juvenile Xenopus laevis

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Leptin binding to the leptin receptor (LepR) causes rapid signaling to the nucleus. We investigated the early (2 hr) transcriptional response to acute leptin injectio (intracerebroventricular) in the preoptic area/hypothalamus/pituitary of juvenile Xenopus laevis frogs.

DESIGN
Frogs were given i.c.v. injections of 0.6% saline or recombinant X. laevis leptin (rxLeptin; 20 ng/g BW) and 2 hrs later killed and the preoptic area/hypothalamus/pituitary dissected.
