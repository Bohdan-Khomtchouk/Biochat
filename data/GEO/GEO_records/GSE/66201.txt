TITLE
Transcriptomic responses in Arabidopsis thaliana to PIPL3 peptide treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In order to investigate possible roles of IDL and PIP/PIPL peptides, the transcriptomic response of Arabidopsis seedlings to treatment with PIPL3 peptide was analysed. PIPL3 (At4g37295) was chosen, as no functional data was available for this peptide; furthermore, PIPL3 was expressed in leaf tissue during seedling stages. Transcriptomic responses to 3 hours PIPL3 peptide treatment suggested a role in regulation of biotic stress responses and cell wall modification.

DESIGN
Two weeks old seedlings were treated either with 100 nM PIPL3 peptide (treated) or 100 nM mock peptide (control) and whole rosettes were harvested 3 hours after treatment. 4 biological replicates per treatment.
