TITLE
Investigating the changes in gene expression of liver tissue exposed to phenanthrene over 72hr

ORGANISM
Pimephales promelas

SUMMARY
FHM were exposed to 29ng/L phenanthrene. Fish were euthanized and samples taken after 24, 48 and 72hr.

DESIGN
There were 28 samples analyzed; control liver tissues at 24hr (n=4) 5) phen treated liver tissues at 24hr 5) control liver tissues at 48hr 5) phen treated liver tissues at 48hr 5)control liver tissues at 72hr 4)phen treated liver tissues at 72hrs. There was a total of 28 microarrays processed.
