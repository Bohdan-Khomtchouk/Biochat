TITLE
Gene expression analysis of neural crest in zebrafish to identify novel downstream targets of Twist1

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
sox10:GFP transgenic embryos were used to FACS sort neural crest and microarray analysis was done to compare genes expressed differentially between GFP positive and negative and fold changes were compared to differentially expressed genes in embryos treated with morpholino oligonucleotides to knockdown function of Twist1

DESIGN
A Nimblegen catalog design microarray study done in biological triplicates to analyze expression of genes in neural crest and regulated by Twist1

PLATFORM
GPL14607 NimbleGen Zebrafish Gene Expression 385K Array
