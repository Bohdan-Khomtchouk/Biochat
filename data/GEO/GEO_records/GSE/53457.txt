TITLE
Influence of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and LPA together with interferon tau (IFNt) on transcriptional profiling of bovine endometrial cells.

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The endometrium plays a crucial role in the reproductive organs in the aspect of embryo-maternal communication and pregnancy. This study investigated transcriptome profiles of endometrial cells stimulated with PBS, LPA and LPA in combination with IFNt. LPA, one of the signaling molecule, is locally produced and released from the bovine endometrium during estrous cycle and early pregnancy. The highest concentration of LPA and expression of its active receptor (LPAR1) were detected in bovine endometrium at the time of maternal recognition of pregnancy, when the conceptus announces its presence by increased IFNt production. Using transcriptomic approach we compared the influence of LPA and LPA together with IFNt on the gene expression profiles in bovine endometrial cells.

DESIGN
A total of nine normally cycling Holstein/Polish Black and White (75/25% respectively) cows were used in this study. Global transcriptional profiling was performed using co-cultured stromal and epithelial cells (ratio - 3:1) isolated from bovine endometrium. Three experimental conditions (control (PBS), LPA and LPA plus IFNt) with three replicates per condition were prepared. Total RNAs were extracted from 9 pooled samples (n=3 for each sample) amplified and hybridized onto Affymetrix microarrays.
