TITLE
PARVA promotes invasion through inducing phosphorylation of ILK signaling in lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alpha-parvin (PARVA) is known to involve in the linkage of integrins, regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and cell survival. However, the role of PARVA in cancer progress is still unclear. Here, we identify PARVA as a potential oncogene from a lung cancer invasion cell line model by expression microarrays. Overexpression of PARVA enhances cell invasion, colony formation ability, and endothelial cell tube formation but knockdown of PARVA inhibits invasion and tube formation in vitro. PARVA also promotes tumorigenicity, angiogenesis, metastasis and mortality by in vivo tumorigenesis and metastasis mouse models. To explore the underlying mechanism, the PARVA-regulated signaling pathways were analyzed in PARVA-overexpressing cells compare with mock controls by expression microarrays. We used microarrays to profile the global gene expression of PARVA-overexpressing cells compared with mock control cells and identified the pathways involved in PARVA-induced biofunctional alterations.

DESIGN
The stably pooled PARVA-overexpressing cells and mock control cells were selected with 1mg/ml G418 in CL1-0 cells, human lung adenocarcinoma cells. We compare the  PARVA-expressing profiles with the mock controls to identify the possible mechanisms of PARVA-induced pathways in lung cancer cells.
