TITLE
Gene expression profile after dexamethasone in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells according to IGHV/ZAP-70 status

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glucocorticoids are part of the therapeutic armamentarium of chronic lymphocytic leukemia where it has been suggested that cells with unmutated IGHV genes exhibit higher sensitivity. The mechanisms by which glucorticoids are active in CLL are not well elucidated. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying dexamethasone differential activity according to the prognostic subgroups mutated IGHV genes / low ZAP-70 expression and unmutated IGHV genes / high ZAP-70 expression. We aimed to ascertain the molecular mechanisms that are influencing the diffferential response to this drug.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients were obtained. Samples were split in two for control and incubation with dexamethasone for 6 hours. RNA was extracted and processed for further hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
