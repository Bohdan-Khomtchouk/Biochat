TITLE
Tat RNA silencing suppressor activity contributes to perturbation of lymphocyte miRNAs by HIV-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Herein expression trends of host miRNA were measured in CEMx174 lymphocytes infected with HIV-1NL4-3 or derivative strains deficient in Tat RSS activity (RSS) or vif-/vpr (VV), or unexposed to virus.  As expected from previous studies, miRNA trends were different in naive and HIV-1 infected cells.   Moreover, miRNA expression trends were similar for HIV-1 and vif-/vpr-deficient HIV-1, but diverged for RSS.  Rather than generalized changes in miRNA levels, HIV-1 bearing the Tat K51A RSS mutation changed the steady state of a subset of miRNAs. The results are attributable to reduction in miRNA stability or change in miRNAs activity that altered steady state expression.  Comparison of the miRNA expression trends in patient PBMC and the CEMx174 lymphocytes determined > 50% overlap with a subset of miRNAs identified in patients, supporting the utility of HIV-1 cell culture model to refine experimental design with patient samples, which represent miRNA profiles of co-isolated infected and uninfected cells. Our results indicate that ablation of Tat RNA silencing suppressor activity in HIV-1 changes the steady state of a subset of host mature miRNA. The observation reinforces the concept of active HIV-1 interplay with host small RNAs that modulate replication and spread. The study validated the utility of derivative HIV-1 strains to explore the interface of viral genes with host small RNA activity.

DESIGN
In this study the microRNA profiles of CEMx174 cells infected with HIV-1 NL4-3 or derivative viruses deficient in Vif/Vpr or Tat RNA silencing suppressor activity were compared to mock infected cells.  The samples were analyzed in duplicate.
