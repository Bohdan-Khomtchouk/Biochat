TITLE
Transcriptional effects of lack of Reg1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Reg1 is a regulatory subunit of Glc7, the type 1 Ser/Thr protein phosphatase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Reg1/Glc7 complex is responsible for the dephosphorylation and inactivation of the Snf1 protein kinase, thus controlling Snf1 functions (i.e. expression of glucose-repressed genes). Snf1 is also involved in the response to certain stresses, such as alkaline pH. Surprisingly, both snf1 and reg1 mutants are hypersensitive to high pH. We show here that this phenotype in the reg1 strain is unrelated to the role of Reg1 in regulating Snf1, but depends on the ability of Reg1 to interact with Glc7. Transcriptomic profiling of reg1 cells in the absence or the presence of high pH stress and biochemical analyses suggest that lack of Reg1 impedes the normal downregulation of Pma1 in response to high pH stress. Our results highlight a role of Reg1/Glc7 in the regulation of Pma1 function and hence in the overall cellular cation homeostatic mechanisms.

DESIGN
We identified the transcription pattern of reg1 cells (2 chips). We also identified the changes in the expression profiles caused by alkalinization of the medium (pH8 vs. pH5.5 for 10 min) in the reg1 strain (2chips) Total: 4 chips Changes in the transcriptomic profile in WT cells cause by alkalinization of the medium are included in Series GSE25697 (GSM631186, GSM631187, GSM631188 and GSM631189)
