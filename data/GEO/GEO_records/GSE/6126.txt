TITLE
Comparative gene expression analysis between virus-susceptible and -resistant rice lines (NIL37 and NIL22)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Near-isogenic lines NIL37 and NIL22 were developed from the cross between Ilpum (recurrent parent susceptible to rice stripe virus (RSV)) and Shinkwang (donor parent resistant to RSV). NIL37 is susceptible to RSV, whereas NIL22 is resistant to RSV. In order to identify genes which are constitutively differentially expressed between NIL37 and NIL22, the gene expression in the two lines were compared at two different conditions (healthy, and RSV-inoculated). Keywords: Constitutive differential expression

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 14-day old plants of NIL37 and NIL22 at two different conditions (healthy and RSV-inoculated). The levels of gene expression in the two lines of the same condition were compared by microarray. Each experiment was repeated twice.
