TITLE
Comparative gene expression analysis between virus-susceptible and -resistant rice lines (NIL37 and NIL22)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Near-isogenic lines NIL37 and NIL22 were developed from the cross between Ilpum (recurrent parent susceptible to rice stripe virus (RSV)) and Shinkwang (donor parent resistant to RSV). NIL37 is susceptible to RSV, whereas NIL22 is resistant to RSV. In order to identify genes which are constitutively differentially expressed between NIL37 and NIL22, the gene expression in the two lines were compared at two different conditions (healthy, and RSV-inoculated). Keywords: Constitutive differential expression
