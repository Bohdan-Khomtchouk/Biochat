TITLE
Regulation of biofilm formation, twitching motility, and virulence in Galleria mellonella by AdeN protein of Acinetobacter baumannii

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978

SUMMARY
AdeN deletion mutant AB141 was studied for its effects on biofilm formation, twitching motility, and virulence using phenotypic methods, and the further global role of AdeN was further studied using a multiomics approach

DESIGN
A deletion mutant of the adeN gene in ATCC 17978 (AB141) was created by homologous recombination

PLATFORM
GPL22492 Illumina MiSeq (Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978)
