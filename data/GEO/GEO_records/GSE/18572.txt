SUMMARY
Full title: Discrete genomic domains exhibit co-occurrence of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 histone modifications throughout Drosophila development Trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is strongly associated with gene silencing and transcriptional repression in both Drosophila and mammals.  H3K9me3 is linked to the formation of heterochromatin, while H3K27me3 is a hallmark of repression of euchromatic genes by Polycomb group proteins.  We examined the genomic distribution of the two modifications at high resolution over nine different stages of Drosophila development, and found that they are present in large overlapping domains in euchromatin.  These dual-mark domains are stable throughout the life of the fly, and cover genomic regions greatly enriched in developmental regulatory genes with spatially restricted expression.
