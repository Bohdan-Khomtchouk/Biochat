TITLE
Whole miRNA transcriptome profiling of Trichostatin A and Grape Seed Extract treated SK-MEL-3 human melanoma cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, over 1400 compounds were initially screened for capacity to inhibit the kinetic enzyme activity of nuclear HDACs isolated from SK-MEL-3 cells. From these findings we evaluate miRNA whole transcriptome changes that occur at a 24 hour time point in SK-ME-3 cells in the presence of a known HDAC inhibitor (Trichostatin A) (1uM) or a natural product HDAC inhibitor Grapeseed Extract (120ug/ml), both tested at sub-lethal concentrations relative to untreated controls. Microarrays were acquired using miRNA 4.1 Human Arrays (Affymetrix, Thermo-Fisher Scientific).

DESIGN
Whole miRNA transcriptome profiling of Trichostatin A and Grape Seed Extract treated SK-MEL-3 human melanoma cells.

PLATFORM
