TITLE
Allelic expression in tibial growth plates from 21 day old C57BL/6J x CAST/EiJ F1s

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have identified candidate genes from the Feml2 QTL influencing femur length through allele specific expression analysis of growth plates in C57BL/6J x CAST/EiJ F1 hybrids. This work provides the foundation to identify novel genes affecting bone geometry.

DESIGN
total RNA sequencing in 7 male C57BL/6JxCAST F1s

PLATFORM
