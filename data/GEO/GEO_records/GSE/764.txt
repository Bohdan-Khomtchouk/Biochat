SUMMARY
Comparison of Gene Expression in Uterine Smooth Muscle Tumors (including normal myometrium, benign uterine leiomyoma, malignant uterine and extra-uterine leiomyosarcoma. Total RNA was isolated with Trizol and converted to labeled cRNA by standard Affymetrix protocols. Before analysis, Avg Diff values were normalized to a sum of 3 million for each probe set on the chip and values less than 20 were adjusted to 20 to allow log scaling in subsequent analysis.
