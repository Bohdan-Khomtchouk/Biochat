TITLE
Gene expression profiling of two diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines, DHL4 and DHL6, treated with the SYK inhibitor, R406

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The two DLBCL cell lines were treated with R406 to assess the signature of SYK inhibition. In previous studies, R406 decreased the proliferation and induced apoptosis of these surface Ig+ cell lines. In the previous studies, R406 inhibited the autophosphorylation of SYK 525/526 and SYK-dependent phosphorylation of BCR signaling components such as BLNK.

DESIGN
RNA samples from two DLBCL cell lines, DHL4 and DHL6, treated with R406 or vehicle (DMSO) alone for 0, 2, 6, 24 or 48 hours were profiled in triplicate on Affymetrix HT_HG-U133A chips.
