TITLE
High-resolution mapping reveals a conserved, widespread, dynamic mRNA methylation program in yeast meiosis

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most ubiquitous mRNA base modification, but little is known about its precise location, temporal dynamics, and regulation. Here, we generated genomic maps of m6A sites in meiotic yeast transcripts at nearly single-nucleotide resolution, identifying 1,308 putatively methylated sites within 1,183 transcripts. We validated 8/8 methylation sites in different genes with direct genetic analysis, demonstrated that methylated sites are significantly conserved in a related species, and built a model that predicts methylated sites directly from sequence. Sites vary in their methylation profiles along a dense meiotic time-course, and are regulated both locally, via predictable methylatability of each site, and globally, through the core meiotic circuitry. The methyltransferase complex components localize to the yeast nucleolus, and this localization is essential for mRNA methylation. Our data illuminates a conserved, dynamically regulated methylation program in yeast meiosis, and provides an important resource for studying the function of this epitranscriptomic modification.
