TITLE
Gene expression data from 1833 cells expressing RKIP vs control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RKIP regulates human breast tumor metastasis. We use gene expression array analysis to identify genes regulated by RKIP in human breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from 1833 cells expressing mutant RKIP (S153E-RKIP, a more potent Raf-1 inhibitor) and vector control. Affymetrix GeneChip hgu133plus2.0 Arrays were performed to detail the gene expression and identify the genes regulated by RKIP in human breast cancer cells.
