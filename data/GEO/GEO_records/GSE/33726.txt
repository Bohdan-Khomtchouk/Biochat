TITLE
The circadian clock coordinates ribosome biogenesis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Evolutionary conserved biological rhythms play a fundamental role in the physiology and behavior of all light-sensitive organisms. Generation of rhythmic expression of clock-controlled genes is orchestrated by a molecular circadian clock constitutes by interconnected negative feedback loops of transcription factors. In this study, we want to characterize gene which also present a rhythmic translation through the characterization of genes with a rhythmic polysomal/total RNA ratio.

DESIGN
Analyze of gene expression in liver total RNA and polysomal RNA harvested every 2 hrs during 2 series of 48 hrs, 2 mice per samples
