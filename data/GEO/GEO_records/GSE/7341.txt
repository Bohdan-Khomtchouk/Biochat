SUMMARY
Rgg-dependent transcriptional regulation in Streptococcus pyogenes strains MGAS5005 and CS101 was analyzed during post-exponential phase of growth Keywords: strain comparion, post-exponential growth, rgg mutant

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed using RNA samples isolated from wild-type MGAS5005 and CS101 strains as well as their rgg mutant strains during post-exponential phase of growth
