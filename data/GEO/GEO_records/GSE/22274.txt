TITLE
H. arabidopsidis EMWA1 infection, time course experiment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes. We focused on those genes that were dramatically induced ( > 2-fold) in WT but not in the rpp4 mutant at 2 dpi when WT and rpp4 first showed distinct phenotypes

DESIGN
2-week old Col wild-type plants and rpp4 mutants were infected with spores from 10-day old H. arabidopsidis EMWA1. Leaves were harvested at 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 6 days post-inoculation. Replicates are derived from two independent biological experiments, with no overlap in growing periods.
