TITLE
Molecular consequences of Dlx3 deletion in mouse enamel organ as determined by RNASeq analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DLX3 is a homeodomain transcription factor involved in ameloblast differentiation and enamel formation. Mutations in DLX3 in human lead to defects in enamel. However, the downstream targets of Dlx3 transcriptional activity in the enamel organ have not been identified yet. In this study, we compared the transcriptome of enamel organs where Dlx3 has been deleted to control tissues.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from enamel organs (mandibular incisors) from Dlx3-WT (N=4) and Dlx3-K14cKO (N=4) mice at P10. cDNA libraries were generated using NEBnext and NuGen kits. Sequencing was performed on the HiSeq2000.
