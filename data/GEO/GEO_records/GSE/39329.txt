TITLE
Comparative genomic hybridization of Schistosoma japonicum Chinese and Philippine isolates

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
Chinese and Philippine strains of the blood fluke Schistosoma japonicum present clear and distinctive phenotypes in areas of fecundity, pathology, drug sensitivity and immunology. Despite these differences large scale sequencing efforts have focused solely on Chinese mainland strain of the parasite. We have undertaken a comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) approach to highlight some of the structural differences in the genome of two of the major geographical isolates of S. japonicum. We identified seven distinct regions of the S. japonicum genome that present differential CGH between Chinese and Philippine strains of the blood fluke Schistosoma japonicum, representing either deletion or duplication regions in the Philippine strain. Within these regions, genes that may be related to phenotypical differences are identified and discussed.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was isolated from adult (7 week post cercarial challenge) Schistosoma japonicum Chinese and Philippine isolates and separate maleand femalesamples comparatively hybridised on an Agilent customn designed oligo microarray.
