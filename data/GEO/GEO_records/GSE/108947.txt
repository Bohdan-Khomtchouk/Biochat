TITLE
Expression data from human colorectal cancer cell line LoVo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PEAK1 overexpression vector and negative control vector were transiently transfected into LoVo cells, respectively, and named LoVo-PEAK1 and LoVo-control groups. LoVo cells of different groups were determined to investigate the different expressions of mRNA using a global gene microarray.

DESIGN
To construct the HA-PEAK1 overexpression vector, the full-length human PEAK1 gene was amplified from the template PEAK1 cDNA clone. LoVo cells were seeded at 70-80% confluence, and 12 hours later cells were transiently transfected with indicated vectors with Lipofectamine® 3000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
