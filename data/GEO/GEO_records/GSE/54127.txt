TITLE
Butyrate Induced Changes in Wnt Signaling-Specific Gene Expression in Colorectal Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify Wnt target genes whose expression is differentially modulated by butyrate

DESIGN
Doxycycline inducible DN-Tcf4 expression was used to repress Wnt signaling, cells were treated with butyrate or mock treated.  Genes differentially regulated by butyrate in the absence of doxycycline but not in its presence ( > 2 -fold, P < 0.01) were evaluated.
