TITLE
Influence of Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) in Cell-Free Supernatant of Salmonella Typhimurium in Gene Expression of S. Typhimurium

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is known to synthesize and respond to the cell signaling molecule, autoinducer-2 (AI-2). The luxS gene is involved in the synthesis of AI-2. We have previously shown that luxS controls a variety of bacterial processes in S. Typhimurium. In this study we identified the genes regulated by AI-2 in the Cell-Free supernatant of S. Typhimurium using mRNA samples from isogenic luxS gene mutant of S. Typhimurium strain 87-26254 grown in LB media in the presence of S. Typhimurium wild type CFS / absence  AI-2 (mutant CFS of S. Typhimurium). In the presence of AI-2 in CFS, 758 genes were significantly regulated. Interstingly, AI-2 in CFS caused the down-regulation of 39 genes in Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-1 (SPI-1).

DESIGN
Purified cDNAs from the mutant supplemented with CFS containing AI-2 and mutant without AI-2 (Mutant CFS) were each labeled with Cy-3 mono-Reactive Dye and Cy-5 mono-Reactive Dye (GE Health Care, Piscataway, NJ) and were processed using a dye-swapping design. A total of 5 microarray arrays, each with duplicate spots for each gene.
