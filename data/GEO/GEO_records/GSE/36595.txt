TITLE
Time-course in rice leaves of the temperature shift experiment

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Time-course transcriptional profiling of rice leaf of the temperature shift experiment in a growth chamber. This experiment was performed to validate the results of field transcriptomic modeling.

DESIGN
Rice leaves (cv. Norin8) were collected at 2:00 and 14:00 on the day -1, 2, 4 and 6 from the temperature shift (diurnal cycle temperature condition to continuous temperature condition). Two biological replicates for each sampling time point.
