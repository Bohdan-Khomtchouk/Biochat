TITLE
Gene expression landscape of CS cerebellum

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The intricate features of human brain development and function are reflected on the precise regulation of transcriptional architecture. This study characterizes the gene expression perturbations of Cockayne Syndrome brain tissue samples underlying the complex neurological abnormalities.

DESIGN
The Nimblegen human 12 x 135K gene expression array was used to define gene expression profiles of CS cerebellum tissues and age-matched controls.
