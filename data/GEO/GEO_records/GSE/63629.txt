TITLE
Genome-wide maps of SOX9 binding sites in human colorectal cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant expression of SOX9 in human colorectal cancer cells suggests its roles in the development of colorectal cancer. To gain insight into SOX9-mediated transcriptional regulation in colorectal cancer cells, we attempted to identify its physiological targets on a genome-scale using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) in HT-29, human colorectal cancer cells.

DESIGN
SOX9 CHIP-seq was carried out using HT-29 cells.
