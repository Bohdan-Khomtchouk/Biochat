TITLE
The mRNA levels of CD133 positive and CD133 negative cells after radiation exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cancer initiating cells (CICs) act as a tumor initiation source. Recent studies have shown that CICs contribute to chemoresistance and radioresistance. The aims of this study were to investigate the relationship of CD133+ liver CICs and radiation resistance and to define a possible mechanism for radioresistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

DESIGN
Total RNA is obtained from CD133 positive cells and CD133 negative cells at 0, 12 and 24 hours after radiation exposure.
