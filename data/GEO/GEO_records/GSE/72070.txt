TITLE
Breed-dependent differences in transcriptomic response of dermal fibroblasts to lipopolysaccharide

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We report the breed-dependent differences in the innate immune response of dermal fibroblasts following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Skin biopsies were collected from Angus (a beef breed) and Holstein (a dairy breed) animals and isolated fibroblasts were exposed to LPS to investigate differences in gene expression between these two cattle breeds.

DESIGN
Fibroblast were isolated from 4 animals of each breed (Angus and Holstein) and treated with LPS for 0 hrs, 2 hrs, and 8 hrs. RNA was extracted at each of these times points.
