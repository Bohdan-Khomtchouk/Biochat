TITLE
Testis samples from Alkbh1 wild-type and KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to elucidate the role of Alkbh1 by targeted deletion in C57/BL6 mice. Alkb deficiency results in sex-ratio distortion of offspring and apoptosis in adult testes, most likely caused by defects in the pachytene stage during spermatogenesis. Due to the pivotal role of Alkbh1 in mouse survival and potentially in germ cells, we searched for Alkbh1-regulated genes in adult testes.

DESIGN
Testes from 12 week old mice were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We used testes from 3 wild type mice and 3 KO mice
