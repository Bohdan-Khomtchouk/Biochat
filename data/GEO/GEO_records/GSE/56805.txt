TITLE
Expression data in human oral mucosa fibroblasts (hOFs), dermal fibroblasts, and hOFs-derived iPS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To define the characteristics of human oral mucosa fibroblasts (hOFs), we analyzed the gene expression of hOFs compared with that of human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs), and that of hOF-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (hOF-iPSCs). In this dataset, we found that 5,738 probes and 5672 probes were differently expressed in hOFs and hDFs respectively, compared with those in hOF-iPSCs at more than 2-fold levels. In contrast, only 434 probes are differently expressed between hOFs and hDFs.

DESIGN
Total 9 samples (i.e., 3 samples in each group; hOFs, hDFs, and hOF-iPSCs) were analyzed. The average data from 3 samples in each group were calculated, and used for pairwise comparisons with GeneSpring software; hOFs vs. hDFs, hOFs vs. hOF-iPSCs, hDFs vs. hOF-iPSCs.
