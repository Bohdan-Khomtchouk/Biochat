TITLE
dRNA-Seq of Chlamydia pneumoniae

ORGANISM
Chlamydophila pneumoniae CWL029

SUMMARY
The obligate intracellular human pathogen Chlamydia pneumoniae was subjected to dRNA-Seq to gain insights into the transcriptome. The two distinct life cycle forms elementary bodies (EB) and reticulate bodies (RB) were isolated from human Hep2 cell line by differential gradient centrifugation.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated and partially treated with Terminator Exonuclease to digest RNA without 5'-PPP and thereby enrich for native 5' ends.
