TITLE
Comparison of the gene expression profiles of carfilzomib-resistant derivatives versus parental human myeloma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KMS-11 and KMS-34 cells were exposed to stepwise increasing concentrations of carfilzomib over a period of 18 weeks: cells adapted to growth in 4 nM carfilzomib by 4 weeks, in 6 nM in another 6 weeks and in 12 nM after a further 8 weeks. The resulting cell cultures, denoted KMS-11/Cfz and KMS-34/Cfz, respectively, retained resistance to carfilzomib even when tested after removal of selective pressure for approximately 8 weeks.

DESIGN
KMS-11/Cfz and KMS-34/Cfz cells were profiled for gene expression after 1 week of growth in the absence of carfilzomib together with parental KMS-11 and KMS-34 cells which had not been selected in the drug (triplicate samples).
