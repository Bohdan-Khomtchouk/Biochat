TITLE
Gene Expression analysis of stomachs of a C/EBP beta knockout (KO) mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify genes that are potentially regulated by the transkription factor C/EBP beta in the stomach, we have performed a microarray-based profiling of the genome-wide mRNA expression of C/EBP beta KO mouse stomach and compared it to wildtype (WT) littermates.

DESIGN
newborn were killed and the stomachs were taken out. 5 KO and 4 WT stomachs were used for the profiling.

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
