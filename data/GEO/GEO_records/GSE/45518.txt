TITLE
The consequences of rapid mating system evolution in crucifer genomes

ORGANISM
Capsella rubella

SUMMARY
We compare RNA expression and polymorphism patterns between C. rubella and its outcrossing progenitor C. grandiflora. There is a clear shift in the expression of genes associated with flowering phenotypes; a similar shift is seen in the related genus Arabidopsis, where self-fertilization evolved about 1 million years ago.

DESIGN
This is a two group comparison of gene expression between the self-compatible Capsella Rubella and out-crossing Capsella Grandiflora mixed stage flowerbuds.  Leaf expression is also provided as an annotation reference dataset.
