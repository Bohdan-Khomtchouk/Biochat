TITLE
The consequences of rapid mating system evolution in crucifer genomes

ORGANISM
Capsella rubella ; Capsella grandiflora

SUMMARY
We compare RNA expression and polymorphism patterns between C. rubella and its outcrossing progenitor C. grandiflora. There is a clear shift in the expression of genes associated with flowering phenotypes; a similar shift is seen in the related genus Arabidopsis, where self-fertilization evolved about 1 million years ago.

DESIGN
This is a two group comparison of gene expression between the self-compatible Capsella Rubella and out-crossing Capsella Grandiflora mixed stage flowerbuds.  Leaf expression is also provided as an annotation reference dataset.
