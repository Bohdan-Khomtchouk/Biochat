TITLE
Expression profiles of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 4074 and the qseB/qseC gene-deleted mutant

ORGANISM
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae

SUMMARY
To determine the role of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae two-component system QseBQseC, we constructed a qseBqseC gene-deleted mutant ΔqseBΔqseC based on the wild type A. pleuropneumoniae 4074. The transcriptional profiles were compared between the A. pleuropneumoniae ΔqseBΔqseC and its parental strain under the normal growth condition using microarray. A total of 44 genes were found differentially expressed (DE) compared to the wild type strain. These functional genes are primarily related to metabolism, cell wall biogenesis, energy, replication and recombination. Further investigations indicated that the type IV pili (Tfp) assembly protein PilM is regulated directly by QseB, and PilM is essential for adherence and virulence. Characterization of the QseBQseC regulon genes will provides new insight into understanding of the relevant signal transduction pathways and prevention of the infection.

DESIGN
A. pleuropneumoniae strains were cultured in TSB medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and 10% (v/v)filtered cattle serum at 37℃. The samples were collected at the mid-exponential phase and the total RNA were extracted using RNA-Solv Reagent (Omega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Expression profiles of two different Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (4074 and ΔqseBΔqseC) were determined. The fold changes > =1.5 or < =-1.5 were selected as differentially expressed genes.
