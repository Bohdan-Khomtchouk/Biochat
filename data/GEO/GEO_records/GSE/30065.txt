Cultured human amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stromal cells [miRXplore data]

Homo sapiens ; synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Human amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMSC) have become one of the main cell populations used in regenerative medicine and for the study of various clinical disorders. These cells have a great capacity for proliferation and differentiation, do not form teratomas when transplanted into animal models and their stemness seems to be between embryonic cells and adult mesenchymal cells. Prior to their use in cell therapy they must be cultured and expanded in vitro, but the effect this process has on their fitness, a determining factor for the success or failure of cell therapy, is unknown. We undertook a follow-up of gene and microRNAs (miRNAs) expression using microarray of a hAMSC population kept under in vitro culture conditions for the first 15 passages. Significant changes were noted in the expression of various mRNAs and miRNAs, particularly down-regulation of TP53, increased expression of hsa-miR-125a and up-regulation of CDKN2D. The variations in TP53 and hsa-miR-125a may act as an indicator of the stemness of the hAMSC, whereas CDKN2D may indicate the reduction in the proliferative capacity of these cells in a TP53-independent mechanism. The genes described in this study will help evaluate the fitness of hAMSC, thus guaranteeing their biological quality for use in regenerative medicine.

DESIGN
miRNA patterns were studied in in vitro culture samples of human amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stromal cells at passages P1, P3, P5 and P10 with miRXplorer microarrays using a synthetic pool of miRNAs. Cell pellets of 5 x 10E5 cells were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen and sent to Miltenyi Biotec for their analysis.
