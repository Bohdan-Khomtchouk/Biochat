TITLE
Constitutively Active Foxo3 in Oocytes Preserves Ovarian Reserve in Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During female reproductive life, the reserve of ovarian follicles is reduced by maturation and atresia until menopause ensues. Foxo3 is required to maintain the ovarian reserve in mice. We asked if overexpression of a constitutively active FOXO3 protein can increase long-lasting ovarian reproductive capacity in mice.

DESIGN
Trangenic vs non-transgenic mice onto Foxo3+/- vs Foxo3-/- genotype
