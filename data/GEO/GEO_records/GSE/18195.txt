TITLE
Effects of bevacizumab (avastin) in mouse model of endometrial cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to determine the efficacy of bevacizumab (a monoclonal antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors.) on endometrial cancer cells. Endometrial cancer is the most frequent gynecologic cancer in women. Long term outcomes for patients with advanced stage or recurrent disease are poor. Targeted molecular therapy against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors constitute a new therapeutic option for these patients. The goal of our work was to assess the potential effectiveness of inhibition of VEGF/VEGFR signaling in a xenograft model of endometrial cancer using bevacizumab (Avastin, a humanized antibody against VEGFA). We also aimed to identify molecular markers of sensitivity or resistance to this agent. We show that bevacizumab retards tumor growth in athymic mice by inhibiting molecular components of signaling pathways that sustain cell survival and proliferation. We also demonstrate that resistance to bevacizumab may involve up-regulation of antiapoptotic genes and certain proto-oncogenes.

DESIGN
Human xenografts produced from endometrial cell line, grown in athymic mice, were treated in vivo with bevacizumab.
