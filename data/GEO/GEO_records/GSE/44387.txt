TITLE
Transcriptomal profiling of C57BL/6 wild type and ER-alpha KO mice fetal mammary gland after fetal exposure to Bisphenol A (BPA) and 17alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine whether the BPA-induced morphological alterations of the fetal mouse mammary glands are a) associated with changes in mRNA expression reflecting estrogenic actions and/or b) dependent on the estrogen receptor α (ERα), we compared the transcriptomal effects of BPA and the steroidal estrogen ethinylestradiol (EE2) on fetal mammary tissues of wild type and ERα knock-out mice.

DESIGN
Mammary glands from fetuses of dams exposed to vehicle, 250 ng BPA/kg BW/d or 10 ng EE2/kg BW/d from embryonic day (E) 8 were harvested at E19. Total RNA was subjected to transcriptomal profiling using Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 microarray.
