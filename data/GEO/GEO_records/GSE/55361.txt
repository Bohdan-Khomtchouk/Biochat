TITLE
Systematic Mapping of ADAR1 Binding Reveals its Regulatory Roles in Multiple RNA Processing Pathways [CLIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ADARs are the primary factors underlying A-to-I editing in metazoans. We conducted the first global study of ADAR1-RNA interaction in human cells using CLIP-Seq. In contrast to the expected predominant binding of ADAR1 to Alu repeats, thousands of CLIP sites were located in non-Alu regions. This unexpectedly frequent non-Alu binding enabled discovery of transcriptome-wide functional and biophysical targets of ADAR1 in the regulation of mRNA processing including alternative 3' UTR usage and alternative splicing. In addition, a global analysis of ADAR1 binding to non-Alu regions also revealed its primary interaction with microRNA (miRNA) transcripts in the nucleus, which subsequently affected expression levels of mature miRNAs. A complex global picture was revealed regarding the dependence of this function on the double-stranded RNA binding domains or deaminase activity. Our study unfolded a broad landscape of the diverse functional roles of ADAR1.

DESIGN
To charaterize ADAR1 binding profiles in U87 cells, we performed CLIP-seq using two different ADAR1 monoclonal antibodies.
