TITLE
Histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation is linked to the core transcriptional network in human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lysine 56 acetylation in the helical core of histone H3 opens yeast chromatin and enables histone gene transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair, and prevents epigenetic silencing. While K56Ac is globally abundant in yeast and flies its presence has been uncertain in mammals. We show here using mass spectrometry and genome wide analyses that K56Ac is present in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) overlapping strongly at active and inactive promoters with the binding of the key regulators of pluripotency NANOG, SOX2 and OCT4. This includes also the canonical histone gene promoters and those for the hESC-specific microRNAs. K56Ac then relocates to developmental genes upon cellular differentiation. Thus K56Ac state more accurately reflects the epigenetic differences between hESCs and somatic cells than other active histone marks such as H3 K4 tri-methylation and K9 acetylation. These results suggest that K56Ac is involved in the human core transcriptional network of pluripotency.

DESIGN
Genome wide location analysis ChIP-chip was performed in two human embryonic stem cell lines (HSF1 and HSF6) and two somatic cell lines (ARPE and BJ), for each of the following histone modifications: H3 K56Ac, H3 K9Ac, H3 K4me3 and H3 K27me3.
