TITLE
Transcriptional ontogeny of the developing liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We characterized gene expression changes in the developing mouse liver at gestational days (GD) 11.5, 12.5, 13.5, 14.5, 16.5, and 19.5 and in the neonate (postnatal day (PND) 7 and 30) using full-genome microarrays and compared these changes to that in the adult liver. The fetal liver, and to a lesser extent the neonatal liver, exhibited dramatic differences in gene expression compared to adults. Canonical pathway analysis of the fetal liver signature demonstrated increases in functions important in cell replication and DNA fidelity whereas most metabolic pathways of intermediary metabolism were suppressed. Comparison of the dataset to a number of previously published datasets revealed 1) a striking similarity between the fetal liver and that of the pancreas in both mice and humans, 2) a nucleated erythrocyte signature in the fetus and 3) suppression of most xenobiotic metabolism genes throughout development, except a number of transporters associated with expression in hematopoietic cells. Keywords: gene expression/microarray

DESIGN
We characterized gene expression changes in the developing mouse liver at gestational days (GD) 19 and in the neonate (postnatal day (PND) 7 and 30) using full-genome microarrays and compared these changes to that in the adult liver. Total RNA was isolated from liver samples and gene expression analyzed using Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 GeneChips. Data from 16 samples, with four mice in each of the four age groups, were analyzed.
