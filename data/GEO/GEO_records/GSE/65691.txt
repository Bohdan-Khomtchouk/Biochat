TITLE
Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 regulates cell growth via Myc in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To check the dMyc function, RNA profiling was achieved by the RNA-seq assay comparing mRNA levels of lst81, dm0, lst81dm0 and rictorÎ”1 in the adult heads of male mutant animals with wild-type controls

DESIGN
Compare the mRNA profiles of 5-day old adult head materials of mutants (lst81, dmP0, lst81dmP0 and rictor1) to wild type W1118 by Illumina suquencing.

PLATFORM
