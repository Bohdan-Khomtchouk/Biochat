TITLE
Mapping chromatin remodelling in delta isw2 cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To define chromatin structure changes along the yeast genome using microarrays. Nucleosomal DNA from WT and delta isw2 yeast were hybridized and differences in signals were calculated. Keywords: Nucleosomal DNA hybridization

DESIGN
Nucleosomal DNA was harvested from WT and delta isw2 yeast (2 biological replicates of each) then fragmented into ~50bp lengths and then hybridized onto the tilling microarrays. WT signal was the compared to the mutant signal to find regions of chromatin structure change.
