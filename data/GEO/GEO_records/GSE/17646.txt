TITLE
Identification of Recurrence-Related microRNAs in the Bone Marrow of Breast Cancer Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA microarray analysis was performed to compare microRNA levels in bone marrow from 4 breast cancer patients with recurrent disease and 4 patients without recurrence.

DESIGN
To achieve this goal, we used microRNA microarray analysis to compare microRNA expression in bone marrow from breast cancer patients with and without disease recurrence.

PLATFORM
GPL9039 Agilent-014947 microRNA array (early access version)
