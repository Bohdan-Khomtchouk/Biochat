TITLE
LCOR regulates transcription of human mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal human mammary epithelial cell (HMLE) and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells are engineered to knockdown or enforce expression of variety of LCOR gene products. In addition to wild-type cDNA, functional domain deficient mutants were used to elucidate mechanism of LCOR incorporated transcriptional regulation. The transcriptome profiles were determined and compared.

DESIGN
Two sets of experiments: (1) LKO vector control vs LCOR-KD in two cell types to determine the outcome of LCOR deficiency. (2) LEX vector control vs. (wild-type, LSKAA mutant, â–³HTH mutant) LCOR to confirm the LCOR outcome (as identified by KD) and determine the functional impact of individual domain.
