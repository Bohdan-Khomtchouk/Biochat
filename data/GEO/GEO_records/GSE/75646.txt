TITLE
Espression data of control and heat-stressed Arabidopsis WT, hd2c-3, brm-1 and brm-1 hd2c-3 plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Studies in yeast and animals have revealed that histone deacetylases (HDACs) often act as components of multiprotein complexes, including chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs). In our group, we found evidence for the interaction between Arabidopsis HD2C deacetylase and a BRM-containing SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Moreover, we revealed a novel function of HD2C as a regulator of the heat stress response. HD2C transcript levels were strongly induced in plants subjected to heat treatment and the expression of selected heat-responsive genes was up-regulated in heat-stressed hd2c mutant, suggesting that HD2C acts to down-regulate heat-activated genes. Microarray transcriptome analysis of brm and hd2c mutants identified a subset of commonly regulated heat-responsive genes, and the effect of the double brm hd2c mutation on the expression of these genes was non-additive. Moreover, heat treated hd2c, brm and brm hd2c mutants displayed similar rates of growth retardation. Taken together, our findings suggest that HD2C and BRM act in a common genetic pathway to regulate the Arabidopsis heat stress response.

DESIGN
3-week-old WT (Col-0), hd2c-3, brm-1 and brm-1 hd3c-3 plants were collected before and after 1 hour of heat (38Â°C) treatment.  For each variant, three biological replicates with similar expression levels of selected marker genes, were chosen for microarray analysis.
