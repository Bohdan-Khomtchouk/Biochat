TITLE
RNA-seq transcriptonal profiling in partial hepatectomy liver tissues in Arid1a WT and liver specific KO mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Arid1a is the subunit of SWI/SNF complex, which was reported to guide SWI/SNF to DNA. Here, we found that loss of Arid1a in the liver  results in improved liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy.Genome-wide analysis showed that after hepatectomy,loss of Arid1a reduces the recruitment and activity of E2F4 on target promoters, resulting in expression programs that favor regeneration during injury.RNAseq shows transcriptional profiling in WT and Arid1a LKO livers pre- and post-hepatectomy, which confirmed the E2F4 target genes and cell cycle genes were upregulated after hepatectomy.

DESIGN
After partial hepatectomy, liver transcriptional profiling in WT and Arid1a liver specific KO mice were generated by RNA-seq analysis.
