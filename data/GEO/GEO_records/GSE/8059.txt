TITLE
resting and IL2 activated human natural killer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to investigate the activation of human NK cells by IL2 through analyzing the global gene expression at different time points (0, 2, 8 and 24 hours) after culture with the cytokine IL2 at 100 IU/ml. NK cells with the CD56+/CD16+ and CD3- phenotype were negatively selected by immunomagnetic beads and re-examined by flow-cytometry to ensure greater than 90% purity . Keywords: resting and IL2 activated NK cells(time series)
