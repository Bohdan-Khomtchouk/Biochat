TITLE
Expression profiling of invasive breast carcinoma samples from Institut Curie

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic hallmarks of homologous recombination deficiency in invasive breast carcinomas to appear in Internationa Journal of Cancer Transcriptome analysis of 243 (plus 12 duplicates) primary breast invasive carcinoma samples of various molecular subtypes.

DESIGN
This dataset contains 255 arrays for 243 primary breast tumor samples obtained from 243 patient; 12 duplicated cases. Data production involved different array batches and hybridation series.

PLATFORM
GPL16311 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array [CDF: Brainarray HGU133Plus2_Hs_ENTREZG 14.0.0]
