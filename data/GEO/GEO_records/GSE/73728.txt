TITLE
Gene array data of tumour draining lymph node fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lymph node (LN) stromal cells, particularly fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs), provide critical structural support and regulate immunity, tolerance and transport properties of LNs. In many tumors, LN metastasis is predictive of poor prognosis, however, stromal contribution to the evolving microenvironment of tumor draining LNs (TDLN) remains poorly understood. Here we present comparative transcriptional data of resting and TDLN FRCs after different time points of tumor drainage. FRCs were isolated from lymph nodes and FACS sorted based on the expression of CD45-, CD31- and PDPN+

DESIGN
FRCs were pooled per animal of 2 brachial LNs and gene array analysis was performed on triplicates
