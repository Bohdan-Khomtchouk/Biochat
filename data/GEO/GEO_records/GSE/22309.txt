TITLE
Expression data from human skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Insulin is a potent pleiotropic hormone that affects processes such as cellular growth, differentiation, apoptosis, ion flux, energy expenditure, and carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the influence of insulin in human skeletal muscle collected from different human individuals including 20 insulin sensitive, 20 insulin resistant and 15 diabetic patients. We identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during these processes. The pathophysiology of obesity represents an imbalance between a high energy intake and/or low energy expenditure. Resting energy expenditure (REE) comprises 60-75% of total energy expenditure. The respiratory quotient (RQ) is used to estimate fuel partitioning between fat and carbohydrate as preferred substrates for energy generation, and fuel preferences to generate REE also exhibit individual variation. Genes influencing REE and RQ could represent candidate genes for obesity, Metabolic Syndrome, and Type 2 Diabetes due to the involvement of these traits in energy balance and substrate oxidation. We used microarrays to explore the molecular bases for individual variation in REE and fuel partitioning as reflected by RQ. We performed microarray studies in human vastus lateralis muscle biopsies from 40 healthy subjects with measured REE and RQ values. We identified genes significantly correlated with REE and RQ, respectively.

DESIGN
Human skeletal muscle samples were biopsied from different individuals before and after insulin treatment for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
