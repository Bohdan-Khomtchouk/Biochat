TITLE
Genome wide expression profiling of mesenchymal stem cells of fetal and adult origin and dermal fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In animal models and human trials, intramyocardial injection of adult bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) provides beneficial effects in failing hearts. These effects are mainly mediated through paracrine mechanisms. Mesenchymal stem cells of fetal origin (hAMC) can be isolated from the amniotic membrane of human placenta. Our results provide evidence that hAMC exert remarkable cardioprotective effects through paracrine mechanisms. However, the complete nature and scope of the paracrine mediators of cardioprotection have not been investigated yet. We compared the gene expression profiling of hAMC (n=8), BM-MSC (n=10) and dermal fibroblasts (n=6) to shed light onto the identity of putative cardioprotective factors secreted by fetal MSC.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from cultured hAMC (n=8), BM-MSC (n=10) and dermal fibroblasts (n=6) and analyzed with HumanHT-12 v3 Expression BeadChips
