TITLE
Reduction of the tumorigenic potential of human retinoblastoma cell lines by TFF1 overexpression involves p53/caspase signaling and miR-18a regulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TFF1 overexpression in retinoblastoma cell line Y79 Differentially expressed genes and pathways involved in cancer progression were identified after TFF1 overexpression in Y79 cells by gene expression array analysis, underlining the effects on reduced tumorigenicity.

DESIGN
Retinoblastoma cell line: Y79 overexpressing TFF1 versus Y79; 2 biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL13497 Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
