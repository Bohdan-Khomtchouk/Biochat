TITLE
High-resolution genome-wide copy-number analysis suggests a monoclonal origin of multi-focal prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Many human cancers present as multi-focal lesions. Understanding the clonal origin of multi-focal cancers is of both etiological and clinical importance. The molecular basis of multi-focal prostate cancer has previously been explored using only a limited number of isolated markers and, although independent origin is widely believed, the clonal origin of multi-focal prostate cancer is still debatable. We attempted to address clonal origin using a genome-wide copy-number analysis of individual cancer and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) lesions. Using Affymetrix array 6.0 copy-number analysis, we compared the genomic changes detected in 54 individual cancer and HGPIN lesions, isolated from 20 clinically localized prostate cancer cases. Identical genomic copy-number changes, shared by all same-case cancer foci, were detected in all 16 informative multi-tumor cases. In addition, both HGPIN lesions in the two multi-HGPIN cases available shared identical genomic changes. Commonly known genomic alterations, including losses at 6q15, 8p21.3-8p21.2, 10q23.2-10q23.31, 13q21.31-13q21.32, 16q22.3, 16q23.2-16q23.3 and 21q22.2-21q22.3 regions and gain of 8q24.3 were the most frequently detected changes in this multi-focal prostate cancer study, occurring in all same-case foci in at least one case. Microarray data were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization in selected foci. Our high-resolution genome-wide copy-number data suggest that many multi-focal cases derive from a single prostate cancer precursor clone and that this precursor may give rise to separate HGPIN foci, which through clonal expansion may progress to multi-focal invasive prostate cancer. These findings, which demonstrate the monoclonal origin of multi-focal prostate cancer, should significantly enhance our understanding of prostate carcinogenesis and potentially improve clinical management of the disease.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array was performed for a total of 48 cancer and HGPIN lesions from 18 prostate cancer cases. All samples have case-matched normal controls. PL = high grade PIN from left side, PR = high grade PIN from right side, PM = high grade PIN from middle of the tissue, TL = tumour from left side, TR = tumour from right side.
