TITLE
Genome wide gene expression profiling of visceral adipose tissue among Asian Indian diabetics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genes showing differential expression in visceral adipose tissue obtained from Asia Indian obese women suffering from type-2 diabetes mellitus as compared to age and BMI matched normal glucose tolerant women were identified by genome wide transcriptomic profiling in 5 diabetic and 5 control subjects respectively.

DESIGN
In this study, omental biopsies were obtained from 5 diabetic and 5 control women undergoing cholecystectomy. All the subjects age > 55 years, BMI > 30, free from infection and malignancy. Expression profiling of 32878 probes for 29,098 genes was done in all participants. A matrix file containing both processed and raw data is linked below as a supplementary file.
