TITLE
A miRNA-based signature associated to relapse in pediatric t(8;21)RUNX1-RUNX1T1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed genome wide miRNA expression analysis to investigate the ability of miRNAs in predicting leukemia relapse from 33 t(8;21) pediatric AMLs at diagnosis divided into a training and a validation cohort. COX regression analysis and ROC curves were used to identify a powerful miRNA signature able to predict relapse in t(8;21) AML patients.  miRNA profiling showed that patients with high- or low- risk of relapse had different expression profiles.  We support the role of microRNAs in modulating the prognosis of t(8;21)-AML and the use of a miRNA expression signature at diagnosis  to better define standard risk cases in pediatric AML.

DESIGN
260 ng of bone marrow RNA from 33 patients with de novo AML harboring t(8;21) pediatric AML at diagnosis were hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip® miRNA 4.0 arrays for high throughput detection. Class comparisons between different patient subgroups (Relapsed vs No Relapsed) were performed. Moreover,  6 matched relapse specimens were hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip® miRNA 4.0 arrays and analyzed.
