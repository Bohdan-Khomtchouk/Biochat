TITLE
MicroRNA 19a replacement partially rescues fin and cardiac defects in zebrafish model of Holt Oram syndrome [miRNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The regulative role of miRNAs in Holt-Oram Syndrome is investigated in a zebrafish model.

DESIGN
The zebrafish gene Tbx5a was silenced with antisense morpholino oligonucleotide MO-Tbx5a against the TSS of the gene. A MO-CT was used in CT sample. 1.5ng morpholinos were injected into the yolk of 1-cell stage embryos and total RNA extracted from 50 embryos collected at 48hpf.The Zebrafish  wild-type AB strain line was used.
