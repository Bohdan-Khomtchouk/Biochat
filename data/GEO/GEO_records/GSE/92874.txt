TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome profiles in Control and Schizophrenia hiPSC-dervied NPC [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We Report the genome-wide RNA expression levels in control and schizophrenia hiPSC dervied NPC treated with neuronal media for 2 days.  In total about 15,000 gene expression were detected in all samples, of which 1349 were dysregualted.

DESIGN
Examination, identification and comparision of mRNA expression profliles in control and schizophrenia npc
