TITLE
Temporal comparison of transcriptomic alterations in human, mouse and rat primary B lymphocytes exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq was used to analyze and compare temporal TCDD-induced gene expression changes in primary human, mouse and rat B cells. Most of the differentially expressed genes exibited species-specific expression. Cross-species comparison identified 28 orthologs commonly deregulated in all 3 species.  The study provides new insight into mechanisms of TCDD-induced suppression of B cell effector function.

DESIGN
Primary human, mouse, and rat mRNA profiles of primary B cells treated with either vehicle (0.02% DMSO) or 30nM TCDD for 4, 8, and 24h  were generated by sequencing.  Human B cell treatments was performed in triplicate while primary B cells from 20 mice or 6 rats were pooled.
