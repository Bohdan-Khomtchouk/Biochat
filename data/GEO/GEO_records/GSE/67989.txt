TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of E2F1 dependent gene expression in mouse testicular tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The effect of E2F1 loss on gene expression in testicular tissue was analyzed in 20-day old E2F1-/-, E2F1+/- mice. The hypothesis ws that there would be clear changes in expression of genes related to cell cycle machinery. The results show that E2F1 has wider implications in gene expression dynamics in testicular cell types than merely controlling cell cycle related genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from testis tissue of 20-day-old E2F1-/- (KO), E2F1+/- (HZ) and E2F1+/+ mice (WT).
