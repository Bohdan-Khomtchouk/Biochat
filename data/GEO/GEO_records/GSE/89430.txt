TITLE
RNA-Seq Analysis of Dose-Dependent TCDD-Elicited Ileal Gene Expression in Male Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dose-dependent ileal gene expression was examined following repeated exposure (every 4 days for 28 days) to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). These data were used to examine the effect of repeated TCDD exposure on gene expression in the intestinal epithelium of C57BL/6 male mice.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates for each dose (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30) of TCDD and sesame oil vehicle
