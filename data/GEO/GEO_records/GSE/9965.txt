TITLE
Notch targets in KC Drosophila cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To identify genes upregulated in response to Notch signalling in KC cells. Keywords: Expression analysis at a single timepoint (30' after Notch activation)

DESIGN
KC cells were obtained from Dr Martin Zeidler. Control versus Notch activated KC cells: mRNA was extracted from KC cells incubated in the absence or presence of EDTA to activate Notch (cells were harvested 30 minutes after addition of EDTA). RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Sigma) and reverse transcription was performed with Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo-dT primers (Sigma). Control and experimental samples were labeled with Cy3 or Cy5, mixed together and hybridized on Drosophila transcriptome long-oligonucleotide microarrays (FlyChip, FL002; http://www.flychip.org.uk/services/core/FL002/ ). Three biological replicates and dye swaps were performed (5 arrays in total/experiment). Slides were scanned by Genepix 400B dual laser scanner (Axon) and spots were found and quantified by Dapple software.
