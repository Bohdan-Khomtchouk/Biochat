TITLE
Human airway epithelial cell response to LPS and house dust mite antigen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Allergic asthmatic, allergy only, asthma only (no allergy), and non-allergic non-asthmatic (control) subjects underwent bronchoscopy with instillation of saline, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and house dust mite antigen in separate subsegmental bronchi. Airway epithelial cells were collected four hours later (three samples per subject). RNA was extracted from these cells for microarray analysis. Keywords: gene expression arrays (two-dye: sample against common " universal " reference RNA)
