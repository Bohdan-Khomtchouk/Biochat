TITLE
RNA-Seq study of gene expression in feather branching

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Feather branching morphogenesis is a complex process which is likely to be regulated by many genes. Also, feathers from different body regions are drastically different in their morphology, thus suggesting differential gene expression. To understand the feather epithelial branching process, we profiled gene expression in the ramogenic feather epithelium in adult chicken where branching begins. Feathers from the neck, wing, and tail regions in their actively growing phase were each profiled.

DESIGN
Feathers from the neck, wing, leg regions in adult chicken in their actively growing phase were plucked. Feathers were dissected under a stereo dissection microscope. The mesenchymal pulp were discarded. The ramogenic feather epithelium was pooled from five feathers. Total RNAs were extracted from the feather epithelium, and processed for RNA-seq.
