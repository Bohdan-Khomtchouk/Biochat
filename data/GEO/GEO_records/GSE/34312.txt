TITLE
Prostatic Stromal Cell Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated prostatic stromal microarray expression data for functional validation of our LOH/AI hot-/cold-spots in stroma. Stromal cells from normal peripheral zone tissue and from tumors are grown in culture, and were analyed on gene expression platform.

DESIGN
Stromal cells cultured from normal peripheral zone tissues (F-PZ-64, F-PZ-79, F-PZ-82, F-PZ-102, F-PZ-105) and from tumors (F-CA-31, F-CA-39, F-CA-52, F-CA-67, F-CA-93) were established and grown as previously described in Peehl et al. (2000). Total RNAs were extracted from semi-confluent cells (passages 4-5) one day after feeding fresh medium using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions and treated with TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion).  Hybridizations were performed according to Illumina protocols by the Genomic Core, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic.  All samples were hybridized to the Illumina Sentrix Human-6_v3 Expression BeadChip (GPL6884) which contains 48,000 distinct oligonucleotide probes.  Normalization is done using average normalization algorithm of BeadStudio Gene Expression Module v3.4 (Illumina).
