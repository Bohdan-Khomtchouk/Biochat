TITLE
Metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic study of enrichment culture of M. oxyfera (denitrifying methanotroph)

ORGANISM
Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera

SUMMARY
DNA, RNA and protein were extracted from the culture and subjected to massive parallel sequencing and nano-LC-MS-MS respectively

DESIGN
Combination of these methods enabled the reconstruction of the complete genome sequence of M oxyfera from the metagenome and identification of the functionally relevant enzymes and genes

PLATFORM
