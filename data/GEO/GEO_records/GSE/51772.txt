TITLE
Interactions of ARF6 with PIF4, BZR1, and RGA integrate auxin signaling with environmental and other hormonal signals in Arabidopsis [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Auxin is a major plant hormone for both development and environmental adaptation. Auxin responses are context dependent and highly modulated by light, temperature, the circadian clock, brassinosteroid, and gibberellin, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that auxin signaling integrates with other signals through direct interactions of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR6 (ARF6) with PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4), the brassinosteroid-signaling transcription factor BZR1, and the gibberellin-signaling repressor RGA.  ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq experiments show that ARF6, PIF4, and BZR1 bind to largely overlapping targets in the genome and synergistically activate gene expression. In vitro and in vivo assays show that ARF6-promoter binding is enhanced by PIF4 and BZR1 but blocked by RGA. Furthermore, a tripartite HLH/bHLH module feedback regulates PIF activity and thus modulates auxin sensitivity according to additional developmental and environmental cues. Our results demonstrate a central growth-regulation transcriptional network that coordinates hormonal, environmental, and developmental control of cell elongation and plant growth.

DESIGN
Seedlings (Col-0 and iaa3) were grown on medium containing 2 ÂµM propiconazole (PPZ) in the dark for 5 days and treated with mock or 100 nM BL for 4 hr before harvesting for total RNA extraction.

PLATFORM
