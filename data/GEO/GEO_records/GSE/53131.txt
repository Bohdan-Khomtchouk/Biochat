TITLE
Expression data from livers of C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet and coffee

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of  the intake of three types of coffee (caffeinated, decaffeinated,  and green unroasted coffee) on the livers of C57BL/6J mice fed  a high-fat diet, and to extensively elucidate the physiological  responses to coffee intake by analysing the findings obtained  from a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis using DNA  microarrays.

DESIGN
Briefly, 7-week-old male C57BL/6J mice purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan (Yokohama) were divided into the following five groups. The normal diet group (ND group) was fed D12450B (10 kcal% fat, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). The high-fat diet group (HF group) was fed D12492 (60 kcal% fat, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). The caffeinated coffee group (HFCC group) was fed a high-fat diet containing 2% caffeinated freeze-dried coffee. The decaffeinated coffee group (HFDC group) was fed a high-fat diet containing 2% decaffeinated freeze-dried coffee. The green unroasted coffee group (HFGC group) was fed a high-fat diet containing 2% unroasted caffeinated freeze-dried coffee. The mice had ad libitum access to their diets and drinking water. After 9 weeks, mice were sacrificed and the livers were subjected to the Affymrtix DNA microarray experiment.
