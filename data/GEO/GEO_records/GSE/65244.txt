TITLE
Temporal gene expression in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
In Escherichia coli crosstalk between DNA supercoiling, nucleoid-associated proteins and major RNA polymerase Ïƒ initiation factors regulates growth phase-dependent gene transcription. We show that the highly conserved spatial ordering of relevant genes along the chromosomal replichores largely corresponds both to their temporal expression patterns during growth and to an inferred gradient of DNA superhelical density from the origin to the terminus. Genes implicated in similar functions are related mainly in trans across the chromosomal replichores, whereas DNA-binding transcriptional regulators interact predominantly with targets in cis along the replichores. We also demonstrate that macrodomains (the individual structural partitions of the chromosome) are regulated differently. We infer that spatial and temporal variation of DNA superhelicity during the growth cycle coordinates oxygen and nutrient availability with global chromosome structure, thus providing a mechanistic insight into how the organization of a complete bacterial chromosome encodes a spatiotemporal program integrating DNA replication and global gene expression.

DESIGN
Temporal gene expression data taken at 60, 120, 180 300 (wt only) and 420 min under controlled growth conditions. See also methods of Sobetzko et al. 2012
