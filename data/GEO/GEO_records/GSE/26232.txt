TITLE
Genomic profiles vary with race and subtype in young African American and European American breast cancer (SNP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the United States, African-American (AA) women are more likely to develop early-onset breast cancer and have historically poorer outcomes due to this disease compared to European-American (EA) women. Here, we analyzed genomic profiles of breast tumors from young women ( < 50 years old), matched by tumor subtype, histological grade, and ethnicity (African-American, AA, compared to European-American, EA). DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) were analyzed on the Affymetrix Human SNP Array v 6.0 platform. The study provides insight into the genetic component of ethnicity-related breast cancer health disparities.

DESIGN
DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) and genotypes were analyzed using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 platform. Breast tumor samples from young women ( < 50 years old) were matched as follows: a matched pair consists of one AA and one EA sample, matched for tumor grade and tumor subtype (based on immunohistochemical analysis of ER, PR, and HER2 status). DNA from forty-four samples (22 AA, 22 EA) was analyzed on the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array according to manufacturerâ€™s directions.
