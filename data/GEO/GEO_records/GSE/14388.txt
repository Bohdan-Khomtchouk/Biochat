TITLE
Cotton Fiber Cells: Germplasm Line MD 52ne vs. Germplasm Line MD 90ne

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of cotton fiber cells from two cotton germplasm lines, MD 52ne and MD 90ne.  Comparison of fiber cell transcription profiles is between the two germplasm lines and over a developmental time-course from 8 to 24 days post anthesis in four day intervals.
