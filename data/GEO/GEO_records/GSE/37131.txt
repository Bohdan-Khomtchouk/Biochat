TITLE
Melanoma tissue samples from a clinical trial: no treatment vs. post-temsirolimus alone vs. post-combination temsirolimus and bevacizumab

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine if treatment with a combined therapeutic regimen, which resulted in clinical benefit in a subset of patients in a clinical trial, alters miRNA expression in a way that may be used to guide treatment with these agents and to identify miRNAs that may be involved in the mechanism of action of this regimen

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, untreated tissue, post-temsirolimus alone treatment, post combination-treatment tissue. 33 total samples, including 5 samples resubmitted for quality control.

PLATFORM
GPL11434 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, 6th generation - hsa, mmu & rno
