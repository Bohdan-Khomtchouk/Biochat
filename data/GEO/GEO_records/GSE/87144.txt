TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of MRL-871 and control-treated C57BL/6 thymocytes and Rorc over-expressing cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the genes that are differentially expressed in thymocytes upon treatment with MRL-871 in vitro and in vivo, and by Rorc over-expression in thymic lymphoma cell lines.

DESIGN
For in vitro RNA-Seq experiment, whole thymocytes from 7-9 week old C57BL/6 mice were isolated and treated with DMSO control or MRL-871 for 2hr, and collected for RNA-Seq analysis. For in vivo analysis, C57BL/6 mice were treated with vehicle control or MRL-871 for 2hr and whole thymocytes were analyzed by RNA-Seq. Rorc-/- cell line was derived from a lymphoma that spontaneously developed in the thymus of a Rorc-/- mouse. The bicistronic MIGR1 retroviral vector expressing RORÎ³T-GFP or GFP was used to transgect the Rorc-/- cell line.
