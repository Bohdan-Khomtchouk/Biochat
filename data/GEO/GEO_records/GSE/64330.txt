TITLE
Gene expression profile of mock and FLT3-ITD-expressing K562 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes regulated by FLT3-ITD activity.

DESIGN
Viral particles with pMY-puro, pMY-puro-FLT3-ITD-1 or pMY-puro-FLT3-ITD-2, were generated using PLAT-gp packaging cells and infected to K562 cells. The vector-transduced cells were selected with 2Âµg/ml puromycin treatment.

PLATFORM
GPL13497 Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
