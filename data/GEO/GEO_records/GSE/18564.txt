TITLE
DEHP activation of PPAR(alpha) and CAR regulartory pathway in mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Characterization of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor alpha (PPAR(alpha)) - Independent Effects of PPAR(alpha) Activators in the Rodent Liver: Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate Activates the Constitutive Activated Receptor data files in this series indicate the involvement of PPAR(alpha) and CAR regulatory pathway after DEHP treatment. Keywords: gene expression/microarray

DESIGN
Wild-type and PPAR(alpha)-null mice were treated with DEHP for 4 days and liver tissues were collected for microarray assay.
