TITLE
Adult aging in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We wished to study normal adult aging in C. elegans.  We competitively hybridized a series of experimental samples (experimental variable: adult age) against a common reference sample. We use the CF512 fer-15(b26) II; fem-1 (hc17) IV mutant strain, which has defective spermatids which fail to activate into spermatozoa at 25C.  Culturing this strain at 25C prevented self-fertilization and therefore eliminated contributions from embryonic transcripts.  CF512 animals develop an otherwise-normal germ line; their lifespan and aging are similar to wild-type animals. We axenized eggs and then synchronized animals via L1 arrest. Populations were very tightly synchronized.  Animals were cultured at 25C.  Samples were extracted and hybridized as described in protocols at http://microarrays.org.
