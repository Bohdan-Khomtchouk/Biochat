TITLE
Profiling adipose tissue (eWAT) from obese ob/ob and lean control ob/+ mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This program addresses the molecular basis of beta-cell failure associated with the development of type 2 diabetes in the db/db mice. Specifically, which genes are differentially expressed in pancreatic islets of the db/db mice compared to the control db/+ mice?

DESIGN
The db/db mice islets profiling data was analyzed by identifying genes that were up- and down-regulated at selected p value and fold change in the islets of db/db mice compared to the corresponding db/+ controls.
