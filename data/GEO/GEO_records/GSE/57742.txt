TITLE
Transcriptomic effects of the expression in Arabidopsis of a TCP15-EAR fusion controlled by its own promoter (one-color experiment)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
TCP proteins are transcription factors that participate in plant development (Martin-Trillo ad Cubas, 2010; Uberti-Manassero et al., 2013). Previous studies demonstrated that the Arabidopsis thaliana TCP protein TCP15 affects the development of leaves, stems and flowers (Kieffer et al., 2011; Uberti-Manassero et al., 2013). To obtain further insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in TCP15 action, we performed a transcriptional profiling of plants that express a repressor form of TCP15 under the control of the TCP15 promoter (P15::TCP15-EAR), previously described in Uberti-Manassero et al. (2012). For this purpose, gene expression was quantified in RNA extracted from complete rosettes of 25-day-old P15::TCP15-EAR plants and compared with that in RNA extracted from wild-type (Col-0) plants of the same age.

DESIGN
Two genotype experiment: wild type vs. P15::TCP15-EAR plants. Biological replicates: 1 wild type replicate, 1 P15::TCP15-EAR replicate.

PLATFORM
GPL12621 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Probe Name version)
