TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of diverse cell types infected with human cytomegalovirus [array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comprehensive RNA sequencing and splicing-sensitive microarray analysis of three diverse cell types infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), including primary fibroblasts (HFFs), endothelial cells (ECs), and neural progenitors (NPCs) derived from embryonic stem cells. This global analysis includes both host and viral gene expression measurements, and an in-depth assessment of alternative RNA processing events. Extended comparisons were conducted through RNA sequencing analysis of human herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections.

DESIGN
Alternative host splicing analysis component of the study. This data subset was derived from triplicate sets of cell culture that were each subjected to splice-junction arrays.
