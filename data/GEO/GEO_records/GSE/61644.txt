TITLE
Transcript profiling of Bln1 silenced plants (BSMV-VIGS) relative to empty vector and buffer treated controls in barley-powdery mildew interactions

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) was used to identify significant new genes in the regulation of host innate immunity.  This experiment was designed to uncover significant changes in Bln1 (Contig12219_at)-silenced plants relative to empty vector and buffer treated controls. Five independent biological replications of a split-plot experimental design were conducted with replications as blocks, treatment with Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh) as the whole-plot factor, and all combinations of genotype (Mla13 and Mla9) and VIGS treatment [Buffer control (mock), BSMV:00 (empty vector), and BSMV:Bln1248] as the split-plot factor for a total of 60 GeneChip hybridizations. Ten seedlings were used as a split-plot experimental unit for each combination of replication, Bgh treatment, genotype, and VIGS treatment.  Plants were grown in a controlled 20Â°C glasshouse prior to VIGS treatment.  Twelve days after VIGS treatment, half of the plants in each replication were challenged with the compatible Bgh isolate 5874.  Top halves of 5 of the 10 seedling third leaves (about 10 cm) from each split-plot experimental unit were harvested into liquid N2 at 32 hours after inoculation (HAI) - the timepoint with the highest differential Bln1 transcript accumulation (Meng et al. 2009), and after initial establishment of the perihaustorial interface (Caldo et al. 2004).  The remaining 5 leaves were used to record infection phenotype 7 days later.  RNA was isolated for GeneChip hybridization from the 32-HAI samples.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Yan Meng.
