TITLE
Gene expression in the heart of mouse with myocardial infarction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the function of genes in heart, we performed gene expression microarray for the hearts of 4 sham-operated mice and 4 anterior interventricular artery ligated mice.

DESIGN
4 mice were subjected to permanent occlusion of the anterior interventricular artery while 4 mice were subjected to the identical surgical procedure without coronary ligation. 24 hours after the permanent occlusion, mice were sacrificed and the ventricles of heart were harvested for RNA isolation. Total RNAs were labelled and hybridised on Agilent Mouse SurePrint G3 Array. One sample per array.
