TITLE
Gene expression profile of metastasis-associated neutrophils

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to determine gene expresssion differences between neutrophils from either K14cre;CdhF/F;Trp53F/F mammary tumor-bearing mice or wild-type mice.

DESIGN
Neturophil expression profiles were compared between four wild-type mice and five K14cre;CdhF/F;Trp53F/F mice.
