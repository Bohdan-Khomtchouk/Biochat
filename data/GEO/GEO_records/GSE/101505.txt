TITLE
Arginine-dependent gene regulation in Streptococcus gordonii arcR regulator knockout

ORGANISM
Streptococcus gordonii str. Challis

SUMMARY
We have previously shown that responses of the oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii to arginine are co-ordinated by three paralogous regulators: ArcR, ArgR and AhrC. This set of experiments was designed to assess the effects of the ArcR gene regulator on global gene expression in Streptococcus gordonii under high arginine or following a shift to no arginine.

DESIGN
Single colour microarrays were used to measure gene expression in four biological replicates of S. gordonii cells cultured, with and without arginine restriction.
