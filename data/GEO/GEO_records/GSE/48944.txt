TITLE
Gene expression profiles of human kidneys

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The association of cytosine methylation and gene expression in the human kidneys is yet to be determined, here we have 25 pairs of the methylation and gene expression profile.

DESIGN
We sought to decrease the cell type heterogeneity of kidney tissues to increase the resolution of expression profiles. To that end, microdissected human kidney tissue are used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
