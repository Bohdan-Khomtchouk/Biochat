TITLE
Amniotic fluid and necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Preterm neonates are susceptible to gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Maternal milk, and especially colostrum, protects against NEC via growth promoting, immunomodulatory and antimicrobial factors. The fetal enteral diet, amniotic fluid (AF), contains similar bioactive components and we hypothesized that postnatal AF administration would reduce inflammatory responses and NEC in preterm neonates. Thirty preterm pigs (92% gestation) were delivered by caesarean section and fed total parental nutrition (TPN) for 48 h followed by enteral porcine colostrum (COLOS, n=7), infant formula (FORM, n=13) or formula + porcine AF (AF, n=10). Using a previously validated model of NEC in preterm pigs, we determined the structural, functional, microbiological and immunological responses to AF when administered prior to and after introduction of a suboptimal enteral formula diet.
