TITLE
Comparison between V. cholerae MO10 delta PTS mutant and wild type strain grown as planktonic or surface-associated cells

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae MO10

SUMMARY
The PTS system is a central regulatory cascade in bacteria. Here, Vibrio cholerae PTS role was investagated during biofilm formation

DESIGN
Analysis used wild type MO10 cells as control samples for comparison to the delta PTS strain. Strains were grown as planktonic (sample 1) or surface attached cells (sample 2). Experiment was done in triplicate with dye swap, which represent 6 independent microarray hybridizations.

PLATFORM
GPL4353 JCVI PFGRC Vibrio cholerae 19K v2 array designed primarily based on strain El Tor N16961
