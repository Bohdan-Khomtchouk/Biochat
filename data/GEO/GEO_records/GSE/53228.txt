TITLE
Epigenome analysis of human brain gliomas (part 2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of 33 human glioblastoma samples. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in glioma samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 33 glioblastoma samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version) GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
