TITLE
Transcriptome of WT mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goals of this study was to obtain the trasncriptome of WT mESCs to compare it with the transcriptome of RNAi mutant mESCs (deposit separately).

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of mouse embryonic stem cells (E14) were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
