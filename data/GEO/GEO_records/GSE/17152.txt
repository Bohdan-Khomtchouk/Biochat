TITLE
T-REx 293 cells expressiong either WT or I642G IRE1α: 1μg/mL dox and 5μM 1NMPP1 treated vs control at two time points

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of 1μg/mL dox and 5μM 1NMPP1 treatedT-REx 293 cells expressing either WT or I642G IRE1α  vs control.

DESIGN
TREx 293_WT_8h_03 and TREx 293_WT_NT_03 are hybed against a universal control sample;TREx 293_WT_24h_01and TREx 293_WT_NT_01 are hybed against a universal control smaple;TREx 293_WT_24h_02 and TREx 293_WT_NT_02 are hybed against a universal control smaple;TREx 293_IG_24h_01 and TREx 293_IG_NT_01 are hybed against a universal control sample;TREx 293_IG_24h_02 and TREx 293_IG_NT_02 are hybed against a universal control sample. The rest arrays are hybed pairwise with treated vs untreated on the same array.
