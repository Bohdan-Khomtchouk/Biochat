TITLE
Expression data from gall bladder and cystic duct in wild type and Sox17+/-mice at 15 dpc

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sox17 expression is important for development of gallbladder and bile duct systems in embryo, and it is reported that gallbladder hypoplasia in Sox17 hetero genic embryo. Additionally it was reported that hepatitis was occurred in Sox17 hetero genic newborn by gallbladder hypoplasia. So, we examined Sox17 gene cascade and the role for the formation of gallbladder and bile duct systems by microarray analysis on Sox17 hetero genic gallbladder in day 15 of pregnancy when Sox17 express and gallbladder epithelium alternated morphology. We detected that expression of Sonic hedgehog (shh) signal genes decreased in sox17+/- gallbladder and cysticduct as compared with the wildtype gallbladders.These arry analysis in gallbladder and cysticduct reveal expression of shh in developmental gallbladder is downstream in sox17+/- and gene expression in sox17+/- gallbladder was similar in cysticduct .

DESIGN
Total RNAs from gallbladder and cysticduct of wildtype and Sox17+/- mice at 15dpc were subjected to microarray analyses. Two biological replicates of each genotype were analyzed.
