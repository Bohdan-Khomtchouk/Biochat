TITLE
Comprehensive assessment of the regulons controlled by the FixLJ-FixK2-FixK1 cascade in Bradyrhizobium japonicum

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium japonicum ; Glycine max

SUMMARY
Genome-wide transcription profiling of B. japonicum fixJ, fixK2, and fixK1 mutant strains which were grown in free-living microoxic condition, and in the case of the fixK1 mutant also in anoxic condition. Transcriptomes of nodules from soybean plants infected with the fixJ or fixK2 mutant strains were investigated, too. This study includes also the expression data of a nifA mutant grown in free-living anoxic condition. Samples from GSM210242 to GSM210286 in GEO record number GSE8478 need to be considered for the analyses. Keywords: gene regulation, genetic modification, growth conditions, symbiosis

DESIGN
Comparison analysis of the B. japonicum fixJ, fixK2 and fixK1 mutants and the wild type grown under different oxygen conditions in culture and during symbiosis with soybean.

PLATFORM
