TITLE
The E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah2 contributes to castration-resistant prostate cancer by regulation of androgen receptor transcriptional activity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression altered upon knockdown of Siah2 in prosate cancer cells. The objective is to elucidate which signaling pathways or transcription factors are regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah2 in human prostate cancer cells.

DESIGN
CWR22Rv1 cells were in fected with pLKO.1 control or Siah2 shRNA, and selected with 1ug/ml of puromycin to get stable transfectants.  Total RNA was extracted for micorarray analysis to compare the diffentially expressed genes between pLKO.1 control and Siah2 knockdown cells.
