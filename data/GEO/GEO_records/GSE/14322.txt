ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used array-based comparative genomic hybridization (arrayCGH) of 76 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) to search for genetically disrupted genes.

DESIGN
Seventy-six HCC clinical specimens were analyzed. Genomic DNA of the tumor sample was labeled with Cy5 and reference normal DNA (Promega) was labeled with Cy3.
