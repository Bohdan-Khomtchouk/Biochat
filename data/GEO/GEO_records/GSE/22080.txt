TITLE
Pleiotropic expression of endogenous genes upon fungus infection of wheat plants containing anti-fungal transgenes

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Recent attempts to increase endogenous disease resistance of plants by overexpression of anti-fungal transgenes have shown a potential of this method. However, it has also been shown that such improvements are usually small. One of the obvious reasons for this low anti-fungal effect might be the regulation of endogenous genes in parallel. In this project, we will study the effect of anti-fungal transgenes on the endogenous gene expression. Such effects might relate to substantial equivalence which is a biosafety issue of concern to the public. The GeneChip Wheat Genome Array will be used to detect expression of defence response genes and key genes of metabolic pathways. We will use wheat plants transformed with anti-fungal gene of specific effect against a small group of seed transmitted, pathogenic fungi (KP4 against smuts and bunts). Transformed spring wheat line will be challenged by stinking smut (inhibited by KP4). The effect on the endogenous gene expression will be tested for plants grown in the field in collaboration with the USDA Department. This work will contribute to our understanding of plant defence responses in general and may allow improving strategies to strengthen these responses.

DESIGN
Teliospores of pathogenic races T-1, T-5 and T-16 of T. caries provided by a collection in Aberdeen, ID, USA were used for the tests. Seeds of the genetically engineered Swiss spring wheat variety Greina (GrKP4) and the null-segregant control line (Gr0) were coated with spores and Individual plants were scored for bunt symptoms. For microarray analysis only samples inoculated with T1 and T16 were used.
