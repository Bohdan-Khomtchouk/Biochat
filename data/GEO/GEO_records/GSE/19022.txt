TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of OSKM / N2SKM- infected MEFs over time course

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global  gene expression profiles of  OSKM and N2OSKM-infected MEFs over a time course (3, 7, 11 dpi).

DESIGN
Three biological replicates for each OSKM and N2OSKM time point. The global gene expression profiles of the N2OSKM infected MEFs were compared to OKSM-infected MEFs.
