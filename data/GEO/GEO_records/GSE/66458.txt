TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of Brachypodium distachyon

ORGANISM
Brachypodium distachyon

SUMMARY
96 BdbZIPs responding to 14 stresses were screened using qPCR. All samples were repeated with 3 times and GAPDH was regarded as house keeping gene. The stresses included heavy metal treatments, environmental factors and phytohormones

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. The 20d-seedlings were used and the 3Âµg of total RNA were sysnthesis for cDNA by using PrimeScript Reverse Transcriptase (TAKARA).
