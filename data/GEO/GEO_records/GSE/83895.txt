TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of innate intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Characterization of intraepithelial ILC on the basis of CD8α and Ly49E expression

DESIGN
CD3- CD45+ CD8αα- Ly49E+, CD3- CD45+ CD8αα+ Ly49E+ and CD3- CD45+ CD8αα+ Ly49E- cells were sorted to high purity ( > 98%) from the small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte fraction of NOD-SCID mice using a BD FACSAria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences). RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Amplification and hybridization was carried out with the Ovation Pico WTA V2 kit (NuGen Technologies, San Carlos, CA, USA) and the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0ST Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
