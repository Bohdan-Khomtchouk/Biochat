TITLE
MyoD and FoxO3 mediated hotspot interaction orchestrates super-enhancer activity during myogenic differentiation (Foxo3 ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Super-enhancers (SEs) are cis-regulatory elements enriching lineage specific key transcription factors (TFs) to form hotspots. A paucity of identification and functional dissection promoted us to investigate SEs during myoblast differentiation. ChIP-seq analysis of histone marks leads to the uncovering of SEs which remodel progressively during the course of differentiation. Further analyses of TF ChIP-seq enable the definition of SE hotspots co-bound by the master TF, MyoD and other TFs, among which we perform in-depth dissection for MyoD/FoxO3 interaction in driving the hotspots formation and SE activation.

DESIGN
Foxo3 ChIP-seq experiments performed in myoblast and myotube.
