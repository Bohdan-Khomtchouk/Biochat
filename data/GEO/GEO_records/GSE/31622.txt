TITLE
Gene expression data from WT and Klf3 KO mouse CD19+ splenic B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the roles of Klf3 in B lymphopoiesis, CD19+ B cells were sorted from the spleens of WT and Klf3 KO mice (Molecular and Cellular Biology (2008); 28:3967â€“3978). Following RNA extraction, gene expression was compared in WT and Klf3 KO CD19+splenic B cells using Affymetrix microarrays.

DESIGN
4 wildtype and 4 Klf3 KO mice were analysed, aged between 10 and 12 weeks

PLATFORM
