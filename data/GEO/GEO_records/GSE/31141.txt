TITLE
HCMV infection of human neural precursor cells: HCMV expression

ORGANISM
Human betaherpesvirus 5 ; unidentified

SUMMARY
HCMV treated and control human primary adult neural precursor cells (isolated from hippocampus) were used at passages 2-4 for infection with HCMV and RNA was harvested at indicated times

DESIGN
Primary adult neural precursor cells were infected with HCMV strains Towne and TR (O.1MOI) and RNA was extracted at 72 hrs postinfection for expression profiling on both HCMV and Affymetrix DNA arrays
