TITLE
Transcript levels in mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total RNA was isolated from liver samples of C57/BL6 mice over a circadian time course, 3 biological replicate samples per time point were collected and processed individually. RNA from each individual biological replicate sample was extracted using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Cat# 74106) and hybridized on an Affymetrix mouse Gene ST1.0 microarray.

DESIGN
Examination of mouse liver tissue at 4 time-points around the clock in free-running, continuous conditions (constant darkness, temperature and food available ad libitum).

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
