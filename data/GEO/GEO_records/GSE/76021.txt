TITLE
Gene expression profiling of pediatric adrenocortical tumors collected by the International Pediatric Adrenocortical Tumor Registry (IPACTR).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have previously observed that expression of HLA genes associate with histology of adrenocortical tumors (PMID 17234769). Here, we supplement that data with gene expression data on N additional tumors. This submission includes the data from the original study and N additional tumors.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to explore the expression profiles of a cohort of heterogenously treated pediatric adrenocortical carcinomas with histology. Specimens were harvested during surgery and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen to preserve tissue integrity.
