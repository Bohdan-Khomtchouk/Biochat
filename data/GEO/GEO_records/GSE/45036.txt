TITLE
20 mM EtOH on hESCs.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied alcohol's effect on human embryonic stem cell line, H9. Our main objective was to delineate the molecular mechanisms that are involved in changing the differentiation potential of hESCs.

DESIGN
Undifferentiated and differentiated (Embryoid bodies) hESCs were treated with 0 or 20 mM EtOH in duplicate for 24 hours.
