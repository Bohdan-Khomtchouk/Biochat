TITLE
Changes in gene expression when Nab3 is non-functional.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Nrd1 and Nab3 are two yeast RNA binding proteins which have been shown to be involved in transcription termination of non poly(A) genes.  We have used expression profiling of a Nab3 mutant to discover novel RNA targets of the Nrd1 and Nab3 transcription termination pathway.  Failure to terminate RNA polymerase II by Nab3 leads to continued transcription well beyond the correct termination sites, altering the expression of adjacent downstream genes.  Using this concept, our microarray uncovered the up-regulation of numerous genes that are located downstream of “cryptic unstable transcripts”, transcripts that are transcribed, terminated and rapidly degraded by Nrd1, Nab3, and the nuclear exosome. Keywords: yeast temperature sensitive mutant 25C vs 37C
