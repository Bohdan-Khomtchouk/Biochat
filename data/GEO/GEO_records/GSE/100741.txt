TITLE
Effects of temperatures on meiotic recombination in S. cerevisiae [CGH]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Temperature is key for biological activities, but its role in meiotic recombination processes is less known. Here, we uncovered the patterns of meiotic recombination by monitoring the double strands DNA breaks in diploid strain ZK5 cells cultured at 14ºC, 30ºC, and 37ºC.

DESIGN
Using whole genome CGH microarray, we examined meiotic DNA double strands breaks at different temperatures.
