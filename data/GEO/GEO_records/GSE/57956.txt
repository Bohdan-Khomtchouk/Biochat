TITLE
Methylation profile of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation profiling of tumor and adjacent non-tumorous tissues of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs. Samples included 59 tumors and 59 adjacent non-tumorous samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 59 tumors and 59 adjacent non-tumorous samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip.

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
