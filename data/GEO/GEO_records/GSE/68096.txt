TITLE
Comparative expression during feeding against starvation in the rice brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens

ORGANISM
Nilaparvata lugens

SUMMARY
Nilaparvata lugens, the brown planthopper (BPH) sucks the rice phloem sap containing high sucrose to obtain carbon source. The comparative gene expression analyses were perfomed during feeding against starvation in order to determine sugar transporter and other feeding related gene expression.

DESIGN
Young BPH females that feed rice seedlings or feed-deprived (water-supplied) for 24 hours were prepared in triplicate. Gene expression was compared in these two groups: feeding and feed-deprived.

PLATFORM
GPL20083 Agilent Brown planthopper (BPH) microarray version 2 (018781), containing partial spider mite EST
