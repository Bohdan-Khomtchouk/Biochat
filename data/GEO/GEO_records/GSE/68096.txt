TITLE
Comparative expression during feeding against starvation in the rice brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens

ORGANISM
Tetranychus urticae

SUMMARY
Nilaparvata lugens, the brown planthopper (BPH) sucks the rice phloem sap containing high sucrose to obtain carbon source. The comparative gene expression analyses were perfomed during feeding against starvation in order to determine sugar transporter and other feeding related gene expression.
