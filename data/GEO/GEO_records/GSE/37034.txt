TITLE
Rapid evolution in fungal reproductive genes as revealed by evolutionary analyses of expressed sequence tags in Neurospora

ORGANISM
Neurospora intermedia

SUMMARY
Neurospora intermedia is a heterothallic filamentous ascomycete. In this study we use microarray technology to study the difference in gene expression between vegetative growth and early reproductive development.

DESIGN
Neurospora intermedia FGSC#8882 mat-A and FGSC#8782 mat-a. Solid synthetic crossing medium (SCM)  was used as a nutrient regime before sampling and processing. Two different conditions were sampled: vegetative mycelial tissue and young reproductive mycelial tissue.

PLATFORM
GPL10640 Yale University Neurospora crassa 70-mer oligo whole genome transcription array
