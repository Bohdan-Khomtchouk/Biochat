TITLE
Transcriptome analysis in a radiosensitive and a radioresistant cell line after ionizing radiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression profiling was performed in two lymphoblastoid cell lines with different radiosentivitity, one radiosensitive (RS) and another radioresistant (RR), after different post-irradiation times. A greater and a prolonged transcriptional response after irradiation was induced in the RS cell line. Functional analysis showed that 24 h after irradiation genes involved in DNA damage response, negative regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis were still differentially up-regulated in the RS cell line but not in the RR cell line.

DESIGN
Sham-irradiated and irradiated (2 Gy) cell cultures of the RS and the RR cell line were incubated at 37ÂºC for 4 and 24 h and 14 days. After that, RNA was extracted and sequenced with QuantSeq technology
