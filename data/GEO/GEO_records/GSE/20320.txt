TITLE
Expression data from TK6 exposed to low-dose metals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We are investigating the response of human lymphoblastoid cells to low-dose exposure of environmental metals We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression upon response to low-dose metals Keywords: dose

DESIGN
TK6 cells  were grown to mid log-phase and exposed to low-doses of arsenic and cadmium. RNA was collected 24 hrs after exposure.
