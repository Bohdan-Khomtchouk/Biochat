TITLE
Genome wide analysis of skin cancer cell gene expresison exposed to stromal cancer associated fibroblasts in 3D gel matrix

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SCC12 cells were seeded ontop of organotypic gels with HN-CAF (head and neck carcinoma associated fibroblasts). Differential gene expression was analysed between cancer cells not exposed to CAFs or non-invading cancer cells exposed to CAFs.

DESIGN
Squamous cell cancer organotypics were constructed by embedding CAFs in collagen Matrigel matrix with SCC 12cells added on top. Gene expression was compared between non-invaded cancer cells and cancer cells not expoesd to CAFs.
