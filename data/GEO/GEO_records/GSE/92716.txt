TITLE
Iron_deficiency gene expression in Arabidopsis wild type and yellow stripe1-like1/3 (ysl1ysl3) double mutants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
When iron is withdrawn from the growth medium of plants, large changes in gene expression have been observed.  A double mutant with T-DNA insertions in the Arabidopsis yellow stripe1-like1 (At4g24120) and yellow stripe3-like (At5g53550) genes shows strong iron-related phenotypes.  This study is intended to uncover the gene expression changes that occur in leaves and roots of the double mutant compared to wild type plants.

DESIGN
or this study, wild type plants were grown with or whithout iron for a period of three days.  In these plants, the levels of iron deficiency chlorosis and the levels of iron are similar to that in the double mutant plants grown with normal iron nutrition. Thus, six samples are compared in this study.  Leaves from wild type plants grown with normal iron nutrition.   Leaves from wild type plants grown without iron for three days. Leaves from ysl1ysl3 double mutant plants grown with normal iron nutrition.   Roots from wild type plants grown with normal iron nutrition.     Roots from wild type plants grown without iron for three days.  Roots from ysl1ysl3 double mutant plants grown with normal iron nutrition. Plants were grown in sterile petri plates containing 1X Murishige and Skoog medium with or without antibiotics.  Plates were placed in an upright position so that the roots grew along the surface rather than inside the agar, which allowed for easy transfer.  Incubator conditions for plate-grown plants were 16 hour light, 8 hour dark at 22C.  After 10 days, plants were moved either to fresh iron containing plates (+Fe samples) or to plates prepared without Fe (-Fe samples).  Growth was continued for 3 days before samples were harvested.  Chlorophyll measurements were made at the time of harvest.
