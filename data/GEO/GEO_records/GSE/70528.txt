SUMMARY
Genes related to sleep and wakefulness were evaluated by RNA microarray in patients, including CKD,HD patients and control subjects.

DESIGN
RNA microarray analysis was performed in 19 patients without diabetes. The patients were divided into three groups: HT group (8 hypertension patients with eGFR of > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), CKD group (7 patients not on dialysis with eGFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and HD group (4 HD patients).
