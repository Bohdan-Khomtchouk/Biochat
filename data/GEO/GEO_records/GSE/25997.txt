TITLE
Expression data from Caulobacter crescentus (syn. C. vibrioides) swarmer and stalked cells starved for carbon

ORGANISM
Caulobacter vibrioides

SUMMARY
Bacteria adapt to shifts from rapid to slow growth, and have developed strategies for long-term survival during prolonged starvation and stress conditions. We report the response of specific developmental stages of C. crescentus -swarmer and stalked cells- to carbon starvation, a common form of nutritional stress encountered by free-living bacteria, that induces stasis.

DESIGN
Glucose, the only carbon source in the minimal media M2G was removed from C. crescentus exponential phase cultures, and total RNA was extracted after 30 and 60 minutes of incubation. The controls are cells growing in complete media.
