TITLE
Age-related changes in gene expression in retinal microglia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to evaluate the gene expression profile of retinal microglia cells in different age, we purified CD11b-positive microglia from the retinas of wild type C57BL/6 mice at 3, 12, 18, and 24 months age using cell sorting method with flow cytometry.  Age-related genes from isolated retinal microglia were performed using 16 Affymetrix GeneChips of Mouse Exon 1.0ST Arrays. Gene expression level between consecutive age groups (i.e. between 3 and 12 months, 12 and 18 months, and 18 and 24 months) was examined to identify microglia relevant aging genes that demonstrated significant changes. We identified a total 719 genes that showed increasing or decreasing more than 1.5-fold change (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA) for at least one of the three inter age-group comparisons. These identified genes were subjected to a hierarchical cluster analysis to visualize trends in differential expression across individual biological repeats in the 4 age groups.

DESIGN
The microglia cells were isolated from wild type C57BL/6 mice with microglia cell specific marker CD11b conjugated with FITC using flowcytometry sorting. The aging time point was designed as 4 groups: 3 moth, 12 month, 18 month and 24 month; each group includes 4 repeats. The total RNA was extracted from isolated retinal microglia cells and reverse transcripted to cDNA after amplification and labeling. The gene expression profile was detected with Affymetrix GeneChip of Mouse Exon 1.0ST Arrays
