TITLE
Influence of RppH on the small RNA transcriptome of Neisseria gonorrhoeae MS11

ORGANISM
Neisseria gonorrhoeae

SUMMARY
We assessed the small RNA transcriptome of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain MS11 in two genetic backgrounds; using wild type cells as well as cells carrying a rppH insertional mutation.  It was found that the presence of the RppH enzyme affected both the quantity and length of small RNAs in various chromosomal locations.  However, in comparing the two transcriptomes, we found that not all small RNAs were differentially expressed, suggesting that RppH targets only a subset of transcripts.

DESIGN
Analysis of the small RNA transcriptome of N. gonorrhoeae in a wild type and Î”rppH mutant background.
