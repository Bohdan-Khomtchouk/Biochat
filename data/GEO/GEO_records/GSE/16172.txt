TITLE
Effect of Ovarian Hormone on Gene Expression in Rhesus Dorsal Raphe Nucleus with Rhesus Affymetrix Chip

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
A small block of the midbrain containing the dorsal raphe nucleus was obtained from ovariectomized monkeys treated with placebo, estrogen, progesterone or estrogen plus progesterone for one month. The RNA was extracted and hybridized to the Rhesus Affymetrix chip. The results were analyzed with GCOS 1.0
