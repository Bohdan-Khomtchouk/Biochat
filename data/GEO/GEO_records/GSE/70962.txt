TITLE
Analysis of Junctional zone in murine placenta upon loss of Tfap2c

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tfap2c is deleted in Tpbpa positive precursor cells forming the junctional zone of murine placenta. Deregulation in gene expression is analysed compared to the junctional zone in control placenta.

DESIGN
TpbpaCre:Tfap2c-/- and wild type junctional zone of murine placenta at E13.5 was punched out using laser microdissection and RNA was isolated to perform Illumina WG6 v2.0 using platform GPL18752

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
