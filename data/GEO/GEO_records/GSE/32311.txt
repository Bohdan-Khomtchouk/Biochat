TITLE
Harnessing of the Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase complex controls lymphocyte development and prevents leukemogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cell fate decisions depend on the interplay between chromatin regulators and transcription factors. Here we show that activity of the Mi-2u Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex is controlled by the Ikaros family of lymphoid-lineage determining proteins. Ikaros, an integral component of the NuRD complex in lymphocytes, tethers this complex to active lymphoid differentiation genes, but keeps it in a functionally-poised state. Loss in Ikaros DNA binding activity causes a local increase in Mi-2u chromatin remodeling, histone deacetylation and suppression of lymphoid gene expression. The NuRD complex also redistributes to transcriptionally-poised non-Ikaros gene targets, involved in proliferation and metabolism, inducing their re-activation. Thus release of NuRD from Ikaros regulation blocks lymphocyte maturation and mediates progression to a leukemic state by engaging functionally-opposing epigenetic mechanisms and genetic networks. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression of mouse DP thymocyte after Ikaros inactivation with dominant negative of Ik at different stage.

DESIGN
8 samples (mouse DP thymocytes from wt, and different stage after Ikaros inactivation) are analyzed Mouse Microarray Expression platforms, Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0. Examination of different histone modifications and binding sites for Ikaros, Mi2beta in wild type DP thymocytes, and Ikaros knockout thymocytes.
