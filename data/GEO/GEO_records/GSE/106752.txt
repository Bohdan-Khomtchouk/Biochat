TITLE
β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine is a potent anti-alphavirus compound that induces high level of mutations in viral genome

ORGANISM
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus

SUMMARY
The goal of this project was the analysis of virus variants resistant to β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine.

DESIGN
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus TC-83 was passaged on Vero cells for 20 passages in the presence or absence of β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine. Virus samples were collected at passages 0, 5 10, 15 and 20. Total virion RNAs were isolated and sequenced.

PLATFORM
GPL24256 Illumina MiSeq (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus)
