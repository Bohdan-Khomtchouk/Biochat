TITLE
LaminB1 DamID in HT1080 fibroblasts overexpressing NET29/TMEM120A, NET39/PPAPDC3 or NET47/TM7SF2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Maps of genomic regions in proximity to the nuclear lamina were determined in untreated HT1080 fibroblasts and HT1080 stable cell lines expressing NET29/TMEM120A, NET39/PPAPDC3 or NET47/TM7SF2 as GFP fusions

DESIGN
The nuclear transmembrane proteins (NETs) NET29/TMEM120A, NET39/PPAPDC3 and NET47/TM7SF2 are able to reposition chromosomes towards/away from the nuclear envelope when overexpressed or knocked down in HT1080 cells. In this study we wanted to investigate peripheral chromatin changes after overexpression of these NETs.
