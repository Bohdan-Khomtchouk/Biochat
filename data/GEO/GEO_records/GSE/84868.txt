TITLE
Expression data from control and WHSC1 siRNA treated PC3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We conduct transcriptome comparison of control and WHSC1 depleted PC3 cells to gain genomic insights on the biological processes that WHSC1 is involved in prostate cancer cells. More than 2000 known genes were found changed in the WHSC1 depleted cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) show that the most prominent altered pathways in the WHSC1 depleted cells are related to regulation of actin-based motility, mTOR signaling pathway.

DESIGN
Genome-wide expression profiling of PC-3 cells transiently transduced with control siRNA in comparison to two independent siRNAs against WHSC1 and total RNA was isolated 72 hours later. Each is tested in duplicate.
