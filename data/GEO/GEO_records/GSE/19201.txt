TITLE
Expression profiling of ATRA treated NB4 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NB4 is an APL derived cell line, carrying the t(15;17) translocation and expressing the PML/RARa fusion protein. Still, an important question that remains to be addressed is whether PML/RARa target genes are transcriptionally suppressed in primary APL cells and re-activated in all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treated NB4 cells. Gene expression of NB4 cells treated with ATRA at different time points were analyzed.

DESIGN
6 samples at various times. No replicats.
