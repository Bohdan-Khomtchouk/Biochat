TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of human plasma miRNA expresson

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Plasma samples from 10 colonrectal cancer patients (CRCs) (including 5 stage II and 5 stage III patients) and 10 normal controls.An amount of 5 to 10 milliliters of whole blood were obtained from each participant.The plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 1200g for 10min at 4°C.To complete the removal of residual cellular components, plasma samples were recentrifuged at 12,000g for a further 10min at 4°C.A volume of 600μL of each plasma samples from CRC group or normal control group was picked out and uniformly mixed.

DESIGN
qPCR miRNA expression profiling. Plasma samples form 10 colonrectal cancer patients(CRCs) (including 5 stage II and 5 stage III patients) and 10 normal controls were used and treated as indicated in the summary. Equal amount total RNA from each donor was pooled prior to gene expression analysis.
