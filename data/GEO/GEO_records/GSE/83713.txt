TITLE
Genome-wide HP1a occupancy measured by DamID-seq

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In order to map levels of genome-wide HP1a occupancy we applied DamID (van Steensel & Henikoff, Nat Biotech, 2000; PMID: 10748524) in combination with next-generation sequencing of methylated GATC fragments. Mapping by next-generation sequencing makes it possible to examine heterochromatic regions that were not covered by earlier datasets which were generated using microarrays.

DESIGN
Wild-type Kc167 cells were transiently transfected in duplicates with Dam-HP1a or Dam only and collected by two days after transfection for quantification of genome-wide methylation levels via next-geneartion sequencing.
