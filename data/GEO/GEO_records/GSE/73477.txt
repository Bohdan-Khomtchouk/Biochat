TITLE
Gene expression analysis of KLF4 expression in THP-1 cells with CRISPR knockout of miR-150 and p21 (CDKN1A)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression changes associated with KLF4 expression in the AML cell lines THP1 cells. Resutls demonstrate KLF4 promotes myeloid differentiation in these cells via gene signatures. We also identified KLF4 downstream regulators that are modified in miR-150 and p21 (CDKN1A) CRISPR knockdown cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from THP1 cells infected with KLF4 or empty control (ECV) lentivirus 5 days post infection (dpi), CRISPR cells were 17 days post selection.
