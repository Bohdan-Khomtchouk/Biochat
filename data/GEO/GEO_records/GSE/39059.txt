TITLE
Changes in microRNA and mRNA expression with differentiation of human bronchial epithelial cells [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells cultured in an air-liquid interface (ALI) system form a polarized, pseudostratified epithelium composed of basal, ciliated and goblet cells that closely resemble the in vivo airway epithelium structure. ALI cultures of NHBE cells provide a unique in vitro system to investigate airway epithelial biology, including developmental, structural and physiologic aspects. In this study, we wanted to investigate mRNA expression patterns during airway epithelium differentiation. By using microarrays, we studied the changes in expression of mRNAs in normal human bronchial epithelial cells as they differentiate from an undifferentiated monolayer to a differentiated pseudostratified epithelium after 28 days of air-liquid interface (ALI) culture, when epithelial cells differentially express basal, ciliated and goblet cell markers.

DESIGN
Normal human bronchial epithelial cells were cultured in an air-liquid interface (ALI) system and harvested at three different time-points: subconfluent, confluent and day 28 of ALI. Samples were processed for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  All the experiments were performed by triplicate.
