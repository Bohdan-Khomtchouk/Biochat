TITLE
TGF-beta1 target genes in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were isolated from human cord blood and amplified in vitro for 10-14 days in serum-free medium with specific cytokines (Ju et al., Eur. J. Cell Biol. 82, 75-86, 2003; Hacker et al., Nat. Immunol. 4, 380-386, 2003). Cells were then treated with TGF-beta1 for various periods of time (2, 4, 16 hours) and RNA was prepared and subjected to microarray analysis. Keywords: Response to cytokine treatment for various periods of time.

DESIGN
CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HPC) were amplified in vitro and treated with TGF-beta1 (10 ng/ml) for 2, 4 and 16 hours. HPC untreated HPC + TGF-beta1 for 2 hours HPC + TGF-beta1 for 4 hours HPC + TGF-beta1 for 16 hours
