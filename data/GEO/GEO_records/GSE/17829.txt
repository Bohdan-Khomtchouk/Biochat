TITLE
Effects on expression profile of YabA-null cells after replication arrest

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
To compare the transcriptional effects of replication arrest that are dependent on YabA we compared the transcriptional profiles of yabA null and yabA+ cells after treatment with the replication inhibitor HPUra. To avoid secondary effects of replication overinitiation that the yabA-null strain exhibits, we did all experiments in oriC-null cells

DESIGN
We compare triplicates of treated (HPUra) and untreated samples for each yabA-null (AIG185) and YabA+ (MMB170) strains.
