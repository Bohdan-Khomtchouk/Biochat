TITLE
DNA interactions with the ribosomal enhancer

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
DNA-DNA interactions are important for the control of gene expression. However, DNA interactions that occur in trans are difficult to identify. We used 4Cs to identify DNA regions that interact with the yeast ribosomal DNA enhancer. We used 4Cs to identify DNA regions that physically interact with the yeast ribosomal enhancer. Keywords: 4C

DESIGN
Yeast cells were grown to exponential stage and cross linked, digested with Msp1, diluted and ligated. Fragments that interact with the ribosomal enhancer were amplified by nested PCR > Cut samples were used as a negative control. One set of samples were treated with phenanthroline prior to cross-linking. 8 samples, 4 sets of 2 biological replicates Background controls: J0001.CEL, J0003.CEL, J0005.CEL, J0007.CEL Cut-ligated: J0002.CEL, J0004.CEL, J0006.CEL, J0008.CEL
