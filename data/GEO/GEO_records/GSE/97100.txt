TITLE
mRNAseq of Huntington's disease and control patient iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study are to compare the transcriptomic profile (mRNA-seq) of HD and control patient iPSC-derived brain microvascular endotheial cells to identify alterations in gene expression. Methods: RNA were isolated from HD and control iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells. mRNAseq using Illumina TruSeq mRNA PolyA+ v2 lib prep and HiSeq 2500. Statistical difference in mRNA levels were calculated with subsequent GO and pathway analysis. Results: mRNAseq and statistical analysis revealed differentially expressed genes between HD and control iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells. Conclusions: Our study shows differentially expressed genes between HD and control iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells, and reveals gene networks that are relevant to the mechanism of HD pathogenesis.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of HD and control iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells were generated by mRNAseq, in duplicate, using Illumina TruSeq mRNA PolyA+ v2 and Illumina HiSeq 2500.
