TITLE
ChIP-seq comparisons of H3K9me2, H3K9me3 and PHF2 occupancy profiles of epithelial and mesenchymal cells - N8, N8-CTx

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We find that treating mesenchymal NAMEC8 cells with cholera toxin (CTx) to elevate intracellular cAMP levels and activate PKA induces a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition whereby the cells assume an epithelial state (N8-CTx). NAMEC8 cells undergo epigenetic reprogramming triggered by active PHF2, a histone demethylase, which demethylates H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 regions of epithelial genes silencing in the mesenchymal state

DESIGN
Performing ChIP-Seq on NAMEC8 and the CTx-reverted version of NAMEC8 a.k.a N8-CTx
