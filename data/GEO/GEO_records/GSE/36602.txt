TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of somatic cells differentiation throughout oocyte competence acquisition in rainbow trout ovarian follicles.

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
Somatic cells surrounding the oocyte were sampled at the following stages: developmentally incompetent or poorly competent prophase I oocytes (NC1 oocytes), developmentally competent prophase I oocytes (C1 oocytes), and developmentally competent metaphase II oocytes (C2 oocytes). NC1 samples were collected from late vitellogenic females (LV), C1 samples from post-vitellogenic females (PV), and C2 samples from females undergoing meiotic maturation (Germinal Vesicle Breakdown)

DESIGN
Global transcriptional profiling was performed using somatic cells collected from rainbow trout ovarian follicles during in vivo oocyte developmental competence acquisition. Somatic cells were collected at 3 stages of oogenesis: NC1 stage follicles (LV, late vitellogenic, prophase I arrested oocytes, meiotically incompetent and developmentally incompetent, n=6), C1 stage follicles (PV, post-vitellogenic, prophase I arrested oocytes, meiotically competent and developmentally competent, n=16). Ovulatory follicles were also collected during oocyte maturation after in vivo induction (metaphase II arrested oocytes, developmentally fully competent, n=6).
