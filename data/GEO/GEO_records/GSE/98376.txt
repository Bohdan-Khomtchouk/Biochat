TITLE
Expression data from WT and atrap mutant Arabidopsis rosette leaves

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
AtRAP, which is a bacterial-induced small RNA target gene, negatively regulate plant defense response. To identity genes that are regulated by AtRAP, we performed microarray analysis on the (Wild Type) WT and atrap mutant.

DESIGN
We profiled changes in gene expression in the atrap mutant by using Affymetrix microarrays. Three biological replicates were performed using 3-week old rosette leaves from WT and atrap mutant plants.
