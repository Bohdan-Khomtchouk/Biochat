TITLE
Ionomycin Treatment Renders NK cells Hyporesponsive

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Natural killer cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes important in immune responses to cancer and multiple pathogens. However, chronic activation of NK cells can induce a hyporesponsive state. The molecular basis of the mechanisms underlying the generation and maintenance of this hyporesponsive state are unknown, thus an easy and reproducible mechanism able to induce hyporesponsiveness on human NK cells would be very useful to gain understanding of this process. Human NK cells treated with ionomycin lose their ability to degranulate and secrete IFN-Î³ in response to a variety of stimuli, but IL-2 stimulation can compensate these defects. Apart from reductions in the expression of CD11a/CD18, no great changes were observed in the activating and inhibitory receptors expressed by these NK cells, however their transcriptional signature is different to that described for other hyporesponsive lymphocytes.

DESIGN
Four biological replicated per sample type were analyzed by two-color agilent microarrays (AGILENT human gene expression 4x44K v2). Dye swap were applied to minimize dye biases.
