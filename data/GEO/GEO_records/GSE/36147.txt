TITLE
Next-generation sequencing and microarray-based interrogation of microRNAs from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue: Assessment of cross-platform concordance.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examine the concordance between miRNA-seq and cDNA-mediated annealing, selection, extension, and ligation (DASL) miRNA assays.

DESIGN
We profiled two technically replicated FFPE specimens on both DASL and RNA-seq. This submission represents the RNA-seq component of study. The DASL samples used in the study are GSM876557, GSM876558, GSM876564, and GSM876565.

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
