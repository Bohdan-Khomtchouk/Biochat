TITLE
Gene expression response to DUX4 in murine myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DUX4 is generally agreed to underlie pathology in Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy Microarrays were used to examine gene expression after primary murine satellite cell-derived myoblasts were retrovirally infected with constructs encoding DUX4, DUX4c, constitutively active, dominant negative and truncated DUX4 versions.

DESIGN
Primary murine satellite cell-derived myoblasts were expanded and then divided into six sister cultures and each infected with a different construct. After a further 20 hours in culture, RNA was isolated.
