TITLE
Lactobacilli modulate epithelial cytoprotection through the Nrf2 pathway [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that cellular ROS enzymatically generated in response to contact with lactobacilli in both mice and Drosophila has salutary effects against exogenous insults to the intestinal epithelium via the activation of Nrf2 responsive cytoprotective genes.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from the colons of untreated, PBS, E. coli, and LGG innoculated germ free mice and RNA-seq performed to identify the gene expression in response to each condition

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
