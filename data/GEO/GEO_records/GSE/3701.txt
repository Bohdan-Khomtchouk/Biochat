TITLE
Growth Hormone Doping Detection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA microarray technology was utilised for the identification of potential marker genes for the abuse of human growth hormone (hgh) in athletes. Keywords: Whole genome gene expression study

DESIGN
Three cell lines of leukocyte subsets (THP-1, H9, RA-1) as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were challenged with recombinant human growth hormone to elicit specific responses. Suitable doses and incubation times were first tested with THP-1 cells, most effective concentrations were used for the other two cell lines and the PBMC. Tests were carried out in duplicates. For the three cell lines treated and untreated samples (all Cy3) were co-hybridised with reference samples (Cy5). For the PBMC from five donors dye-swaps were carried out for the samples from different sampling days. Treated and untreated control samples were co-hybridised.
