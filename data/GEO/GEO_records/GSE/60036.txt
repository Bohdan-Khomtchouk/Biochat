TITLE
Genome-wide miRNA turnover profile after transcription inhibition in HDMYZ cells with biological triplicate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HDMYZ cells were treated with 4ug/ml ActD for 0, 1, 4 and 12 hours. Small RNAs of 15-40 bases were gel-purified from 5 ug total RNA, and subjected to multiplex Illumina small RNA library preparation. Small RNA libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq2000 (Illumina).

DESIGN
Measure miRNA expression level at 0, 1, 4, 12 hours post ActinomycinD treatment to examine miRNA turnover pattern.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
