TITLE
Comparative transcriptome profiling of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing the Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis candidate effector HaRxL106 and knock-out mutants of HaRxL106-interacting host proteins

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To prevent activation of plant innate immunity the oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis translocates effector proteins into infected cells of its host Arabidopsis thaliana. We noticed that some H. arabidopsidis effectors, when over-expressed in A. thaliana, render the plant more susceptible to infection by biotrophic pathogens (Fabro et al., 2011, PubMed PMID: 22072967). Here we performed transcriptome profiling of a representative transgenic line constitutively expressing H. arabidopsidis effector HaRxL106. We compared the transcriptomes of A. thaliana wild-type (Col-0) plants and an isogenic line expressing HaRxL106 before pathogen challenge and 24 h after infection with the compatible bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000. HaRxL106 interacts with several Arabidopsis proteins (Mukhtar et al., 2011, PubMed PMID: 21798943; Wirthmueller et al., 2015, PubMed PMID: 25284001). To test whether the HaRxL106-interacting A. thaliana proteins MODIFIER OF SNC1, 6 (MOS6), 6B-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1-LIKE 1 (ASIL1) or RADICAL-INDUCED CELL DEATH1 (RCD1) are altered in their transcriptional response to a biotrophic pathogen we performed transcriptome profiling of mos6-1, asil1-1 and rcd1-1 mutants before and 24 h after infection with P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000.

DESIGN
Five weeks old Arabidopsis plants (Col-0, HaRxL106-overexpressing Col-0 plants, mos6-1, asil1-1 and rcd1-1 mutants) were either left untreated (untreated), infiltrated with P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (DC3000) or infiltrated with 10 mM MgCl2 buffer (Mock) at 12:00 (4h after lights on). All samples were harvested 24 hours later for total RNA extraction. mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing on Illumina GAIIx using EXPRSS tag-seq protocol. Each biological replicate set of samples were sequenced as one batch (biorep1, biorep2 and biorep3 in filenames).
