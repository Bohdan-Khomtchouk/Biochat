TITLE
Effect of inhaled anesthetic to cultured cortical neurons

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Inhaled anesthetics produce many effects and bind to a large number of brain proteins, but it is not yet clear if this is accompanied by widespread changes in gene expression of the biological targets.  Such changes in expression might implicate functionally important targets from the large pool of binding targets. Isolated primary cortical neurons were exposed to anesthetics and DNA oligonucleotide microarrays were used to detect and quantify transcriptional changes in neuronal tissue. Keywords: DNA Oligonucleotide Array
