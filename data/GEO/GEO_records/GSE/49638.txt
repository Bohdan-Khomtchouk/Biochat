TITLE
Circadian gene expression from wild type MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiles in WT MEF at different circadian time point after dexamethasone synchronyzation.

DESIGN
We used the Affymetrix expression microarrays to detail the circadian gene expression from wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts during a 24 hour circadian cycle. For each circadian time point (CT), three biological replicates were analyzed.
