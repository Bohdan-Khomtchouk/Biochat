TITLE
Deep sequencing of small RNAs from different tissues in soybean

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Analysis of flanking genomic sequences of unique small RNAs enabled identification of 419 miRNAs. Expression analysis revealed that miRNAs were differentially expressed in different tissues and development stages. Prediction of the miRNA target genes suggested that they are involved in important processes in soybean growth and development. Most conserved soybean miRNAs guide the cleavage of conserved genes. Our study significantly increased the number of known conserved and non-conserved miRNAs in soybean. Our description of soybean miRNAs can be used for functional characterization.

DESIGN
one sample, We sequenced 2,570,250 small RNAs representing 1,157,365 unique sequences from different soybean tissues using sequence-by-synthesis high-throughput sequencing
