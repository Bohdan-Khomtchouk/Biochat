TITLE
Gene expression profile for male SD Rats upon fructose and DHA treatment by RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To investigate the beneficial effects of DHA (omega-3) on affecting fructose induced brain dysfunction and metabolic disorders by sequencing the transcripome (RNA-Seq) in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of male SD rats.

DESIGN
Male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats of 2 months old were randomly assigned to an omega-3 fatty acid diet (n-3 diet) with or without fructose added in the drinking water (15%) for six weeks. The rats were sacrificed by decapitation. Hypothalamus and hippocampus were dissected out, flash frozen, and stored at -70°C for later transcriptome and DNA methylome sequencing experiments. All experiments were performed in accordance with the United States National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of California at Los Angeles Chancellor’s Animal Research Committee.
