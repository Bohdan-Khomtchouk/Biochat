TITLE
Comparisons of the transcriptional profiles between rat aorta and ductus arteriosus

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The transcriptional profiles of the aorta and the ductus arteriosus during development were compared. Keywords: time course, development, tissue type comparison

DESIGN
Total RNA samples were isolated from pooled tissues obtained from Wister rat embryos on embryonic day 19 and 21, and from neonates on the day of birth (n > =120). The RNA was converted to biotin-labeled cRNA, which was hybridized to Affymetrix RG_U34A microarray. The hybridization experiments were performed in duplicate.
