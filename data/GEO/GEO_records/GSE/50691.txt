TITLE
DNA Topoisomerase 1α Promotes RNA-directed DNA Methylation and Histone Lysine 9 Dimethylation at Transposable Elements in Arabidopsis [Bisulfite-Seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is a transcriptional silencing mechanism mediated by small and long noncoding RNAs produced by the plant-specific RNA polymerases Pol IV and Pol V, respectively. Through a chemical genetics screen with a luciferase-based DNA methylation reporter, LUCL, we found that camptothecin, a compound with anti-cancer properties that targets DNA topoisomerase 1α (TOP1α) was able to de-repress LUCL by reducing its DNA methylation and H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) levels. Further studies with Arabidopsis top1α mutants showed that TOP1α promotes RdDM by facilitating the production of Pol V-dependent long non-coding RNAs, AGONAUTE4 recruitment and H3K9me2 deposition at transposable elements (TEs).
