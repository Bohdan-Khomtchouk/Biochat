TITLE
Uropathogenic E. coli UTI89 cells in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide or ethanol

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli UTI89

SUMMARY
The expression levels of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) UTI89 cells in YESCA broth with and without 4% dimehtyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 2% ethanol (EtOH) were studied.

DESIGN
To determine the up- or down-regulated expression profile in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethanol (EtOH),  UPEC UTI89 were grown in YESCA broth with 4% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or 2% ethanol (EtOH) or no comound at 26Â°C with 200 rpm shaking for 24 hours were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
