TITLE
Ube3a-ATS characterization with strand-speicific microarray

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This strand-specific array is performed to characterize expression features of Ube3a-ATS, including its imprinting status, its exon-intron structure, its transcriptional initiation and termination site as well as its polyadenylation status. The array contains reverse-complementary probes detecting transcripts from both strands and therefore we are able to pick up signal from both Ube3a sense and antisense. By comparing wild-type with various mutants, and total RNA with polyA RNA, we concluded that Ube3a-ATS is a paternally imprinted gene covering the whole gene body of Ube3a in the antisense orientation. It does not have an obvious exon-intron structure. Its transcription initiates at Snrpn major promoter and terminates ~40kb upstream of Ube3a transcriptional start site.

DESIGN
Total RNA from Snrpn-Ube3a maternal deletion mutant (del s-u/+), its wild-type littermate, paternal deletion mutant and its wildtype littermate were analyzed. Mutant mice with S-U maternal deletion and Snrpn promoter paternal deleiton which leads to depletion of Ube3a-ATS (del s-u/0.9 and del s-u/4.8) were also analyzed. polyA RNA was purified from the sample 2 and sample 4. All eight samples were hybridized to the custom 8X60k Agilent CGH array.
