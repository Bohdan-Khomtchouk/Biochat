TITLE
Distribution of Drosophila insulator proteins Mod(mdg4) and L(3)mbt in Kc cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Here we map the localization of Mod(mdg4), including Mod(mdg4)2.2 specific and Mod(mdg4) common to all isoforms, to chromatin insulators, as well as the lethal-3 malignant brain tumor protein in Drosophila Kc cells.

DESIGN
examination of genomic occupancy for Mod(mdg4)2.2, Mod(mdg4)BTB (all isoforms), and L(3)mbt, control samples used for Drosophila Kc were previously described (Wood, Van Bortle et al., 2011 GSE30740)
