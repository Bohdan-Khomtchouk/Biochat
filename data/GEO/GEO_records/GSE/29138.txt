TITLE
The mRNA expression patterns in macaque brains from prenatal to neonatal

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
We search for developmental changes specific to humans by examining gene expression profiles in the human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque prefrontal and cerebellar cortex. In both brain regions, developmental patterns were more evolved in humans than in chimpanzees. To distinguish whether the human specific developmental pattern represent novel human-specific developmental patterns or a shift in the timing of the existing patterns, we measured mRNA expression patterns in macaque brains from prenatal to neonatal. Our results show that the major human-specific developmental patterns identified in the PFC reflects an extreme shift in timing of synaptic development.

DESIGN
Rhesus macaque post-mortem brain samples from the superior frontal gyrus region of the prefrontal cortex were collected. Six fetal and six newborn samples were used. RNA extracted from the dissected tissue was hybridized to AffymetrixÂ® Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
