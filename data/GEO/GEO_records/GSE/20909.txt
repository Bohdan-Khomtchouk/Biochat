TITLE
Alteration of gene expression in mammary gland tissue of dairy cows in response to dietary unsaturated fatty acids

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to determine the effects of unprotected dietary unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) from different plant oils on gene expression in the mammary gland of grazing dairy cows. Milk composition and gene expression in the mammary gland tissue were evaluated in grazing dairy cows supplemented with different unsaturated fatty acids (UFA). The UFA supplementation improves the health and nutrition quality aspects of dairy milk, but also affects the gene networks expression signature associated with cellular growth and proliferation, cell-death, signalling, nutrient metabolism, and immune response, and in turn, the mammary gland integrity and health.

DESIGN
A total of 28 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows in mid-lactation were blocked according to parity (2.4 ± 0.63 years), days in milk (DIM; 153 ± 32.8 days), milk yield (25.7 ± 3.08 kg/d) and fat content (4.3 ± 0.12%). Cows were then randomly assigned to four UFA-sources based on rapeseed, soybean, linseed or a mixture of the three oils for 23 days (Period I) after which, all 28 cows were switched to a control diet for an additional 28 days (Period II). On the last day of both periods, mammary gland biopsies were taken to study genome-wide differences in lipid metabolism gene expression.
