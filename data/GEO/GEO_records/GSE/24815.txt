TITLE
Transcriptional changes in Sohlh1/Sohlh2 double knockout newborn mouse ovaries

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sohlh1 and Sohlh2 are germ cell-specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors critical in early folliculogenesis. Differential genes expression by both Sohlh1 and Sohlh2 deficiency in mouse newborn ovaries was accessed using microarray. RNA samples from Sohlh1/ Sohlh2 double knockout and wild-type newborn ovaries were arrayed on the Illumina beadchip mouse WG-6 2.0.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from wildtype and Sohlh1/Sohlh2 double KO mouse newborn ovary were used to run Illumina BeadChip MouseWG-6 2.0 arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
