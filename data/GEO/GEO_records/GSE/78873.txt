TITLE
A long noncoding RNA lincRNA-EPS acts as a transcriptional brake to restrain inflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LincRNA-EPS is a long noncoding RNA that is expressed in macrophages and downregulated upon exposure to diverse microbial products. Analysis of macrophages from lincRNA-EPS-deficient mice revealed a specific role for this lincRNA in restraining immune response gene (IRG) expression. Mechanistically, lincRNA-EPS associates with chromatin at regulatory regions of IRGs to repress their transcription. To gain insight into the molecular function of lincRNA-EPS on chromatin, we generated ATAC-Seq libraries from wildtype and lincRNA-EPS-deficient macrophages stimulated with LPS.

DESIGN
We examined chromatin structure using ATAC-seq in wild-type and lincRNA-EPS knock-out macrophages stimulated with LPS
