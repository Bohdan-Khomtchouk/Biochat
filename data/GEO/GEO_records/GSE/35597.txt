TITLE
Microbiota-dependent gene expression in small intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from total small intestine of each four 28-day old conventionally raised (conv) and germ-free (GF) bred C57BL/6 mice (protocol according to: Lotz et al., J. Exp Med. 2006). Total RNA was isolated by TriZol and ist purity was examined using a Bioanalyszer. We used microarrays to comparatively detail the global gene expression in primary total isolated intestinal epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates from isolated intestinal epithelial cells obtained from each 4 germ-free bred and conventionally raised mice. Colour change.
