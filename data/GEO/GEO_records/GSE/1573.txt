TITLE
MicroRNA profiles of RISC sub-complexes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
293 cells were tranfected with Myc-tagged argonaute family members and associated microRNAs quantitated by microarray analysis of immunoprecipitates. Human argonaute 1, 2, and 3, and a control immunoprecipitation were done. Two independent immunoprecipitations were performed, with two replicate points per immunoprecipitation. Ch1and Ch2 net values are median intensity, background subtracted, unnormalized. Normalized Ch2 values for argonaute immunoprecipitations are median center normalized. Normalized Ch2 values for control immunoprecipitates are normalized by a constant that is the average of the constants used for argonaute immunoprecipitates.
