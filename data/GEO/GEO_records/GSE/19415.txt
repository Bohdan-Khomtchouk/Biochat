TITLE
Expression data from primary ovine fetal turbinate cells infected with Orf Virus IA82 and deletion mutant OV-IA82Δ024

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Reverse genetics has been widely used to investigate function of viral genes. In the present study we investigated the gene expression profile of a primary ovine cell (OFTu) in response to infection with the wild type (OV-IA82) and deletion mutant virus (OV-IA82Δ024) aiming to determine possible functions for ORFV024 during ORFV infection. We used microarray analysis to investigate gene expression profile of OFTu with ORFV OV-IA82 and OV-IA82Δ024.
