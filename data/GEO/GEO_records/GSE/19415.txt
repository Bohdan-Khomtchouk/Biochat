TITLE
Expression data from primary ovine fetal turbinate cells infected with Orf Virus IA82 and deletion mutant OV-IA82Δ024

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Reverse genetics has been widely used to investigate function of viral genes. In the present study we investigated the gene expression profile of a primary ovine cell (OFTu) in response to infection with the wild type (OV-IA82) and deletion mutant virus (OV-IA82Δ024) aiming to determine possible functions for ORFV024 during ORFV infection. We used microarray analysis to investigate gene expression profile of OFTu with ORFV OV-IA82 and OV-IA82Δ024.

DESIGN
OFTu cells were infected with each virus (m.o.i = 10) and RNA was extratect at 2 and 4 hours post-infection. cDNA was synthesized and hybridized with GeneChip Bovine Genome Array from Affymetrix. Gene expression profile were determined by comparing expression of cells infected with the deletion mutant virus with those infected with the wild type virus in each time point.
