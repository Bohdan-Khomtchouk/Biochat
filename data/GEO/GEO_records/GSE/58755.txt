TITLE
Global identification of growth-related long non-coding RNAs in breast muscle of chicken

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can have potential roles in development of tissues and organs. We selected breast muscle of fast-growing White Recessive Rock chicken (WRR) and slow-growing Xing Hua chicken (XH) to identify lncRNA transcripts by LncRNA-Seq. This study identified 21,993 novel lncRNAs. Among 7,339 differentially expressed lncRNAs, 723 up-regulated and 6,616 down-regulated lncRNAs were found in WRR compared with XH. Of them, five novel lncRNA were antisense transcripts for growth-related genes CACNA1D (unigene 14689_all), IL4I1 (unigene 15355_all), LEF-1 (unigene 19525_all) and FABP1 (unigenes 17536_all and 17537_all) respectively. Meanwhile, 12 other novel lncRNAs were found in the intron or downstream of some known growth-related genes (IGF1, IGF2BP2, IGF2BP3, CACNA1D, IL4I1, LEF-1 and FABP1). In addition, 4,043 SSRs and 200,049 SNPs were identified. Our data revealed the global lncRNA expression pattern in muscle tissue, and contributed a useful genomic resource towards studying the effects of lncRNAs in regulating chicken growth.
