TITLE
Whole transcriptome analysis of erlotinib treatment in EGFR-mutant cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We were interested in characterizing the transcriptional changes that occur on a genome-wide scale following treatment of EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells with targeted therapies.

DESIGN
HCC827 human lung cancer cells harboring an amplified EGFR allele with an activating in frame deletion of 15 nucleotides in exon 19 were treated in triplicate with 1uM erlotinib (EGFR inhibitor), AZD-6244 (MEK inhibitor) or BEZ-235 (PI3-Kinase/mTOR inhibitor) for 6 hours, followed by total mRNA isolation and whole transcriptome analysis using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 expression arrays.
