TITLE
Root and shoot Jamonic Acid induction in Brassica oleraceae

ORGANISM
Brassica oleracea

SUMMARY
Brassica oleraceae plants were treated with jasmonic acid either at the roots or two leaves. An acidic (HCl) water sollution with the same pH as the jasmonic acid sollution was also applied to two leaves of the root jasmonic acid treated plants, and to the roots of leaf jasmonic acid treated plants. Control plants received a mock treatment on roots and leaves with acidic water of the same pH as the jasmonic acid sollution. The whole root system and two systemic leaves were harvested separately at 6, 18 and 30 h after treatment. For each time point, tissue and treatment, three biological replicates (except two replicates for 'Root-Cont-18h' sample) were made consisting of pooled tissue samples from 10 plants. Gene expression was analyzed in both tissues using the 29,000 element Arabidopsis Oligonucleotide Microarrays (Qiagen-Operon Arabidopsis Genome Array Ready Oligo Set version 3.0).

DESIGN
Two treatments (root and leaf jasmonic acid) and control treatment. For each treatment, three biological replicates (except two replicates for 'Root-Cont-18h' sample) were taken of two tissues (roots and leaves). Samples were taken at three time points (6, 18 and 30 h). Single color hybridizations were performed, which lead to 53 slides in total.
