TITLE
Genome-wide microRNA analysis of NPC and non-NPC specimens gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of differential expression between NPC and non-NPC tissues at miRNA expression level.  We used a miRNA microarray platform to investigate the profile between NPC tissues and normal nasopharyngeal tissues to evaluate the relationship between miRNA expression and NPC. Recognition of the aberrant miRNAs and enrichment pathway analysis of predicted target gene may provide some clues to estimate the mechanism of miRNA effects on NPC carcinogenesis mediated by miRNA-mRNA regulation.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 8 NPC tissues compared to 4 nasopharyngeal tissues. We peformed the Illumina miRNA microarray to identify the differentially expressed miRNA between NPC tissues and normal nasopharyngeal tissues.

PLATFORM
GPL8933 Illumina Human Beta-version microRNA expression BeadChip,
