TITLE
Equine Laminitis vs Control.

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
Equine lameller tissues were collected to compare normal vs laminitis generated differences in transcriptom level. Keywords: Laminitis, Equine, Diseased foot

DESIGN
Three Laminitis generated vs three normal Equine hoof tissues were subjected to comparison analysis in transcriptom level by using the Affymetrix Bovine GeneChip. The reasons for Bovine chip were; 1) Genetic similarity to Equine. 2) More transcriptom was search at that Affymetrix platform comparing the Equine GeneChip at the time of the study.

PLATFORM
GPL2112 [Bovine] Affymetrix Bovine Genome Array
