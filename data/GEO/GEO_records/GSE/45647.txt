TITLE
Anti-BRAF mutation drug resistance enhances EGFR expression in melanomas [methylation profiling]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We treated melanoma cells with BRAF mutation with BRAF inhibitor and screened for BRAF inhibitor resistant cells. We extracted DNA from parental cells and resistant cell lines.  We compared the DNA methylation via Illumina 450K Methylation Array

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 4 specimens was hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
