TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Grapevine (cv. Summer Black) leaf at four developmental stages, using the Illumina Platform

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
conducted to find out the transcriptional system that is connected with the development of leaves and production of metabolites during photosynthesis.  We examine the cellular expression by use the up-to-date RNA sequencing expertise to carry out a complete analysis of the transcriptional profile of V. vinifera leaves at four different developmental stages.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from 4 samples with three replication for each and compared within all samples.

PLATFORM
GPL18740 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Vitis vinifera)
