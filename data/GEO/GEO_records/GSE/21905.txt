TITLE
Gene expression in Lineage negative bone marrow cells of C57B/L6 and B.D(Chr5) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These mouse strains differ in absolute numbers of hematopoietic stem cells but differ genetically only at the Chr 5 congenic locus. We used microarray analysis to identify candidate regulators of hematopoietic stem cells based on differential gene expression patterns.

DESIGN
Triplicate RNA samples were isolated from 500,00-800,000 Lineage negative bone marrow cells from each strain.  Each of the six samples were analyzed on 6 separate MG 430 2.0 Affymetrix Microarray Chips.

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
