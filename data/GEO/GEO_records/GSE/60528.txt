TITLE
Mouse GM-CSF-related alveolar macrophage genome-wide expression data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GM-CSF receptor-β deficient (Csf2rb–/– or KO) mice develop a lung disease identical to hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (hPAP) in humans with recessive CSF2RA or CSF2RB mutations that impair GM-CSF receptor function. We performed pulmonary macrophage transplantation (PMT) of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) without myeloablation in Csf2rb–/–mice. BMDMs were administered by endotracheal instillation into 2 month-old Csf2rb–/– mice. Results demonstrated that PMT therapeutic of hPAP in Csf2rb–/– mice was highly efficacious and durable. Alveolar macrophages were isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage one year after administration subjected to microarray analysis to determine the effects of PMT therapy on the global gene expression profile.

DESIGN
Total mRNA was isolated from alveolar macrophages PMT-treated Csf2rb–/–mice (PMT) and from age-matched, untreated KO mice (KO)  and wild-type (C57Bl/6) mice (WT). Total mRNA was evaluated using Affymetrix microarrays (Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array) to compare the gene expression profiles among the three groups (3 mice/group).
