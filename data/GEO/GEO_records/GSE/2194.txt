SUMMARY
Array hybridizations profiling diverse human tissues; for each array the human tissue RNA is hybridized against a universal reference RNA. Experiments 1-3 are replicates of universal reference RNA vs. genomic DNA hybridizations, used to estimate transcript abundance. Arrays 4-8 are tissue RNA vs. genomic DNA hybridizations, carried out to evaluate the method for estimating transcript abundance (see manuscript for details). Logical set Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: other
