TITLE
Gene expression analysis of PANC-1 cells inducibly expressing the bHLH protein E47

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of induced E47 expression on PDA cells at the gene expression level.The hypothesis tested in the present study was that PDA cells can be reprogrammed to revert to their original quiescent acinar cell phenotype by stimulating a tamoxifen inducible form of E47 fused to a modified estrogen (E47-ER) receptor . Results provide important information on the remarkable ability of E47ER to trigger reactivation of the acinar cell differentiation program and cell cycle arrest in PDA cells.

DESIGN
PANC-1 cells stably expressing a tamoxifen inducible form of the bHLH protein E47 were treated with tamoxifen at 2 doses to induce E47 activity
