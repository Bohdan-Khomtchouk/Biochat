TITLE
PIWI-interacting RNAs are dysregulated in renal cell carcinoma and associated with tumor metastasis and cancer specific survival

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a distinct group of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) that silence transposable genetic elements to protect genome integrity. Due to their limited expression in gonads and sequence diversity, piRNAs remain the most mysterious class of small RNAs. Studies have shown piRNAs are present in somatic cells and dysregulated in gastric, breast and liver cancers. By deep sequencing 24 frozen benign kidney and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) specimens and using the publically available piRNA database, we found 26,991 piRNAs present in human kidney tissue. Among 920 piRNAs that at least had two copies in one specimen, 19 were differentially expressed in benign kidney and ccRCC tissues, and 46 were associated with metastasis. Among the metastasis-related piRNAs, we found 3 piRNAs, piR- 32051, piR-39894 and piR-43607, to be derived from the same piRNA cluster at chromosome 17. We confirmed the 3 selected piRNAs not to be miRNAs or miRNA-like sncRNAs. We further validated the aberrant expression of the 3 piRNAs in a 68-case formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) ccRCC tissue cohort and showed the upregulation of the 3 piRNAs to be highly associated with ccRCC metastasis, late clinical stage and cancer-specific survival.
