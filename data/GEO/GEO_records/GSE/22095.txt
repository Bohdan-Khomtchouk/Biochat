TITLE
Genome-wide Myb chromatin occupancy in murine myeloid progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report genome-wide pattern of Myb chromatin occupancy in vivo. We used ERMYB, a myeloid progenitor cell line derived by transformation of primary cells by ER-Myb fusion protein, as our model system. In these cells, activation of the ER-Myb fusion protein by estrogen is required to maintain a proliferative progenitor-like phenotype. We performed ChIP-seq with biological duplicate samples from ERMYB cells with Myb either “on” or “off” (i.e. + or - β-E2 for 6 hr). By comparing enrichment signals between Myb-on, Myb-off and isotype control samples, we identified 7,646 high-confidence Myb binding regions, which can be assigned to 4,892 annotated genes according to their distances to the nearest transcriptional start sites.
