TITLE
Primary human nasal cells extracted from current smokers treated with kaempferol

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We are investigating the mRNA expression profiles of human nasal cells from smokers treated with kaempferol We used microarrays to compare the global mRNA expression profiles upon response to kaempferol treatment

DESIGN
Primary nasal epithelial cells were extrated from current smoking volunteers. Cells were cultured, and treated with either DMSO (controls) or 14 uM kaempferol (treated) for 6 hours. RNA was collected after treatment.
