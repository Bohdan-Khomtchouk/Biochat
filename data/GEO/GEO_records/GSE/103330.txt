TITLE
PCR array analysis of the heart of Wild Type (WT) and Ebi3 deficient mice infected for 7 days with Trypanosoma cruzi

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
WT and Ebi3 deficient mice were intraperitoneally infected or not with 1,000 forms of trypomastigotes of T. cruzi Y strain for 7 days, and fragments of the heart tissues of non-infected and infected animals were obtained for RNA extraction. Samples were examined by qPCR assay according to RT²ProfilerPCRArrayTM kit of Mouse Innate Immune Responses & Adaptive (PAMM 052Z - Qiagen) on the ABI StepOnePlusTM equipment.

DESIGN
PCR array gene expression profiling. Heart fragments from five animals of each group were used, and the amount of RNA was normalized prior to gene expression analysis

PLATFORM
GPL23971 RT²ProfilerPCRArrayTM kit of Mouse Innate Immune Responses & Adaptive (Qiagen)
