TITLE
Early Relapse in ALL is identified by Time To Leukemia in NOD/SCID mice and is characterized by a gene signature involving survival pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis identified a specific signature of differentially expressed genes discriminating TTLshort and TTLlong phenotypes. Gene expression signatures of xenografted leukemia samples with different TTL phenotypes were analyzed on  cohorts of pediatric BCP-ALL patients.
