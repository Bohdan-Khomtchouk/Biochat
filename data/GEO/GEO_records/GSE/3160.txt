TITLE
Exploring the scope of TOR/PKA co-regulation in MDN

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To identify genes co-regulated by TOR and PKA during growth in MDN Keywords: Media, Wild type and mutant strains, and dose response

DESIGN
BCY1, bcy1 deletion, TPK, and tpk1-3 deletion strains were grown in MDN with and without rapamycin treatment.  Different combinations of these samples were examined.

PLATFORM
