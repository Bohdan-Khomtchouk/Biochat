The genome of a songbird

SUMMARY
This study was part of a larger study on the zebra finch genome (Warren et al 2010. Nature). Here we present a summary of the specific experiment on singing-regulated gene expression. To evaluate the genomic landscape of learned vocal communication, we profiled gene expression in the zebra finch song nucleus, Area X, with custom Agilent oligoarrays for up to seven hours following initiation of singing. We developed algorithms to identify singing-regulated transcripts related to time spent singing, and discovered over 800 transcripts in Area X that are significantly regulated by singing. These included known increases of the egr1 and c-fos transcription factors, and a decrease in the FoxP2 transcription factor, a gene associated with spoken language development. We clusted the singing-regulated genes in Area X into 20 temporal dynamic expression patterns, which include rapidly up-regulated and transient, rapidly up-regulated and sustained, slowly up-regulated and sustained, a late upregulated response, and equally diverse clusters of down-regulated patterns. Using promotor motif search algorithms, we found significant over-representation of transcription factor binding sites in the promoters of genes within specific clusters. These binding sites included those of transcription factors known to be activated by neural activity and plasticity, such as CREB, SRF, AP-1, NFKB1, CFOS, EGR1, and MEF2.

DESIGN
Gene expression in Area X was measured before singing (0) or after singing for 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7hours.  Six independent experiments were performed at each of the 9 timepoints.
