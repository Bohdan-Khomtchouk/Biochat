TITLE
Irf3 phenotyping

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The interferon regulatory factors IRF3 and IRF7 are key players in the regulation of type I and III IFN genes. In this study, we analyzed the role of IRF3 and IRF7 for the host response to influenza A virus infections in Irf3-/-, Irf7-/- and Irf3-/-Irf7-/- knock-out mice.

DESIGN
The KO and WT mice were intranasally infected with PR8M virus or PBS for mock controls. Lungs were collected at indicated time points post infection (d3) . Total RNA from these lungs were used for microarray analysis.
