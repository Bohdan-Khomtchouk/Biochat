TITLE
Estrogen-like activity in cell signaling of capsaicinoids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparing the expression profiles of the genes in response to 17b-estradiol (E2) and capsaicinoids (capsaicin (CAP), dihydrocapsaicin (DHCAP), nordihydrocapsaicin (NDHCAP), nonivamide (NV))

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, E2- or each capsainoid-treated vs. control cells. Three biological replicates, independently grown and harvested. Three replicates per array.
