TITLE
Expression profiling of prostate cell lines by miRNA array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignant carcinoma that develops in men in Western countries. Up to 30% of patients continue to suffer from disease progression following radical prostatectomy. Therefore, better prognostic markers and molecular targets for cancer treatment are needed. MicroRNA (miRNA) has the potential to be used as biomarkers and as a therapeutic target for the treatment of various cancers, including PCa. Here, to determine how miRNA is involved in PCa progression, we investigated the miRNA expression profiles of 3 PCa cell lines, namely PC3, DU145, and LNCaP, and 2 normal prostate cell lines, namely  RWPE-1 and PrSc, using miRNA microarrays.

DESIGN
We investigated miRNA genes that were significantly upregulated in PCa cell lines (PC3, DU145, LNCaP) compared with normal cell lines (RWPE-1, PrSc).
