TITLE
The temporal dynamics of differential gene expression in human alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells interacting with the human pathogenic mould Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aspergillus fumigatus is the most relevant pathogenic mould in immunocompromised patients. Spores of A. fumigatus are inhaled and reach the lung alveoli, where they interact with the human immune system. In this set of experiments, we co-cultured with defined morphologies of Aspergillus fumigatus (Af293) for 0h, 3h and 6h with either cells representing human alveolar epithelium (A549) or human alveolar endothelium (HPAEC). We included either monocyte-derived or myeloid dendritic cells from volunteer donor blood to the epithelial layer to examine their effect on gene expression.  RNA was extracted from both cell lines at each time point and hybridised to microarrays.  Microarrays contain probes for approximately 110 selected human immune-relevant genes, including cytokine and chemokine genes, their receptors and downstream innate immunity genes.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of human alveloar epithelial and endothelials cells after 3h and 6h of co-cultivation with Aspergillus fumigatus and monocyte-derived or myeloid dendritic cells
