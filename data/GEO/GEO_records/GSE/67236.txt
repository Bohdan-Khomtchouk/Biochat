TITLE
Cis regulatory effects on A-to-I RNA editing in Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila sechellia and their F1 hybrids

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila sechellia ; Drosophila melanogaster x Drosophila sechellia

SUMMARY
We applied microfluidic multiplex PCR and deep sequencing (mmPCR-seq) to quantify RNA editing levels at targeted sites in Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila sechellia and the species-specific alleles of their F1 hybrids to understand the contribution of cis and trans regulatory factors to regulating RNA editing levels.

DESIGN
Examination of RNA editing levels through RT-PCR amplification of 493 loci in female heads of two replicates of D. melanogaster parents, two replicates of D. sechellia parents, two replicates of a mixture of the two parent species (mixed parent control), three replicates of their F1 hybrids, and three replicates of hybrids mutant for D. melanogaster Adar.
