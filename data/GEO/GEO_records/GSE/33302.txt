TITLE
Expression data from sleep deprivation experiment in mouse hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the effect of sleep deprivation in the mouse hippocampus and identified distinct classes of regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Hippocampal tissue was taken from sleep deprived mice and time-matched non-sleep-deprived control animals that were left undisturbed in their home cages during the sleep deprivation period for a total of 8 and 9 replicates per group. RNA was isolated and cDNA was synthesized from hippocampal tissue, and the sample from each animal was hybridized to a separate Affymetrix Mouse 430_2 microarray
