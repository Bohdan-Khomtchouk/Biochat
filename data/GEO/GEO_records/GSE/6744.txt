TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Streptococcus mutans in biofilm and planktonic conditions

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans

SUMMARY
In vitro comparative transcriptome analysis was carried to determine genes that are differentially expressed in S. mutans biofilm compared with free-living cells. DNA-microarray analyses indicated that about 12 % of genes showed significant differential expression: 139 were activated and 104 were repressed in biofilm vs. planktonic environment. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
S. mutans UA159 was grown to stationary phase planktonic bacteria  and the biofilm generated on polystyrene multidishes. the total RNA was extracted and, after Reverse transcription and probe labeling, Hybridized to DNA-microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL4745 S. mutans UA159 v2
