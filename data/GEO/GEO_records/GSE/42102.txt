TITLE
Proteomic and transcriptomic responses to thiamethoxam in the Sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae)

ORGANISM
Bemisia tabaci

SUMMARY
We investigated the transcriptional response to thiamethoxam in the Bemisia tabaci using Illumina sequencing technology. A total of 1,338 genes were differently expressed in the  thiamethoxam-resistant whiteflies.

DESIGN
All the B biotype whiteflies were maintained on cabbage. The susceptible strain (TH-S) was cultured without exposure to any chemical insecticides. Before the sample collected, almost 10,000 thiamethoxam-resistant adult whiteflies were treated with 2,000 mg/L thiamethoxam (~LC80) to eliminate the heterozygous individuals. Then the survivors were collected after 48 hours and designated as the TH-2000 sample.  Then approximately 1,500 adult TH-S and TH-2000 were collected, respectively, The RNA was extracted and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
