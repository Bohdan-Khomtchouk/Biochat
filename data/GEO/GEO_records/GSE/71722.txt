TITLE
Transcriptome bioinformatical analysis of vertebrate stages of Schistosoma japonicum reveals alternative splicing events

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
Alternative splicing is a molecular process that contributes greatly to the diversification of proteome and to gene functions. Understanding the mechanisms of stage-specific alternative splicing can provide a better understanding of the development of eukaryotes and the functions of different genes. Schistosoma japonicum is an infectious blood-dwelling trematode with a complex lifecycle that causes the tropical disease schistosomiasis. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome of Schistosoma japonicum to discover alternative splicing events in this parasite, by applying RNA-seq to cDNA library of adults and schistosomula. Results were validated by RT-PCR and sequencing. We found 11,623 alternative splicing events among 7,099 protein encoding genes and average proportion of alternative splicing events per gene was 42.14%. We showed that exon skip is the most common type of alternative splicing events as found in high eukaryotes, whereas intron retention is the least common alternative splicing type.

DESIGN
BioProject accession number is PRJNA290970, and the SRA Study accession number is SRP061588. Mixed sample of cDNA libaraies of Schistosomula and adult were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2000.
