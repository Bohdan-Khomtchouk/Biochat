TITLE
IKKa-mediated signaling circuitry regulates early B lymphopoiesis during hematopoiesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Multiple transcription factors regulate B cell commitment, which coordinates with myeloid–erythroid lineage differentiation. One such factor, NF-kB, has long been speculated to regulate early B cell development; however, this issue remains controversial. IKKa is required for splenic B cell maturation, but not for bone marrow (BM) B cell development. Here, we unexpectedly found defective BM B cell development and an increased myeloid–erythroid lineages in kinase-dead IKKa (KA/KA) knock-in mice. Markedly increased cytosolic p100, an NF-kB2 inhibitory form, and reduced nuclear NF-kB p65, RelB, p50, and p52, as well as IKKa, was observed in KA/KA splenic and BM B cells. Several B- and myeloid–erythroid-cell regulators, including Pax5, were deregulated in KA/KA BM B cells. Using fetal liver and BM congenic transplants, and IKKa deletion from early hematopoietic cells in mice, this defect was identified as B cell intrinsic and as an early event during hematopoiesis. Re-expression of IKKa, Pax5, or combined NF-kB molecules promoted B cell development, but repressed myeloid–erythroid cell differentiation in KA/KA BM B cells. Together, these results demonstrate that IKKa regulates B-lineage commitment via combined canonical and noncanonical NF-kB transcriptional activity to target Pax5 expression during hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed on RNA isolated from the BM of B220+ cells isolated from 4-week old WT and KA/KA mice using affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 array chip, containing 45,000 genes, at the Laboratory of Molecular Technology SAIC-Frederick. Data were normalized, and log2 transformations were generated using Partek software (St. Louis, MO, USA).
