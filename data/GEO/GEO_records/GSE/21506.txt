TITLE
The metalloregulatory site in Streptococcus pneumoniae AdcR,  a zinc-activated MarR-family repressor

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae

SUMMARY
Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 AdcR (adhesion competence repressor) is the first metal-sensing member of the MarR (multiple antibiotic resistance repressor) family to be characterized.  Expression profiling of a âˆ†adcR strain grown in liquid culture under microaerobic conditions revealed that transcript amounts for 13 genes were up-regulated relative to the wild-type strain, among them adcR, adcCBA, encoding a high affinity ABC uptake system for zinc, and genes encoding cell-surface zinc-binding pneumococcal histidine triad (pht) and adcII (lmb, laminin binding) proteins. Down-regulated transcripts included those encoding two putative zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenases.

DESIGN
Bacterial strains were grown exponentially in rich (BHI) media at 37C and an atmosphere of 5% CO2 to OD620~0.2, and were processed as described in the related Sample records.  Samples were collected from three independent biological replicates and included one dye swap. Data were normalized using the Lowess (block) method without background subtraction. Changes in relative transcript amounts of positive or negative 2-fold with Bayesian P value of < 0.001 were considered significant, and were included as supplementary material for the accompanying manuscript (The metalloregulatory site in Streptococcus pneumoniae AdcR, a zinc-activated MarR-family repressor; Reyes-Caballero, H. et al, manuscript in preparation).
