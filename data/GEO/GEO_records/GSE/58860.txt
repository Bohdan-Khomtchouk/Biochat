TITLE
Identification of MIR196B (or MIR375 or MIR429) target genes in Colon cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MIR196B  (or MIR375 or MIR429) target genes were identified by comparing the mRNAs downregulated in MIR196B  (or MIR375 or MIR429) -overexpressing cells (determined by mRNA microarray analysis) with target genes predicted by public bioinformatics tools.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from non-trancfected or transfected SW480 or Caco2 cells by MIR196B  (or MIR375 or MIR429)

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
