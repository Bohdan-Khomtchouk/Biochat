TITLE
Impact of URT1-mediated uridylation on small RNA tailing in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To analyse the impact of URT1-mediated uridylation on miRNA and siRNA tailing, we deep-sequenced small RNA libraries for WT and urt1 duplicate samples at the same developmental stage that was analyzed by TAIL-seq, i.e., two-week-old seedlings.

DESIGN
Examination of miRNA and siRNA tailing in WT and urt1 samples.
