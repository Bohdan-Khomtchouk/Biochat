TITLE
Gene expression in undifferentiated or cyclic adenosine monophosphate-exposed BeWo trophoblast cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BeWo trophoblast cells differentiate in response to expsure to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) analogs. Differentiation includes syncytialization (fusion) and hormonogenesis. The goal of this study was to globally determine transcripts differentially expressed in BeWo trophoblast cells following a 24-h exposure to 250 uM 8-bromo-cAMP.

DESIGN
3 replicates undifferentiated BeWo trophoblast cells; and 3 replicates BeWo trophoblast cells treated with 250 uM 8-Br-cAMP for 24 h.
