TITLE
Celecoxib induced transcriptional alterations in gastric cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Celecoxib is recognized to have chemopreventive and anti-cancer property beyond its anti-inflammatory function. Celelcoxib treatment in AGS cells down regulates Wnt/β-catenin, STAT3, RXR and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways. Transcriptional profiling after celecoxib shows differential regulation of oncogenic pathway regulated genes.

DESIGN
AGS cell  were treated with celecoxib in triplicates and incubated for 24 hours. The processed samples were  hybridized in “HuGene-1_0-st” array and the differentially expressed genes were taken for pathway analysis and transcription factor enrichment analysis.
