TITLE
Comparison of transcriptomes in class-B GATA mutants with cytokinin treatments

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We have used Agilent whole genome arrays (v4) to compare the gene expression changes between 14 days-old Arabidopsis seedlings with or without cytokinin treatments in wild type as well as the following mutant genotypes: gnc gnl (AT5G56860, AT4G26150),  gata16 gata17 gata17l (AT5G49300, AT3G16870, AT4G16141), gnc gnl gata16 gata17 gata17l (AT5G56860, AT4G26150, AT5G49300, AT3G16870, AT4G16141) Three independent biological samples were prepared for each genotype. Experiment was performed in two rounds: Col-0_1, gnc gnl, quintuple and Col-0_2, triple.

DESIGN
Three replicate measurements of three biological samples were prepared for each genotype.
