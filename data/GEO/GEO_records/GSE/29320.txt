TITLE
The effect of Iron limitation on the transcriptome and proteome of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5: iron(III) chloride

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas fluorescens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 comparing iron(III) chloride supplemented grown culture against non-iron treated grown culture in M9 minimal media

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, iron(III) chloride supplemented culture versus non-iron treated culture. 3 biological replicates including 3 technical replicates for one of the biological replicate and 2 technical replicates for another biological replicate. Swap-dye experiments were performed

PLATFORM
GPL7621 JCVI Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 28k v2.0
