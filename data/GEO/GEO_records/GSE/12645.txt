TITLE
NB4 cell line treatment with WEB-2170

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study reports the ability of WEB-2170, an antagonist of platelet-activating-factor receptor, to induce apoptosis in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells.

DESIGN
Action mechanisms of WEB-2170 were first investigated in promyelocytic NB4 cells by DNA microarray profiling followed by morphologic, cytofluorimetric and biological analyses which were then extended to other AML cell lines including KG1, NB4-MR4, THP1 and U937, and, eventually, to blasts from patients with different AML subtypes (M0-M5).

PLATFORM
