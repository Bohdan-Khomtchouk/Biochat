TITLE
RNA-sequencing of  hepatocyte specific ABCA1 deletion mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) regulates cellular cholesterol efflux. We characterized the gene expression changes following hepatocyte specific ABCA1 deletion in mice. We report that genes and pathways related to lipogenesis were downregulated in mice with hepatocyte specific ABCA1 deletion compared to floxed controls.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of C57BL/6 mice with hepatocyte specific (Albumin-Cre) ABCA1 deletion and floxed controls were generated by high throughput sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.
