TITLE
Transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa PA3 to bacteriophage PaP3 infection

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas virus PaP3

SUMMARY
Explore the genome-scale phageâ€“host interactions across different developmental infection stages

DESIGN
Samples were taken from the PA3 Lysates infected with phage Pap3 at six internal time (0,5,10,20,30,80min). Three independent experiments were performed at each time.

PLATFORM
GPL20140 Agilent-031063 Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 NC_002516 and bacteriophage PaP3 4X44K array [Probe Name Version]
