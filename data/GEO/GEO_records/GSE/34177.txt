TITLE
BW25113 Rif pre-treated persister cells vs. stationary phase BW25113 wild-type

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
E. coli K-12 BW25113 persister cells generated via rifampicin pre-treatment  relative to BW25113 wild-type stationary phase gene expression. Persister cells were generated following exposure to ampicillin 20 ug/mL.

DESIGN
BW25113 wild-type, pre-treated with refampicin 30 min, ampicillin 3 h; BW25113 wild-type OD at 600 nm of 3.0, ampicillin 30 mins. Medium: LB ampicillin 20 ug/mL used to generate persisters; ampicillin 5 ug/mL added to stationary phase BW25113 wild-type

PLATFORM
GPL3154 [E_coli_2] Affymetrix E. coli Genome 2.0 Array
