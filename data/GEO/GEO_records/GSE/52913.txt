TITLE
Atriplex lentiformis transcriptome profiling

ORGANISM
Atriplex lentiformis

SUMMARY
To seek further insight into the factors controlling the shift from a 16:3 to 18:3 lipid profile in A. lentiformis, we conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis to assess gene expression in plants grown at 23 ºC and 43ºC

DESIGN
Total RNA for RNA-seq analysis were extracted from A. lentiformis leaf tissues with four biological replicates for each growth condition.
