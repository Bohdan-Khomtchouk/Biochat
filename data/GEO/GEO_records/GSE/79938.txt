TITLE
Expression data of Human Decidual NK cells, Peripheral blood, CD56Bright NK cells and CD56Dim NK cells on HGU133A arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fragmented RNA cocktails from FACS sorted Human  decidual NK cell, and peripheral blood CD56Bright and CD56Dim NK cells,  previously  hybridization to  HGU95AV2 chips (Koopman et al J Exp Med. 2003 Oct 20;198(8):1201-1), were stored long term at -80C, thawed and hybridized to HG-U133A arrays.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis of Human decidual NK cells and NK cells from peripheral blood using Affymetrix UGU133A arrays.
