TITLE
Effects of acute Notch activation on the mammary epithelial compartment in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Notch signaling is widely implicated in mouse mammary gland development and tumorigenesis.  To investigate the effects of acute activation of Notch signaling in the mammary epithelial compartment, we generated bi-transgenic MMTV-rtTA; TetO-NICD1 (MTB/TICNX) mice that conditionally express a constitutively active NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD1) construct in the mammary epithelium upon doxycycline administration.

DESIGN
Two timepoints (48h and 96h) of doxycycline induction in TetO-NICD1 (TICNX; control) and MMTV-rtTA; TetO-NICD1 (MTB/TICNX) mice with 3-4 replicates per timepoint
