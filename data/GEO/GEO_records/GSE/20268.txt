TITLE
MicroRNA expression profile in Dgcr8-homozygous mutant mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the effect of Dgcr8-homozygous mutation on microRNA expression profile in mouse embryonic stem cells. MicroRNA expression was substantially impaired, indicating a pivotal role of DGCR8 in microRNA biogenesis.

DESIGN
MicroRNA expression profile was compared between Dgcr8-homozygous mutant ES cells and wild-type ES cells
