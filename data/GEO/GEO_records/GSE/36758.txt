TITLE
Expression profiling shows differential functions and provides potential new diagnostic biomarkers for colorectal serrated adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our microarray study validates characteristic functions of serrated adenocarcinoma (SAC) reported in the only previous study which was performed on patients from a dissimilar environmental and genetic background and using a different microarray platform. In our study, fascin1 and hippocalcin were validated at the mRNA and protein level as the best biomarkers reported so far for the distinction of SAC from conventional carcinoma and from colorectal carcinoma showing molecular and histological features of high-level microsatellite instability.

DESIGN
In this study, we used gene expression arrays  to investigate differences between two experimental classes: serrated and conventional carcinomas
