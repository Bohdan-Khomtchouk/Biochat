TITLE
RNA-Seq of retina and RPE/choroid tissues from wild type, Abca4 knockout and Abca4 L541P;A1038V knockin mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report RNA-Seq analysis of the transcriptome of retinas and RPE/choroids from Abca4 knockout, Abca4 L541P;A1038V knockin and control wild type mice in order to better understand changes in gene regulation that could lead to retinal pathology in mice with ABCA4 deficiency/defect.

DESIGN
Retinal and RPE/choroidal mRNA profiles of 30-day-old wild type (WT), Abca4-/- and Abca4L541P;A1038V/L541P;A1038V mice were generated by RNA-Seq, using Illumina Hiseq 2500
