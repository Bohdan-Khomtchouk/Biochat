TITLE
Gene expression profile of colorectal cancer HCT116_p53minus cells treated with single (2Gy) or fractionated (5 x 2Gy) doses of ionizing radiation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The clinical significance of conventional treatment is based on an accumulated dose and usually consists of single daily irradiations of 1.8 - 2 Gy fractions. The most important molecule mediating DNA damage response (DDR) is the transcription factor p53. When activated, p53 mediates processes which are important for the cellular response to the clinical irradiation. These processes can be altered in cells having non-functional p53 that decrease cancer cell sensitivity to the fractionated irradiation. Therefore, the ongoing investigation of genomic scale expression changes in colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 with non-functional gene p53 following single and multiple fractions of irradiation provide researchers with essential data studying and incorporating novel therapies in the cancer treatment.

DESIGN
RNA was harvested from colorectal cancer cell line HCT116_p53minus 4h after the treatment of single (2 Gy) or fractionated (5x2 Gy) ionizing radiation dose. Non-treated cells were used as a control.
