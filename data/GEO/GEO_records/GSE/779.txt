SUMMARY
This is a time course experiment with 4 - 6 slides per time point where all samples were hybridised to time zero.  The microarray slides were scanned using a GenePix 4000B Scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA, USA). The “SPOT” software package (CSIRO) was used to identify spots and subtract backgrounds. The extracted information was normalised using the “Statistics in Microarray Analysis " (SMA) open source R package.  Scaled print tip group lowes normalisation was performed for each slide and replicate slides were scaled to each other. The cDNAs used in this microarray were identified as part of collaborative project between the IMVS and Bionomics Limited. The project aims were to identify genes up-regulated during in vitro capillary tube formation as targets for angiogenesis-based therapeutics.
