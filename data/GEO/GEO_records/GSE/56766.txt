TITLE
Whole Blood and Stimulated Whole Blood Transcriptomics in COPD.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We observed no transcripts in the whole blood that distinguishes COPD patients and  control smokers.  In contrast, T cell directed stimulation of whole blood, resulted in altered transcriptomic response and separated COPD patients from control smokers.

DESIGN
Performed microarrays on whole blood from 80 subjects.  Control groups were smokers with out COPD.  Compared COPD subjects to controls.  Whole blood from COPD subjects were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and microarray perfomed.  N=62 (stimulated) and N=64 (unstimulated
