TITLE
Characterization of the piRNA Complex from Rat Testes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This data series contains the sequences and read counts of Piwi-interacting RNAs and other small RNAs from mouse and rat testes extracts.  In a search for different classes of small RNAs that might be involved in transcriptional gene silencing, we encountered a novel class of small RNAs within mammalian testes.  This study reports the identification of small RNAs and their relative abundance levels to each other based on the deep coverage of the cDNA library. Keywords: High-throughput pyrosequencing by the 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer 20â„¢ System
