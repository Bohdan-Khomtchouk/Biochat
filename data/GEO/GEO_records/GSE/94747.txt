TITLE
NapA Mediates a Redox Regulation of the Antioxidant Response, Carbon Utilization and Development in Aspergillus nidulans

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Using transcriptomic analysis we show that transcription factor NapA is required for the regulation of at least 214 genes in intact asexual spores, including ethanol utilization genes alcR, alcA and aldA, and large groups of genes encoding proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, drug detoxification, carbohydrate utilization and secondary metabolism, comprising multiple oxidoreductases, membrane transporters and hydrolases.

DESIGN
We compare the transcriptomic profiles of WT and âˆ†napA intact asexual spores (conidia)
