TITLE
Gene expression profiling in acute murine autoimmune hepatitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The etiology of autoimmune hepatitis is poorly understood but likely involves Th1 cells producing IFN-γ. BALB/c background TGF-β1-/- mice rapidly develop fulminant Th1-mediated autoimmune hepatitis. Our aims are to profile liver gene expression in TGF-β1-/- mice, to identify gene expression pathways dependent on IFN-γ as possible targets for rational therapy, and to test potential targets directly in vivo in mice. Keywords: Comparative analysis of gene expression in livers of WT, TGFB1 & IFN knockout mice

DESIGN
DNA microarray analyses were applied to liver RNA from TGF-β1-/- mice, TGF-β1-/- /IFN-γ-/- mice, and TGF-β1+/+ littermate controls. 3 mice from each group were analyzed in this study.
