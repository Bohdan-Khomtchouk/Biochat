TITLE
RNAseq from polysomal RNA harvested from HCT116, MCF7 and SJSA cell lines treated with DMSO and Nutlin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine effects of p53 activation on levels of RNA associated with polysomes, we performed RNA-seq analysis of colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116, breast carcinoma line MCF7, and osteosarcoma line SJSA treated with MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin.

DESIGN
Polysomal RNA was extracted from HCT116, MCF7 and SJSA cells treated with Nutlin, polyA enriched and subjected to RNA-seq protocol.

PLATFORM
GPL17303 Ion Torrent Proton (Homo sapiens)
