TITLE
Molecular insight into AL cells and their subsequent dedifferentiation to primitive cell types with multilineage potency

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The sequential adipogenic differentiation and dedifferentiation processes resulted in novel stem cells that proliferated faster and retained multilineage potency; however, the mechanism underlying this cross-talk remained to be determined. In this context, we identified a number of differentially expressed genes during these processes. Gene expression profiling was performed to obtain a deeper molecular insight into AL cells and their subsequent dedifferentiation to primitive cell types with multilineage potency. GeneChips were generated for PDMSCs, AL cells and DePDMSCs from 3 donors. We selected numerous genes which were differentially expressed in the processes.

DESIGN
Expression profiling was performed for 9 samples (n = 3 donors) subdivided into 3 groups: 3X (PDMSCs), 3X (AL cells) and 3X (DePDMSCs P3) using [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array.
