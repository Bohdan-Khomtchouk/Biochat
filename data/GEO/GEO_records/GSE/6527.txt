TITLE
Earlybird mutation and knockout of Rab3a on gene expression in the cortex and hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cortex and hippocampus were dissected from each individual mouse.  Targets from three biological replicates of earlybird mutants and their wildtype littermates and six replicates of Rab3a knockouts and wildtype littermates were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix MOE430 A and B arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of tissue specifically expressed genes and genes that are affected by mutations of Rab3a. Keywords: repeat
