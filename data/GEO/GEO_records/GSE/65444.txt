TITLE
Expression and transcriptional regulation dynamics of hepatic lincRNAs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in adult male and female mouse liver was assayed by RNA-seq, as part of a study on hepatic lincRNAs.

DESIGN
Total liver RNA was prepared from 12 individual male and 12 individual female mice. Four independent pools, comprised of RNA isolated from 6 individual male or female livers (2 pooled biological replicates for each sex) were then prepared and used for RNA-seq.
