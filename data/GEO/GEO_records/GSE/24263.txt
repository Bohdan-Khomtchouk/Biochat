TITLE
High-throughput sequencing of WT and the yqhC mutant of Salmonella using Illumina Genome Analyzer II

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Total RNA was isolated from WT and the mutant and the ribosomal RNA was removed using Ambion Kit. Construction of cDNA library, addition of adapters and sequence read were performed.

DESIGN
2 samples were used, WT Salmonella and its yqhC mutant

PLATFORM
GPL10998 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium)
