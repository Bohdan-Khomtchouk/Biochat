TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans strain CB1190 during growth with dioxane, glycolate or pyruvate

ORGANISM
Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans strain CB1190 during growth with dioxane, glycolate or pyruvate.

DESIGN
Three treatments, based on carbon source used for growth: pyruvate, dioxane and glycolate. Triplicate microarrays (biological replicates) were prepared for each treatment. Pyruvate was used as the reference treatment for subsequent analysis. Gene expression changes were compared pair-wise: dioxane vs. pyruvate, and glycolate vs. pyruvate
