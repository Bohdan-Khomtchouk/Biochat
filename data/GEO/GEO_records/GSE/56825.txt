TITLE
CD47-dependent immunomodulatory and angiogenic activities of extracellular vesicles produced by T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intercellular communication is critical for integrating complex signals in multicellular eukaryotes.  Vascular endothelial cells and T lymphocytes closely interact during the recirculation and trans-endothelial migration of T cells.  In addition to direct cell-cell contact, we show that T cell derived extracellular vesicles can interact with endothelial cells and modulate their cellular functions.  Thrombospondin-1 and its receptor CD47 are expressed on exosomes/ectosomes derived from T cells, and these extracellular vesicles are internalized and modulate signaling in both T cells and endothelial cells.  Extracellular vesicles released from cells expressing or lacking CD47 differentially regulate activation of T cells induced by engaging the T cell receptor.   Similarly, T cell-derived extracellular vesicles modulate endothelial cell responses to vascular endothelial growth factor and tube formation in a CD47-dependent manner. Uptake of T cell derived extracellular vesicles by recipient endothelial cells globally alters gene expression in a CD47-dependent manner. CD47 also regulates the mRNA content of extracellular vesicles in a manner consistent with some of the resulting alterations in target endothelial cell gene expression. Therefore, the thrombospondin-1 receptor CD47 directly or indirectly regulates intercellular communication mediated by the transfer of extracellular vesicles between vascular cells.

DESIGN
HuVEC cells were cocultured with exosomes derived either from Jurkat or JinB8 cells culture media. Each condition was done in triplicate. Also, Exosome RNA from Jurkat or JINB8 cells were compared to each other in triplicate.
