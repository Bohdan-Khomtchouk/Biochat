TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Pml wt and Pml KO mice liver with acetaminophen (apap) overdose (300mg/kg) i.p.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Pml gene is essential to the formation of PML nuclear bodies, domains which have been associated with various functions such as apoptosis/senescence, DNA repair and cell proliferation( Lallemand-Breitenbach 2010). PML-NBs formation is regulated by cellular stress including oxidative stress(Jeanne 2010, de The 2012).  To investigate the role of PML in ROS response in vivo, we analyse the expression difference to the acetaminophen toxicity, which is initiated by ROS, in Pml wt and Pml KO mice.

DESIGN
Liver samples were collected from Pml wt and Pml KO untreated or treated with acetaminophen at 2h or 6h time points. 2 samples each.  Samples are stabilized in RNAlater and stocked in -20Â°C. Untreated samples are used as a control. Total RNA samples were extracted using Qiagen kit. Gene expression analysis was done in the plateform of Institute Curie using Affmetrix
