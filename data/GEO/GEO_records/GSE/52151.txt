TITLE
Analysis of DNA methylation changes in normal human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation analysis on purified human long-term and short-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC, ST-HSC), common myeloid and megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor cells (CMP, MEP) using HELP arrays. FACS-purified hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) subsets were analyzed for changes in DNA methylation using NimbleGen HELP microarrays.

DESIGN
Analysis of DNA methylation of bone marrow-derived HSPC subsets of healthy human donors.
