TITLE
A549, human alveolar adenocarcinoma cell, treated with aldehyde

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain deeper insight into the mechanism of toxicity, it is important to identify and characterize mRNAs profiles involved in responses to specific classes of toxicants in conjunction with their impact on gene expression levels. However, few reports have described the effects of toxicants on mRNA expression profiles. Taking into account the prominent role of mRNAs in cancer development, progression, cell cycle control, and proliferation-related processes, it is likely that mRNAs are involved in the toxic response induced by carcinogens. Aldehydes are a well-characterized class of human carcinogens. In the present study, we documented the different expression profiles of mRNAs in environmental carcinogen-exposed A549 cells by mRNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
To evaluate the change in mRNA expression levels, human alveolar cells(A549) were exposed to seven lower-molecular-weight saturated aliphatic aldehyde (LSAAs) for 48h. mRNA expression analysis was conducted using a  4x44k human whole genome oligo microarray (Agilent Technologies, USA).
