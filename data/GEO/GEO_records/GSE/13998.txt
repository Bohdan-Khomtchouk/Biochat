TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of RelE family toxin overexpression in Mycobacterium tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
To understand the mechanism of action of the RelE family of toxins on metabolism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To this effect, toxin expression was induced under control of a tetracycline regulatable promoter and transcriptional profiles compared during overexpression of the three RelE toxin family members. Profiles were also compared to previously published profiles of drugs of known mechanism of action against this organism.
