TITLE
Expression data from Tcfeb KO mice specifically in muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the effects of the absence of Tcfeb on the muscle transcriptome, we performed Affymetrix Gene-Chip hybridization experiments for the KO mice as compared with wt mice Transcriptome analysis of the Tcfeb KO mice specifically in muscle

DESIGN
For the analysis on the Tcfeb KO mice, total RNA was extracted from the muscle of three mice; RNA extracted from the muscle of three wt muscles was used as control.
