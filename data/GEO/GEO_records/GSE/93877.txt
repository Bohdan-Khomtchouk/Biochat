TITLE
RNA-Seq in SMARCD2 k/d NB4 cells with/without ATRA differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report differential gene expression in the human AML cell line NB4 that can be partially differentiated into neutrophil granulocytes by 1ÂµM ATRA for 2d or the vehicle DMSO only ((mock))

DESIGN
Chromatin accessibility in CTRL vs SMARCD2-specific shRNA1 and SMARCD2-specific shRNA2. All biological samples were sequenced twice, i.e. technical replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
