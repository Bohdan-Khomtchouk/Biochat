TITLE
Transcriptional network controlled by Candida glabrata Ada2, a transcription coactivator

ORGANISM
[Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
In order to identify genes governed by Ada2, a transcription coactivator in C. glabrata, we compared the genome-wide expression profile in wild-type strain CBS138 and ada2 mutant via RNA sequencing. According to our analyses, 43 genes were down- and 443 genes were up-regulated in ada2 mutant when compared with the wild-type. The 43 down-regulated genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis pathway (ERG6, ERG13), adhesin or adhesin-like genes (ICS2, AWP2, EPA7), heat shock genes (HSP30, SSB2) and other cellular functions. Among the 443 up-regulated genes, nine adhesin-like EPA family genes (EPA1, EPA6, EPA8, EPA10, EPA11, EPA12, EPA15, EPA20, EPA23) and three yapsin family genes (YPS4, YPS8, YPS10) were included.

DESIGN
Total mRNAs extracted from C. glabrata wild-type CBS138 and ada2 mutant were analyzed using RNA sequencing
