TITLE
Mismatch oligonucleotides in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Tiled 10kb region centered around ACT1 gene (YFL039C, CHROMOSOME 6 @ coords 48760-59195), double-stranded, 36mers at 1bp spacing, with mismatches and deletions; also tiled 6 genes of interest (YBL092W, YGR155W, YOL040C, YOR312C, YMR242C, YLR229C), coding strand only, 36mers at 1bp spacing, with some mismatches and deletions Keywords: Mismatch hybridization experiment
