TITLE
Mismatch oligonucleotides in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Tiled 10kb region centered around ACT1 gene (YFL039C, CHROMOSOME 6 @ coords 48760-59195), double-stranded, 36mers at 1bp spacing, with mismatches and deletions; also tiled 6 genes of interest (YBL092W, YGR155W, YOL040C, YOR312C, YMR242C, YLR229C), coding strand only, 36mers at 1bp spacing, with some mismatches and deletions Keywords: Mismatch hybridization experiment

DESIGN
Tiled perfect match and various designs of mismatch oligonucleotide for several yeast genes. Goal was to observe the influence of various MM types on hybridization behavior in yeast and compare it to human (see related slide).
