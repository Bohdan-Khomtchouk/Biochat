TITLE
Global Regulation of Alternative RNA Splicing by the SR-Rich Protein RBM39 CLIP-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RBM39 is extensively involved in alternative splicing of RNA and helps regulate transcript levels. RBM39 may modulate alternative splicing similarly to U2AF65 by either directly binding to RNA or recruiting other splicing factors, such as U2AF65.

DESIGN
Genome-wide RBM39-RNA interactions were mapped via cross-linking and immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (CLIP-Seq) in wild-type MCF-7 cells.

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
