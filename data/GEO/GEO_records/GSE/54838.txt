TITLE
D-2-Hydroxyglutarate produced by mutant IDH2 causes cardiomyopathy and neurodegeneration in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) have been discovered in several cancer types and cause the neurometabolic syndrome D2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria  (D2HGA). The mutant enzymes exhibit neomorphic activity resulting in production of D2- hydroxyglutaric acid (D-2HG). To study the pathophysiological consequences of the  accumulation of D2-HG, we generated transgenic mice with conditionally activated IDH2R140Q and IDH2R172K alleles. Global induction of mutant IDH2 expression in adults  resulted in dilated cardiomyopathy, white matter abnormalities throughout the central nervous system (CNS), and muscular dystrophy. Embryonic activation of mutant IDH2  resulted in more pronounced phenotypes, including runting, hydrocephalus, and shortened life spanâ€”recapitulating the abnormalities observed in D2HGA patients. The  diseased hearts exhibited mitochondrial damage and glycogen accumulation with a concordant upregulation of genes involved in glycogen biosynthesis. Notably, mild  cardiac hypertrophy was also observed in nude mice implanted with IDH2R140Q expressing xenografts, suggesting that 2HG may potentially act in a paracrine fashion.  Finally, we show that silencing of IDH2R140Q in mice with an inducible transgene restores heart function by lowering 2HG levels. Together, these findings indicate that inhibitors of  mutant IDH2 may be beneficial in the treatment of D2HGA and suggest that 2HG produced by IDH mutant tumors has the potential to provoke a paraneoplastic condition.

DESIGN
We have performed microarray expression profiling of hearts from IDH2 mutant and control mice.
