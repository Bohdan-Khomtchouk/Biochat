TITLE
Transcript changes in tlpD mutant of Helicobacter pylori

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori N6

SUMMARY
Differential gene transcript amounts between Helicobacter pylori N6 (wild type strain) bacteria and isogenic tlpD mutant grown in liquid culture to similar O.D.600 (1.0; mid log)

DESIGN
Comparative analyses of transcript levels in N6 (wild type strain) and isogenic tlpD mutant comprising four arrays of three biological experiments (one including a dye swap); each array comprising two technical replicates for each gene

PLATFORM
