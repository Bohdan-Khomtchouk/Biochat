TITLE
Gene expression signature for highly liver metastatic colon cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal was to identify genes that promote liver metastasis of colorectal cancer. Microarray analysis was performed to compare gene expression and altered biological pathways between a poorly metastatic CT26 cell line as compared to an isogenic highly metastatic CT26 FL3 cell line that was isolated by in vivo selection in an orthotopic mouse model of colon cancer metastasis to the liver.

DESIGN
Gene expression in CT26-FL3 and parental CT26 cells were determined using the Agilent platform.  Four independent samples each were analyzed.
