TITLE
The DNA methylation landscape of human early embryos

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our data provided a genome-wide DNA methylation landscape of human early development embryos, including human MII oocytes, sperm, zygotes, 2-cell to 8-cell embryos, morula, blastocyst and postimplantation embryos at single base resolution.

DESIGN
In total, 44 samples including biological and technical replicates, from 12 different human embryo development stages were analyzed, including two metaphase II oocytes, two zygotes, three first polar bodies, two second polar bodies, four sperm samples, two 2-cell-stage embryos, two 4-cell-stage embryos, three 8-cell-stage embryos, three morulae, three inner cell masses (ICMs) and three trophectoderms (TEs) seperated from late blastocysts, and three post-implantation embryos. In addition, 12 different human embryo development stages were analyzed, including metaphase II oocytes, zygotes, first polar bodies, second polar bodies, sperm samples, 2-cell-stage embryos, 4-cell-stage embryos, 8-cell-stage embryos, morulae, inner cell masses (ICMs) and trophectoderms (TEs) seperated from late blastocysts, and post-implantation embryos.
