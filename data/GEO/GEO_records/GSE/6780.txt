TITLE
Evaluating the effects of activating mutations of human LH receptor in MA-10 cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the potential tumorigenic effect of two activating mutations of hLHR identified in patients, we generated in vitro cell model using mouse Leydig MA-10 cells. The two mutations, Asp578His and Asp578Gly, were stably transfected to MA-10 cell to create MA-10-Asp578His and MA-10-Asp578Gly line. The profile of expressed genes in cells expressing the mutated hLHR was compared with that of control cells using cDNA microarrays with NIA mouse clone sets. Keywords: Genetic modification analysis

DESIGN
Both stably transfected cells were compared to empty vector control. MA-10 cell was used as reference for all the samples. Indirect labelling of Cy3 and Cy5 was applied to subject and control. Each sample contains three biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL4755 Custom cDNA array from NIA mouse clone set
