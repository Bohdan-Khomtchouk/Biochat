TITLE
DNA methylation analysis of human atherosclerotic plaques in comparison to healthy mammary arteries

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report differential DNA methylation results from human femoral atherosclerotic plaques compared to healthy mammary arteries. 5-methylcytosine containing DNA fragments are captured by methylcytosine binding domain - based MethylCapture assay. Captured fragments are sequenced using Illumina paired-end approach and mapped to human genome (hg19). Results. Hypomethylation of chromosomal DNA predominates in atherosclerotic plaques. Chr14q32.2 was identified for the first time as an extensively hypomethylated area in atherosclerosis with highly induced expression of miR127, -136, -410, -431, and -432

DESIGN
DNA methylation in 8 human atherosclerotic plaques was compared to 5 healthy mammary arteries.
