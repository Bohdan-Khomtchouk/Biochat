TITLE
Transcription profiling of human olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells (hOE-MSCs) from familial dysautonomia (FD) patients with or without kinetin treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells (hOE-MSCs) from controls and familial dysautonomia (FD) patients were cultured in either sphere-forming conditions (ITS + EGF + bFGF) or in the presence of retinoic acid, forskolin and Sonic Hedgehog (rafnshh) for 7 days to induce neuroglial differentiation and were also treated or not with kinetin (100 mM for 48h) which corrects the aberrant splicing of IKBKAP mRNA. We used the recently described model of human olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells to identify genes differentially expressed between controls and familial dysautonomia patients, and also the genes sensitive to kinetin which corrects aberrant splicing of IKBKAP mRNA

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from 20 samples including: 4 control and 4 FD hOE-MSCs-derived sphere cultures, 4 control and 4 FD rafnshh-treated hOE-MSCs, 4 FD rafnshh-treated hOE-MSCs in the presence of kinetin
