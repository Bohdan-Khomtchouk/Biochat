TITLE
Small RNAs from the lycopod Selaginella moellendorffii

ORGANISM
Selaginella moellendorffii

SUMMARY
The small RNAs of Selaginella moellendorffii were sampled by direct pyrosequencing (454 Life Sciences).  These data represent microRNAs, siRNAs, and other expressed small RNAs of ~18-~28 nts. in length. Keywords: Small RNA sequencing - high throughput

DESIGN
One sample of above-ground tissues of greenhouse-grown S. moellendorffii was used to extract and sequence small RNAs.
