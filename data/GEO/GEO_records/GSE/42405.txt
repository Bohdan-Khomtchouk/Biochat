TITLE
Gene expression profiling of FUT8 knockdown CL1-5 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Overexpression of fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) is found in many cancers including liver, ovarian, thyroid, colorectal and non-small cell lung cancers. Unlike other FUTs which are functionally redundant, FUT8 is the only enzyme responsible for the alpha1,6-linked fucosylation (core fucosylation) by adding fucose to the innermost GlcNAc residue of an N-linked glycan. A growing body of evidence indicates that core fucosylation is important for regulating protein functions, such as EGFR, TGF beta receptor and integrins. To understand the downstream molecular events in response to the global alteration of core fucosylation during cancer progression, microarray analysis was employed to profile the changes in gene expression following FUT8 silencing. The genes significantly (2-fold, P < 0.01) changed in CL1-5/shFUT8 cells were selected for functional annotations using a Gene Ontology database. The result revealed that many genes involved in cell adhesion, motility, growth, angiogenesis, and inflammation were under the control of core fucosylation.

DESIGN
In this experiment, the gene expression profile of two stable FUT8 knockdown clones of CL1-5 cells, CL1-5/shFUT8-1 and CL1-5/shFUT8-2, were compare with CL1-5/Control cells. A total of eight samples were analyzed, including four CL1-5/Control vs. CL1-5/shFUT8-1 and four CL1-5/Control vs. C1-5/shFUT8-2. The biological replicates for each cell lines were four.
