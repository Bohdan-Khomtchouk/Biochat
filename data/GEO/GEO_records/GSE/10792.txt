TITLE
Genome wide genotyping and gene expression data of childhood B-cell precursor ALL without known genetic aberrations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute lymphoblastic pediatric leukemia specimens without known genetic hallmarks are examined for hidden genomic aberrancies and related gene expression profiles Integration of genomic variation and gene expression profiling identifies hidden genetic lesions and novel pathways involved in BP-ALL pathogenesis Keywords: expression data

DESIGN
To identify variation in expression of genes affected by recurrent genomic alterations in BP-ALL genotype and GEP data of the same samples were integrated
