SUMMARY
Acute lymphoblastic pediatric leukemia specimens without known genetic hallmarks are examined for hidden genomic aberrancies and related gene expression profiles Integration of genomic variation and gene expression profiling identifies hidden genetic lesions and novel pathways involved in BP-ALL pathogenesis Keywords: expression data
