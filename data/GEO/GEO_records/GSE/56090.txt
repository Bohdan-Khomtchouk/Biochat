TITLE
Expression data from HT29 intestinal epithelial cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study recapitulates, through in vitro micropatterned co-cultures, interactions between HIV-infected T-lymphocytes and intestinal epithelial cells in order to investigate the mechanisms underlying the disruption of normal epithelial cell and barrier function during HIV infection. The co-culture method simplifies observation/monitoring of the two cell types and is particularly suited for laser microdissection-based retrieval of the epithelial cells for downstream gene expressions studies. Microarrays were used to characterize changes in gene expression in HT29 epithelial cells co-cultured with Jurkat T-lymphocytes in the presence and absence of HIV infection

DESIGN
Micropatterned co-cultures were generated of healthy or HIV-infected T-lymphocytes (Jurkat) and human intestinal epithelial (HT-29) cells whereby both cell types were positioned on the same surface in a price spatial configuration (micropattern).  HT29 celsl were then isolated by laser capture microdissection and used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix U133 Plus2 microarrays.
