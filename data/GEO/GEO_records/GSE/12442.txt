TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Sacchromyces cerevisiae in different levels of oxygen provision

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK113-1A was grown in glucose-limited chemostat culture with 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.8% or 20.9% O2 in the inlet gas (D= 0.10 /h, pH5, 30C).

DESIGN
Four (0,0.5,2.8 and 20.9% oxygen) or seven samples (1% oxygen) were analysed. Samples were either from four (0,1,20.9% oxygen) or two independent cultivations (0.5, 2.8% oxygen). One sample (VTT_Ys23_13_1%) was found to be an outlier and was removed from the analysis.
