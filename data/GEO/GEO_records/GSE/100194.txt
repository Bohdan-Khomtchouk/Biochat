TITLE
Transcriptional Profiling Confirms the Therapeutic Effects of Mast Cell Stabilization in a Dengue Disease Model [liver]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we show that the host response to DENV infection in immunocompetent mice recapitulates transcriptional changes that have been described in human studies. We found that DENV infection induced metabolic dysregulation and inflammatory responses, and also affected the immune cell content of the spleen and liver. Use of the mast cell stabilization drug, ketotifen, reversed many of these responses, and induced additional changes in the transcriptome and immune cell repertoire that contribute to decreased dengue disease.

DESIGN
Gene expression in liver and spleen were measured on days 1 and 3 post mock infection or infection with DENV2 plus or minus ketotifen treatment. Three mice were profiled for each treatment category and timepoint. This dataset includes the data from liver.
