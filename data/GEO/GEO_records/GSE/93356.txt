TITLE
Ginsenoside Rh2 epigenetically regulates cell-mediated immune pathway to inhibit proliferation of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of estrogene receptor postive breast cancer cell line MCF-7, treating Ginsoenoside Rh2. The Illumina Infinium Human Methylation EPIC v1.0 B2 Bead chip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 850,000 CpGs. This profiling indicates that Ginsenoside Rh2 induces epigenetic and cellular changes.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA obtained from  MCF-7 treated Ginsenoside Rh2

PLATFORM
GPL21145 Infinium MethylationEPIC
