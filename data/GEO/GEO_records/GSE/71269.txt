TITLE
Genome-wide expression microarray analysis of PRAME knock down TCam-2 cells with and without ATRA treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina expression microarray analysis of shRNA-mediated PRAME knock down TCam-2 cells with and without all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment for 8 days, of TCam-2 cells with and without ATRA (8d) and of in vitro cultivated GCC cell lines TCam-2, 2102EP, NCCIT and JAR.  These data are part of the article 'The Cancer / Testis-Antigen PRAME supports the pluripotency network and represses somatic and germ cell differentiation programs in seminomas'.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from TCam-2 PRAME shRNA cells (sh)  treated for 8 days with (n = 3, sh+A) and without (n = 3, sh-A) ATRA (20 micromolar). Additionally, total RNA from TCam-2 cells treated with ATRA for 8 days was isolated (n = 1, TCam-2 +A). As controls, TCam-2 cells were infected with empty pSUPER.retro-vector (n = 1, TCam-2 pS.r) or treated with the ATRA-solvent DMSO (n = 1, TCam-2 DMSO). Stable PRAME shRNA knock down cells were generated by infecting TCam-2 cells with retroviral particles coding for PRAME shRNA (in pRETRO.super-vector). Stable clones were selected by Puromycin selection. Additionally, RNA was isolated from in vitro cultivated TCam-2 (n = 1), 2102EP (n = 1), NCCIT (n = 1) and JAR (n =1) cells.
