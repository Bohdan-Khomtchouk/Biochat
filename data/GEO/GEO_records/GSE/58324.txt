TITLE
Gene expression profile in human cancer BG-1 and MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have evidence to believe that the BG-1 cells (named as BG-1 NIEHS here) we had obtained some years ago and provided to some laboratories are actually a clonal variation of MCF-7 cells. This only became evident from a recent Short Tandem Repeats (STR) analysis. We also have obtained another source of BG-1 cells from an investigator in France which we have named BG-1 FR. In this study, we compared gene expression profile in the two BG-1 lines (BG-1 FR or BG-1 NIEHS) and MCF-7 cells to identify differential genes set. We then will compare within each cell line and determine gene expression changes in response to E2 treatment that are specific for mechanism of ERâ€™s actions in each cell type.

DESIGN
The total RNA was isolated from the cells tretaed with vehicle (75% EtOH) or Estrodiol (10 nM E2) for 18 hrs. In each treatment group, we included the 3 biological replicates.The microarray analysis was perfomed using Agilent whole human 4x44K multiplex oligo arrays (014868).
