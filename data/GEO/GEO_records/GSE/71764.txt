TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis during de-etiolation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis fc2-1 mutants fail to properly de-etiolate after a prolonged period in the dark. Our goal was to monitor whole genome expression during the first 2 hours of de-etiolation to determine the cuase of this growth arrest. In comparison with other mutants that also affect de-etiolation, we identified a subset of genes specifically regulated by FC2 function during de-etiolation.

DESIGN
Seedlings were grown in the dark for 4 days and then exposed to white light for 30 or 120 minutes to initiate de-etiolation and photomorphogenesis
