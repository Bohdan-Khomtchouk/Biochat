TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and Stat3f/f K5cre Skin Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic skin disease, affecting > 15% of children and 2-10% of adults worldwide. Understanding pathogenic mechanisms of the onset and dynamic progression of AD is required to design its effective treatments. The kinetical analysis of transcriptome in a mouse AD model revealed the pathways that led a vulnerable background and were critical to the onset of disease progress.

DESIGN
Kinetical transcriptome analysis in keratinocyte specific Stat3 deficient mice

PLATFORM
