TITLE
Expression data for 211  primary tumors from patients with colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples were taken from surgically resected tumor specimens from patients with colorectal cancer. The expression profiles were determined using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array version 2. Gene mutation status was determined using Sanger sequencing.

DESIGN
211 colorectal cancers samples were analyzed for both microarray expression (Plus2.0 platform) and mutation status of several genes.
