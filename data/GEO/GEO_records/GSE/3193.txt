Breast Tumor Clinical Implications

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to explore the possibility of classifying breast carcinomas based upon variations in gene expression patterns derived from cDNA microarrays, and to correlate tumor characteristics to clinical outcome. A total of 85 cDNA microarray experiments representing tumor and normal breast tissues from 78 individuals were analyzed by hierarchical-clustering. As reported previously, we identified a basal epithelial-like group, an ERBB2-overexpressing group and a normal breast-like group based on variations in gene expression. A novel finding was that the previously characterized lluminal epithelial/ER-positiven group could be divided into at least two subgroups, each with a distinctive expression profile. These subtypes proved to be reasonably robust by clustering using two different gene sets; first, a set of 456 cDNA clones previously selected to reflect the lintrinsicn properties of the tumors and, second, a gene set identified that highly correlated with patient outcome. Survival analyses on the sub-cohort of 51 patients with locally advanced breast cancer uniformly treated in a prospective study showed significantly different outcomes for the patients   belonging to the various groups, including a poor prognosis for the basal-like subtype and a significant difference in outcome for the two estrogen receptor-positive groups.
