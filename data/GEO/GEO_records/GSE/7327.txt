TITLE
Expression data from MCF7 xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to help determine the genes involved in resistance of breast cancer to endocrine therapy, we compared global gene expression profiles of tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 WT xenograft tumors with E2-supplemented tumors. Keywords: two group comparison

DESIGN
MCF7 xenografts were established in ovariectomized five to six week-old nu/nu athymic nude mice supplemented with 0.25 mg 21 day release estrogen pellets by inoculating subcutaneously (s.c.) 5E-6 cells. When tumors reached the size of 150-200 mm3 (3-5 weeks), the animals were randomly allocated to continued estrogen (E2) and estrogen withdrawal plus tamoxifen citrate.  Tumors were harvested for molecular studies when they became resistant to treatment and reached the size of 1000 mm3 (n=7).
