TITLE
Expression data from MCF7 xenografts

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
In order to help determine the genes involved in resistance of breast cancer to endocrine therapy, we compared global gene expression profiles of tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 WT xenograft tumors with E2-supplemented tumors. Keywords: two group comparison
