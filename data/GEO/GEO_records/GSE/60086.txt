TITLE
Distinct gene signatures define pathogen- versus diet-induced atherosclerosis development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to define gene expression profiles in aortic tissue in response to three pro-atherogenic stimuli at two time points. We identified gene expression profiles induced by oral P.gingivalis (Pg), intranasal C. pneumoniae (Cp), and Western diet (WD) at acute (1 day after last infection, Pg, Cp, and control groups) and chronic (9 weeks after last infection, Pg, Cp, and control groups; WD for 9 weeks) time points in aortas of Apolipoprotein E (Apoe-/-) mice. 3 replicates per group were analyzed. RNA was analyzed using Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).

DESIGN
Total RNA  from aortic tissue of  Apoe-/- mice  treated with P. gingivalis, C. pneumoniae,  or fed a Western diet  were compared to controls at acute and chronic time points.
