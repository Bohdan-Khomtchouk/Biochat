TITLE
The AIN-centered DCN of delayed-type eyeblink conditioned mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN) is a proposed site of memory formation of eyeblink conditioning. A large part of the underlying molecular events, however, remains unknown. To elucidate molecular mechanisms, we examined transcriptional changes in the AIN of mice trained with delayed-type eyeblink conditioning The data are not directly comparable between GSE3651 and GSE3652, given the different experimental time periods and amounts of cRNA used for hybridizations. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
