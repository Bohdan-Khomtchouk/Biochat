TITLE
The AIN-centered DCN of delayed-type eyeblink conditioned mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN) is a proposed site of memory formation of eyeblink conditioning. A large part of the underlying molecular events, however, remains unknown. To elucidate molecular mechanisms, we examined transcriptional changes in the AIN of mice trained with delayed-type eyeblink conditioning The data are not directly comparable between GSE3651 and GSE3652, given the different experimental time periods and amounts of cRNA used for hybridizations.
