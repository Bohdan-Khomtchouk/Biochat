TITLE
Host miRNA molecular signatures in the brains of mice are associated with acute herpes simplex virus 1 encephalitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse brain regions (microdissection of cerebellum and hippocampus regions) comparing control, untreated brain tissue with HSV-1 infected brain tissue. Two viral tires, 10^3 and 10^6 plaque forming units of HSV-1 strain F, were intracerebrally inoculated into the brain of SJL/J strain of mice. The goal was to assess global transcriptional dynamics in HSV-1 infected mice, a model of herpes simplex encephalitis, as compared to controls (either PBS or Vero cell suspension). The microarray data identified fluctuations in gene expression where many of these genes were also potential targets of miRNA-200 and miR-183 family members which were themselves upregulated within the same brain samples.

DESIGN
Eight experimental conditions were compared: 1) hippocampus 10^3 plaque forming units of HSV-1 infected brain samples were compared to PBS control;  2) hippocampus 10^3 plaque forming units of HSV-1 infected brain samples were compared to Vero controls; 3) hippocampus 10^6 plaque forming units of HSV-1 infected brain samples were compared to PBS; 4) hippocampus 10^6 plaque forming units of HSV-1 infected brain samples were compared to Vero controls; 5) cerebellum 10^3 plaque forming units of HSV-1 infected brain samples were compared to PBS control;  6) cerebellum 10^3 plaque forming units of HSV-1 infected brain samples were compared to Vero controls; 7) cerebellum 10^6 plaque forming units of HSV-1 infected brain samples were compared to PBS; 8) cerebellum 10^6 plaque forming units of HSV-1 infected brain samples were compared to Vero controls. Biological replicates: 2 cerebellum 10^3 HSV-1 infected brain samples; 2 hippocampus 103 HSV-1 infected brain samples; 2 cerebellum 10^6 HSV-1 infected brain samples; 2 hippocampus 106 HSV-1 infected brain samples; 1 Vero control sample, 1 PBS control sample.  Dye swaps were performed for all array samples except for sample 251486812045_6LHippocmapus_10^3_555.txt.
