TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant with extended chronological life span

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
A Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant with extended chronological life span was obtained by using an evolutionary engineering strategy, based on successive batch cultivation under gradually enhanced caloric restriction. The mutant strain SRM11 was selected which had about 50% longer life span than the reference strain. Whole-genome transcriptomic analysis of SRM11 with respect to the reference strain was performed to identify differences in gene expression levels between the two strains.

DESIGN
To perform the comparative whole-genome transcriptomic analysis of the selected mutant SRM11 with respect to the reference strain, Agilent Yeast One-Color DNA microarray systems were used. Prior to gene expression analysis, three replicates of each culture were grown in yeast minimal medium (YMM) at 30Â°C and 150 rpm. Total RNA isolation was carried out by using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) at logarithmic phase of growth (OD600 ~1.0).
