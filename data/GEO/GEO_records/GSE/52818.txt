TITLE
Expression data from the aorta of DBA, B6 and 129 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Strain differences influence susceptibility to atherosclerosis. Apolipoprotein E-null mice on a DBA/2J genetic background (DBA-apoE) and C57BL/6 (B6-apoe) are highly susceptible to atherosclerosis in the aortic root area compared with those on a 129S6/SvEvTac background (129-apoE). To explore strain-specific differences affecting the susceptibility to atherosclerosis, we performed microarray analysis of aortic arch and root from wild type mice of each strains.

DESIGN
Aortia were dissected from wild-type DBA-apoe, B6-apoe and 129-apoe male mice, and tissues from 4-6 mice were pooled per sample.
