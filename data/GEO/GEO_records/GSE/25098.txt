TITLE
Rhabdomyosarcoma can be initiated in activated Pax7+ Muscle Progenitor Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of rhabdomyosarcomas generated using mice with conditional mutations in Kras and p53 using both in vivo and in vitro approaches to identify a cell of origin for rhabdomyosarcoma.

DESIGN
Contains rhabdomyosarcomas derived in vivo using Pax7-CreER mice and in vitro using sorted muscle progenitor cells, UPS derived from intramuscular Adeno-Cre injection, and normal muscle.
