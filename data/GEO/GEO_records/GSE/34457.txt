TITLE
Molecular Signatures of cardiac defects in Down syndrome lymphoblastoid cell lines (congenital heart disease)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Molecular Signatures of cardiac defects in Down syndrome lymphoblastoid cell lines. In this study, we want to identify genes and pathways specifically dysregulated in atrioventricular septal defect and /or atrial septal defect + ventricular septal defect in case of trisomy 21.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from DS lymphoblastoid cell lines without congenital heart disease compared to cell lines from DS with congenital heart disease.
