TITLE
Characterization of porcine chromosomal regions harboring QTL for water holding capacity of meta by tiling arrays and mRNA-seq

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To further characterize genomic regions previously identified which are linked with meat quality traits like drip loss, PH, conductivity and etc., we employed mRNA-seq experiment on the PiF1 animals used in the tiling array experiments. Total RNA were taken from muscle sample of M. longissimus dorsi of pigs selected from two phenotypic groups graded according to high (HI) and low (LO) drip loss.

DESIGN
Muscle mRNA profiles of 12  were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina GAIIx.

PLATFORM
