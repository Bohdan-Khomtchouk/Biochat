TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 challenged with Ralstonia solanacearum race 4

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum is a serious seed/soil borne disease that causes severe yield and quality losses in many plants. In order to understand the change in genome expression of inculated plants, microarray analysis were performed.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis Col-0 seeds were inoculated with Ralstonia solanacearum race 4 @ 10^8 cfu/ml, distil water were mock inoculated and twenty one days plants were taken for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Seeds were incubated in growth chamber for development, temperature and humidity were maintained as per plant requirement for both treated and control plants. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying disease development and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes during this process.
