SUMMARY
The p53-regulated long non-coding RNA, lincRNA-p21, has been proposed to promote apoptosis and to repress in trans the expression of genes in the p53 transcriptional network. Here, we report the generation of a conditional knockout mouse model developed to further examine lincRNA-p21 function. Using this genetic approach, we find that the primary function of lincRNA-p21 is to activate in cis the expression of its neighboring gene, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Mechanistically, we show that lincRNA-p21 acts in concert with hnRNP-K as a co-activator for p53-dependent transcription of p21. Additional phenotypes of lincRNA-p21 deficiency, including deregulated expression and altered chromatin state of a set of Polycomb target genes, defective G1/S checkpoint, increased proliferation rates, and enhanced reprogramming efficiency could be attributed to diminished p21 levels. This study reveals a novel paradigm, whereby the long non-coding RNA lincRNA-p21 affects global gene expression and influences events in the p53 tumor suppressor pathway by acting in cis as a locus-restricted transcriptional co-activator for p53-mediated expression of p21.
