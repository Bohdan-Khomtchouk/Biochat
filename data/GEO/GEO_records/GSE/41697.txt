TITLE
Microarray analysis of GFP-SAS cells treated with siAURKA and MLN8237

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knockdown of AURKA by siAURKA and treatment with MLN8237 markedly inhibit the growth of GFP-SAS cells. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of siAURKA and MLN8237 using the Affymetrix GeneAtlasTM System.

DESIGN
Using the Affymetrix GeneAtlas System, we compared gene expression profiles of GFP-SAS cells treated with siAURKA, siNon-target (siNT), MLN8237, or DMSO.
