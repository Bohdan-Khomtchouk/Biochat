TITLE
Overexpression of miR-9 and miR-9* in 32D cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Overexpression of miR-9 and miR-9* in 32D cells, cells grown under IL-3 conditions and miR-9 and miR-9* were introduced with retroviral vectors containing about ~150 bp up and downstream of mmu-mir-9-2. Expression was determined to find out the effect of miR-9/9*overexpression on the transcriptome level compared to introduction of empty vector control.

DESIGN
Transcriptome levels were determined for 32D cells expressing miR-9 and miR-9* and empty vector control. Experiment performed in three independent replicates.
