TITLE
Expression data of macrophage phenotypes treated with interleukin-1alpha

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of the difference in responsiveness to interleukin-1alpha between M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypes.

DESIGN
To identify the difference in responsiveness to interleukin-1alpha between M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypes, we performed micorarray analysis of gene expression in two phenotypes with or without the treatment of interleukin-1alpha.
