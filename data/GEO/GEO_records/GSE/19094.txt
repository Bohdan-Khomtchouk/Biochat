TITLE
microRNA profiling in human macrophages under immunogenic treatments in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRs) contribute to both neuronal and immune cell fate, but their involvement in inter-tissue communication remained unexplored. The brain, via vagal secretion of acetylcholine (ACh), suppresses peripheral inflammation by intercepting cytokine production; therefore, we predicted that microRNAs targeting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) can attenuate inflammation. Here, we report that inflammatory stimuli induce leukocyte over-expression of the AChE-targeting miR-132. Injected LNA-modified anti-miR-132 oligonucleotide depleted miR-132 levels while elevating AChE in mouse circulation and tissues.  In transfected cells, a mutated 3â€™UTR miR-132 binding site increased AChE mRNA expression, whereas cells infected with a lentivirus expressing pre-miR-132 showed suppressed AChE. Transgenic mice over-expressing 3'UTR-null AChE showed excessive inflammatory mediators and impaired cholinergic anti-inflammatory regulation, in spite of substantial miR-132 up-regulation in brain and bone marrow. Our findings identify the AChE mRNA-targeting miR-132 as a functional regulator of the brain-to-body resolution of inflammation, opening new avenues for study and therapeutic manipulations of the neuro-immune dialogue.
