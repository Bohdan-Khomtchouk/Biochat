TITLE
CSE-induced hydorogen sulfide improves glucose homeostasis and inhibits beta-cell failure in high-fat diet mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CSE knockout (CSE-KO)mice at age 6 months were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks.we determined the effects of CSE knockdown on beta-cell function and mass in islets from the mice. After 8 weeks of the HFD,blood glucose levels were drasically increaced in CSE-KO mice compared with WT mice. To assess the effect of HFD on gene expression in CSE-KO mice,we performed a comparative DNA microarray analysis

DESIGN
2 samples analysis.control is CSE-WT(HFD+)

PLATFORM
