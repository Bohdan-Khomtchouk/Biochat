TITLE
Genomic signatures predict poor outcome in Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcomas and Leiomyosarcomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) analyses was used to analyze 20 UPS and 17 LMS samples from untreated patients. The data were validated using quantitative PCR.

DESIGN
Experiment condition, 20 UPS and 17 LMS DNA samples obtained from untreated patients were laleled with Cy5 and commercial reference samples (Promega) were labled with Cy3. Samples Cy3 and Cy5 were mixed and hybridized at slide glasses Agilent 4x44 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL8841 Agilent-014950 Human Genome CGH Microarray 4x44K (Probe Name version)
