TITLE
82-kDa ChAT and SATB1 ChIP-seq after vehicle or amyloid-beta exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we assessed the effects of acute exposure to oligomeric amyloid-beta on 82-kDa ChAT and SATB1 genome association in human SH-SY5Y neural cells, finding that AÎ²-exposure increased 82-kDa ChAT and SATB1 association with gene promoters, introns and matrix attachment regions. We found that both SATB1 and 82-kDa ChAT associate with synapse and cell stress related genes after amyloid-beta exposure.
