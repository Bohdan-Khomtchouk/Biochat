TITLE
Microarray analysis of liver and mammary gland biopsies of dairy cows supplemented with vitamins B9 and B12 alone or in combination

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Data from one animal from B9_B12 group  (Cow 31) were not taken into account for the liver samples Treated animals were compared to control (non supplemented cows)

DESIGN
Twenty four multiparous Holstein cows were assigned to 6 blocks of 4 animals according to their 305-d milk production during the previous lactation to one of the following treatments: injections saline 0.9% NaCl (Ctl); folic acid (B9); vitamin B12 (B12) or folic acid and vitamin B12 (B9_B12). Biopsies of hepatic (foie for liver) and mammary (mam for mammary gland) tissues were taken from these 24 cows. Microarray analyses were performed on samples from both tissues for 3 animals per treatment in CTL, B9 and B9_B12 and for 4 animals in B12 treatment. Data for hepatic tissue of animal 31 (group B9_B12) were not included. For both tissues, treated animals were compared to control.
