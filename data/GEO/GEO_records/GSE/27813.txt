TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression perturbed by Pontin shRNA in MCF7 subjected to normoxic and hypoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the role of Pontin methylation on the expression of hypoxia responsive genes across the whole genome, we performed a microarray analysis from RNAs isolated from MCF7 cells expressing either control shRNA (shNS) or Pontin shRNA(shPontin) in normoxic and hypoxic conditions.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with either non-specific shRNA or Pontin shRNA in replicates. Cells were grown for 24 hours before being exposed to either normoxic (21% Oxygen) or hypoxic condition (1% oxygen) for 6,9 hours. Cells were then lysed and RNA isolated.
