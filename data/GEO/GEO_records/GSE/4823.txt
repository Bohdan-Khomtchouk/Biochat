TITLE
Comparison of normal breast epithelium and stroma from reduction and I.D.C. cases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Histologically normal breast epithelium and stroma were laser capture microdissected from breast reduction specimens and from specimens of invasive ductal carcinoma. The objective of the study was to compare normal reduction tissues to tissues adjacent to I.D.C.  to determine whether adjacent normal tissues contained expression profiles correlated with characteristics of the primary tumor   and to identify markers of normal epithelium and stroma. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
common reference design. 66 samples  replicated twice as dye swaps  generating 132 arrays.
