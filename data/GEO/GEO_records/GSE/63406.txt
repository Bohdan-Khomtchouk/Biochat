TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of wild type and gemin2 mutant plants [cold exposure]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the transcriptional profile (RNA-seq) of wild type and gemin2 Arabidopsis mutants plants exposed to 10ºC for 0, 1 and 24 hours.

DESIGN
WT and gemin2 mutant plants were grown for nine days under continuous white light at 22 degrees centigrades or exposed for 1 or 24 h to 10ºC on the 9th day, before harvesting. Then the transcriptional profile of these plants was analyzed using RNA-seq.
