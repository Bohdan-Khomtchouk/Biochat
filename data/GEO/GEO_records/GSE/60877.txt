TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the fat body of Bombyx mori exposed to phoxim insecticide

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
Transcriptional characteristics of genes in the fat body of domestic silkworms after 24 h exposure to phoxim through whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of fat body in the domestic silkworms comparing control untreated fat body with phoxim-treated fat body Transcription profiling experiments, phoxim-treated fat body (samples) were analyzed. Dual-channel experiments, with test samples labeled by Cy5 and control samples labeled by Cy3. Three Biological replicate. No dye-swaps.

PLATFORM
GPL9527 Silkworm 23K oligo array version 2.0
