TITLE
TGFb dependent Treg conversion and the inhibition of conversion by IL6

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4+ cells activated with anti-CD3 and cultured in the presence of IL2. The effects of TGFb and IL6 on Treg conversion were analyzed to discover methods of inhibiting Treg conversion and/or Treg functional inhibition. CD4+ T-cells were enriched from lymph nodes of Foxp3-GFP mice and cultured under the under the following conditions: 1) anti-CD3+IL2; 2) anti-CD3+IL2+TGFβ; 3) anti-CD3+IL2+TGFβ+IL6; and 4) anti-CD3+IL2+IL6. On day 4 cells were collected, stained with anti-CD4-PE, and sorted into CD4+FOXP3- and CD4+FOXP3+ populations ( > 95% purity). For each treatment condition T-effector cells and Tregs were labeled independently  (either cy3 or cy5) and hybridized together for a two-color array experiment. Each treatment condition had dye swapped replicates, and a minimum of 3 replicate in total.

DESIGN
Two color experiment. Four conditions : 1) anti-CD3+IL2, 3 samples  2) anti-CD3+IL2+TGFβ, 3 samples   3) anti-CD3+IL2+TGFβ+IL6, 4 samples   4) anti-CD3+IL2+IL6, 3 samples
