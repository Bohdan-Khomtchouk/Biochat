TITLE
Transcriptomic profile of Mycobacteriophage Giles

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium phage Giles

SUMMARY
The gene expression during early (30min) and late (2.5hrs) infection of Mycobacteriophage Giles was analyzed, as well as in a Giles lysogen.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated, depleted of rRNA and prepped for sequencing (Illumina) during early and late infection of Giles and a lysogen.
