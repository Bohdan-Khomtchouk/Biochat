TITLE
Analysis of gene expression profile in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-resistant human colon cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the differentially regulated genes in 5-fluorouracil-resnstant human colon cancer cells to discover novel biomarkers involved in 5-FU resistance in colorectal cancer.

DESIGN
The 5-FU resistant colorectal cancer cells were generated using HCT 116 human colon cancer cell line by treatment of cells with increasing concentrations of 5-FU more than 6 months. The basal gene expression profile in parental and 5-FU-resistant cells were analyzed and compared.
