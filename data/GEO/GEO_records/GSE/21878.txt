TITLE
Acquired resistance in M-line Biomphalaria glabrata vs. Sensitized (exposed to irradiated only) and Infected (exposed to viable only) E. paraensei

ORGANISM
Biomphalaria glabrata

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of snails with induced acquired resistance (exposed first to irradiated E. paraensei miricidia) after secondary challenge with viable miricidia. Compared to snails exposed to irradiated miricidia only or to viable miricidia only. Experiments were done over the course of 16 days, with 8 day intervals between sensitization and secondary challenge. Keywords: Dose response

DESIGN
Each replicate is comprised of 5 individual snails from the specified treatment group. Three replicates of each treatment were analyzed on the Snail oligo array.
