TITLE
Notch regulated miRNAs in human T-ALL cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In an attempt to identify miRNAs regulated by oncogenic Notch signaling, we performed miRNA profiling of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells with or without the treatment of Î³-secretase inhibitor (GSI) to block Notch signaling. We found miR-223 levels to increase after GSI treatment suggesting that active Notch signaling represses miR-223 expression. We confirmed insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) to be regulated by miR-223, but were unable to demonstrate functional effects on T-ALL cell growth by overexpression or knock-down of miR-223 alone.
