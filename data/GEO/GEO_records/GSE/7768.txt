TITLE
Expression data from spleens of mice immunized using LPS vs MPL as adjuvant.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An unresolved issue in immunology is the extent to which inflammatory effects are needed for robust T cell responses.  In this study, mice were immunized by iv injection using either high toxicity lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or low toxicity monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) as adjuvant.  Six hours after iv immunization, whole spleens were harvested and gene expression was measured in unfractionated splenic populations of cells.  The analysis indicated that the low toxicity adjuvanticity of MPL was associated with TLR4-mediated signaling that was biased to the TRIF branch of TLR4, while LPS generated balanced MyD88 and TRIF-associated outcomes. Keywords: Treatment comparison

DESIGN
B6.SJL mice adoptively transferred with T cells from B6.OTI and OTII transgenic TCR transgenic were immunized via intravenous injection with ova peptides alone ( " Ova " ), or with LPS ( " OvaLPS " ) or MPL as adjuvant ( " OvaMPL " ).   Six hours after immunization, the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, the spleens were removed and immediately lysed in guanidium chloride, and kept frozen until being used to extract total cellular RNA.  Three mice each were given the indicated treatments, with independent processing and analysis of nine samples total.
