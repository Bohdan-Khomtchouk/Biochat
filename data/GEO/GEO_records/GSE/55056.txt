TITLE
RNA profiling from ovarian FFPE specimens (Nanostring)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study feasibility of gene expression profiling from FFPE tissues using NanoString nCounter platform, we designed a pilot study utilizing samples from ovarian cancer cohort. We selected samples from large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical trials representative of a wide variety of fixation times, block ages and block storage conditions.

DESIGN
five serous carcinoma and six clear cell carcinoma samples with technical replicates

PLATFORM
