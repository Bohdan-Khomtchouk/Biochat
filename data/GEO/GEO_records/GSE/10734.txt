TITLE
SALL4 ChIP-chip using NimbleGen HG18 RefSeq Promoter tiling array (2.7kb)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Increasing studies suggest that SALL4 may play vital roles in leukemogenesis. We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray hybridization as a screening tool to determine potential genes that may account for the role SALL4 plays in leukemogenesis. Analysis of SALL4 binding sites reveals that genes involved in cell death, cancer, DNA replication/repair, and cell cycle were highly enriched (p < 0.05). These genes include 38 important apoptosis-inducing genes (TNF, TP53, PTEN, CARD9, CARD11, CYCS, LTA) and apoptosis-inhibiting genes (Bmi-1, BCL2, XIAP, DAD1, TEGT). Real-time PCR has shown that expression levels of these genes changed significantly after SALL4 knockdown, which ubiquitously led to cell apoptosis. Flow cytometry revealed that reduction of SALL4 expression in NB4 and other leukemia cell lines dramatically increased caspase-3, Annexin V, and DNA fragmentation activity.  Bromodeoxyuridine-incorporation assays showed decreased numbers of S phase cells and increased numbers of G1- and G2- phase cells indicating reduced DNA synthesis, consistent with results from cell proliferation assays.  In addition, NB4 cells that express low levels of SALL4 have significantly decreased tumorigenecity in immunodeficient mice.  Our studies provide a foundation in the development of leukemia stem cell-specific therapy by targeting SALL4. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
The global targets of SALL4 were determined using a NimbleGen promoter tiling array (2.7kb, information below) in the human cell line NB4.  Because SALL4 is thought to play a significant role in leukemogenesis we focused primarily on genes involved in apoptosis and only used the ChIP-chip array as a screening tool to identify potential genes that may bind these genes.  Upon identification and verification of apoptosis genes bound by SALL4 we utilized functional assays to determine the effect of SALL4 on these genes.  In addition, gene expression profiling was used to determine pathways functionally altered by Sall4 reduction.
