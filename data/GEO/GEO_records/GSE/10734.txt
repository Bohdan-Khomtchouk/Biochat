SUMMARY
Increasing studies suggest that SALL4 may play vital roles in leukemogenesis. We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray hybridization as a screening tool to determine potential genes that may account for the role SALL4 plays in leukemogenesis. Analysis of SALL4 binding sites reveals that genes involved in cell death, cancer, DNA replication/repair, and cell cycle were highly enriched (p < 0.05). These genes include 38 important apoptosis-inducing genes (TNF, TP53, PTEN, CARD9, CARD11, CYCS, LTA) and apoptosis-inhibiting genes (Bmi-1, BCL2, XIAP, DAD1, TEGT). Real-time PCR has shown that expression levels of these genes changed significantly after SALL4 knockdown, which ubiquitously led to cell apoptosis. Flow cytometry revealed that reduction of SALL4 expression in NB4 and other leukemia cell lines dramatically increased caspase-3, Annexin V, and DNA fragmentation activity.  Bromodeoxyuridine-incorporation assays showed decreased numbers of S phase cells and increased numbers of G1- and G2- phase cells indicating reduced DNA synthesis, consistent with results from cell proliferation assays.  In addition, NB4 cells that express low levels of SALL4 have significantly decreased tumorigenecity in immunodeficient mice.  Our studies provide a foundation in the development of leukemia stem cell-specific therapy by targeting SALL4. Keywords: ChIP-chip
