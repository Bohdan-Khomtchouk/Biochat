TITLE
mRNA expression signatures of human glioblastoma stem cell like cells after treatment with FG-3019, irradiation and FG-3019 + irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate effects on mRNA expression through treatment with FG-3019, irradiation and their combination to gain mechanistic hypotheses on the effects of these treatments on glioblastoma stem cell like cells which have been observed in vitro and in vivo.

DESIGN
mRNA expression was measured 6 h after treatment with FG-3019, irradiation and their combination. 3 biological replicates were analyzed for each treatment condition (control, FG-3019, irratiation and FG-3019+irradiation)
