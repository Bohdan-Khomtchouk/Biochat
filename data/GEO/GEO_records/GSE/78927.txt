TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of zinc finger transcription factor CASZ1b in neuroblastoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Zinc finger transcriptional factor CASZ1b suppresses neuroblastoma growth. We have generated a tetracycline inducible CASZ1b expression neuroblastoma cell line (SY5YtetCASZ1b), in which CASZ1b has been transfected into SY5Y cells and its expression could be induced by treating the cells with tetracycline. Using gene expression profiling assay for the cells treated with tetracycline (Tet+) or without tetracycline (Tet-), we identified CASZ1b target genes and downstream transcriptional pathways in neuroblastoma cells.

DESIGN
SY5YtetCASZ1b cells were cultured in 6-well plate overnight, then treated with or without 1 Âµg/ml tetracyline for 24 hr. Three independent experiments were performed for microarray analysis
