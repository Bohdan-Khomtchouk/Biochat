TITLE
CGH analysis of UMASS Type A strain

ORGANISM
Clostridium botulinum

SUMMARY
C. botulinum UMASS Type A strain was compared to the ATCC 3502 Type A reference strain.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from the UMASS Type A strain was labled with Cy3 and cohybridzied with Cy5 labeled genomic DNA isolated from the ATCC 3502 Type A strain using a custom comparative genomic hybridization microarray.  Differences in gene content between the were assessed by examining the log2 ratio data of the signal intensities.
