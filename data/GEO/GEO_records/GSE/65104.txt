TITLE
Gene Expression profiles of normal and tumor colon tissues from CDX2; Dmt1+/+/ApcF/+, CDX2; Dmt1F/F/ApcF/+

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the detailed molecular mechanisms for the regulatory role of Dmt1 in colon tumorigenesis, microarray gene expression analysis was performed on normal and tumor colon tissue RNA isolated from 3-month-old CDX2; Dmt1+/+/ApcF/+and CDX2; Dmt1F/F/ApcF/+ mice.

DESIGN
Global gene expression profiling in colon tissue RNAs isolated from 3-month-old CDX2; Dmt1+/+/ApcF/+ (n=7; shah038, normal; shah040, tumor) and CDX2; Dmt1F/F/ApcF/+ (n=4; shah039, normal; shah041, tumor).
