TITLE
Transcriptome data of pears treated with Meyerozyma guilliermondii and sterile distilled water

ORGANISM
Pyrus x bretschneideri

SUMMARY
Meyerozyma guilliermondii, which was isolated from pears by our laboratory, M. guilliermondii had a significant effect on the induction of several defense-related genes compared to the control. It revealed the defense response mechanism of pears by transcriptomics, and investigated the function of more defense-related genes in pears.

DESIGN
Pears treated with sterile distilled water (CK) and pears treated with Meyerozyma guilliermondii (Y)

PLATFORM
GPL24323 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Pyrus x bretschneideri)
