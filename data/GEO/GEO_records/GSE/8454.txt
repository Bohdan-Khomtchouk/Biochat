TITLE
Changes in gene expression in kidneys from Glis2-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Glis2 is a member of the Gli-similar (Glis) subfamily of Kruppel-like zinc finger transcription factors. To obtain insights into the physiological functions of Glis2, mice deficient in Glis2 expression were generated. These mutant mice develop progressive renal disease associated with fibrosis and inflammation. Gene expression profiles were examined to identify changes in gene expression at early stages of progressive renal disease in Glis2 mutant mice. Keywords: Glis2, kidney, fibrosis, nephropathy, inflammation

DESIGN
To analyze changes in gene expression, microarray analysis was performed using RNA from kidneys of PND25 and PND60 wild type and Glis2-mutant mice. Gene expression profiles were compared between kidneys of PND25 wt and Glis2 mutant mice and between PND60 wt and Glis2 mutants. RNA from three kidneys were pooled. RNA from two independent experiments was used and each microarray analysis was performed in duplicate.
