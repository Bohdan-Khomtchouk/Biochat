TITLE
The activation of IL-1-induced enhancers depends on TAK1 kinase activity and NF-kappaB p65 II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The inflammatory gene response requires activation of the protein kinase TAK1, but it is currently unknown how TAK1-derived signals coordinate transcriptional programs in the genome. We determined the genome-wide binding of the TAK1-controlled NF-κB subunit p65 in relation to active enhancers and promoters of transcribed genes by ChIP-seq experiments. Out of 35,000 active enhancer regions, 410 H3K4me1-positive enhancers show interleukin (IL)-1-induced H3K27ac and p65 binding. Inhibition of TAK1, IKK2 or depletion of p65 blocked inducible enhancer activation and gene expression. As exemplified by the CXC chemokine cluster located on chromosome 4, the TAK1-p65 pathway also regulates the recruitment kinetics of the histone acetyltransferase CBP, of NF-κB p50 and of AP-1 transcription factors to both, promoters and enhancers. This study provides a high resolution view of epigenetic changes occurring during the IL-1 response and allows the first genome-wide identification of a novel class of inducible p65 NF-κB-dependent enhancers in epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Two sets of experiments were performed as biological replicate series (rep1 and rep2) each comprising 5 dual-color microarray hybridizations. The two series were performed with inverted Cy-Dye allocation (Dye-swap). Human epithelial KB cells were treated with Interleukin-1-alpha (10ng/µl) for 0.5h, 1h, 3h or 24h, or, were left untreated. An individual set of samples was treated identically with IL1a but after an initial preincubation for 1h with PD98059 (50 micromol/l). Each dual-color microarray represents a direct comparison of samples preincubated or not with PD98059.
