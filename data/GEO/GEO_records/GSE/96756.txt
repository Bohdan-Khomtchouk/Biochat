TITLE
Comparative gene expression analysis of Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 in planktonic and biofilm states

ORGANISM
Porphyromonas gingivalis

SUMMARY
The aim of the present study was to compare the genome-wide transcription activities of P.gingivalis under both states, as biofilm and as planktonic growth, using microarray technology.

DESIGN
P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 was incubated in multiwell culture plates at 37ÂºC for 96 hours in anaerobic conditions using an in vitro static model to to develop both the planktonic and biofilm states (the latter over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs). After incubation, the bacterial cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted, treated with DNase-I, and purified. Three biological replicates for each cell state were independently hybridized for transcriptomic comparison.
