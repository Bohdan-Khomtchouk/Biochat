TITLE
Loss of HSulf-1 promotes altered lipid metabolism in ovarian cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Loss of HSulf-1 potentially contributes to the metabolic alterations associated with the progression of ovarian pathogenesis, specifically impacting the lipogenic phenotype of ovarian cancer cells that can be therapeutically targeted

DESIGN
This study was carried out using human samples in triplicates, and were grown in three different cultures - Sh1, Sh2 and NTC
