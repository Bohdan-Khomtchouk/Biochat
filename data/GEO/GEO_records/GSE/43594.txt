TITLE
Genome-wide localization of Smc1, Smc3 and CTCF in mouse B cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) is initiated by the transcription-coupled recruitment of activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) to switch regions and by the subsequent generation and resolution of dsDNA breaks (DSBs). During, CSR the IgH locus undergoes dynamic three-dimensional structural changes in which promoters, enhancers and switch regions are brought to close proximity. Nevertheless, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Here we show that during CSR, AID associates with subunits of cohesin, a complex previously implicated in DNA repair and in the formation of DNA loops between enhancers and promoters. By ChIP-Seq experiments, we find that Cohesin is dynamically recruited to the IgH locus during CSR and that knockdown of Cohesin or its regulatory subunits results in impaired CSR and abnormal DSB resolution. Our results are consistent with a model in which Cohesin controls the formation of long-range DNA loops at the IgH locus and the resolution of DSBs generated during CSR.

DESIGN
Smc1, Smc3 and CTCF were immunoprecipitated from resting or in vitro activated B cells.
