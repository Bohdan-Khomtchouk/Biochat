SUMMARY
Identification of miRNA expression profile CD3+T lymphocytes

DESIGN
To address the role of miRNAs in the differentiation of pro-inflammatory γδ T cell subsets, we compared the ex vivo miRNA expression profile of highly purified CD27+ (γδ27+) and CD27- CCR6+ ( γδ27-) γδ T cells isolated from pooled lymph nodes and spleen of naïve C57BL/6J mice.

PLATFORM
