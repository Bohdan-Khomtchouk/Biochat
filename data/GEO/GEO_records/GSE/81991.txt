TITLE
Transcriptionally Driven DNA Replication Programme of the Human Parasite Leishmania major

ORGANISM
Leishmania major strain Friedlin

SUMMARY
Faithful inheritance of the large eukaryotic genomes requires the orchestrated activation of multiple DNA replication origins. Although origin activation is mechanistically conserved among eukaryotes, how replication origins are specified and selected for activation in each S-phase seem to differ across the model systems studied. Here we provide a complete analysis of the nucleosomal landscape and replication programme of the human parasite Leishmania major, building on a better evolutionary understanding of replication organization in Eukarya. We found that active transcription is a driving force for the nucleosomal organization of L. major genome, and that both the spatial and the temporal programme of DNA replication can be explained as associated to RNA polymerase kinetics, without the need to invoke specific regulatory mechanisms. This simple scenario likely provides these organisms with the flexibility and robustness to deal with the continuous environmental changes that impose alterations in their genetic programmes during their parasitic life cycle stages. Our findings also suggest that coupling replication initiation to transcription elongation could be an ancient solution used by eukaryotic cells for origin maintenance

DESIGN
Replication intitiation sites were defined using two replicates of short nascent strands of increasing sizes (F4 and F5) purified through three rounds of Lambda-exonuclease digestion, and a genomic DNA control (Ctrl). Nucleosome landscape was determined using two replicates of mononucleosomal-DNA derived from MNase-digested chromatin
