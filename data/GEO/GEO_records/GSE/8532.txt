TITLE
Effect pck or ppc expression on intracellular ATP

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Up-regulation of motility genes and biosynthesis genes were found in the pck expressing high ATP cell by transcriptome analysis while catabolism genes were down-regulated. Keywords: response depends on intracellular ATP concentration derived by pck or ppc overexpression

DESIGN
1. pck or ppc overexpressing E. coli at early log phase using glucose-minimal medium 2. pck or ppc overexpressing E. coli at chemostat culture (D=0.1 h-1)using LB-glucose medium

PLATFORM
GPL5482 Escherichia coli 5K oligo microarray
