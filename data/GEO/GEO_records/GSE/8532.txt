TITLE
Effect pck or ppc expression on intracellular ATP

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Up-regulation of motility genes and biosynthesis genes were found in the pck expressing high ATP cell by transcriptome analysis while catabolism genes were down-regulated. Keywords: response depends on intracellular ATP concentration derived by pck or ppc overexpression
