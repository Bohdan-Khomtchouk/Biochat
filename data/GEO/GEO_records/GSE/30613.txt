TITLE
[E-MTAB-549] Neospora caninum RNAseq

ORGANISM
Neospora caninum

SUMMARY
Recent advances in high throughput sequencing methodologies allow the opportunity to probe in depth the transcriptomes of organisms including N. caninum. In this project, we are using Illumina sequencing technology to analyze the transcriptome (RNA-Seq) of experimentally accessible stages (e.g. tachyzoites at different times points) of N. caninum NCLiv. The aim is to make transcriptional landscape maps at different time points at different life cycle stages of N. caninum and compare it with equivalent datasets from the closely related parasite Toxoplasma gondii.
