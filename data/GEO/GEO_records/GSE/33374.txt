TITLE
Expression data from healthy human CD161++CD8aa and CD161++CD8ab T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to compare gene expression between healthy human CD161++CD8aa and CD161++CD8ab T cells.

DESIGN
We sorted freshly obtained peripheral blood mononucleocytes from healthy controls by first using magnetic beads to negatively select for CD8a+ T cells, fluorescently labelling isolated cells with antibodies and subsequent sorting using MoFlow MLS cell sorter (DAKO). Sorted samples were snap frozen. RNA was later extracted from the sorted populations prior to hybridization to Affymetrix arrays.
