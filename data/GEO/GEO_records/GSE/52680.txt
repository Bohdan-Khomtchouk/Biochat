TITLE
m6A RNA modification controls cell fate transition in mouse embryonic stem cells (gene expression analysis)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we determine the map of RNA methylation (m6A) in mouse embryonic stem cells, and embryoid bodies.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis: To establish the impact of METTL3 loss of function on gene expression in mESC. RNA hybridized to GeneChip Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array

PLATFORM
GPL6193 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
