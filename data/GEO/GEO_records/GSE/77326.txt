TITLE
Expression analysis of bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model lung tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model lung tissue, compared to the Sham group.

DESIGN
Male C57 BL/6 mice (18 g, 6-8 wk) were earmarked before grouping and then were randomly separated into groups by an independent person. To generate mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis, mice were anesthetized with 50 mg/kg pentobarbital i.p. (Merk). Using an insulin syringe, 0.050 ml LPS-free saline clinical grade Bleomycin (Nippon Kayaku) (3.0 U/kg) was directly injected into the trachea. Sham group mice received H2O by the same surgery procedure. Lung tissues were obtained at 21 day after bleomycin injured. RNA samples were obtained from 6 Sham group mice lung tissues and 6 Bleomycin instilled mice lung tissues. Each sample was measured the expression level of 44,170 genes.
