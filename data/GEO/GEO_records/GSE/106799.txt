TITLE
Propofol alters the mRNA profile in the developing mouse hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Propofol has been found to be toxic to developing neurons.  The goal of the current study was to nominate novel genes predicted to underly the neurotoxicity, and use these candidates for future functional pathway assessment

DESIGN
7 day old mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 50mg/kg propofol or 50mg/kg intralipid vehicle control, with a total exposure of 3h.  This was followed by a 3h washout.  Mice were sacrificed, hippocampal tissues were collected, and RNA was extracted prior to profiling.

PLATFORM
GPL24261 Agilent-055750 Mus musculus custom microarray
