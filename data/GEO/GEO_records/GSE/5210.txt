TITLE
Effects of the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) protein on gene expression in Bacillus subtilis

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
We monitored changes in Bacillus subtilis global gene expression in response to deletion or disruption of smc or ftsY. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
We extracted RNA, reverse transcribed, labeled, and co-hybridized samples to arrays containing PCR products amplified from > 99% of B. subtilis genes. We performed at least three independent replicates of each experiment.
