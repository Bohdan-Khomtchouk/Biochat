TITLE
Expression Profiling of Retinal Detachment and Accelerated Re-attachment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retinal detachment is a major cause of blindness due to penetrating trauma and ocular inflammation, and is often observed in many patients following cataract extraction surgery.  When the retinal photoreceptors detach from their epithelium, stress signals and apoptotic pathways are initiated that will lead to loss of vision, however accelerating the reattachment of these cells can prevent photoreceptor death and subsequent vision loss.  To determine the genes involved in this process, we performed a microarray screen using a mouse model or retinal detachment in conjunction with a P2Y2 agonist previously demonstrated to hasten retinal reattachment. Keywords: disease state analysis and therapeutic analysis

DESIGN
We conducted a microarray screen to identify genes involved in promoting faster resolution of retinal detachment.  Subretinal detachment was induced in Balb/cJ mice by subretinal injection of 1 uL saline or delivery of 1 uL of 10uM INS37217/Saline to cause detachment and expedite the rate of recovery.  We performed this study at three timepoints: 2 hrs post-injection to identify early response genes; 24 hrs post-detachment when the retina has reattached, but still grossly misfolded; and 7 days post-detachment when the misfolding has been resolved, but retinal function is merely 50% of wild-type function.  We used each RNA pool (each containing > 5 retinas) for GeneChip hybridization giving a total of 3 biological replicates for each treatment at each timepoint.  For each GeneChip, we labeled 7 ug of total RNA according to the manufacturerâ€™s specifications (Affymetrix Inc.).
