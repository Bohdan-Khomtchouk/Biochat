TITLE
Expression Profiling of Retinal Detachment and Accelerated Re-attachment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retinal detachment is a major cause of blindness due to penetrating trauma and ocular inflammation, and is often observed in many patients following cataract extraction surgery.  When the retinal photoreceptors detach from their epithelium, stress signals and apoptotic pathways are initiated that will lead to loss of vision, however accelerating the reattachment of these cells can prevent photoreceptor death and subsequent vision loss.  To determine the genes involved in this process, we performed a microarray screen using a mouse model or retinal detachment in conjunction with a P2Y2 agonist previously demonstrated to hasten retinal reattachment. Keywords: disease state analysis and therapeutic analysis
