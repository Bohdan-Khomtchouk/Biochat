TITLE
Hyperoxic lung injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nrf2 is a transcription factor that binds to antioxidant response elements of the regulatory region of a number of antioxidant genes.  A mutation in the Nrf2 gene increases susceptibility to hyperoxic lung injury.  This project examines expression differences between wild type and Nrf2 knock out mice with the hope of providing insight to the downstream effector genes regulated by Nrf2. Keywords: other
