TITLE
mRNA expression analysis in mock and cgh-1(RNAi) animals

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To determine mRNA expression levels in mock and cgh-1(RNAi) animals, RNA was purified from young adult worms, using Trizol.

DESIGN
A total of 6 samples was analyzed (triplicates of mock and cgh-1(RNAi) animals respectively)
