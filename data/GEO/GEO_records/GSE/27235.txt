TITLE
Mutations in cohesin-associated genes impair protein translation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The cohesin protein complex is well known for playing a role in chromosome segregation. However, it has additional less understood roles in transcription, DNA repair, and chromosome condensation. Mutants in two yeast orthologues (Eco1 and Scc2) of human cohesinopathy disease alleles were examined by transcriptional profiling in response to perturbation of the transcriptional program by amino acid starvation.

DESIGN
Two cohesin mutants were compared to wt in a time course of amino acid starvation consisting of 4 time points, 3 replicates of each, for a total of 36 samples.
