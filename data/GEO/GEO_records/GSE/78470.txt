TITLE
small RNA-seq from HT1080 (ENCSR855CYO)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from nuclear fractions of a fibrosarcoma immortalized cell line HT1080 derived from the connective tissue from a 35 year old male. They are stranded SE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted TAP pretreated RNA < 200 nucleotides in size.
