TITLE
Genomic mapping of E2F3 and E2F4 binding sites in neurospheres

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neural precursor cells from the ganglionic eminence at E14.5 were isolated and cultured as neurospheres. E2F3 and E2F4 genomic binding sites are mapped by ChIP-on-Chip on wild type or mutant cells.

DESIGN
All cells used in this study were cultured as neurospheres. Neural precursors were obtained by dissection of the ganglionic eminence from developing embryos at gestational age E14.5 from either wild type mice or germline E2f3a and E2f3b deficient mice, and cells were cultured as neurospheres. 3 independent biological replicates were used for each experiment. The customized microarray design counts approximately 1 million probes covering the proximal promoter of most mouse genes.
