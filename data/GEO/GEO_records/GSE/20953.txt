TITLE
Expression data from broiler chickens in response to the combined stressors of catching, transport and slaughter

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The process of commercial catching, transport and slaughter (CTS) is known to be an acute stressful event in broiler chickens. Corticosteroid concentrations increase, impacting measures of IGF-1, growth hormone and metabolites of the immune system from blood plasma samples. We used ARK-Genomics chicken 20K oligo array, a two channel DNA microarray, to investigate the significantly differentially expressed genes in the livers of chickens during CTS.

DESIGN
We investigate the differences of gene expression profiles in hepatic tissues between control birds (n=10) and birds experiencing CTS (n=10) using an ARK-Genomics chicken 20K oligo array, a two channel DNA array ( http://www.ark-genomics.orgmicroarray ) with full dye swap.

PLATFORM
GPL10227 ARK-Genomics G. gallus 20K v2 (single gene version)
