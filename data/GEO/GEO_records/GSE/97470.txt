TITLE
Expression data from control or rat Giver knock-down cells treated w/o Ang II for 3 hours

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Giver is a novel lncRNA found to be upregulated by Ang II stimulation in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (RVSMCs). The regulatory mechanisms of rat Giver has not been reported so far. We used microarrays to detail Giver-mediated global gene expression and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
RVSMCs were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic digestion and cultured for 2 passages before treatment. Cells were transfected with either non-targeting control siRNA (siNTC) or rat Giver siRNA for 48 hours, and then treated with either 100 nM of Angiotensin II or equivalent volume of 1x PBS for 3 hours.
