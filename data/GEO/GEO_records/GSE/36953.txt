TITLE
Gene expression profiles of triple-negative breast cancer cells under the condition of 3D proliferation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and is the most lethal and aggressive subtype of breast cancer. However, the genes which relate to promote tumor aggressiveness in TNBC remain unclear. In order to investigate specific genes and pathways involved in TNBC tumorigenesis, we compared genes differentially expressed between 3D cultures (3DC) or tumor xenograft models and control two-dimensional cultures (2DC).

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from the TNBC cells under the condition of 2DC, 3DC and tumor xenograft models, and applied to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.
