TITLE
Depot dependent effects of dexamethasone on gene expression in human omental and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissues from obese women.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify transcripts regulated by dexamethasone in omental (Om) and abdominal subcutaneous (Abdsc) adipose tissues of severely obese females obtained during elective surgeries. Minced tissue was treated with Dexamethasone in organ culture for 7 days as previously described (Lee et al, Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. 2011 Mar;300(3):E571-80).

DESIGN
3 samples of Abdsc cultures and Om from the same individual was cultured in the presence of 0.7 nM insulin plus 0,1,10 or 1000 nM Dexamethasone.  Adipose tissue from subject A was similtaneously cultured with 200 nM cortisol.  Sample A is from one subject, Sample B and C are pooled from two different subjects each.
