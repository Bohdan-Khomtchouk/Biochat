SUMMARY
Immunological Genome Project ATAC-seq data.  Immune cell populations were isolated in high-purity by flow cytometry.

DESIGN
Immune cell populations were isolated in high-purity by flow cytometry according to ImmGen SOP ( https://www.immgen.org/ ). 10,000 cells (except some rare cell populations) were used to construct each ATAC-seq library. Libraries were dual-indexed and pooled for NGS analysis. -------------------------------------- Immunological Genome Project Consortium
