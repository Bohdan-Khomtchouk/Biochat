TITLE
Methylation profiles of Human kidney tubules

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epigenetic information in the human kidneys is yet to be studied. In this work, we collected 26 human kidney samples and profiled the genome-wide cytosine methylation patterns using HELP assay.

DESIGN
We sought to decrease the cell type heterogeneity of kidney tissues to increase the resolution of methylation profiles. To that end, microdissected human kidney tissue are used for the HELP-assay (HpaII tiny fragment Enrichment by Ligation-mediated PCR) and hybridization on Roche NimbleGen microarrays.
