TITLE
Gene Expression of Breast Cancer Cell Lines Across Biomaterial Platforms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
2 Breast Cancer Cell lines were seeded onto TCPS, on 2D PEG-PC gels, and encapsulated in 3D PEG-Maleimide  gels as single cells or spheroids to determine transcript level changes based on culture platform

DESIGN
Examination of transriptome data of 2 cell lines in several biomaterial platforms

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
