TITLE
Targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis Sensitivity to Thiol Stress at Acidic pH Kills the Bacterium and Potentiates Antibiotics

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to characterize the mechanism of action of the small molecule AC2P36

DESIGN
Mtb strain CDC1551 was grown at 37ºC in T-25 vented, standing tissue culture flasks in 8 mL of buffered 7H9 medium (pH 7.0 or 5.7) lacking catalase to an OD600 of 0.5. Cultures were subsequently treated with 10 µM AC2P36. For the control, cultures treated with an equal amount of DMSO.  Following a 4 h incubation period, total bacterial RNA was extracted, quality controlled and sequenced. Each treatment was repeated with two independent (biological) replicates.
