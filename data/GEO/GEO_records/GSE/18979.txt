TITLE
pad4 vs. pad4 est1b

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to identify transcripts which are changed in plants deficient for evolutionary conserved EST1B gene. A mutation in est1b leads to a constitutive up-regulation of a PAD4-dependent pathogen response pathway. To eliminate secondary effects of the constitutive pathogen response in est1b mutants we will analyze transcriptoms in plants in which lack PAD4. Keywords: Expression profilling by array

DESIGN
6 samples were used in this experiment
