TITLE
miRNA expression profile of SCLC cell lines vs. normal lung

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aim: To determine the miRNA expression profile of SCLC cell lines vs. normal lung tissue. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from SCLC cell lines H69, HTB-172, HTB-173 and HTB-184 were compared to a mixed RNA sample derived from 6 normal lung tissue samples (fresh surgical material), from 6 tumor-free patients.  The same reference sample (normal lung) was used on all 4 microarrays.
