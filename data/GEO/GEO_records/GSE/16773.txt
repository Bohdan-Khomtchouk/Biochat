TITLE
Gene expression response of Populus tremuloides cell suspension cultures to methyl jasmonate feeding

ORGANISM
Populus tremuloides

SUMMARY
Gene expression response of Populus cell cultures subjected to methyl jasmonate feeding was analyzed using the Affymetrix poplar genome microarrays. Keywords: Stress response

DESIGN
Populus tremuloides suspension cells were treated with methyl jasmonate (MJ) in DMSO or with DMSO alone (C).  Cells were harvested after 48 hours.  Two biological replicates were obtained for each condition.
