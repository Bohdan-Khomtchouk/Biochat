TITLE
Epigenome analysis of white blood cells from healthy women with and without BRCA1 mutation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in white blood cells from women with and without BRCA1 mutation. Whole blood samples were drawn from 30 BRCA1 mutation carriers (15 women with breast cancer and 15 healthy women with mean age 57.2) and 30 females without BRCA1 mutation (15 breast cancers and 15 healthy with mean age 57.1). All samples were collected between 2001 and 2008. The samples were drawn from women attending the General Faculty Hospital in Prague and the complete coding sequence, intron-exon junctions and large rearrangements for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were tested.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 60 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
