TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Imatinib and PD166326 resistant cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A comparison between parental K562 cells (CML) and two clones derived from this cell line : ImaR and PDR which are resistant against Imatinib mesylate and PD166326 respectively , two inhibitors of BCR-ABL. Keywords: gene expression, comparison

DESIGN
Six dual channel Samples compared in all combinations, PDR vs. K562, K562 vs. ImaR, ImaR vs K562, PDR vs ImaR, ImaR vs PDR, K562 vs PDR.
