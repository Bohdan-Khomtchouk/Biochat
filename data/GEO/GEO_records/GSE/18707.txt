TITLE
Expression data from mouse lung treated with MACA, BSA or HBSS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesize that there is a set of differentially-expressed gene “biomarkers” that distinguishes the immune response associated with the induction of allergic sensitization from non-allergic immune responsiveness following a single exposure. The goal of this preliminary study was to identify potential biomarkers that differentiate the response to allergens vs non-allergens following an acute exposure in naïve individuals. We evaluated the gene transcriptional responses of mouse lungs following a single exposure to agents of high or low allergenicity or vehicle control.

DESIGN
Female BALB/c mice received a single intratracheal aspiration exposure to Metarhizium anisopliae crude antigen (MACA) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) or HBSS alone.  RNA was isolated from lung tissue of 3-4 biological replicates from each treatment group at 3h and 12h post-treatment.
