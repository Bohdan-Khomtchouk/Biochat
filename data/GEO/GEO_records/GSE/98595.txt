TITLE
Cabergoline-treated lutein granulosa cells from polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients exhibit higher transcriptomic response than cabergoline-treated controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study assessed the transcriptomic profiles of lutein granulosa cells (LGCs) from women with and without PCOS using Affymetrix microarray chips to provide novel information about the molecular changes that occur in these cells when they are treated with a D2-ag (Cb2) and to assess the signal transduction pathways regulated by this treatment. Transcriptomic analysis, using Affimetrix Human 1.0ST. GeneChip Microarray was functionally analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and network modeling with system biology perspective.

DESIGN
This is a paired design that compared no treatment to treatment with Cb2 using LGCs from non-PCOS (controls, n=3) and PCOS patients (n=3) selected according to the Rotterdam criteria. LGCs from each patient were cultured with or without Cb2. Groups were designated Cu: control untreated (n=3), Ct: control treated (n=3), Pu: PCOS untreated (n=3), and Pt: PCOS treated (n=3). Transcriptomic analysis was performed with the 12 samples and 4 extra technical replicates (n=16).
