TITLE
ChIP-seq for SMARCE1 and SMARCC1 in non-invasive and invasive HMLE-Twist-ER cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We find that in invasive HMLE-Twist-ER cells, SMARCE1 binds to ILF3 and is localized to ILF motifs. In contrast, ILF motifs were not enriched at SMARCE1-bound sites in noninvasive HMLE-Twist-ER cells or at SMARCC1-bound sites.

DESIGN
Performing ChIP-Seq on HMLE-Twist-ER cells +/- 125 nM 4-OHT

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
