TITLE
Response of ethanologenic E coli strains LY180 and EMFR9 to furfural

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The data explore the transcriptional response of strain LY180 and the furfural-resistant derivative EMFR9 to 0.5 g/L furfural LY180 and EMFR9 and differences in their expression profiles are described in Miller, E. N., L. R. Jarboe, L. P. Yomano, S. W. York, K. T. Shanmugam, and L. O. Ingram. 2009. Silencing of NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase genes (yqhD and dkgA) in furfural-resistant ethanologenic Escherichia coli. Appl Environ Microbiol 75:4315-23.  The response of LY180 to furfural is described in Miller, E. N., L. R. Jarboe, P. C. Turner, P. Pharkya, L. P. Yomano, S. W. York, D. Nunn, K. T. Shanmugam, and L. O. Ingram. 2009. Furfural Inhibits Growth by Limiting Sulfur Assimilation in Ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain LY180. Appl Environ Microbiol., 2009.

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from cultures of LY180 and EMFR9 immediately before and 15 min after addition of furfural to 0.5 g/L.  The Nimblegen TI83333 chip measures expression of 4,237 genes, with 5 replicates, and 18 probes average per gene. Data from replicate 1 (OID 8641) and replicate 2 (OID 14117) was analyzed independently.
