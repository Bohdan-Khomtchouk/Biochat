TITLE
Genome wide host gene expression analysis in Mice infected with Pasteurella multocida

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using microarray technology, we aim to identify the host gene expression for understanding the cross talk of signaling pathways that leads to the death of mice under P.multocida infection.

DESIGN
Liver, spleen and lung were collected at the onset(6h) and late(18h) stages of P.multocida infection to identify the global gene expression changes vis - a - vis the control in the host

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
