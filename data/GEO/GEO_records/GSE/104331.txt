TITLE
Precise modulation of genome functions and live tracking of genome regions in CRISPR/dCas9 knockin mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we demonstrated ex vivo and in vivo validation of dCas9 KI functions such as transcription

DESIGN
live mRNA profiles of wild type (WT) and SunTag-dCas9 mice were generated by deep sequencing.Myod1 actived and control live mRNA profiles of SunTag-dCas9 mice were generated by deep sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
