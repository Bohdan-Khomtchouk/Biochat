TITLE
Identification of microRNAs specifically expressed in HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Several studies have investigated the association of miRNAs with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but the data are not univocal. Methods: We performed a microarray study of miRNAs in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated HCC and other liver diseases and healthy conditions. Results and Conclusions: The simultaneous comparison of different liver diseases and normal livers allowed the identification of 18 miRNAs exclusively expressed in HCV-associated HCC, with sensitivity and specificity values of diagnostic-grade.

DESIGN
A total number of 76 liver specimens obtained from 43 patients were analyzed: 26 liver specimens obtained from 10 patients with HCV-associated HCC, including 9 specimens from the tumor area (HCC) and 17 specimens from the surrounding non-tumorous tissue affected by cirrhosis (HCC-CIR); 18 specimens from 10 patients with HCV-associated cirrhosis without HCC (CIR); 13 specimens from 4 patients with HBV-associated acute liver failure (ALF); 12 specimens from 12 liver donors (LD); and 7 from normal liver of 7 subjects who underwent hepatic resection for liver angioma (NL).
