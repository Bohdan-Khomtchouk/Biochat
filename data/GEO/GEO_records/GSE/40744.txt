TITLE
Identification of microRNAs specifically expressed in HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Background: Several studies have investigated the association of miRNAs with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but the data are not univocal. Methods: We performed a microarray study of miRNAs in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated HCC and other liver diseases and healthy conditions. Results and Conclusions: The simultaneous comparison of different liver diseases and normal livers allowed the identification of 18 miRNAs exclusively expressed in HCV-associated HCC, with sensitivity and specificity values of diagnostic-grade.
