TITLE
A signature predicting poor prognosis in gastric and ovarian cancer represents a coordinated macrophage and stromal-response.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide mRNA expression profiling of 94 gastric tumours derived from Australian based cohort was performed. . From this data we identified a cluster of co-expressed genes termed the stromal response cluster which almost perfectly differentiates tumor from its non-malignant gastric tissue and hence can be regarded as a highly tumor-specific gene expression signature.  We show that these genes are consistently co-expressed across a range of independent gastric datasets as well as other cancer types suggesting a conserved functional role in cancer.

DESIGN
Profiling of 94 primary gastric tumors on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. All tumors were collected with approvals from Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, Australia; the Research Ethics Review Committee; and signed informed patient consent.
