TITLE
Molecular effects of capsaicin on human gingival epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to explain the molecular mechanisms of capsaicin-induced proliferation of gingival epithelial cells (GECs), a microarray analysis was performed. Several cell proliferation related genes were significantly up-regulated. These data suggest that TRPV1 signaling in GEC may induce transcriptional upregulation of growth factors, which results in an increased proliferation rate.

DESIGN
Simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen-immortalized human gingival epithelial cell line, epi4, were stimulated with 1 Î¼M capsaicin for 4 hours. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to gene expression analysis using Agilent whole human genome oligo microarray.
