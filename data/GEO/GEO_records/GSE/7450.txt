TITLE
Expression analysis of Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 delta-ungD1 delta-ungD2

ORGANISM
Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 delta-ungD1 delta-ungD2 double mutant compared to the wild-type strain. Keywords: expression analysis

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures of Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 and three separate cultures of a double mutant strain, Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 delta-ungD1 delta-ungD2, in which ungD1 (BF1706) and ungD2 (BF2848) are deleted.  Each chip measures the expression level of 4,302 genes from Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 and the associated plasmid pBF9343 with fourteen 24-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
