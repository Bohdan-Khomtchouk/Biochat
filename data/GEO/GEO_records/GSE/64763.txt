TITLE
Expression data from normal myometrium, leiomyomata, and leiomyosarcomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The molecular etiology of uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULMS) is poorly understood, which accounts for the wide disparity in outcomes among women with this disease.  We examined and compared the molecular profiles of ULMS, fibroids, and normal myometrium (NL) to identify clinically relevant molecular subtypes.  RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix U133A 2.0 transcription microarrays.  Differentially expressed genes and pathways were identified using standard methods.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from frozen tissues and hybridized to microarrays.  Unsupervised and supervised analyses were performed using standard methods.
