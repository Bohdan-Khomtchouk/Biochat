TITLE
Comparison of Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus 39E grown on different xylose concentrations

ORGANISM
Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus ATCC 33223

SUMMARY
Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus 39E was grown on 10, 50 and 200 mM xylose in order to identify pathways and transporters responsible for xylose transport and conversion to ethanol.

DESIGN
In this study, 39E cells were grown in difeined medium supplemented with 10, 50 or 200 mM xylose as the sole carbon substrate. Each sample was harvested at mid-log phase.  Each sample was run in triplicate using genomic DNA as the control.
