TITLE
Response of liver-expressed genes (including lincRNAs) to continuous growth hormone (GH) infusion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in livers of adult male mice subjected to continuous GH infusion using Alzet osmotic minipumps for 1, 4 or 7 days was assayed by RNA-seq, as part of a study of growth hormone regulation of hepatic lincRNAs (PMID:26459762) and protein-coding genes (PMID:28694329).

DESIGN
RNA isolated from livers obtained from untreated male mice, or from male mice subjected to continuous GH tratment for 1, 4 or 7 days were prepared and used for unstranded RNA-seq.
