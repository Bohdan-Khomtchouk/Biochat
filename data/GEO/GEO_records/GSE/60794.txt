TITLE
Solar simulated ultraviolet radiation induces histone 3 methylation changes in the gene promoters of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3 in primary human dermal fibroblasts [I]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Skin damage from solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) accumulates in the dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) and contributes to photoaging. Following UVR exposure, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are secreted by dermal fibroblasts to repair and remodel the ECM. Molecular signaling pathways delineating the induction of MMPs are currently well-defined; however, the effects of UV exposure on epigenetic mechanisms of MMP induction are not as well understood. An epigenetic mechanism would further describe how MMP genes are regulated in response to UV. In this study, we examined solar simulated UVR (ssUVR)-induced gene expression changes and alterations to histone methylation in the promoters of MMP1 and MMP3 in primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDF). This set of gene expression data was generated to identify photoaging related genes (including MMP) that were impacted by ssUVR exposure in our system.

DESIGN
Primary neonatal human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) were irradiated a single time with 0, 4, or 12 J/cm2 ssUVR. The sham treatments are negative controls (0 J/cm2 ssUVR). The cells were collected for gene expression analysis 24 hours after exposure. Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays were used to characterize gene expression pattern alterations in response to ssUVR.
