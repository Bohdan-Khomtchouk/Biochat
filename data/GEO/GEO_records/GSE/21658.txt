TITLE
Circadian regulation of gene expression in the coral algal endosymbiosis

ORGANISM
Acropora millepora

SUMMARY
Despite their early evolutionary divergence, reef-building corals exhibit complex circadian responses to diurnal, lunar and annual changes in the conditions around them. Understanding circadian regulation in reef-building corals is, however, complicated by the presence of photosynthetic endosymbionts that have a profound physiochemical influence on the intracellular environment. How corals tune their animal-based clock machinery to respond to external cues while at the same time responding to internal physiological changes imposed by the symbiont is not clear. We explore this issue using microarray analysis to dissect genes governed directly by the circadian machinery from those responding indirectly as a consequence of changing internal oxygen tensions.

DESIGN
Three coral colonies were sampled at 4 hr intervals during two consecutive days under an ambient light/dark (LD) cycle and under constant darkness (DD). In total 72 arrays were hybridized, as each array represented a sample from a treatment and a time point (n=3).
