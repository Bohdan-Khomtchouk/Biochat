TITLE
Trophoblast giant cell underrepresentation (tiling)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We profiled trophoblast stem cell replication-timing in order to compare these data to our data on underrepresented (UR) domainss in trophoblast giant cells (polyploid cells derived from 2N trophoblast stem cells).  We found that UR domains are formed from late-replicating regions in tropoblast stem cells.

DESIGN
Profile of early and late replicating regions in cultured trophoblast stem cells.
