TITLE
Effects of lactoferrin, sophorolipids and lactoferrin-sophorolipids-assembly on gene expression of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFn)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is investigate effects of lactoferrin on human dermal fibroblasts and if sophorolipids influence effects of lactoferrin on human dermal fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Human dermal fibroblasts (HDFn) were treated with lactoferrin, sophorolipids or lactoferrin-sophorolipids-assebly for 24 hours. Total RNA was isolated for microarray assays.
