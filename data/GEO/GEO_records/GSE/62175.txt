TITLE
Mastermind-like protein 1 regulates DNA methylation and expression of early developmental gene clusters in human embryonic kidney cells (expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mastermind-like 1 (MAML1) is a transcriptional coregulator that has been associated with early development of many systems such as neuronal, muscular, cardiovascular and urogenital. The present study aimed to explore the genome-wide effects of MAML1 on gene expression and DNA methylation in human embryonic kidney cells. RNA expression was measured using a microarray that screens approximately 36,000 transcripts, and DNA methylation was determined for 450,000 CpG sites. 225 genes were found to be differentially expressed, while 11802 CpG sites were found to be differentially methylated in MAML1-expressing cells. A subset of 211 differentially methylated loci was associated with the expression of 85 genes. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these genes are involved in the regulation of urogenital system development, cell adhesion and embryogenesis. The aim of the study was to identify genes regulated by mastermind-like pritein 1 and DNA methylation, using genome-wide approach.

DESIGN
We assayed the effects of MAML1 overexpression, as well as knock-down, on global gene expression profiles in HEK293 cells. We applied a filter of p < 0.01 for significantly modulated gene expression and at least a 1.5-fold change in mean  differential expression. By comparing HEK293 (AW01-03_H average) with HEK293_MAML1 samples (AW04-06_MAML1 average), 225 genes were found to be differentially expressed. However, no significant changes were observed by comparing HEK293_H_siControl (AW13-14_H_siCtrl average) with HEK293_H_siMAML1 (AW15-16_siMAML1 average).
