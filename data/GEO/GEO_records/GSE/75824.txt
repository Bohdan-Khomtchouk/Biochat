TITLE
Expression data from pam48 (mterf6-1) mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Of the members of mitochondrial transcription termination factors (mTERFs) found in metazoans and plants known to regulate organellar gene expression at various levels, plant mTERF6 promotes maturation of a tRNA We used microarrays to analyze whole-genome transcriptome changes in pam48 (mterf6-1) mutants compared to wild type.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and pam48 (mterf6-1) leaves were harvested at the 8-leaf stage for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
