TITLE
RNAseq Analysis of Mouse Stomach and Intestines Following Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bariatric surgery, an effective treatment for obesity and diabetes, leads to profound remodeling of whole body energy homeostasis. We utilized a mouse model of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), a common bariatric surgery as a tool to identify novel secreted proteins and peptides that might act as important metabolic regulators. We analyzed gene expression in the stomach and intestines following VSG or sham surgery in diet-induced obese mice and sought to identify differentially regulated genes encoding secreted proteins/peptides.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of 5 different mouse intestinal tissues after VSG or sham surgery

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
