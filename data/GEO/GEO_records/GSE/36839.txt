TITLE
Expression data from OE33 oesophageal adenocarcinoma tumour cells following 24 hour co-culture with human adipose tissue explants or control M199 medium.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Obesity is linked to increased mortality from many cancer types, and oesophageal adenocarcinoma displays one of the strongest epidemiological associations. The aim of this study was to dissect molecular pathways linking obesity with oesophageal adenocarcinoma and to determine if obesity is linked to increased aggressiveness of this disease.

DESIGN
Affymetrix microarrays were used to identify altered signaling pathways in an oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell line following co-culture with visceral adipose tissue from viscerally obese oesophageal adenocarcinoma patients (n=6).

PLATFORM
GPL15362 NuGO array (human) NuGO_Hs1a520180 [CDF: Hs_ENTREZG_14]
