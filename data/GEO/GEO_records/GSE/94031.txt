TITLE
Tamoxifen-associated endometrial tumors expose differential enhancer activity for Estrogen Receptor alpha [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tamoxifen, a small molecule inhibitor that binds the Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα), blocks breast cancer progression while increasing the risk for endometrial cancer. In this study, we assessed genome-wide ERα-chromatin interactions in surgical specimens of endometrial tumors from patients who were previously treated for breast cancer with tamoxifen, and endometrial tumors from patients who were treated without tamoxifen. We compared ERα and signal at differential ERα sites in endometrial tumors of nine patients who received tamoxifen with endometrial tumors with six patients who never used tamoxifen. In addition, we performed H3K27ac (a marker for activity) ChIPs on the above mentioned endometrial tumors, and assed this signal at differential ERα sites. Compared to endometrial tumors of non-users, tamoxifen-associated endometrial tumors exposed higher H3K27ac intensities at ERα sites that are enriched in tamoxifen-associated endometrial tumors. Four tamoxifen-associated endometrial tumors that we used in our analysis have been previously published as Tumor A, B, D, and E in GSE81213.
