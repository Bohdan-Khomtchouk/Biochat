TITLE
Expression data of Tfh cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells access the B cell follicle to promote antibody responses, and are particularly important for germinal center (GC) reactions. However, the molecular mechanisms of how Tfh cells are physically associated with GCs are incompletely understood. Here we report that the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) gene is highly expressed in a subpopulation of Tfh cells that localizes in GCs. S1PR2-deficient Tfh cells exhibited reduced accumulation in GCs due to their impaired retention. T cells deficient in both S1PR2 and CXCR5 were ineffective in supporting GC responses compared to T cells deficient only in CXCR5. These results suggest that S1PR2 and CXCR5 cooperatively regulate localization of Tfh cells in GCs to support GC responses.

DESIGN
Venus-high Tfh, Venus-low Tfh, PD1-intermediate Th, PD1-low Th and na√Øve CD4+ T cells were sorted on FACSAria from immunized S1pr2V/+ mice or control mice for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affimetrix microarrays.
