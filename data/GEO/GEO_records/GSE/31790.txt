TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of mouse RAW264.7 macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with LPS, IFNb, poly(rI:rC), poly(dA:dT), VSV, HSV, Sendai virus. Genes identified by Human Innate Immunity Interactome for type I Interferon (HI5) were examined for expression.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. RAW264.7 macrophages were used and treated separately as indicated in the summary. Equal amount total RNA from each group was  used for gene expression analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL14362 Anti-viral Innate Immunity Pathway PCR assay Panel
