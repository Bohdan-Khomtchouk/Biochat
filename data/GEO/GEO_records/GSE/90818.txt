TITLE
Target RNAs of Samd4 identified by RNA IP in mouse osteoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing technology to identify targets of RNA-binding protein, Samd4, in osteoblasts. By obtaining sequences from immunoprecipitated RNA, we generated several mRNAs which could be bound by Samd4 in mouse osteoblasts.

DESIGN
Examination of Samd4-binding RNAs in osteoblasts.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
