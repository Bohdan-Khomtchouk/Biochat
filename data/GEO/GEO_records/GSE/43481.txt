TITLE
Gene expression profiling of dsDNA90 or ssDNA90 stimulated Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of wild type, STING knock-out and STAT1 knock-out Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) stimulated with 90-mer dsDNA or 90-mer ssDNA. Genes whose expression that are affected by cytosolic DNA in a STING dependent manner will be identified and signaling pathways regulated by STING will be elucidated.

DESIGN
Primary MEFs were mock treated or transfected with dsDNA90 or ssDNA90 for 3 hours. Total RNA was then extracted for array analysis.
