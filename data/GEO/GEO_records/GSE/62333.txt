TITLE
Transcriptomic profiles of skin fibroblasts from patients affected by schizophrenia and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole-genome expression studies in peripheral tissues of patients affected by schizophrenia (SCZ) can provide new insights into the molecular basis of the disorder and  innovative biomarkers that may be of great usefulness in the clinical practice. Recent evidence suggests that skin fibroblasts could represent a non-neural peripheral model useful to investigate molecular alterations in psychiatric disorders. A microarray expression study was conducted comparing transcriptomic profiles of skin fibroblasts from SCZ patients and controls. Fibroblasts can be more advantageous to discover mental disorder aetiological mechanisms since they seem more similar to neurons and less affected by the environmental confounders.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic profiles of human skin fibroblasts obtained from 20 schizophrenia patients were compared to 20 controls
