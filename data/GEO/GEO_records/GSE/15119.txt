TITLE
Mammary tumors in transgenic mice expressing constitutively active and C-terminally truncated variants of STAT5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stat5 is a latent transcription factor that regulates essential growth and survival functions in normal cells. Constitutive activity of Stat5 and the involvement of its C-terminally truncated variant have been implicated in blood cell malignancies and mammary or breast cancer. To distinguish the individual contributions of the Stat5 variants to mammary tumorigenesis, global gene-expression profiling was performed on transgenic STAT5-induced tumors.

DESIGN
Mammary tumors derived from transgenic mice carrying one of two Stat5 variants were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 array.
