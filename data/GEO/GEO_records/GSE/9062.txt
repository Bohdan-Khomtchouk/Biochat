TITLE
Changes in gene expression profile in mammalian cells upon Raf activation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Comparison of  the changes in the gene expression profile of cells in which there is an activation of the Raf oncogene in the absence of any other extracellular signals Keywords: Response to oncogenic activation of the MAPK pathway

DESIGN
Primary rat Schwann cells containing an inducible RafER allele were plated on poly-L-lysine plus fibronectin coated dishes on DMEM + 3% FCS containing medium. Next day cells were transferred to minimal medium (DMEM  containing 100 μg ml-1 transferrin, 100 μg ml-1 bovine serum albumin, 16.1 μg ml-1 putrescine, 39 ng ml-1 selenium) for 24 h. Cells were then treated with either the vehicle (EtOH) or with Tamoxifen for 24 h. Three independent experiments were performed.
