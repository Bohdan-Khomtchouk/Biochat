TITLE
Endogenous Muscle Atrophy F-box is Involved in the Development of Cardiac Rupture After Myocardial Infarction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx/atrogin-1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a crucial mediator of skeletal muscle atrophy and cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload and exercise. We investigated the role of MAFbx in the regulation of cardiac remodeling following MI. A DNA microarray analysis was conducted using total RNA from wild type and MAFbx KO mouse hearts subject to permanet coronary ligation. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanism to mediate the role of MAFbx upon cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction

DESIGN
We applied permanet coronary ligation of left coronary artery to wild type and MAFbx KO mice, and extracted total RNA one day after surgery. The gene expression profiles were examined by Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST Array.
