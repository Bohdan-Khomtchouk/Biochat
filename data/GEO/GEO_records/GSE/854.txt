TITLE
Gene Microarrays in Hippocampal Aging

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Male Fischer 344 rats aged 4 months (young, n=10), 14 months (mid-aged, n=10), and 24 months (aged, n=10) were trained sequentially on two tasks: Morris Spatial Water Maze (SWM) and Object Memory Task (OMT). The training/testing sequence lasted 7 d, and hippocampal tissue was collected 24 hr later. Training and testing occured on each day except for days 2 and 3 of the 7 d sequence. (01/10/05: Series was updated to correct mislabeling of all sample signal values within the Young Treatment Group) Keywords = bioinformatics Keywords = gene expression Keywords = memory Keywords = synaptic plasticity Keywords = myelin Keywords = inflamation Keywords = aging Keywords: repeat sample
