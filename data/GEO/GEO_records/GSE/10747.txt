TITLE
Analysis of genetic changes in MCF10A series cells and MCFDCIS derived xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF10A series is one of the few human models of breast tumor progression. A derivative of MCF10A cells is the MCFDCIS, which reproducibly forms comedo DCIS-like lesions that spontaneously progress to invasive tumors. We used this model to explore the relative importance of myoepithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts in the in situ to invasive breast carcinoma transition. We use Affymetrix 11K XbaI or 250K StyI SNP arrays to analyze the MCF10A series cells and MCFDCIS derived xenografts for copy number changes and LOH (loss of heterozygosity). Keywords: Cell line, xenografts of time course/co-injection groups, different cell types isolated from xenografts
