TITLE
Gene Expression during Panobinostat Dosing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A clinical study evaluating the dosing of an oral HDACi panobinostat in patient infected with HIV-1. Dosing was  20 mg orally, 3 times weekly, every other week for a total of 8 weeks. Gene expression was evaluated in whole PBMCs at baseline (Visit 2), after 3 doses (Visit 4), 4 weeks after dosing (Visit 12) and 6 months after dosing (Visit 13) using the Affymetrix HTA 2.0 gene expression chip

DESIGN
PBMC's were isolated from EDTA blood tubes by Ficoll separation on the indicated visits. Five million cells were lysed directly in PAX-tubes as recommended by manufacturer. Cell lysate was stored at -80C until RNA extraction was performed

PLATFORM
GPL17586 [HTA-2_0] Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 [transcript (gene) version]
