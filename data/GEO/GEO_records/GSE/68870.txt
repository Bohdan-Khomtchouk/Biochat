TITLE
Aberrantly expressed long noncoding RNAs in the eutopic endometrium of women with adenomyosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective: To identify differentially expressed long noncoding RNA in the eutopic endometrium tissue of adenomyosis on a genome-wide scale.  Patient(s): Seventeen women with adenomyosis and fifteen patients without adenomyosis or endometriosis receiving surgical treatment.   Intervention(s): Total RNAs containing long nocoding RNAs was extracted from endometrial tissue obtained during surgery.  Main Outcome Measure(s): Differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were detected by human lncRNA microarray. Result(s): We identified 165 lncRNAs and 612 mRNAs abnormally expressed (P < 0.05) in the eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis.  Conclusion(s): This study showed for the first time that the lncRNA expression profile was altered in women with adenomyosis.

DESIGN
Total 8 samples was analyzed, including 4 samples in the experiment group and 4 in the control group.
