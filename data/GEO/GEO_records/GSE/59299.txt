TITLE
Fetal programming of liver transcriptome in response to gestational diets varying in methylating micronutrients in pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Pietrain gilts were fed a control diet (CON) or a methyl-enriched diet (MET) throughout their pregnancy. Liver transcriptome profiles of the offspring were analyzed at prenatal stages [35, 63, 91 days post-conception (dpc)].

DESIGN
offspring of 5 - 6 gilts per stage were collected for expression profiling

PLATFORM
GPL3533 [Porcine] Affymetrix Porcine Genome Array
