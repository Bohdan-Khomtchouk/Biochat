TITLE
ZHBTc4 ES cells stably expressing EGFP vs Nr5a2-EGFP or Oct4-EGFP vs Nr5a2-EGFP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of ZHBTc4 ES cells expressing EGFP, Oct4-EGFP, Nr5a2-EGFP under CAG promoter.  Monoclonal cell lines selected by Puromycin were used for analysis. Each of the cell lines was cultured in doxycycline containing media for endogenous Oct4 knock-down. Pupose of this experiment is to investigate the possibility that forced expression of Nr5a2 can replace Oct4 function in the self-renewal of ES cells.

DESIGN
Monoclonal ZHBTc4 ES cells expressing EGFP vs Nr5a2-EGFP, Oct4-EGFP vs Nr5a2-EGFP, no replication

PLATFORM
