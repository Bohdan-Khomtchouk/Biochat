TITLE
miRNA expression profile analysis in myelodysplastic syndromes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The miRNA-related signaling pathways in MDS could be screened using high throughput bioinformatics analysis based on the miRNAs expression profile network. Here, we tried to identify the miRNAs-regulated pathways through a miRNA microarray in CD34+ cells from MDS patients.

DESIGN
miRNA expression profile analysis was performed in 12 MDS patients and 6 normal controls using GeneChipÂ® miRNA 3.0 Array, and diffirential miRNAs were identified.

PLATFORM
GPL16384 [miRNA-3] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-3 Array
