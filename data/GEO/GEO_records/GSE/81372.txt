TITLE
miRNA expression profile analysis in myelodysplastic syndromes

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The miRNA-related signaling pathways in MDS could be screened using high throughput bioinformatics analysis based on the miRNAs expression profile network. Here, we tried to identify the miRNAs-regulated pathways through a miRNA microarray in CD34+ cells from MDS patients.
