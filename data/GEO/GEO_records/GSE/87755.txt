TITLE
Arabidopsis Col0 5 week-old plants: control vs 30 minutes of exposure to high light stress (1000 umol m-2 s-1)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of fully developed leaves of Arabidopsis Col0 after 30 min of high-light stress (1000 umol*m-2*s-1). Goal was to find early transcriptional responses to immediate high-light stress, before acclimation responses appear.

DESIGN
two-condition, two-colour experiment, Control vs. light stress, 4 biological replicates per treatment. The experiment comprised a single 4x44 Agilent V4 microarray slide with a dye-swap.
