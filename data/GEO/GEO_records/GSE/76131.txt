TITLE
Study of differentiation of human adipocytes using SBGS cells in vitro.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This data set consists of a time series of transcriptional profiles of differentiating human adipocytes in vitro.

DESIGN
In this study the adipogenesis process of human SBGS pre-adipocyte cells in vitro was monitored by obtaining gene expression profiles at beginning of experiment and at different time points after induction of differentiation. The resulting transcriptomic data set includes six time points (0, 6, 48, 96, 192, 384 hours), with three to nine replicates per time point, for a total of 26 profiles. The platfom used for the profiling was Illumina Human HT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Ilumina, Inc., San Diego, CA).
