TITLE
TRAIL and taurolidine enhance the anticancer activity of doxorubicin, trabectedin and mafosfamide in human fibrosarcoma cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis revealed differential gene expression patterns of HT1080 cells treated with various chemical compounds alone and in combination (trabectedin, doxorubicin, mafosfamide, TRAIL, taurolidine)
