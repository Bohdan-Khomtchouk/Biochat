TITLE
Microarray analysis of lymphocytes isolated from healthy donors ex-vivo exposed to alpha particle radiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to  identify genes that are modulated by alpha particle radiation Cell types were independently exposed to alpha particle radiation using Americium-241 discs (0.9Gy/hr) at a dose range from 0-1.5 Gy. Twenty-four hours post-exposure cells were harvested and RNA was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Expression profiling by array analysis-Sample set, 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 Gy (n=12), analysed 24h post exposure

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
