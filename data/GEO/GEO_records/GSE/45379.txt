TITLE
Transcriptome changes in spliceostatin A treated cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pre-mRNA in eukaryotes is subjected to post-transcriptional modifications, such as capping, polyadenylation and splicing. It is well known that transcription and post-transcriptional modifications are coupled and that this coupling stimulates post-transcriptional modifications, however, the effects of post-transcriptional modifications on transcription are not fully understood. Here, we report that inhibition of U2 snRNP by a splicing inhibitor, spliceostatin A (SSA), and antisense morpholino oligonucleotide to U2 snRNA caused 3’ end down regulation in a gene-specific manner. We also show that U2 snRNP inhibition resulted in the dephosphorylation of second serine residues (Ser2) within heptad repeats of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II, which is important for transcription elongation, and this dephosphorylation was correlated with splicing inactivation. Interestingly, removal of SSA from the culture media caused restoration of the Ser2 phosphorylation and expression of the 3’ end, suggesting that transcription elongation resumed. These findings suggest that a novel checkpoint mechanism prevents pre-mRNA accumulation and the production of aberrant proteins translated from pre-mRNA upon splicing deficiencies through the dephosphorylation of CTD Ser2.

DESIGN
Treated HeLa cells with methanol or spliceosotain A for 3 hours followed by labelling of nascent transcripts with EU for 1 hour. The EU labelled nascent RNA was purified and analyzed on human exon 1.0ST array. Three biological replicates were used for each treatment.
