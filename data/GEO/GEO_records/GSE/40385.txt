TITLE
Overexpression of SChLAP1 versus LACZ in RWPE cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SChLAP1 is a novel long non-coding RNA expressed in prostate cancer. Here we performed transcriptional profiling of the benign immortalized prostate cell line RWPE overexpressing two isoforms of the SChLAP-1 lncRNA compared with RWPE overexpressing LACZ. Our goal was to determine the effect of SChLAP1 overexpression on gene expression in prostate cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: RWPE overexpressing SChLAP1 versus RWPE overexpressing LACZ. Biological replicates: 1 control replicate, 2 experimental replicates.  Technical replicates: 2 replicates per SChLAP1 isoform.  Cell lines: RWPE.
