TITLE
RNA-sequencing analysis of glucose and acetate regulated transcripts in glioblastoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our studies indicate that glucose and acetate can regulate histone acetylation by altering the acetyl-CoA concentrations in the cell. The purpose of this study was to to determine whether specific gene sets correlated with acetyl-CoA availability. We conclude that 10% of glucose-regulated genes are acetyl-CoA regulated genes (genes suppressed or induced by low glucose and reversed by acetate). Acetate usually regulated gene expression in the same direction as glucose, suggesting that acetyl-CoA is a key mediator of glucose-dependent gene expression.

DESIGN
The experiments were performed in quadruplicates for each condition with a total of 12 samples
