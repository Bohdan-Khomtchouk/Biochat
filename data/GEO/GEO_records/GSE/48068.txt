TITLE
Architectural niche organization by LHX2 is linked to hair follicle stem cell function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify direct LHX2 target genes in HFSCs, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis using FACS-isolated HFSCs.

DESIGN
Three independent LHX2 ChIP-seq experiments were conducted.

PLATFORM
