TITLE
Long non-coding RNA expression profile in the kidney of male low birth weight rats exposed to maternal protein restriction at postnatal day 10

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To investigate the lncRNA profiles in low birth weight rats with reduced nephron endowment induced by restriction of maternal protein intake. Low birth weight by reduced nephron endowment is a risk factor for hypertension and end-stage renal disease in adulthood.

DESIGN
Kidneys at postnatal day 10 were obtained from low birth weight male rats (n=3) fed a low-protein diet throughout gestation and lactation and normal control male rats (n=3) born from normal protein diet dams. LncRNA expression profiles were analyzed by sequencing and screening using the Agilent Rat lncRNA Array.
