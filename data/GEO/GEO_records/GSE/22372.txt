TITLE
Identification of direct androgen-target genes in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of the LNCaP cell line treated with R1881 synthetic androgen and/or cycloheximide.

DESIGN
LNCaP cells were stimulated with R1881 alone, with cycloheximide alone, or with R1881 in the presence of cycloheximide for 24h and compared to control untreated cells. Two independent cell culture experiments for each treatment condition were performed for microarray analysis. Each experiment was repeated with a switch in fluorescent Cy3/Cy5 labels to account for dye effects to produce four data points per hybridization spot.
