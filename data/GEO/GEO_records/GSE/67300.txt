TITLE
Gene expression profiling of transgenic d16HER2- and WT HER2-positive transgenic mammary tumor cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
d16HER2 is a splice variant of HER2 receptor characterized by a significant tumor aggressiveness. We derived primary tumor cell lines from spontaneous tumors grown in mice transgenic respectively for human d16 (MI6 and MI7 cell lines) and WT HER2 isoforms (WTHER2_1 and WTHER2_2). To analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying the higher tumorigenicity of d16HER2 than that of WTHER2, we conducted gene expression profiling analysis of these cell lines.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed using RNA from two transgenic d16HER2-positive (named MI6 and MI7) and two transgenic WT HER2-positive (named WTHER2_1 and WTHER2_2) mammary tumor cell lines.
