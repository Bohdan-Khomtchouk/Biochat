SUMMARY
Strains VCXB21 and VCXB21 pDel were added 0.6 mM chitobiose at early log phase. Samples isolated after 30 min. cDNA from VCXB21 was prepared from 2 ug RNA and labeled with Cy3. cDNA from VCXB21pDel was prepared from 2 ug RNA and labeled with Cy5. A genetic modification design type is where an organism(s) has had genetic material removed, rearranged, mutagenized or added, such as knock out. Keywords: genetic_modification_design
