TITLE
Genomic profiling of gastric adenomas by array-based comparative genomic hybridization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated CNAs of 20 gastric CIS (Vienna category 4.2) and 20 adenomas, including 7 low-grade adenomas (LGA; Vienna category 3) and 13 high-grade adenomas (HGA; Vienna category 4.1), by 244k oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH).

DESIGN
20 gastric adenomas vs. 20 controls. The supplementary file 'GSE19574_aberrations.txt' file contains a summary of the aberrations in the gastric adenomas as determined by the ADM-2 algorithm.
