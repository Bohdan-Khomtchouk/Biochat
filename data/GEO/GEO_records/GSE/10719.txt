TITLE
Response of Arabidopsis cell culture to phytoprostane A1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
12-Oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and several phytoprostanes are structurally related cyclopentenone oxylipins that can be formed via the enzymatic jasmonate pathway and a non-enzymatic, free radical-catalyzed pathway, respectively. To elucidate the biological activities of phytoprostanes in comparison to OPDA as well as the metabolism we performed genome-wide expression analysis. Keywords: mixotrophic Arabidopsis cell culture, ATH1 Chip

DESIGN
In order to get a comprehensive view of the biological activity of non-enzymatically formed reactive oxylipins the regulation of gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana was analyzed using the ATH1 chip representing 22500 genes. A mixotrophic cell culture of Arabidopsis was treated with 75 ÂµM phytoprostane A1 or with 0.5% methanol in water (Control) and harvested after 4 h. Three independent replicates of each treatment were analyzed and the fold change of normalized signals from PPA1-treated cell culture versus control cell culture was calculated.
