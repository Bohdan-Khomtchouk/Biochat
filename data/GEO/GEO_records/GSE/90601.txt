TITLE
Mature Arabidopsis leaves: RAP2.6L overexpressing vs wild-type (Ws)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana, comparing control wild-type (ecotype Wassilewskija, Ws) leaves with leaves from transgenic plants overexpressing the transcription factor RAP2.6L under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (RAP2.6L-OX; this line was originally described in Krishnaswamy et al (2010)).

DESIGN
Leaf samples for the 35S:RAP2.6L line and the Ws control were harvested from 28 day old plants. Three individual leaves (Leaf 7) from separate plants were harvested from both Ws and 35S:RAP2.6L genotypes. Total RNA from the three biological replicates of Ws and 35S:RAP2.6L samples were pooled separately. Expression was compared between Ws vs. 35S:RAP2.6L using six technical replicates including dye-swaps.
