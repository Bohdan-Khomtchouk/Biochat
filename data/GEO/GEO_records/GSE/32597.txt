TITLE
Gene expression profile of YAP1, TEAD1 and KLF5 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (SK-Hep1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hippo signaling pathway is pivotally involved in human cancer. Among the Hippo components, YAP1 is highly active while function of MST1,2 and SAV1 was lost in liver cancer. Based on systematic analysis, we identified KLF5 as YAP1 binding partner in silico. To investigate KLF5 in liver cancer, we performed the gene expression microarray after knocked down YAP1, TEAD1 and KLF5 in SK-Hep1 cell line.

DESIGN
To identify the role of YAP1, TEAD1 and KLF5 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, we performed microarray after knocking down YAP1, TEAD1 and KLF5 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (3 siLuc, 3 siYAP1, 3 siTEAD1, 3 siKLF5)
