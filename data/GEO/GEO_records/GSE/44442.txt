TITLE
Genomic binding profile of TAL1 in human Endothelial Colony-Forming Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) have been reported as promising cells for regenerative medicine thanks to their angiorepair properties. Transcription factors are primary determinants of the functional capacity of the cells and TAL1 has been shown as a critical regulator of endothelial lineage in both development and adult life. However, only few (three) TAL1 targets have been identified so far in mouse and human endothelial cells. This ChIP-seq experiment was designed to identify genome binding/occupancy of TAL1 by ChIP and high throughput sequencing in primary human endothelial stem/progenitor cells.

DESIGN
TAL1 ChIP and IgG ChIP (negative control) were performed in crosslinked ECFCs derived from human umbilical cord blood.
