ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the gene expression level of 4T1 orthotopic tumors in mice with and without pericyte depletion.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from orthopotic 4T1 tumor with and without pericyte genetic targeting (using PDGFRb-TK mice) at early and late stage of tumor progression, and with anti-Ang2 or IgG (control) antibody treatment.
