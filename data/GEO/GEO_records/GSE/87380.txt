TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of effects of various nutrients

ORGANISM
Fervidobacterium islandicum

SUMMARY
We compared profiling of mRNA of cells grown exponentially in various nutrients. mRNA profiles were generated in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Sequenced reads were mapped to the reference genome sequence (GenBank No. CP14334.1).

DESIGN
mRNA of cells exponentially grown carbon or nitrogen sources were generated in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500.
