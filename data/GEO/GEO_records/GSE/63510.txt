TITLE
Nck2 Regulates Adiposity and Adiposity-Related Metabolic Disorders in Mice and Human

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Obesity is linked to the development of metabolic disorders. Expansion of white adipose tissue (WAT) from hypertrophy of pre-existing adipocytes and/or differentiation of precursors into new mature adipocytes contributes to obesity. We found that Nck2 expression is largely restricted to WAT, raising the hypothesis that it may play a unique function in that tissue. Using mice lacking Nck2, we found that Nck2 regulates adipocyte hypertrophy thus contributing to increased adiposity and progressive glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. These findings were recapitulated in humans such that Nck2 expression in omental WAT was inversely correlated with the degree of obesity. Mechanistically, Nck2 deficiency promoted the induction of an adipocyte differentiation program and signaling by the PERK-eIF2Î±-ATF4 pathway in agreement with a role for the unfolded protein response in adipogenesis. These findings uncover Nck2 as a novel regulator of adipogenesis and that perturbation in its functionality contributes to adiposity-related metabolic disorders.
