TITLE
BCR-ABL1 and a dominant negative isoform of Ikaros cooperate to induce human acute myeloid leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of lineage depleted human cord blood cells sequentially transduced with retro- (BCR-ABL1) and lentiviral (Ik6) vectors and the corresponding controls. Results provide important informations on the collaboration of BCR-ABL1 and Ik6 in human hematopoietic cells.

DESIGN
Double-transduced lineage depleted human cord blood cells were puirifed according to GFP and LNGFR expression. RNA was extracted from purified cells.
