TITLE
Single-cell transcriptomics reveals unique features of human pancreatic islet cell subtypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the single-cell RNA-seq based identification of 6 known human islet cell types (alpha cells, beta cells, delta cells, pp cells, acinar cells and duct cells) based on the expression of known marker genes. We further assess cell type specific gene expression and suggest novel marker genes for several cell types.

DESIGN
Transcriptional dissection of human pancreatic islets of one donor using single-cell RNA-seq

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
