TITLE
HeLa transcriptome induction by IFN gamma and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We describe the modulation of gene expression by IDO induction in HeLa cells.

DESIGN
The RNA-seq transcriptome profile of IFN gamma-treated and IDO1-transduced HeLa cells was compared to that of untreated WT and GFP-transduced HeLa cells, respectively.
