TITLE
Effect of valproic acid  on hematopoiesis: A functional profiling and cell phenotyping approach

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effects of valproic acid (VPA) on chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. This study attempts to elucidate the effects of VPA on cell homeostasis and hematopoietic differentiation pathways in this cell line.

DESIGN
We used ten experimental conditions comparing valproic acid-treated and untreated cells at time points 2, 6, 10, 48 and 72 hrs respectively. Experiments were performed in three biological replicates including a dye swap (represented by replicate 3, for each timepoint).
