TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in staged Drosophila embryos, ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains ChIP-seq data generated on Solexa Genome Analyzer for 6 Histone modifications (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27Ac, H3K9Ac), PolII and CBP/p300. Each factor has been studied for 12 different time-points of Drosophila development. Keywords: Epigenetics For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
For each combination of time-point and antibody, triplicate ChIP experiments have been performed and hybridized on Agilent 244K arrays. The hybridizations have been verified by sequencing one replicate of IP and one replicate of Input following Solexa sequencing procedure.
