Differential transcriptomic responses of Biomphalaria glabrata to bacteria and metazoan parasites

ORGANISM
Biomphalaria glabrata

SUMMARY
Differential transcriptomic responses of Biomphalaria glabrata (Gastropoda, Mollusca) to bacteria and metazoan parasites Schistosoma mansoni and Echinostoma paraensei (Digenea, Platyhelminthes). Transcriptional profiling of Biomphalaria glabrata comparing control uninfected M-line B. glabrata with five experimental groups.  The experimental groups are: wounded but not infected M-line, Escherichia coli infected, Micrococcus luteus infected, Echinostoma paraensei infected and Schistosoma mansoni infected at 12 hours time point post infection.

DESIGN
Seven groups of samples: two controls, wounded, two bacterial- and two trematode-infected B. glabrata were analyzed in triplicate, using universal RNA reference.
