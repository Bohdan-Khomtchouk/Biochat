TITLE
Gene expression data of RNA from liver sample of DUhTP and DUC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver gene expression following longterm selection for high treadmill performance in mice Liver probe-sets were screened, analysed for differential expression between high treadmill performance selected mouse line (DUhTP) and control line (DUC)

DESIGN
RNAs of liver from mouse line were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Murine Genome Array.

PLATFORM
GPL8321 [Mouse430A_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array
