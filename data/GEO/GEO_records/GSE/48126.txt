TITLE
Gene expression profiles of amiodarone, valproic acid, and tetracycline induced steatosis in C57BL/6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Toxicogenomics (tgx) is used as a tool to identify mechanisms and markers of steatosis in C57BL/6 mice treated by oral gavage using amiodarone (AMD), valproic acid (VPA), and tetracycline (TET). Critical doses for tgx analysis were derived from a 25 day dose range finding study.  For tgx analysis, livers of mice were collected after 1, 4, and 11 days of repeated treatment with 6.7, 20, and 60 mg/kg bw for AMD; 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg bw for VPA; and 14.8, 44, and 133 mg/kg bw for TET.

DESIGN
For each treatment (compound and vehicle) in the toxicogenomics study samples were as follows: four at the high dose 1 and 4 day time point, and five at the low, medium, and high dose at 11 days. One set of vehicle controls were used for AMD and VPA (PBS), and TET had its own vehicle controls (milli-q water with ascorbic acid). The total number of samples was 95.
