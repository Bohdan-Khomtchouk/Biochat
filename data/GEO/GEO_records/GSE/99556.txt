TITLE
Expression data from lung metastatic explants

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of PGC1alpha in breast cancer lung metastasis is largely unknown. We used expression data from lung metastatic explants overexpressing PGC1alpha or control, treated with phenformin to understand global gene expression changes which occur in a PGC1alpha context and under phenformin treatment. We used expression data to understand the pathways and genes that may lead to lung metastasis in a PGC1alpha overexpression setting.

DESIGN
PGC1alpha overexpressing or control explants from a lung metastatic tail vein (LMTV) assay were isolated and put into culture and treated with phenformin (100uM) for 4 days or dh20 control.
