TITLE
ChIP-seq of RNA polymerase II, transcription factors and histone modification in retinal pigment epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Retinal pigment epithelial cells are critical for eye function and loss of cell function is linked to age-related blindness.  Relatively little is known about the transcriptional regulatory networks in these cells.  The datasets presented here are ChIP-seq experiments for RNA polymerase II , transcription factors and histone modifications in human retinal pigment epithelial cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq for transcription factors, RNA polymerase, histone modifications and CTCF in retinal pigment epithelial cells

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
