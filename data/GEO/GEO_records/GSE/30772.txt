TITLE
The human mitochondrial transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human mitochondrial genome comprises a distinct genetic system transcribed as precursor polycistronic transcripts that are subsequently cleaved to generate individual mRNAs, tRNAs and rRNAs. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the human mitochondrial transcriptome across multiple cell lines and tissues. Using directional deep sequencing and parallel analysis of RNA ends, we demonstrate wide variation in mitochondrial transcript abundance, and precisely resolve transcript processing and maturation events. We identify novel transcripts, including small RNAs, and observe the enrichment of several nuclear RNAs in mitochondria. Using high-throughput in vivo DNaseI footprinting, we establish the global profile of DNA-binding protein occupancy across the mitochondrial genome at single nucleotide resolution, revealing novel regulatory features at mitochondrial transcription initiation sites and functional insights into disease-associated variants. Together, this integrated analysis of the mitochondrial transcriptome reveals unexpected complexity in the regulation, expression, and processing of mitochondrial RNA, and itÂ  provides a resource for the future study of mitochondrial function (accessed at mitochondria.matticklab.com).
