TITLE
Effect of Egg Protein Ovotransferrin-derived Peptide, IRW on Gene Expression of Vascular Tissues in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In this study we tested the effect of orraly administered egg white ovotransferrin derived pepide, IRW on gene expression in spontaneously hypertensive rats. IRW is previously identified with antihypertensive effect and in this study we evaluated how IRW treatment can modulate various gene expression.

DESIGN
Two groups of animal, group 1 is untreated control with 5 animals, receiving vehicle control for 18 days and group 2 is IRW treated (15mg/kg BW) for 18 days, 6 animals were used in this group
