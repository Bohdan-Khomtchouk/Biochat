TITLE
Transcriptional reprogramming and stimulation of leaf respiration by elevated CO2 concentration is diminished, but not eliminated, under limiting nitrogen supply.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional reprogramming and stimulation of leaf respiration by elevated CO2 concentration is diminished, but not eliminated, under limiting nitrogen supply.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis plants were grown in either ambient (370 ppm) or elevated (750 ppm) CO2 with either ample N supply or limiting N supply. Leaf tissue was harvested from youngest most fully expanded leaves 35 days after plant germination at either midday or midnight.
