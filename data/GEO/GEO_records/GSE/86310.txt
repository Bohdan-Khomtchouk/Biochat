TITLE
Single-cell RNA-sequencing of murine atrioventricular node macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tissue-resident macrophages abound in the distal atrioventricular (AV) node of the heart, electrically couple to conducting cardiomyocytes via Connexin (Cx) 43-containing gap junctions and are implicated in normal and aberrant cardiac conduction.

DESIGN
Comparison of 76 single-cell transcriptomes from murine AV node macrophages.
