TITLE
Comparison of Fusobacterium Nucleatum stimulated and unstimulated neutrophils

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neutrophils are known to be stimulated by different periodontal bacteria to produce reactive oxygen species and cytokines. It is inportant to investigate the gene changes made by bacteria of importance, of which, for periodontal disease, fusobaterium nucleatum is one. we used microarrays to investigate gene experssion changes in peripheral blood neutrophils werwhich e stimulated with or with out Fusobacterium Nucleatum (10953).

DESIGN
Neutrophils from periodonatlly healthy individuals (n=4) were isolated and stimulated for 3hrs with or without fusobaterium nucleatum (10953). RNA was then extracted from these and pooled before hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
