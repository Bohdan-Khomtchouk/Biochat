TITLE
PD991 Gene Expression Arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Agilent gene expression arrays were used for intrinsic subtyping and to measure changes after anastrozole (C1D1) and after combination of anastrazole and palbociclib (C1D15).

DESIGN
118 breast cancer patient samples (baseline, n=32; C1D1, n=33; C1D15, n=29; surgery, n=24) from clinical trial NCT01723774 were arrayed, subtyped, and used to detect changes with treatment.
