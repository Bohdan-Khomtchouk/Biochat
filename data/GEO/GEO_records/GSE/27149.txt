TITLE
Expression data from murine vaginal samples following adjuvant treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Vaccine research today is focused on using safer, highly purified or recombinant antigens with poor immunogenicity, which has created a need for potent adjuvants. Rational design of effective and safe mucosal adjuvants for human use necessitates a thorough understanding of the mode of action of successful candidate adjuvants. We used microarray to comprehend the molecular signatures of mucosal adjuvants in the mouse vagina. The adjuvants studied, CpG-ODN and α-GalCer have previously been shown to be potent mucosal adjuvants in mice when administrered together with a glycoprotein from HSV-2.

DESIGN
Two individual experiments were performed, called ES1 and ES2, each experiment contained 4 groups of mice. All mice were pre-treated with progesteron (DP) before intravaginally recieveing either CpG ODN, α-GalCer or their respective buffers, PBS and PBS/Tween. Vaginas were excised at 3 different time-points; 4h, 24h and 48h following adjuvant delivery.
