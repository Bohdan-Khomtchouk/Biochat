TITLE
Transcriptome profiling analysis of bacterial challenged Lateolabrax japonicus reveals deep insight into the immune-relevant genes in marine fish (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Lateolabrax japonicus

SUMMARY
We report the application of Solexa/Illuminaâ€™s RNA-seq sequencing approaches for transcriptome in a marine fish under different conditions (bacterial- and mock-challenged conditions). By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from the cDNA, we generated 169,950 none-redundant consensus sequences, from which 44842 functional transcripts with complete or various length of encoding regions were identified. More than 52% of these transcripts could be enriched in approximately 219 known metabolic or signaling pathways, among of which 2673 transcripts were found to be associated with immune-relevant genes. Besides, about 8% of the transcripts seemed fish-specific genes that have never been described before. This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations. Our study provided a global survey of the gene activities in host defense against bacterial infection in a non-model marine fish.

DESIGN
Examination of different transcriptome in baterial- and mock challenged fish.
