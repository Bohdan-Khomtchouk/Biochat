TITLE
Gene expression profile of human endothelial cells with or without nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the the effect of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating a fluorine contrast agent on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling. The NPs used in this study were prepared in our lab. HUVECs were ordered from Lonza (Cat# C2517A). HUVECs were incubated with NPs for 4 hours. After 4 h, the cells were washed couple of times to remove the NPs and gene expression profiles were detected after 20 h (total time: 24 h) and 7 d in the absence of NPs.  HUVECs  after 24 h without nanoparticles were used as controls.

DESIGN
The gene expression in HUVECs was measured at 24 h and 7 d after incubation with nanoparticles. Three independent experiments were performed at each time.
