TITLE
Yeast D10 Small ~ WT San I

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of parental S. cerevisiae San I cells in comparison with its translocant derivative D10 Small strain. The latter strain was obtained using Bridge Induced translocation technique between DUR3 gene (Chromosome VIII) and ADH1 gene (Chromosome XV), and exhibited an abnormal phenotype comprising elongated buds and multi-budded, unevenly nucleated pseudo-hyphae. Goal was to demonstrate how chromosomal translocations can influence gene expression of translocant and other chromosomes.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, direct comparison of Saccharomyces cerevisiae D10 small (4 biological replicates) vs. pooled WT San I (reference) cells.
