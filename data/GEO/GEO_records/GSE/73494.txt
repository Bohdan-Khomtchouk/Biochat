TITLE
Gene expression profiles of rat liver tissues after carbon tetrachloride treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Acute hepatic failure (AHF) usually occurs due to the rapid necrosis of liver cells or serious liver injury induced by a variety of pathogenic factors. We used Rat Genome 230 2.0 microarray to further highlight the rat liver tissues after carbon tetrachloride treatment.

DESIGN
The rat model of acute hepatic failure (AHF) was established, and the expression profiles of liver tissues from AHF were detected at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours using Rat Genome 230 2.0 array. Then the significantly changed genes related to AHF were identified. The relevance of gene expression profiles and biological processes was analyzed by bioinformatics and systems biology.
