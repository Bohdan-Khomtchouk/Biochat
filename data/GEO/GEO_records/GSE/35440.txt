TITLE
The evolution of low mutation rates in experimental mutator populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
microarray experiment to test the gene expression in long term lines of mutator and non-mutator yeast. Here we use an experimental evolution approach to investigate the conditions required for evolution of a reduction in mutation rate and the mechanisms by which populations tolerate the accumulation of deleterious mutations. We find that after ~6700 generations four out of eight experimental mutator lines had evolved a decreased mutation rate.

DESIGN
2 condition experiment, derived experimental evolution strains compared to their ancestor strain. We compared the expression profile of one of the mutator lines (m8) after 6700 generations with its mutator ancestor, and as a control, an evolved non mutator after 6700 generations was compared to to its non-mutator ancestor. In order to prepare cells for expression microarray, glass tubes containing 3 ml of YPD were inoculated from overnight cultures, and grown until the OD600 was approximately 0.3.
