TITLE
Genome-wide map of GATA6 DNA binding in human PDAC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By studying a mouse model, as well as human tumors samples and cell lines, we have revealed a tumor suppressive role for Gata6 in the pathogenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In order to understand the mechanism underlying such tumor suppressive function, we analyzed the genome-wide DNA-binding of GATA6 in a human PDAC cell line (PaTu8988S). GATA6 is found to bind the promoter of genes involved in the epithelial differentiation programme, as well as of genes involved in the mesenchymal programme. With this we describe a novel GATA6-dependent mechanism of regulation of EMT.
