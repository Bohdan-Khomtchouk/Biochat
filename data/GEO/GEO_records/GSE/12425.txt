TITLE
Dox-regulated Notch4 overexpression in mouse ES cells redirects hemagioblasts to a cardiac fate.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previous studies have demonstrated that distinct progenitor subpopulations of mesoderm display tissue specific and vascular potential: hemangioblasts, a progenitor population capable of generating cells of the hematopoietic, endothelial and vascular smooth muscle lineages, and a multipotential progenitor capable of generating progeny of the cardiac, endothelial and vascular smooth muscle lineages.  Each of these populations is characterized by co-expression of brachyury (Bry) and Flk-1, although the hemangioblast population is established before the cardiovascular progenitors in ES cell differentiation cultures (e.g. d3.5 for hemagioblast, versus d4.5 for cardiovascular progenitors). To investigate the role of Notch signalling in the establishment of cardiac lineages, we used a tet-inducible ES cell line (Ainv18) engineered to express an activated form of the Notch4 receptor following doxycycline treatment. This line also expresses a GFP cDNA from the Bry locus. Following 3.0-3.5 days of serum stimulation, three distinct populations based on Flk-1 and GFP expression are observed: Bry-GFP-/Flk-1-, Bry-GFP+/Flk-1- and Bry-GFP+/Flk-1+ cells.  Previous studies have shown that the Bry-GFP+/Flk-1+ population contains hemangioblasts, whereas the Bry-GFP+/Flk-1- population displays cardiac potential.
