TITLE
Comparison of plant responses upon P. palmivora infection in wild type (A17) line and in the api mutant

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
api mutant has been shown to be more resistant to P. palmivora than the A17 wild type (WT) line. In this study we want to compare both WT and mutant plant responses to the pathogen as well as their respective control transciptomes in order to identify api-dependent gene networks. Following germination, A17 or api plants grown in vitro on Agar medium were inoculated (or not = controls) with a P. palmivora zoospores (10^5/ml) and harvested 16 hours after inoculation. Three independent repeats were performed.

DESIGN
12 arrays - Medicago; normal vs disease comparison,normal vs ems mutant comparison,time course
