TITLE
miRNA expression data from meningioma samples and healthy meningial cell line

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Although meningioma is a common disease, there is a lack of understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms behind its initiation and progression. We used combined miRNA-mRNA transcriptome analysis to discover novel genes and networks in meningiomas.
