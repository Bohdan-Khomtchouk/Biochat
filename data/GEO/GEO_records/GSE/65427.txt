TITLE
Genome-wide studies identify a novel interplay between AML1 and AML1/ETO in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The AML1/ETO fusion protein is essential to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and is well recognized for its dominant-negative effect on the co-existing wild-type protein AML1. However, the involvement of wild-type AML1 in AML1/ETO-driven leukemogenesis remains elusive. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, computational analysis plus a series of experimental validations, we report here that AML1 is able to orchestrate the expression of AML1/ETO targets regardless of being activated or repressed, via forming a complex with AML1/ETO and via recruiting the cofactor.

DESIGN
4 ChIP-seq assays were used to identify the high confidence binding regions of AML1-ETO and AML1 in t(8;21) AML Kasumi-1 cell lines. The anti-AML1 (N20) antibody targets the N-terminus of AML1 and recognizes both AML1 and AML1/ETO; the anti-AML1 (C19) antibody targets the C-terminus of AML1 and recognizes AML1 but not AML1/ETO; the anti-ETO (C20) antibody targets the C-terminus of ETO and specifically recognizes AML1/ETO. 2 ChIP-seq assays were used to identify the binding regions of AML1 in human macrophage U937 cell lines. And the total input was used as control.
