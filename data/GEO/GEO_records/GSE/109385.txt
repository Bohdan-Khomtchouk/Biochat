TITLE
Roles of the Brca2 and Wapl complexes with Pds5 in sister chromatid cohesion, cohesin localization, and gene expression [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
RNA expression was measured by RNA-seq in Drosophila ML-DmBG3-c2 cells depleted for proteins involved in sister chromatid cohesion, and in developing third instar wing discs with or withough brca2 gene mutations

DESIGN
RNA expression in depleted cells was compared to mock treated cells and RNA expression in wing discs from brca2 mutant Drosophila was compared to expression in wing discs without brca2 mutations This series includes mock RNAi treated samples re-used from GSE100547.

PLATFORM
