TITLE
Defective Decidualization During and After Severe Preeclampsia Reveals a Possible Maternal Contribution to the Etiology

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In preeclampsia (PE), cytotrophoblast (CTB) invasion of the uterus and spiral arteries is often shallow. Thus, the placentaâ€™s role has been a focus. We hypothesized that decidual defects are an important determinant of the placental phenotype. We isolated (human) endometrial stromal cells (hESCs) from non-pregnant donors with a prior pregnancy that was complicated by severe PE (sPE). Versus controls, they failed to decidualize as demonstrated by morphological criteria and the analysis of stage-specific antigens. These results were bolstered by showing that they were transcriptionally inert. Additionally, we used laser microdissection to isolate the decidua from tissue sections of the maternal-fetal interface. Transcriptional profiling revealed sPE-associated defects in gene expression. Also, decidual cells from sPE patients, which de-differentiated in vitro, failed to re-decidualize in culture. Immediately following isolation they released factors that inhibited CTB invasion, linking a possible cause to a known effect. These data suggested that failed decidualization is an important contributor to down regulated CTB invasion in sPE. Diagnosis of this defect prior to pregnancy would enable therapies that are designed to improve decidualization, a novel strategy for prevention.

DESIGN
We used laser microdissection to isolate the decidua basalis and parietalis from sPE and nPTB samples (n=4/ group). Biopsies of the placenta/decidua basalis and smooth chorion/decidua parietalis were washed repeatedly in cold PBS to remove blood contaminants then placed in cryomolds containing OCT, frozen over a dry ice/ethanol slurry, and stored at -80C.
