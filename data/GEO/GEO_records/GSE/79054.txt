TITLE
H3K4me1 ChIP-seq in murine pre-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
H3K4me1 binding in murine pre-B cells detected by ChIP-seq.

DESIGN
For the ChIP-seq, input and immunoprecipitated DNA was given to the TSRI Next Generation Sequencing Core (the Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, US), where it was prepared for massively parallel sequencing on Illumina HiSeq2000.
