TITLE
Autism-associated gene expression signatures in peripheral blood leucocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using DNA microarray as a global approach to understanding the molecular basis of autism, we examined gene expression profiling in peripheral blood from 21 young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and healthy mothers having children with ASD, between whom there was no blood relationship. Several genes which were significantly changed in the ASD group comparing with their age- and gender-matched healthy subjects were mainly involved in cell morphology, cellular assembly and organization, and nerve system development and function. In addition, mothers having children with ASD possessed a unique gene expression signature shown as significant alterations of protein synthesis despite of their nonautistic diagnostic status.  Moreover, an ASD-associated gene expression signature was commonly observed in both individuals with ASD and healthy mothers having children with ASD.
