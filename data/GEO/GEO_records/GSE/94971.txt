TITLE
Changes in chromatin association with the nuclear periphery in resting and activated Jurkat T-cells [DamID-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Activation of T-cells induces dramatic changes in genome organisation and gene transcription. Here we identify changes in chromatin association with the periphery by DamID.

DESIGN
Maps of genomic regions in proximity to the nuclear lamina were determined in resting and activated Jurkat T-cells using Lamin B1 DamID.
