TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of FOXF2-regulated genes in normal and metastatic breast epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This genome-wide gene expression studies are aimed at deciphering whether FOXF2 transcriptional activity and specificity are compromised in FOXF2-expressing breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) compared with FOXF2-expressing normal breast epithelial cells (MCF10A).

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 (231) cell lines transfected with siRNA for 48 hours.

PLATFORM
GPL18387 Illumina HumanWG-6 v3.0 expression beadchip (gene symbol)
