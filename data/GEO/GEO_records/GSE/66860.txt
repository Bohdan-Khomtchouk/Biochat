TITLE
RNA-seq of control and foxo3b MO zebrafish cells.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Gata1+ cells isolated from control and foxo3b MO zebrafish at 24 and 48hpf were subjected to RNA-seq and related analyses.

DESIGN
Gata1-GFP zebrafish stran was utilized, embryos were injected with foxo3b MO and standard MO at one-cell stage. Gata1+ cells were selected by FACS at 24 and 48hpf and submitted to RNA-seq and related analyses.
