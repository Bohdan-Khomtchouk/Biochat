TITLE
A Genomic Portrait of the Genetic Architecture and Regulatory Impact of microRNA Expression in Response to Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of changes in microRNA expression, remodelling of relationships between microRNA and mRNA expression levels, and genetic polymorphisms associated with inter-individual variation in the dendritic cell immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.

DESIGN
We characterised genome-wide changes in microRNA expression, and of the broader miRNA-mdeiated regulatory system, in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection, and assessed the extent to which this response is under genetic control. To do so, we profiled microRNA expression levels in primary dendritic cells from 65 individuals before and after infection with MTB for 18 hours.
