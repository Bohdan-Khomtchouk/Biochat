TITLE
Time course expression data of human cell lines infected with dengue virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray data was used to study the gene expression changes following dengue infection at various time points to identify host genes and pathways responsible for dengue virus replication Keywords: time course

DESIGN
HepG2 cell line was infected with TSV01 virus and expression profiled at 3hrs, 6hrs, 12hrs,24hrs, 48 hrs and 72hrs after infection. At each time point we profilesd the transcriptome using 3 biological repeats and each sample profiled using a technical repeat with dyes swapped

PLATFORM
