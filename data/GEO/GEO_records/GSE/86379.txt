TITLE
Expression data from BPH resistant and susceptible rice varieties

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Bph6 is a gene that confers rice high resistance to its devastating pest BPH. Understanding the molecular responses of the resistant and susceptible varieties would pave the way to controlling the pest more effectively. To better understand the molecular mechanism underlying resistance to BPH mediated by Bph6, we conducted a genome-wide microarray analysis of NIL-BPH9 and 9311 at the early stage of BPH infestation.

DESIGN
Leaf shealth of resistant and susceptible rice plants were collected at 0(without BPH infestation),6, 48h by BPH infestation for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL2025 [Rice] Affymetrix Rice Genome Array
