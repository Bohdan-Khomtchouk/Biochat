TITLE
HMGA2/TET1/HOXA9 pathway regulates breast cancer growth and metastasis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HMGA2, Tet1 and HOXA9 are all regulated human breast tumorigenesis. We use gene expression array analysis to identify and compare the genes regulated by HMGA2, Tet1 and/or HOXA9 in human breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from 1833 cells with HMGA2-depletion, Tet1-expression or HOXA9-expression. Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays were performed to detail the gene expression and identify the genes regulated by HMGA2, Tet1 and HOXA9 in human breast cancer cells.
