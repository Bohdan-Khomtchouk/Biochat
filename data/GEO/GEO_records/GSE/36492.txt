TITLE
Expression data from the adipose tissue of mice fed a normal diet and a high fat diet.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify novel Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPARg) responsive secretory and/or transmembrane genes that is related to obesity, we integrated the expression data from the adipose tissue derived from obese mice with the other two data sets: expression profiling of adipocyte differentiation using ST2 cells and siRNA-mediated knockdown of Pparg during ST2 cell adipogenesis. We used microarrays to detect the up-regulated genes in adipose tissue derived from mice fed a high fat diet compared to a control.

DESIGN
Total RNA from adipose tissue was obtained and from mice fed a high fat diet HFD32 (MOUSE_HFD) from 6 week-old to 18 week-old, or a normal diet CE-2 (MOUSE_ND) as a control. Pooled RNAs of each three animals were analyzed by the Affymetrix GeneChip microarray system.
