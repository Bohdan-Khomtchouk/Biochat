TITLE
Methanococcus maripaludis response to hydrogen limitation

ORGANISM
Methanococcus maripaludis

SUMMARY
Methanococcus maripaludis is a methanogenic Archaea that conserves energy from molecular hydrogen to reduce carbon dioxide to methane. Chemostat grown cultures limited for hydrogen, phosphate, or leucine were compared to determine the regulatory response to hydrogen limitation. This was done by comparing hydrogen limited cultures to both leucine limited and phosphate limited cultures. Slow and rapid growing samples limited for either hydrogen or phosphate were compared to determine the regulatory effects of growth rate. Keywords: archaea, hydrogen, leucine, phosphate, nutrient limitation, growth rate, methanogen
