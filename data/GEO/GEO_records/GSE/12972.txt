TITLE
Heterogeneous in vitro effects of doxorubicin on gene expression in primary human liposarcoma cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Doxorubicin is considered one of the most potent established chemotherapeutics in the treatment of liposarcoma; however, the response rates usually below 30%, are still disappointing. This study was performed to identify gene expression changes in liposarcoma after doxorubicin treatment. Cells of 19 primary human liposarcoma were harvested intraoperatively and brought into cell culture. Cells were incubated with doxorubicin for 24 h, RNA was isolated and differential gene expression was analysed by the microarray technique. We used microarrays to detail the global  gene expression changes following doxorubicin treatment of primary liposarcoma cell cultures Keywords: response to chemotherapeutic agent
