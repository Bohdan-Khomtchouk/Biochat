TITLE
Expression difference between osteoarthritic chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells during chondrogenic differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells in order to reconstruct damaged cartilage of osteoarthritis joints is a challenging tissue engineering task. Vision towards this goal is blurred by a lack of knowledge about the underlying differences between chondrocytes and MSC during the chondrogenic cultivation process. The aim of this study was to shed light on the differences between chondrocytes and MSC occurring during chondral differentiation through tissue engineering. As a model we used the pellet culture system under chondrogenic conditions for the comparison of chondrocyte and MSC differentiation. Immunohistology was followed by microarray analysis, which was filtered through already published datasets describing different developmental processes. Validation was performed with quantitative RT-PCR. Results describe inferior chondrogenic ECM-production by MSCs and underline their closer link to the osteogenic lineage. Chondrocytes have an upregulated fatty acid/cholesterol metabolism which might give hints for future modifications of culture conditions.

DESIGN
To shed light on the differences between chondrocytes and MSC occurring during chondral differentiation through tissue engineering, a pellet culture system under chondrogenic conditions for the comparison of chondrocyte and MSC differentiation was used after  0, 3, 7 and 14 days
