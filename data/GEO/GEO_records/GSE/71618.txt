TITLE
Expression data from DD neurons isolated from early L1 stage C. elegans larvae.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Six DD class GABAergic neurons are generated in the embryo to synapse with ventral muscles and receive input from cholinergic neurons in the dorsal nerve cord. After hatching and toward the end of the first larval (L1) stage, DD neurons reverse polarity (i.e., synapse with dorsal muscles, receive ventral cholinergic inputs). Expression profiles were generated from DD neurons in the early L1 stage before the initiation of the remodeling program. We used microarray analysis to detect transcripts with potential roles in DD remodeling.

DESIGN
We used FACS to isolate ttr-39::mCherry labeled DD GABAergic motor neurons from a synchronized population of L1 larvae and amplified and labeled total RNA to generate Affymetrix Genome Array data. The DD data sets were compared to an expression profile obtained from all cells in a matched population of synchronized L1 larvae. See Spencer et al. PLOS One 9, e112102 (2014).
