TITLE
Placental ischemia induces changes in gene expression in chorionic tissue

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of differentially expressed genes from rats undergoing placental ischemia versus health controls Placental ischemia is believed to be an important contributor to human preeclampsia, though the targets induced by the ischemia remain unclear.

DESIGN
Chorionic placental tissues from 6 control and 6 placental ischemic reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) rats were analyzed for gene expression by microarray.
