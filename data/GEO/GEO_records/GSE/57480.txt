TITLE
Inducible PAX5 expression in a human B lymphoblastic leukemia cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hypomorphic mutations of the transcription factor PAX5 occur in one third of B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs). To identify PAX5-regulated genes in B-ALL, here we employ inducible expression of PAX5 in a human B-ALL cell line (REH) that harbors a loss-of-function mutation in PAX5. In this model, inducing PAX5 expression is associated with competitive disadvantage.

DESIGN
Comparison of REH cell lines with Dox-inducible expression of PAX5-IRES-GFP, or control GFP alone. GFP positive cells were isolated by FACS.
