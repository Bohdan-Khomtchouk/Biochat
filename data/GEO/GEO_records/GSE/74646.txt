TITLE
Comprehensive Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs in Purified Cell Types from the Brain Reveals Functional LncRNA in OPC Fate Determination (OLIG2 Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in mouse neural stem cells)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To better understand the OLIG2 binding site in the whole-genome of mouse neural stem cells, ChIP was performed using 107 mouse neural stem cells. The ChIP-Seq library was constructed by using DNA SMART ChIP-Seq Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech) and was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencer.

DESIGN
OLIG2 Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in mouse neural stem cell.
