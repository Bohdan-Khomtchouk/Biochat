TITLE
Expression data from Dicer and Ago2-knockdown HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dicer and Argonaute2 (Ago2) gene is involving in microRNA (miRNA) maturation. Knockdown of these genes has great impact on miRNA expression profiles. We used microarrays to detail the miRNA expression profiles in Dicer- and Ago2-knockdown HeLa cells and demonstarted that the significant difference between Ago2-knockdown and Dicer- and Ago2-co-knockdown HeLa cells were not found.

DESIGN
Hela-shDicer cells, which inducibly express shDicer by Dox treatment, were cultured in Dox-containing medium for 48 h, followed by transfection with siControl or siAgo2. After 48 h incubation, the cells were collected and the miRNA expression profiles were in the cells analyzed by the miRNA microarray analysis.
