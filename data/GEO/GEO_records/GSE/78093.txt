TITLE
Silcening RAC1 expression suppresses the proliferation of colon cancer cells by inducing gene differentially expressed.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study,RAC1 expression was silenced by RNA interference in colon cancer cell lines, and investigate the correlation between RAC1 expression and colon cancer proliferation,and differential expressed genes were analized by gene assay and qPCR technologe.The proliferation and colony formation ability of colon cancer cells were significantly reduced after RAC1 knockdown. More 1200 known genes were found to be involved in the RAC1 functions related tumorigenesis by genechip analysis, these genes related to cell proliferation/apoptosis and cell cycle process. qRT-PCR results showed an expression pattern consistent with that of the genechip analysis.

DESIGN
Lentivirus-mediated RNA interference was used to knockdown RAC1 expression in colon cancer cell lines. And cell proliferation assays . GeneChip analysis were carried out for mRNA expression profiling, followed, the expressed levels of mRNA and protein were measured by Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot, respectively.
