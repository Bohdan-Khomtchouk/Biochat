TITLE
Synthetic circuits for tracking human cell fate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cells respond heterogeneously to DNA damage. We engineered genetic circuits to detect differential responses in a population that persist for many days post-stimulus. We used microarrays to compare memory and non-memory subpopulations 3 days after DNA damage or doxycycline exposure.

DESIGN
MD12/p53R2-RE and MD10/TetOx2 cells were either exposed to UV (10uJ/m^2) or doxycycline (1 ug/mL, 24 hours) and allowed to recover 3 days before sortng of memory and non-memory cells and RNA extraction. Two replicates were submitted for each condition (UV memory, UV non-memory, dox memory, dox non-memory)
