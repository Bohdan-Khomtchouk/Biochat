TITLE
A map of open chromatin in human pancreatic islets

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing of genomic regions isolated using FAIRE (Formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements) from three purified pancreatic islet samples For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
Identification of nucleosome-depleted genomic regions in three human pancreatic islet samples This work was carried out in the laboratories of Jason Lieb and Jorge Ferrer, and was supported in part by a subcontract to J. Lieb from Greg Crawford's ENCODE grant.
