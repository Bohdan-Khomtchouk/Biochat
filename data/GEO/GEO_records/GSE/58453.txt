TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of Wild-Type FVB/NJ Mouse Primary Cardiomyocyte and Cardiac Nonmyocyte Polyadenylated RNA and small RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cells from three adult, wild-type, FVB hearts were separated into cardiomyocyte and nonmyocyte fractions using Langendorff perfusion, collagenase digestion and gravity filtration. Total RNA was prepared immediately from myocytes, while nonmyocytes were passaged twice to yield a culture from which total RNA was prepared.

DESIGN
6 cardiac polyadenylated RNA (mRNA and lncRNA) and small RNA (microRNA) profiles of isolated cardiomyocytes (CM) and nonmyocytes (fibro) from 12-wk FVB/NJ mouse hearts were generated on Illumina HiSeq 2000 instruments.
