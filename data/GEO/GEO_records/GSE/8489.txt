TITLE
ChIP-chip analysis of transcription factors GABP, SRF, TAF, and NRSF on Affymetrix whole genome tiling arrays 2.0R

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As part of the ENCODE consortium project (NIH, NHGRI), we conducted genome-wide location analysis for various transcription factors in various cell types.  The long-term goal of this project is to determine the function of each DNA nucleotide in the genome.  Measurement of transcription factor binding events is an important part of this effort.  Here we measure genome-wide binding events for a variety of important transcriptional regulators. Keywords: ChIP-chip
