Expression data from human stem cell memory (TSCM) CD8+ T cells induced by Notch signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adoptive T-cell immunotherapy provides a promising approach to cancer therapy. Stem cell memory T (TSCM) cells have been proposed as a new class of memory T cells that possess longevity and a high proliferative potential. It has been shown that CD8+ TSCM cells can be generated in vitro from naïve CD8+ T cells via Wnt signaling; however, the methods for inducing TSCM cells from activated or memory T cells remain to be developed. Here, we established a new strategy for generating TSCM-like cells in vitro (designated as “iTSCM” cells) from activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mice and humans by coculturing with stromal cells expressing a Notch ligand. These iTSCM cells lost PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression and produced a large number of tumor-specific effector cells after restimulation. The present study illustrates a novel approach to generating a large number of antigen-specific effector T cells for adoptive immunotherapy.

DESIGN
For all samples, total RNA was isolated using a ReliaPrep RNA Cell Miniprep System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).  Microarray analysis was performed using fragmented and labeled with a Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit, one-color and hybridized to SurePrint G3 Mouse Gene Expression 8x60K (Agilent), all according to the respective manufacturer's instructions.
