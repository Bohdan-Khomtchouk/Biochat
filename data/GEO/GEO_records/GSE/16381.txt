TITLE
Cytoprotective Nrf2 pathway is induced in chronically Txnrd1-deficient hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Metabolically active cells require robust mechanisms to combat oxidative stress.  The cytoplasmic thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin (Txnrd1/Txn1) system maintains reduced protein dithiols and provides electrons to some cellular reductases, including peroxiredoxins. Here we generated mice in which the txnrd1 gene, encoding Txnrd1, was specifically disrupted in all parenchymal hepatocytes. Keywords: Triplicate comparisons, two conditions.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analyses on whole mouse livers.
