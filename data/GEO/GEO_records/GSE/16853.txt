TITLE
Expression data from Foxl2 wild-type and mutant ovaries and testes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Foxl2 is a forkhead transcription factor expressed only in the female, but not in the male gonad. We have created mice homozygous mutant for the Foxl2 gene (KO) as well as mice carrying a conditional mutant Foxl2 allele (floxed). The expression profiles of conventional Foxl2 knockout and wildtype ovaries were compared at P3, using the Affy Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array. Adult wildtype and conditional mutant (Foxl2 floxed x RosaCre-EBD treated with tamoxifen) ovaries were compared to adult wildtype testes using the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. Both experiments (KO/WT P3 and Mutant/WT/Testis Adult were also compared to each other.)

DESIGN
Ovaries from newborn (postnatal day 3) and adult (8 week old) mice were excised from the animal and RNA was prepared from whole ovaries (Adult testes were excised and RNA was isolated from 1/4 testis).
