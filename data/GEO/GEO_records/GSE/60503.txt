TITLE
A Comparison of Whole Genome Gene Expression Profiles of 0p-EpSCs and 15p-EpSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate successful maintenance of skin epithelial stem cells (EpSCs) in vitro using Wnt-3a, we prepared CD49f+CD34+ cells, an EpSC-rich population from adult mouse skin and cultured for 10 days in the presence of Wnt-3a. Sorted CD49f+CD34+ cells proliferated markedly in the presence of Wnt-3a. Those cells were then subjected to a second 10-day culture with Wnt-3a and sorted, with the same procedures repeated until fifteen 10-day cultures were performed.

DESIGN
A dye-swapped experiment was performed by hybridizing complimentary RNA (cRNA) labeled with either Cyanine (Cy) -3 or Cy-5 onto 4X44K ver.2 Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarray (G4846A).

PLATFORM
