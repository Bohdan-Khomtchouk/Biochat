TITLE
dRNA-seq data of the Streptomyces venezualae WT and mutant (sven6563::apr (rsrR::apr)) strains at time point 16 h

ORGANISM
Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712

SUMMARY
We report here the sequence results of S. venezualae WT and the mutant sven6563::apr (rsrR::apr) strains at 16h and the differential expression profile of WT vs. Mutant.  Additionally we report the resulting TSSAR analysis of the transcriptional start site information for the genes expressed at this time point.

DESIGN
WT vs RsrR::apr mutant at 16h.  Total RNA was isolated and processed by vertis Biotechnologie AG.  Ribodepletion was carried out to remove ribosomal RNA, the sample split in two, 1 had tex treated to remove processed RNA the other not.  EAch was then converted to cDNA and sequenced.  WT vs Mutant was compared at 16h while the others were used for the purposes of TSS identification.
