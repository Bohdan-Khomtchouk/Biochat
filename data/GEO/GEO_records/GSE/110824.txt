TITLE
Parallel-factor ER ChIP-seq of Breast Cancer PDX Material

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To demonstrate the versatility of parallel-factor ChIP-seq, we applied our method to the analysis of ER binding in five patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples.

DESIGN
Parallel-factor ChIP-seq makes use of a second antibody to provide an internal normalisation. Five samples were analysed using a combined ER/CTCF pull down. Pull down efficiency was normalised to CTCF.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
