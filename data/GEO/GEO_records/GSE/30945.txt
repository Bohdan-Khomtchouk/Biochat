TITLE
The use of non-amplified RNA samples for gene expression analysis by sensitive microarray.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were compared based on the rounds of sample RNA amplification procedure.

DESIGN
The intra- and inter-method reproducibility was shown by comparing gene expression profiles from two micoarray data. For the repeatability, CVs calculated from multiple microarray data were compared between different amplification methods. The accuracy of each method was estimated from the correlation with RT-PCR results when the same samples were assayed. The range of differential expression was shown using the brain RNA samples derived from an Alzheimer and non-Alzheimer donors.
