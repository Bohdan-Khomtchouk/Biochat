TITLE
Changes in global gene expression in SIN1 knock-out murine epithelial fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA from wt and SIN1 knock-out MEF cell lines were compared Using affymetrix murine gene chip, the effects of SIN1 ablation on global gene transcription were assessed

DESIGN
RNA from wild type and SIN1 knock out cells was purified and differences in gene expression between the two sets. MEFs were derived from C57BL/6 (Jacinto et. al. Cell. 2006 Oct 6;127(1):125-37. Epub 2006 Sep 7
