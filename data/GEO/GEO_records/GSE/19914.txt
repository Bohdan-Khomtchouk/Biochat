TITLE
Identification of post-generation effect of MDMA on the mouse brain by large-scale gene expression analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The expression analysis of the brain of F1 pups, after maternal ingestion of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 20mg/kg), resulted in significant transcriptional changes in both male and female pups.

DESIGN
In this study, in order to investigate whether maternal ingestion of MDMA and prenatal exposure to MDMA affects the transcriptional configuration of the brain of offspring, we assessed large-scale gene expression changes in the mouse brains of mice exposed to long-term ingestion of MDMA in utero.
