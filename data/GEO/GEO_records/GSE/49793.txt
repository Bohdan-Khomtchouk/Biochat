TITLE
Transcriptional consequences of manipulating the candidate schizophrenia susceptibility gene miR-137 in human neural progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the largest published genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia to date (PGC1), the most significant association (P = 1.6 X 10-11) was observed at an intronic variant (rs1625579) within the MIR137 host gene (MIR137HG). In this study we have performed genome-wide RNA profiling of a human foetal neural progenitor cell line following miR-137 manipulation, in order to identify gene expression changes through which genetic variation at the MIR137HG locus could confer susceptibility to schizophrenia.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from human neural progenitor cells manipulated with either mir137 inhibitor or mimic. 4 replicates per group. Genome wide transcript levels were then measured using gene expression microarrays.
