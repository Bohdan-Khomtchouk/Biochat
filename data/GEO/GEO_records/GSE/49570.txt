TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of REST-bound sites in human CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq to identify genome-wide REST (NRSF) binding in the human CD4+ T cells. The data were compared to REST occupancy in additional 15 human cell types analyzed by the ENCODE project (GSE32465) in order to study the dynamics and context-dependent functions of REST-chromatin interaction.

DESIGN
Identification of REST binding by ChIP-seq in human CD4+ T cells.
