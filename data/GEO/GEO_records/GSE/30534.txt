TITLE
Expression of obese mice subjected to diet induced weight loss for 60 days

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to study the gene expression dynamics during caloric restricted weight loss in obese mice after feeded with high fat diet. C57BL/6J male mice were placed on a high fat diet at 10-11 weeks of age in individual cages and kept on the diet until they reached ~ 41 g. After all the baseline (41g) measurement were made, each mouse  was fed 75% of their ad libitum food intake in two divided daily " meals " .  The high fat diet was maintained.

DESIGN
Mice were sacrificed after 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 or 42 day of caloric restriction. Hypothalamus, liver, abdominal subcutaneous adipose, mesenteric adipose, perirenal adipose and perigonadal adipose tissues were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
