TITLE
Expression profiling of human medulloblastoma cell line ONS76 upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of KDM5A/LSD1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KDM5A/LSD1 is an important epigenetic regulator in medulloblastoma, the most frequent brain tumor of childhood. Here, the response of ONS76 medulloblastoma cells upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of KDM5A is analysed.

DESIGN
The expression profile of ONS76 cells upon KDM5A knockdown was compared to mock control. Both conditions were run in triplicate.
