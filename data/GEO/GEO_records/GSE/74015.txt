TITLE
Gene expression from splenic cells in response to VSV-M2 and ligands to RIG-I and MDA5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
VSV-M2 is recognized by cytosolic RIG-I. Notably, 5'-triphosphate RNA molecules derived from either viral RNA or from the synthetically produced 3pRNA can also induce RIG-I activation. MDA5 stimulation is achieved using complexed poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of viral dsRNA. To test whether the RIG-I and MDA5 ligands 3pRNA and poly(I:C) can be used in their complexed structures to decipher RNA virus-induced sickness behavior in vivo, we first compared the tissue-specific signaling pathways after systemic challenge with VSV-M2 and the RIG-I and MDA5 ligands, respectively. A whole-genome expression analysis using splenic cells was carried out using an Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.1 ST Array.

DESIGN
Adult wt mice were injected with either VSV-M2, 3pRNA or complexed poly(I:C); 18h (VSV) or 24h later spleens were removed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix arrays.
