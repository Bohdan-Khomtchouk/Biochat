TITLE
Differential microRNA expression profiles of mouse lungs infected with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus and seasonal H1N1 virus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further understand the molecular pathogenesis of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus infection, we profiled cellular miRNAs of lung tissue from BALB/c mice infected with influenza virus BJ501 and a mouse-adapted influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1)(PR8) as a comparison.

DESIGN
Five groups of mice were selected, and three of each group were used to profile the miRNA, two were in case for unqualified RNA extraction. Whole lungs from mice infected by BJ501 or PR8  were harvested on 2,5 days post infection (dpi), and compared with lung samples from 5 uninfected mice.
