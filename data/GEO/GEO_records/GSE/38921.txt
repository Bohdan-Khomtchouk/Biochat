TITLE
Mouse expression data of epididymal white adipose tissue at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 18 comparison control vs. Sleep restriction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hybridzed cRNA from epididymal white adipose tissue collected at ZT18 of control animals and TSR animals (TSR: these mice were sleep restricted for 6 hours every day by gentle handling for 5 consecutive days and killed on the last day at ZT18) mice used in this study were C57BL/6

DESIGN
control mice were compared to timed sleep restriction mice (TSR: these mice were sleep restricted for 6 hours every day by gentle handling for 5 consecutive days and killed on the last day at ZT18)
