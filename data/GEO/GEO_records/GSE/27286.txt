TITLE
Human ependymoma samples, Subgrouping [aCGH - German Cancer Research Center human 33K BAC array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole-genome array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of human ependymoma tumors. DOP-PCR products were spotted in triplicate onto NexterionTM Slide E epoxysilane-coated slides (PEQLAB, Erlangen, Germany) using a spotting robot (VersArray ChipWriterTM Pro system,BioRad, Munich, Germany) at 20C and 40% humidity. After spotting, slides were cross-linked,baked for 1 hr at 80C, and cross-linked again.

DESIGN
Fresh frozen tumor material was collected during tumor resection. Copy number aberrations represent the status at diagnosis.
