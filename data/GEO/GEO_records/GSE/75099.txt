TITLE
p190 RhoGAP mediates contact inhibition of cell proliferation by repressing YAP1-mediated gene transcription

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Recently, ARHGAP35 encoding p190A RhoGAP was unexpectedly found to rank among the 20-30 most frequently mutated genes in human cancer.  The spectrum of mutations in ARHGAP35 is consistent with that of a tumor suppressor, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood.  In this work we sought to elucidate functions for p190A RhoGAP (p190A) and its isoform p190B RhoGAP (p190B) that might confer tumor suppressor capacities in epithelial cells.  We establish an essential role for p190A and p190B to mediate contact inhibition of cell proliferation (CIP).  Both p190A and p190B localize in part to adherens junctions, which is consistent with a role in CIP.  Using an unbiased approach, we determine that p190A and p190B repress expression of a cassette of genes that are modulated by the Hippo pathway.  Moreover, we demonstrate that p190A and p190B promote activation of LATS kinases and inhibit translocation of the Hippo transducer YAP to the nucleus.  Next, we validate that expression of an activated form of YAP induces a gene signature with significant similarities to that of cells depleted of p190A and p190B expression.   Furthermore, we establish that p190A and p190B promote CIP by repressing YAP-TEAD-mediated gene transcription.  Collectively, our results demonstrate that p190 RhoGAPs serve as activators of the Hippo pathway, which is widely implicated in CIP.   Our work suggests that ARHGAP35 belongs to group of tumor suppressor genes, including AJUBA, CDH1, and NF2, with gene products that localize to cell-cell junctions and modulate the activity MST/LATS complex.

DESIGN
TR-T10 cells, as well as retroviral and lentiviral 293 packaging cells, were all propagated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. To permit inducible knockdown of p190A and or p190B expression, TR-T10 cells were transduced with retrovirus encoding p190A shRNA or p190B shRNA and cells then selected in hygromycin (p190A shRNA) or puromycin (p190B shRNA).  To generate TR-T10 cells with combined knockdown of p190A and p190B, p190B-kd cells were transduced with retrovirus encoding p190A shRNA and cells were selected in hygromycin.  To induce knockdown of gene expression, cells were plated at subconfluent density and cultured for 3 days in the presence of 4 µg/ml of doxycycline.  Cells were then harvested and replated at subconfluent or confluent density for another 3-5 days prior to experimentation. TR-T10 or p190A+B-kd cells with inducible expression of YAP5SA or YAP5SA+S94A were generated by lentiviral transduction and selected with 3 mg/ml G418. In cells with p190A+B-kd, expression of YAP5SA or YAP5SA+S94A is linked to knockdown p190A and p190B, as both are under control of the TetR.
