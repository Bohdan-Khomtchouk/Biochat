TITLE
Comparison of simple mutants gcn5 and hd1 and double mutant gcn5 hd1.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs05-09_histone-acetylase - gcn5 - Different genes show an opposed expression profile in gcn5 compared to hd1. For these genes, the double mutant might show an expression similar to the wild type.  - gcn5, hd1 or double mutant gcn5hd1 were grown on MS during 10 days (1.03 boyes stage). Keywords: gene knock out

DESIGN
3 dye-swaps - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL4346 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.2
