TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Yap mutant kidneys

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to examine gene expression changes between control and mutant (YapCM-/-) kidneys to investigate molecular changes responsible for abnormal nephrogenesis seen in Yap mutants. This work identifies a list of potential genes regulated by Yap during nephron development.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from three mutants and three controls kidneys at embryonic day E13.5 were used for the expression profiling analysis.
