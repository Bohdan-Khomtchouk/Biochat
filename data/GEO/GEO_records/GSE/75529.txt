TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Tetranychus urticae and Its Sibling Species Tetranychus cinnabarinus Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Tetranychus urticae

SUMMARY
Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG) between the treated samples of mites.The goal of the study is to elucidate the invasion mechanism that results in the continuous expansion of Tetranychus urticae that has occurred in China. Methods:Transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing is becoming  an attractive method as it facilitates rapid generation, identification  and quantification of large number of transcripts,  even in the species where no prior genome sequence information  is available. Results:the expression of 10 P450(cytochrome P450 monooxygenases), 6 GST(glutathione S-transferases), 13 CCE(carboxy/cholinesterases) and other novel candidate genes was higher ( > 2-fold) in T. urticae than in T. cinnabarinus as detected by using the digital gene expression (DGE) method.

DESIGN
T .cinnabarinus and T. urticae, which were exposed to abamectin, fenpropathrin and tebufenpyrad, and preexposed mites were used for constructing RNA-seq libraries. The experiment was performed with three biological replicates, resulting in total of 24 RNA-seq libraries for sequencing.
