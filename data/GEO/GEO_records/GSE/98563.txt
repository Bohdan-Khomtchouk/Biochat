TITLE
TREM2 is a global regulator of microglia energetic and biosynthetic metabolism during steady state and in Alzheimer’s disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The most common form of senile dementia, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is  characterized by Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the CNS.  AD genetic studies have identified high-risk hypomorphic variants in TREM2, a myeloid cell surface receptor that enables concerted microglial responses to Aβ plaques and neuronal cell death, including proliferation, survival, clustering and phagocytosis. How TREM2 promotes these responses is not known. Here, we demonstrate that TREM2 drives mTOR signaling, which maintains high ATP levels, supports biosynthetic pathways and suppresses AMPK phosphorylation and autophagy. In vitro, TREM2-deficient macrophages undergo dramatically increased autophagy and die in response to growth factor limitation or ER stress. Excessive autophagy is also evident in microglia from Trem2-/- 5XFAD mice and in post-mortem specimens from AD patients carrying TREM2 risk variants. Metabolic derailment, autophagy and cell death can be circumvented by engaging alternative energy production pathways. Thus, restoring microglial energetic and anabolic levels may be a future therapeutic avenue for TREM2-associated neurological disease.

DESIGN
Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from WT and Trem2–/– mice were cultured in either 0.5% or 10% LCCM overnight in complete RPMI. Some samples cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml LPS for 4 hours.
