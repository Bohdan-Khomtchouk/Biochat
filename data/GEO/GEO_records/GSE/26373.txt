TITLE
High-throughput mapping of he promoters of the mouse olfactory receptor genes reveals a new type of mammalian promoters

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We map the transcription start sites of 1085 murine olfactory receptor genes and analyze putative promoters The bar files contain MAT analysis of RLM-RACE products hybridized to a custom olfactory genome tiling array.

DESIGN
RNA from the olfactory epithelia of adult mice was prepared by RLM-RACE. Olfactroy receptor transcripts were amplified by degenerate priming and hybridized to tiling arrays to map 5' transcript structure.
