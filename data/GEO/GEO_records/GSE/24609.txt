TITLE
FT1 and FT2 network analysis in poplar

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides ; Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
We conducted microarray experiments by comparing constitutive and inducible Flowering Locus T1 (FT1) and FT2 constructs with appropriate controls, followed by the identification of common targets of Pro35S:FT1 and ProHSP:FT1 or Pro35S:FT2 and ProHSP:FT2.

DESIGN
Independent samples of leaf tissues were collected from 1- to 2-year-old plants. Each replication represents an individual plant from one of the treatment lines. RNA was extracted from tissues and hybridized on the Affymetrix GeneChip Poplar Genome Array.
