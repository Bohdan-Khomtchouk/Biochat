TITLE
Cell type and culture condition-dependent alternative splicing in human breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used splicing-sensitive microarrays to detect differences in alternative splicing between two breast cancer cell lines MCF7 (estrogen receptor positive) and MDA-MB-231 (estrogen receptor negative), as well as cultured human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). Several splicing alterations in genes, including CD44, FAS, RBM9, HnRNPA/B, APLP2, and MYL6, were detected by the microarray, and verified by RT-PCR. We also compared splicing in these breast cancer cells cultured in either two-dimensional flat dishes (2-D) or in three-dimensional Matrigel (3-D) conditions. Only a subset of the splicing differences that distinguish MCF7 cells from MDA-MB-231 cells under 2-D culture condition is retained under 3-D conditions, suggesting that alternative splicing events are influenced by the geometry of the culture conditions of these cells.
