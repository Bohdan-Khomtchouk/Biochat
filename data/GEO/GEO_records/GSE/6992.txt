TITLE
Expression data from a paraquat time course experiment in wild type and SoxR deficient strains

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
SoxR and SoxS constitute an intracellular signal response system that rapidly detects changes in superoxide levels and modulates gene expression in E. coli. A time series microarray design was used to identify co-regulated SoxRS dependent and independent genes affected by superoxide Keywords: time course
