TITLE
Identification of Gon4l-associated genomic regions by DamID-seq

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We report DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID)-sequencing data to identify Gon4l-associated genomic regions in wild-type (WT) tailbud (TB) stage zebrafish embryos. Methylated, and therefore Gon4l-proximal, gDNA was isolated from embryos expressing a Gon4l-Dam fusion and compared to that from embryos expressing GFP-Dam control.

DESIGN
gDNA sequencing from WT embryos expressing Gon4l-Dam or control GFP-Dam with biological triplicates.
