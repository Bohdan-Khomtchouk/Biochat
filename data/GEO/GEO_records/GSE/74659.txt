TITLE
SCL and LMO1 reprogram thymocytes into self-renewing cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The SCL and LMO1 oncogenic transcription factors reprogram thymocytes into self-renewing pre-leukemic stem cells (pre-LSCs). Here we report that SCL directly interacts with LMO1 to activate the transcription of a self-renewal program coordinated by LYL1.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of thymocytes from SCL-LMO1 transgenic and age-matched non transgenic Cd3Îµ-/- mice were compared to identify candidate genes that confer self-renewal capability to pre-leukemic thymocytes.
