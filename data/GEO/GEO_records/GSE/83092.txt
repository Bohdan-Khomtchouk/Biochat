TITLE
Expression data from Tip110 transgenic mouse blastocyst-derived outgrowths

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LONG SUMMARY: In this study, we aimed to characterize the function of Tip110 in embryonic development and in mESC survival and self-renewal using a Tip110+/- mouse model. Mating these mice produces wild-type, Tip110+/-, and Tip110-/- offspring. Tip110-/- offspring die early in mouse postimplantation development and mESCs cannot be derived from Tip110-/- blastocysts. Array analysis was performed to gain a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms at play and to appreciate the biological role of Tip110 in embryo and ESC development. SHORT SUMMARY: We used microarray analysis to detail the global program of gene expression in Tip110-/- outgrowths compared to their wild-type counterparts to gain a better understanding of the biological role of the Tip110 protein in embryonic development and mESC survival and self-renewal.

DESIGN
Mouse blastocysts were flushed from the uterine horns of pregnant females at 3.5 dpc after successful Tip110+/- intercrosses. Blastocysts were cultured in knockout serum replacement embryonic stem cell media for 4-6 days before isolating RNA. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays (WTA 1.0, Mouse). We collected many embryos from both natural matings and superovulations and generated cDNA from 1-2 ul of RNA to confirm whether each was wild-type, Tip110+/-, or Tip110-/-.  The Veriquest One-Step qR-PCR Quantification Assay from Affymetrix was used to quantify the RNA from wild-type and Tip110-/- outgrowths. 100 pg of RNA was used per sample.
