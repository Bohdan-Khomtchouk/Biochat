TITLE
Identification of cytokine signals regulated by Caspase-9

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide transcriptional profiles of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPCs)-enriched population derived from bone marrow chimeras reconstituted with Caspase-9 or Bak and Bax deficient fetal liver cells. Gene ontology analysis revealed changes in the expression of genes associated with interferon responses.

DESIGN
HSPCs (Lineage-Kit+CD45.2+) were flow sorted from the femur and tibia of bone marrow chimeras 12-16 weeks post transplant of 2 million embryonic day (E) 13.5 fetal liver cells. Total RNA was isolated and up to 250 ng of total RNA per sample was labelled and hybridized to Illumina Mouse WG6V2 expression BeadChip platform. Three independent samples were used for each population.

PLATFORM
