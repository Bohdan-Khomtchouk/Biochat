TITLE
Identification of the genes regulated by maternal Ovo-B in PGCs in Drosophila melanogaster.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To identify downstream genes which was regulated by maternal Ovo-B in PGCs, we compared the transcriptomes between OvoA-expressing PGCs and control PGCs by microarry analysis in Drosophila melanogaster. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate PGCs from the stage 16 embryos carrying the transgene, EGFP-vasa, which expresses GFP specifically and continuously in the germline throughout the life cycle.

DESIGN
RNAs from FACS-sorted OvoA-expressing PGCs and control PGCs from the stage 16 embryos were hybridized to microarray after Cy3 labling.
