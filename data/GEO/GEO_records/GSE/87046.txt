TITLE
Sox11 expression in adult retina promotes regeneration of some ganglion cell types but kills others

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
At least 30 types of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) send distinct messages through the optic nerve to the brain. Strategies for promoting regeneration of RGC axons following injury act on only some of these types. Here we tested the hypothesis that over-expressing developmentally important transcription factors in adult RGCs could reprogram them to a “youthful” growth-competent state and promote regeneration of other types. From a screen of transcription factors expressed by developing RGCs, we found one, Sox11, that induced substantial axon regeneration. Transcriptome profiling confirmed that Sox11 activates genes involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and axon growth. Remarkably, alpha-RGCs, which preferentially regenerate following treatments such as PTEN deletion, were killed by Sox 11. Thus, Sox 11 promotes regeneration of non-alpha RGCs, which are refractory to PTEN. We conclude that Sox11 can reprogram adult RGCs to a growth-competent state and that different growth-promoting interventions act on distinct neuronal types.

DESIGN
We compared transcriptomes of retinal ganglion cells between AAV-Control retinas, and retinas treated with AAV-Sox11 overexpression. We then performed optic nerve crush, and 3 days later purified RGCs using FACS. RGCs were marked with Thy1-PE-Cy7 antibody and with live/dead cell staining. We performed sample preparations in full triplicate, and in each replicate we always performed Control and Sox11 on the same day, in alternating order.
