TITLE
The DYRK1A kinase positively regulates angiogenic responses in endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Angiogenesis is a highly regulated process essential for organ development and maintenance, and its deregulation contributes to inflammation, cardiac disorders and cancer. The Ca2+/Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) signaling pathway is central to endothelial cell angiogenic responses, and it is activated by stimuli like the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF). NFAT phosphorylation by dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKs) is thought to be an inactivating event. Contrary to expectations, we show that the DYRK family member DYRK1A positively regulates VEGF-dependent NFAT transcriptional responses in primary endothelial cells. DYRK1A silencing reduces intracellular Ca2+ influx in response to VEGF, which dampens NFAT activation. The effect is exerted at the level of VEGFR2 accumulation leading to impairment in PLCg1 activation. Notably, Dyrk1a heterozygous mice show defects in developmental retinal vascularization. Our data establish a regulatory circuit, DYRK1A/ Ca2+/NFAT, to fine-tune endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis.

DESIGN
RNA microarray analysis using VEGF-stimulated HUVECs infected with lentivirus expressing a control shRNA or a shRNA targeting DYRK1A. To discriminate the NFAT-dependent group of genes, VEGF-stimulated cells in the presence of the CN/NFAT inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) were analyzed.
