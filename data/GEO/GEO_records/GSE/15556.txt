TITLE
Systematic and single cell analysis of Xenopus Piwi-interacting RNAs and Xiwi

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis ; Xenopus tropicalis

SUMMARY
Various small RNA libraries from purified microtubules or Xiwi immunoprecipitates or total extract from X.tropicalis or X.laevis egg extract.   Various small RNA libraries from single X.tropicalis eggs. Analysis of this series of files is described in the manuscript " Systematic and single cell analysis of Xenopus Piwi-interacting RNAs and Xiwi " .

DESIGN
Small RNAs were ligated with linkers and converted to cDNA by reverse transcription.  cDNA library was amplified by PCR and was sequenced with either the 454 Genome Sequencer FLX platform or the Illumina GA-II platform.
