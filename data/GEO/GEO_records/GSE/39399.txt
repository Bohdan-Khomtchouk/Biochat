TITLE
Ribosomal biogenesis genes play an essential and p53-independent role in pancreas development

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptional profiles in Sbds(ATG) MO-injected embryos with and without coinjection of p53(ATG) MO. We identified a large number of changes in transcript abundance associated with loss of Sbds.  Among the 24,278 annotated zebrafish genes in the platform, 4,892 significantly differentially expressed genes were identified.

DESIGN
Embryos were carefully staged at 24 hpf and RNA was extracted from approximately 50 embryos per condition in Trizol, followed by purification using RNA miniprep columns (Qiagen).  Four independent experiments were extracted.  cDNA microarrays were performed at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins Microarray Core Facility using 4x44K Zebrafish gene expression microarray slides (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).
