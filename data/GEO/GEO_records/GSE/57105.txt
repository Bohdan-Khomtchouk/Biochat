TITLE
Wip1 regulates adult neurogenesis and Wnt signaling during aging

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The number of newly-formed neurons declines rapidly during aging. Here we describe an important mechanism that contributes to this decline via Wip1-dependent regulation of neuronal differentiation. We found that Wip1 is expressed in neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) of the mouse subventricular zone and its upregulation at physiological levels maintained higher NPC numbers and neuronal differentiation in old mice. This resulted in markedly improved neuron formation and rescued a functional defect in fine odor discrimination in old mice. We identified Dkk3 as a key downstream target of Wip1 and found that its expression in SVZ is restricted to NPCs. Functionally, Dkk3 inhibited neuroblast formation by suppressing Wnt signaling, while deletion of Dkk3 or pharmacological reactivation of the Wnt pathway improved neuron formation and olfactory function in aged mice. We propose that Wip1 controls a Dkk3-dependent inhibition of neuronal differentiation during aging and thus regulating Wip1 levels could prevent certain aspects of functional decline of the aging brain. We found if neurospheres were derived from 18 months old mice, Wip1 transgenic neurospheres were more neurogenic than wt ones. This microarray was a pilot experiment to search the mechanism how Wip1 Transgene promoted neurogenesis, and found Dkk3 as a potential mediator.

DESIGN
WT vs Wip1Tg neurospheres were cultured from mouse brain, and gene expression was compared using Illumina mouseWG-6 array

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
