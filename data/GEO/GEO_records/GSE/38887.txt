TITLE
PrPC-dependent gene expression and cell signalling signature in Neuro2a cells. Role on mitogenic stimulation and cell morphology.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this work we present the PrPC-dependent gene expression signature in N2A cells and its implication on the most overrepresented functions; cell cycle, cell growth and proliferation and cell morphology.

DESIGN
To evaluate the genes whose transcription was regulated after Prnp modulation, RNA samples were analyzed with Illumina mouse whole genome beadarrays. cell type comparison; genetic modification; RNA interference

PLATFORM
GPL6105 Illumina mouse-6 v1.1 expression beadchip
