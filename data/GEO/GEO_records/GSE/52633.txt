TITLE
MicroRNA Marker Based Prognostication of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of our study was to discover a miR marker panel prognostic of 5-year survival in OSCC patients that may be utilized in parallel with the current clinical covariates. We assessed differential expression of miRNAs genome-wide via deep sequencing in 20 tumor tissue samples. We also attempted to identify deregulated miR expression signatures that may serve as the prognostic marker of cancer survival. Selected miR marker-based panel then may serve as a guide for selection of appropriate follow-up chemo/radiation treatment, significantly improving the clinical management of OSCC and the overall survival rate.

DESIGN
Identify miRs differentially expressed in the poor prognosis group compared to the good prognosis group
