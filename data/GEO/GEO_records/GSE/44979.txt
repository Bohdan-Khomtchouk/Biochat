TITLE
Methanopyrus kandleri small RNA analysis

ORGANISM
Methanopyrus kandleri AV19

SUMMARY
We report the profiling of small RNAs from Methanopyrus kandleri by high throughput sequencing. Over 83 million Illumina Hi Seq2000 reads were obtained for six independent RNA libraries. The reads were mapped to the M. kandleri AV19 genome (Genbank: NC_003551, 1694969 bp). The small RNome of M. kandleri was analyzed.

DESIGN
