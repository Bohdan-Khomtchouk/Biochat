TITLE
Unexpected growth-promoting effect of oxaliplatin in ERCC1-transfected human colon cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The nucleotide excision repair protein ERCC1 has been repeatedly shown to be involved in the sensitivity of cancer cells to platinum derivatives. In order to better understand this process, we transfected HCT-116 cells with a plasmid encoding ERCC1 and studied their in vitro and in vivo behaviour. The Trop2 protein was identified as being potentially involved in the underlying mechanism for these observations. Our results suggest complex regulation of signalling in cancer cells exposed to cancer drugs.

DESIGN
Analysis of gene expression of Hcont cells (Stable HCT-116 cells transfected with control plasmid) and Hercc1 cells (Stable HCT-116 cells transfected with ERCC1-coding plasmid) in cells from tumors grown in mice treated or not with oxaliplatin (2 mg/kg) two hours before the recovery of tumors. The experiment was performed in triplicate
