TITLE
Genome-wide expression study of the CD11b+  subsets of dermal myeloid cells and their migratory counterparts in the draining lymph node

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Numerous CD11b+ myeloid cells are present within the dermis. They are very heterogeneous and can be divided in dermal DCs, tissue monocytes and tissue macrophages. At steady state, only CD11b+ DC migrate from the dermis to the skin draining lymph nodes whereas upon DNFB-induced inflammation, CD11b+ DC as well as dermal monocytes migrated to the lymph nodes. The objective of this study was to use gene expression profiling to rigorously identify the different subsets of dermal CD11b+ myeloid cells at steady state and upon inflammation and to characterize their functional potential.

DESIGN
This study includes data from DC, monocytes and macrophages purified by flow cytometry sorting from the blood (monocytes only), dermis and the cutaneous lymph nodes (migDC and mig mono) of WT C57BL6 mice, under steady-state or upon DNFB-mediated inflammation. Three independent replicates were made for each cell type, from three independent pools of mice,  and were hybridized on 3 separate batches of gene chips Affimetrix 1.0ST.
