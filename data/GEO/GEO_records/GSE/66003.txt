TITLE
Gene expression profile of intact and hypophysectomized adult male and female mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in intact and hypophysectomized adult mouse liver was assayed by RNA-seq analysis of total liver RNA, as part of a study of growth hormone regulation of hepatic lincRNAs.

DESIGN
Eight independent pools: two intact males, two intact females, two hypophysectomized males and two hypophysectomized females, comprised of total RNA isolated from 3-5 individual livers / pool, were prepared and used for unstranded RNA-seq.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
