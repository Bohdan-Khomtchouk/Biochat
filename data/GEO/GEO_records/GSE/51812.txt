TITLE
Identification of chondrocyte subsets during human development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Joint injury and osteoarthritis affect millions of people worldwide, but attempts to  generate articular cartilage using adult stem/progenitor cells have been unsuccessful.  We hypothesized that recapitulation of the human developmental chondrogenic  program using pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) may represent a superior approach for  cartilage restoration. Using laser capture microdissection followed by microarray  analysis, we first defined a surface phenotype  (CD146low/negCD166low/negCD73+CD44lowBMPR1B+) distinguishing the earliest  cartilage committed cells (pre-chondrocytes) at 5-6 weeks of development; pellet  assays confirmed these cells as functional, chondrocyte-restricted progenitors. Flow  cytometry, qPCR and immunohistochemistry at 17 weeks revealed that the superficial  layer of peri-articular chondrocytes was enriched in cells with this surface phenotype.  Isolation of cells with a similar immunophenotype from differentiating human PSCs  revealed a population of CD166negBMPR1B+ putative pre-chondrocytes. Functional  characterization confirmed these cells as cartilage-committed, chondrocyte  progenitors. The identification of a specific molecular signature for primary cartilagecommitted  progenitors may provide essential knowledge for the generation of purified,  clinically relevant cartilage cells from PSCs.

DESIGN
A total of 15 samples were analyzed.  In the first comparison, there were 6 biological replicates for both the chondrogenic condensations and total limb cells.  In the second comparison, three biological replicates of chondrocytes from the articular region were compared to the 6 replicates of the condensations.
