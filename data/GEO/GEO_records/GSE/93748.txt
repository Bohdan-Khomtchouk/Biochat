TITLE
Identification of target genes of TAZ in the prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found that the transcriptinal co-activator TAZ is a basal cell marker for the prostate epithelium which is lost in the prostate cancer tissues and re-expression of TAZ in the prostate cancers may be a indicator of malignancy. TAZ promotes cell migraiton, EMT and metastasis in the prostate cancers. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we performed the RNA-seq analysis of TAZ knockdown DU145 cells using two independent TAZ shRNA and pLKO control cells.

DESIGN
Two TAZ knockdown DU145 cells using two independent TAZ shRNA and two pLKO control DU145 cells were used for RNA-seq.
