TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of endometrial tissues following GnRH agonist treatment in a mouse adenomyosis model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: We sought a transcriptomic analysis of endometrial tissues following GnRH agonist treatment in a mouse model Methods: The neonatal female mice were randomly divided into three groups: control group, adenomyosis group and GnRH agonist treatment group. The pregnant outcome was observed and compared among the three groups. Besides, endometrial tissues from Day 4 of pregnancy were transcriptomic analysed using bioinformatics approaches. Results:We found that the litter size was smaller in adenomyosis group than control group (8±0.28vs. 11±0.26; P＜0.05).However, the average live litter size was increased (10±0.28 vs.8±0.28; P＜0.05) after GnRH agonist treatment. Transcriptomic analysis showed that compared with the adenomyosis group, 359 genes were differentially expressed in the GnRH agonist treatment group: 218 were down regulated and 141 were up regulated.Gene function analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were related to diverse biological processes, including estrogen metabolism, cell cycle, and metabolites biosynthesis. Conclusions: GnRH agonist can improve the pregnancy outcome of adenomyosis in mouse model. Besides pituitary down regulation effect, other possible mechanisms may play role in GnRH agonist treatment, e.g., regulate cell proliferation cycle. It may be useful for the further understand the the mechanisms of the GnRH agonist in adeomyosis treatment.
