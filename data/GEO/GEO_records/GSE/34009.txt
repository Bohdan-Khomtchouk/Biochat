TITLE
Comparative expression profile of Porphyromonas gingivalis parent strain W83 and the HU protein (PG0121) mutant during exponential growth in rich medium.

ORGANISM
Porphyromonas gingivalis

SUMMARY
HU protein regulates expression of genes involved in cell-division, iron acquisition, and transcriptional regulation in Porphyromonas gingivalis

DESIGN
Analysis involved RNA extracted from the parent strain W83 and the PG0121 (HU protein) mutant during exponential growth in rich medium. Each of the four experiments used a different preparation of RNA. Comparative expression profiles were determined by hybridizing the microarray slide with a mixture containing equal amount of cDNA generated from each strain. Dye swap experiments were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL4309 JCVI PFGRC Porphyromonas gingivalis 10K v2 array designed primarily based on strain W83
