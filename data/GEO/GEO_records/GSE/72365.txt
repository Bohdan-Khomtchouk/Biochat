TITLE
Mouse lung tissue transcriptome response to influenza H5N1 [miRNA] (AmbryGenetics)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA, miRNA, proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and histopathology analysis in mouse lung infected with WT A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1; 'VN1203').

DESIGN
Groups of 22-week-old C57BL/6 mice were infected with WT A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1; 'VN1203'). Infections were done at 10^4 PFU/mouse in 50 Î¼l PBS. Time points were 1, 2, 4, and 7 d.p.i. There were 5 mice for all infection groups and 3 mice for all mock groups. Lung samples were collected for virus load, transcriptional and proteomics analysis. Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.

PLATFORM
