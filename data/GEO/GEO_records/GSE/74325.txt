TITLE
Identification and characterization of kidney-enriched long intergenic non-coding RNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to provide functional data of kidney-specific long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNA), loss-of-function study was conducted.

DESIGN
Using HEK-293 cells, we performed microarray experiments for siRNA-mediated silencing of LOC440173 and PAXIP1-AS1.
