TITLE
Gene expression analysis of mESCs following short-term inhibition with PD032, CHIRON, EPZ6438 and GSK-J4 both individually and in combination.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to determine the extent of gene misregulation in mouse ESCs cultured for 24hrs in different base medias and treated with the indicated inhibitors.

DESIGN
Polyadenylated mRNA from mESCs cultured in the indicated culture conditions was hybridised as three independed biological replicates to Agilent SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarrays (GPL10787). Individual replicates for each of the specified conditions were performed in HV H2b-mCh, HV9.3 and HFHC12.3 cell lines.

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
