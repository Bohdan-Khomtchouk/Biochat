TITLE
Effects of knockdown of Jmjd6 on human umbilical vein endothelial cells - gene and exon expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated for 48 h after transfection of scrambled siRNA or siRNA targeting Jmjd6 . Changes in transcript and exon levels were analyzed.

DESIGN
6 samples; 2 conditions: Scrambled siRNA vs. siJmjd6 ; 3 replicates per condition
