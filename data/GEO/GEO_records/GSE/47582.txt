TITLE
miRNA expression in primary renal carcinomas, subgrouped based on HIF1α expression

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common type of renal cancer is often associated with inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene von-Hippel Lindau (VHL), leading to stable expression of hypoxia inducible factors, HIF1α and HIF2α. Although HIF1α functions as a tumor suppressor gene, majority of ccRCCs constitutively express HIF1α, stratifying VHL-deficient ccRCCs into groups which express either both HIF1α and HIF2α (H1H2) or HIF2α exclusively (H2). MicroRNA (miRNA) profiling performed in these two ccRCC subtypes to identify novel molecular mechanisms.
