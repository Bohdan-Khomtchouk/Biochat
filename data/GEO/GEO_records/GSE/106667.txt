TITLE
RT quantitative PCR analysis of inflammasome related genes in mice choclea after noise exposure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Six month-old wild type and Igf1 heterozygous mice were exposed to a violet swept sine noise (frequency range 2–20 kHz) at 110 dB SPL for 30 minutes. Cochlear samples were taken at 2 and 24 hours post-noise exposure to study the evolution of the expression of  inflammation genes by using PCR arrays and RT-qPCR. Six month-old wild type and Igf1 heterozygous mice not exposed to noise were used as control.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. Cochlea samples from 3 animals per group were analised.  The expression of genes related to inflammation was studied at 2 and 24 hours post-noise exposure.
