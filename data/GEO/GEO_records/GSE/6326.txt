TITLE
Histone H3 K4,36,79R 0 hr

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Total RNA from two replicate cultures of wild-type and mutant strains was isolated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix arrays. Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by H3 K4,36,79R mutant.  Cells were grown in galactose media to give the 0 hour timepoint. Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
Histone H3 K4,36,79R time course. Cells were grown in galactose media and then shifted to glucose media, which repressed the expression of wild-type histone H3, leaving the histone H3 K4,36,79R mutant as the sole source of histone H3 protein in the cell. Total RNA was isolated from replicate cultures of wild-type and mutant histone H3 at various time points after the shift to glucose media (0, 6, and 9 hours). Expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix arrays. Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by H3 K4,36,79R mutant.
