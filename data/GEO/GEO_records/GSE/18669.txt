TITLE
Analysis of murine hematopoieitic stem cells, multipotent progenitors, PreMegE progenitors and mature CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An investigation of the global gene expression signatures of murine hematopoietic stem cell differentiation during steady state hematopoiesis. This data compliments the miniChIP-chip data obtained from the same cell types as described in Weishaupt et al., 2009 (Blood).

DESIGN
An Affymetrix genechip study using total RNA recovered from three separate FACS isolated HSC and MPP samples. The HSC and MPP gene expression data was analyzed alongside the PreMegEs and CD4+ T cells datasets obtained from our previous work (Pronk et al., 2007, Rolf et al. 2008). HSCs are phenotypically identified in bone marrow as lineage-, cKit+, Sca1+, CD150+, Flk2/Flt3- (LSKCD150+ cells). MPPs are phenotypically identified in bone marrow as lineage-, cKit+, Sca1+, CD150-, Flk2/Flt3+ (LSKCD150- cells). PreMegEs are phenotypically identified in bone marrow as lineage-, cKit+, Sca1-, CD150+, CD105- and CD41- as described in Pronk et al., 2007. Splenic-derived CD4+ T cells are phentypically identified as CD4+, CD8-, B220-, Nk1.1- cells as described in Rolf et al., 2008.
