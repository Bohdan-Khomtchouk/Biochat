TITLE
EZH2 inhibitor efficacy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma does not require suppression of H3K27 mono-methylation [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we report the discovery of highly potent and selective EZH2 small molecule inhibitors, their validation by a cellular thermal shift assay, their application across a large lymphoma cell panel and their efficacy in GCBDLBCL xenograft models.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of KARPAS-422 cell line RNA, in duplicate, treated with DMSO as control, and EZH2 inhibitors CPI360, EPZ-6438 and GSK126. Eight samples in total.
