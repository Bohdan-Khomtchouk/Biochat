TITLE
Cerebrospinal fluid microRNAs are potential biomarkers of temporal lobe epilepsy and status epilepticus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common intractable form of epilepsy in adults and status epilepticus (SE) is the most severe form of seizure that can be non-convulsive and is then difficult to diagnose. Diagnosis of both conditions is principally based on clinical examination and history, often depending on EEG and imaging. A molecular biomarker of these two conditions would be transformational in supporting both diagnoses.Cerebrospinal fluid offers an alternative source of microRNA biomarkers with the advantage of being in closer contact with the target tissue and sites of pathology. The present study indicates cerebrospinal fluid may contain microRNA biomarkers of TLE and SE and offers insights into trafficking mechanisms of biofluid microRNAs that may further enhance diagnostic value.

DESIGN
microRNA expression in the CSF of 15 patients with headache, 15 pateints with TLE and 15 pateints with SE was measured by TaqMan OpenArray Human MicroRNA Panel.
