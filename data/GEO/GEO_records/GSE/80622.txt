TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of WT and NOD1 knockout zebrafish (PI3K-AKT)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zebrafish larvae from WT and NOD1-1IS-/- collected at 10 dpf were used for Zebrafish PI3K-AKT Signaling Pathway RT2 Profiler PCR Array.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. Larvae from WT and NOD1-deficient zebrafish were collected at 10 dpf.Three biological replicates were performed for the WT and NOD1-deficient zebrafish. 200~250 larvae per replicate were pooled and used for gene expression analysis.
