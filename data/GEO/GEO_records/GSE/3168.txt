TITLE
Genes modulated by DNA demethylation in UM1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1 mediates DNA demethylation. Using a human oral cancer cell line, UM1, genes induiced by DNA demethylation were screened. To verify the methylation status of those induced genes, the gene expression profile was compared with that of 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine treated sample. Keywords: DNA demthylation, ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1, 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine

DESIGN
Preparation of samples, hybridization process and data analysis were performed according to the manufacture's protocol (BD Biosciences). To verify the genes induced by ornithine decarboxylase antizyme via DNA demethylation, 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine treatment was carried out as a parallel experiment.
