TITLE
Genes modulated by DNA demethylation in UM1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1 mediates DNA demethylation. Using a human oral cancer cell line, UM1, genes induiced by DNA demethylation were screened. To verify the methylation status of those induced genes, the gene expression profile was compared with that of 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine treated sample. Keywords: DNA demthylation, ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1, 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine
