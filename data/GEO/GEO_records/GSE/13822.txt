TITLE
Growth temperature response in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Moderate increases in the ambient temperature promote hypocotyl growth in Arabidopsis, and this response is totally dependent on the proper activity of the auxin, gibberellin, and brassinosteroid pathways. We have analyzed global the changes in gene expression that occur in Arabidopsis seedlings after a moderate increase in the growth temperature (20ºC to 29ºC for 2 hours). In order to understand how the different hormone pathways affect this growth response, the same transcription profiling analysis was conducted in seedlings deficient in each hormone. Keywords: Growth condition

DESIGN
We performed three replicas of each sample category: wild type mock-treated, wild type PAC-treated, wild type NPA-treated, and det2-1 mutants. Samples transferred from 20ºC to 29ºC of replicas #2 and #3 were labelled with Cy3, whereas those kept at 20ºC were Cy5-labelled. Samples of replica #1 were reversed-labelled.
