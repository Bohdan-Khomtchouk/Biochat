TITLE
FACS sorting of human adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adipose tissue from 6 non-obese patients was collagenase treated and adipocytes separated from the stromal vascular fraction(SVF). SVF was then FACS sorted for the following fractions CD45-/CD34+/CD31+ (endothelial), CD45-/CD34+/CD31- (progenitor), CD45+/CD14+ (monocyte/macrophage), CD45+/CD14-(Leukocyte). RNA was isolated from adipocyte, SVF, progenitor, macrophage/monocyte and leukocyte fractions and analyzed on the Affymetrix Human Transcriptome 2.0 array. We also sorted SVF from an additional 13 (10 non-obese, 9 obese) patients and sent progenitor RNA for Affymetrix Human Transcriptome 2.0 array analysis.
