TITLE
Analysis of DNA methylation in a three-generation family reveals widespread genetic influence on epigenetic regulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess variation and inheritance of genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation simultaneously in humans, we applied reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to somatic DNA from six members of a three-generation family.

DESIGN
Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing was applied to genomic DNA from leukocytes of 6 family members and two unrelated individuals.
