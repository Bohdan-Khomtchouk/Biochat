TITLE
Gene expression profiles of fibroblasts from childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy patients and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although not an affected cell type, skin fibroblasts from individuals with childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD), an early onset X-linked neurological disorder, show defects in very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) metabolism that provide the basis for clinical diagnostic tests. We report the gene expression profiles of fibroblasts from childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy patients and healthy controls

DESIGN
Primary dermal fibroblast cultures from 5 CC-ALD patients and 5 healthy controls were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 37Â°C with 5% CO2 until confluence for RNA extraction. The overall goal was to identify genes that are differentially expressed between CCALD patients and healthy controls
