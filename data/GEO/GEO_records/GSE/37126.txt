TITLE
Portrait of early-onset breast cancer in Brazilian patients: germline mutation screening of BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 genes and tumor expression profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differentially expressed genes between BRCA1/BRCA2 negative and positive mutation driven-tumors.

DESIGN
Screening for germline mutations was performed in a cohort of 55 patients under the age of 35 years in the BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 (c.del1,100C) and TP53 genes, and the respective tumors were investigated regarding hormonal receptors status, HER2 expression. Transcriptional profiles were performed using Agilent one color hybridizations in a G4112F platform.

PLATFORM
