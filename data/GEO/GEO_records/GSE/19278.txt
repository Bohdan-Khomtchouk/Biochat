TITLE
S100P is a metastasis-associated gene that facilitates transendothelial migration of pancreatic cancer cells [HG-U133_Plus_2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We and others have shown that S100P is highly upregulated during the progression of pancreatic cancer. We used microarrays to look at the target genes regulated by S100P in the pancreatic cancer cell line Panc1. Keywords: Gene overexpression

DESIGN
We generated stable cell lines by introducing control vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His or S100P-overexpressing vector pcDNA3.1/S100P-V5-His into the pancreatic cancer cell line Panc1, single cell clones were then isolated. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We looked for new target genes regulated by S100P.
