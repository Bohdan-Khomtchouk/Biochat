TITLE
Rhesus monkeys challenged with H. pylori and ENNG

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Gene expression was studied in samples from the stomach of Rhesus monkeys that have been infected with Helicobacter pylori and treated with a known carcinogen (Ethyl-nitro-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG)) that is similar to known nitrosamine dietary carcinogens. The samples represent the following: Biopsy 4689 is from animal 81G taken 55 months after inoculation with H. pylori and the start of the carcinogen ENNG Biopsy 4691 is from animal 63G taken 55 months after inoculation with H. pylori and the start of the carcinogen ENNG Biopsy 4709 is from animal 92F taken after 55 months of observation and no treatment (control). Gastric biopsies were obtained at the indicated times and RNA was harvested from the sample. All hybridizations were conducted against a common reference that was prepared using commercially obtained RNA isolated from the stomach of uninfected monkeys.

DESIGN
Infection: Inoculated with H. pylori and treated with carcinogen ENNG (Treated) or control
