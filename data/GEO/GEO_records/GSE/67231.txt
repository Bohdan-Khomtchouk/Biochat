TITLE
Small RNAs during E. invadens stage conversion

ORGANISM
Entamoeba invadens

SUMMARY
We analyzed ~27nt small RNAs from Entamoeba invadens trophozoites, 24h cysts, 72h cysts, and excysting cells (8h)

DESIGN
E. invadens trophozoites were induced to encyst by incubation in low glucose media, and parasites harvested at 0, 24 and 72h. A subset of the 72h cysts were induced to excyst, and parasites harvested at 8h. Total RNA was extracted for each sampleand small RNA libraries constructed and sequenced as below
