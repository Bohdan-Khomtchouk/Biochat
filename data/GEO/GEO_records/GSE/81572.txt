TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of NMB0419 mutant of Neisseria meningitidis MC58

ORGANISM
Neisseria meningitidis MC58

SUMMARY
Neisseria meningitidis is an obligate commensal colonising the human nasopharynx and occasionally invades the bloodstream causing life-threatening meningitis and septicaemia. The gene NMB0419 on the genome of N. meningitidis MC58 encodes a putative Sel1-like repeat (SLR) containing protein, which has been implicated in mediating meningococcal invasion of epithelial cells. We prepared RNA samples from N. meningitidis MC58 (WT) and its isogenic mutant of NMB0419 grown to log phase in in-vitro culture. The RNA samples were subjected to RNA sequencing. The resulting transcriptomes were compared to determine the genes that differentially expressed in NMB0419 mutant.

DESIGN
RNA samples werer prepared from three biological replicates for NMB0419 mutant strain and wild type (WT) MC58 strain and were subjected to paired comparison between NMB0419 mutant and WT strain.
