TITLE
Plasma Long Noncoding RNA and mRNA Expression Profile of Crohn’s Disease identified by Microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a genome-wide analysis of lncRNA expression to identify novel targets in Crohn's disease (CD). Samples obtained from CD patients and control were analyzed using Arraystar human 8×60K lncRNA/mRNA v3.0 microarrays chips to find differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs; The results were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified through fold-change filtering. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analyses were performed using standard enrichment computational methods.

DESIGN
We performed a genome-wide analysis of lncRNA expression to identify novel targets for the further study of Crohn's disease. 3 CD samples(D1-3) and 3 control samples (C1-3) were obtained .
