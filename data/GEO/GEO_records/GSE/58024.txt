TITLE
EDHB treated KYSE170

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the gene expression profiles of KYSE170 cell line to identify distinct up and down-regulated genes during treatment with ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate.

DESIGN
KYSE170 cell line were treated with 50Î¼g/ml EDHB for 12 hrs and selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to gene expression profiles of KYSE 170 cell line treated with ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate.
