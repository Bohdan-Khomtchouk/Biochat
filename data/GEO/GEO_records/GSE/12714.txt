TITLE
Genotyping data from 54 patients with deficit schizophrenia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disease with complex etiology, affecting approximately one percent of the general population. Most genetic studies so far focused on disease association with common genetic variation such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, but recently it has become apparent that large-scale genomic copy number variants (CNVs) are involved in disease development as well. To assess the role of rare CNVs in schizophrenia, we screened 54 patients with deficit schizophrenia using Affymetrixâ€™ GeneChip 250K SNP arrays. Keywords: genomic hybridisation

DESIGN
We hybridized genomic DNA of 54 patients with deficit schizophrenia to Affymetrix' GeneChip 250K SNP (Nsp) arrays, and identified genome-wide CNV using the Copy Number Analyzer for Affymetrix GeneChip (CNAG v2.0) software, which uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithm to calculate copy numbers.
