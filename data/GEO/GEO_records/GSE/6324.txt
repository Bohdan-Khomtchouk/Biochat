TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression from MDA-MB-231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used human Affymetrix microarrays to identify the up- or down-regulated gene expressions from MDA-MB-231 cells infected with control vector or Flag-SR-IkBa Keywords: microarray

DESIGN
The pattern of gene expression from MDA-MB-231 cells transduced with retroviruses were analysed by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. From expression profiles, we identified NF-kB target genes, and uncovered a novel and specific role of a gene in osteolytic bone metastasis.
