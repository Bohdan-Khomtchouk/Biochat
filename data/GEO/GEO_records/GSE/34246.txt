TITLE
Genome-wide Identification of Polycomb Target Genes Reveals a Functional Association of Pho with Scm in Bombyx mori

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are involved in chromatin modifications for maintaining gene repression that play important roles in the regulation of gene expression, tumorigenesis, chromosome X-inactivation, and genomic imprinting in Drosophila melanogaster, mammals, and even plants. PcG proteins act together in three multimeric complexes, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and Pleiohomeotic repressive complex (PhoRC), to repress transcription of the target genes. Here, we identified Polycomb target genes in Bombyx mori using genome-wide expression screening based on the knockdown of the BmSCE, BmESC, BmPHO, or BmSCM gene, which represent the distinct complexes. As a result, most genes were up-regulated after knocking down these four PcG genes, which indicated a potential epigenetic mechanism on the regulation of these genes expression by the PcG system. The further analysis of our data will provide some important information for the regulation mediated by PcG proteins in Bombyx mori.

DESIGN
Transcription profiling experiments, knockdowns of four Polycomb genes (four samples) in  silkworm BmN4-SID1 cells, were analyzed. Dual-channel experiments, with test samples labeled by Cy5 and common reference samples labeled by Cy3. The common reference sample, knockdown of the EGFP gene in BmN4-SID1 cells, was used for data normalization. One biological replicate. No dye-swaps.
