TITLE
Expression data from primary breast tumors (Auckland)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Frozen tissue specimens from primary breast tumors were collected and profiled using Affymetrix U133 plus 2 expression microarrays. A publication describing the generation of these data is not yet available. However, these data can be used alongside other Affymetrix breast tumour data sets to form large meta-cohorts for breast cancer research, as was done in Lasham et. al. J Natl Cancer Inst. 2012 Jan 18;104(2):133-146.

DESIGN
Frozen tumor tissues comprising of > 60% tumor cellularity were extracted for total RNA and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
