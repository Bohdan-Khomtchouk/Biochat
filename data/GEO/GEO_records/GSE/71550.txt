TITLE
A comprehensive microRNA expression profile related to hypoxic adaptation in Tibetan pig

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In this study, miRNA-seq technique was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) in cardiac muscle of the Tibetan pig (TP) and Yorkshire pig (YP), which were both raised in highland environments. We obtained 108 M clean reads and 372 unique miRNAs that included 210 known pre-miRNAs and 162 novel pre-miRNAs. In addition, 20 DE miRNAs, including 10 upregulated and 10 downregulated miRNAs, were identified by comparing TP and YP. Based on the expression abundance and differentiation between the two populations, we predicted their targets, and KEGG pathway analyses suggested that DE miRNAs between the Tibetan pigs and Yorkshire pigs are involved in hypoxia-related pathways, such as the MAPK, mTOR, and VEGF signaling pathways, cancer-related signaling pathways, etc. Five DE miRNAs were randomly selected to validate the veracity of miRNA-seq using real-time PCR. The results showed that the expression corresponds to the trend in miRNA-seq, hence the deep-sequencing methods were feasible and efficient. This study expanded the number of hypoxic-adaptation-related miRNAs in pig and indicated that the expression patterns of hypoxia-related miRNAs are significantly altered in the Tibetan pig. DE miRNAs may play important roles in hypoxic adaptation after migration to hypoxic environments.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 6-month old Tibetan pig (TP) and Yorkshire pig (YP) were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Hiseq 2000.
