TITLE
Role of Gα(olf) in Familial and Sporadic Adult-Onset Primary Dystonia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression studies were performed to identify pathways possibly dysregulated by mutant in the gene Gα(olf). These experiments employed RNA derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines established for 4 affected carriers and 4 non-carriers. In comparison to endogenous control and other dystonia-associated genes, GNAL was expressed at relatively low levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines.

DESIGN
Comparison of whole blood expression profiles of mutation carrying dystonia patients with normal controls
