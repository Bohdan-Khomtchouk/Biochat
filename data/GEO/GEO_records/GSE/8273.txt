TITLE
Interplay between MAMPs-triggered and SA-mediated defense responses

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis Pathoarray 464_001 (GPL3638) was used to compare response of Col-0, pad4-1 (Zhou et al., 1998; Jirage et al., 1999) and sid2-2 (Wildermuth et al., 2001) to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 hrcC mutant. SA production is drastically reduced in sid2 mutants. PAD4 is required for SA-mediated responses. The results suggested that the SA increase triggered by MAMPs is one major component in the MAMPs-triggered signaling mechanism. Keywords: Responses of Arabidopsis to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 hrcC mutant
