TITLE
Copy number analysis of familial and sporadic Epithelial Ovarian Carcinomas (EOC) from FFPE tissue on high resolution Agilent platform.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was conducted in order to characterize genomic instability level and pattern in hereditary and sporadic ovarian tumours and define common and/or distinct events occurring in the genesis and evolution of these neoplasms.

DESIGN
Overall study comprises 68 epithelial ovarian cancer samples (53 familial and 15 sporadic cases) on high resolution 4x180K Agilent platform.
