TITLE
Response of Drosophila cell lines to 5 hr ecdysone treatment

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The changes in transcript titers are described for different Drosophila cells following 5 hr treatment with 20-hydroxyecdysone. Keywords: hormone response

DESIGN
RNA from ecdysone-treated cells was compared to RNA from cells treated with carrier alone. A total of 3-13 slides were analyzed for each cell line.  Each slide represents separate biological sample; dye-swaps were included.
