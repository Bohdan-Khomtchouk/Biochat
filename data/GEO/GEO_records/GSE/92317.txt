TITLE
Transcriptome assay of maternal mRNA degradation in ERK-deleted oocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the functions of ERK in maternal mRNA degradation in mouse oocytes. By comparing the degradation of transcripts in WT oocytes and KO oocytes, we are able to know the defects in maternal mRNA clearance in ERK-deleted oocytes, and identified the ERK target genes in oocyte maturation.

DESIGN
a WT GV oocyte, a WT MII oocyte, a Erk-/- GV oocyte and a Erk-/- MII oocyte are performed RNA sequencing.

PLATFORM
