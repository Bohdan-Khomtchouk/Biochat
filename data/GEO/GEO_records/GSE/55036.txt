TITLE
Expression data from skin biopsies in pateints with systemic sclerosis treated with anti-TGF-beta, fresolimumab

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Systemic sclerosis is associated with skin fibrosis thought mediated by TGFb. This open label clinical trial examines the effect of TGFb inhibition on skin gene expression. Patients 1-9 received two doses 1 mg/kg dose of fresolimumab at baseline and 3 weeks; patients 10-19 received a single 5 mg/kg dose

DESIGN
Patients with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis within 2 years of first raynauds had skin biopsies before treatment and the 3-4 weeks, 7 weeks and 24 weeks after treatment with fresolimumab
