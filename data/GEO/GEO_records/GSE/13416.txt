TITLE
Memory T cell RNA rearrangement by hn RNP LL

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Immunological Memory is characterized by a heightened recall response to a previously encountered antigen, resulting from clonal expansion of antigen-specific lymphocytes and differentiation into specialized memory cells. Differentiation of memory B cells involves irreversible encountered antigen, resulting from clonal expansion of antigen-specific lymphocytes and differentiation into specialised memory cells. Differentiation of memory B cells involves irrversible DNA rearrangements and mutations, but differentiation of memory T cells is less understood. In an ENU screen for mouse mutations affecting the proportion of T cells with known memory cell markers, such as the alternative spliced Ptprc isoform CD45RO, we identified an inducible RNA-binding protein of previously unknown function, hnRNPLL (gene symbol Hnrpll), whose mutation abolishes the regulated silencing of CD45RABC exons in T cells and other leukocytes. In the mutant, a single amino acid substitution destabilizes an RNA-recognition domain that binds with micromolar affinity to RNA containing the Ptprc ARS exon silencing sequence. Hnrpll mutations selectively diminishes T cell accumulation in peripheral lymphoid tissues but not proliferation. Exon array analysis of Hnrpll mutant naive and memory T cells reveals an extensive program of alternative mRNA splicing in memory T cells coordinated by hnRNPLL. A remarkable overlap with alternative splicing in neural tissues may reflect a co-opted strategy of RNA rearrangement for achieving immunological memory in T cells.
