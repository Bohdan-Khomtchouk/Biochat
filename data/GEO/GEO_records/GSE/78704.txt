TITLE
BRD4 represses CBX5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BRD4 is amplified and/or up-regiulated in a subset of ovarian cancer which correlates with a poor survival siRNA sensitization screens in the presence of CHK1 inhibitor, LY2606368, identify BRD4 as a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer. BRD4 suppression by either siRNA or using JQ1 increases CBX5 expression

DESIGN
(i) BRD4 knockdown by siBRD4 in Ovcar8, performed in 3 replicates. (ii) BRD4 inhibition using JQ1 in Ovcar8, performed in 3 replicates.
