TITLE
FOG-1-independent transcripition by GATA-1(V205G) in G1E cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of genes regulated by GATA-1 independent of the cofactor FOG-1. Keywords: cell treatment comparison

DESIGN
A conditionally activated FOG-1-binding defective mutant of GATA-1, ER-GATA-1(V205G), was expressed in GATA-1-null G1E cells.  Transcipt levels were compared in cells untreated or treated with estradiol to activate the GATA-1 mutant.
