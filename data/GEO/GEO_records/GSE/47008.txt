TITLE
Solanum torvum transcriptional responses to nematodes

ORGANISM
Solanum melongena ; Solanum torvum

SUMMARY
Solanum torvum Sw is worldwide employed as rootstock for eggplant cultivation because of its vigour and resistance/tolerance to the most serious soil-borne diseasesas bacterial, fungal wilts and root-knot nematodes.  A 30,0000 features custom combimatrix chip was designed and microarray hybridizations were conducted for both control and 14 dpi (day post inoculation) with Meloidogyne incognita-infected roots samples. We also tested the chip with samples from the phylogenetically-related nematode-susceptible eggplant species Solanum melongena.The genes identified from S. torvum catalogue, bearing high homology to knownnematode resistance genes, were further investigated in view of their potential role in the nematode resistance mechanism.

DESIGN
total RNA was extracted from control and 14 days post-infection (infection with root-knot nematode Meloidogyne  incognita)  from roots of Solanum torvum and Solanum melongena. Three biological replicates were used for each condition and genotype for a total of 12 samples.
