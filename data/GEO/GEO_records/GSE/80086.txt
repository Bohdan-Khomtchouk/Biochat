TITLE
ChIP-seq analyses of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 in JMJD3c-hESCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated the human ES lines, in which the genome-wide reduction of H3K27me3 can be induced by the ectopic expression of catalytic domain of histone demethylase JMJD3 with doxycycline treatment (JMJD3c-hESCs). Genome-wide changes in H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 after JMJD3c overexpression were examined by ChIP-seq analyses.

DESIGN
JMJD3c-hESCs were cultured in StemFit AK-03 medium with or without doxycycline. The samples were collected at day 3 after doxycycline treatment.
