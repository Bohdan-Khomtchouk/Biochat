TITLE
Thalamus and hypothalamus response to visual input deprivation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of thalamus and hypothalamus under conditions of visual deprivation by dark-rearing (DR). Animals subjected to DR from birth till postnatal day (P) 14. Results provide insight into the role of visual inputs in the regulation of gene expression in thalamus and hypothalamus during development.

DESIGN
RNA sample was taken from thalamus and hypothalamus of 14-day-old mouse reared in standard or dark condition. Comparisons among groups were made by one-color method with normalized data from Cy3 channels for data analysis.
