TITLE
Expression data from the liver of rat treated by Piperonyl butoxide and Dammar resin

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Several studies have successfully detected hepatocarcinogenicity in rats based on gene expression data. Here, we constructed a model for detecting non-genotoxic (NGTX) hepatocarcinogens and predicted their MOAs in rats. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and Dammar resin (DAM) are NGTX hepatocarcinogens. Gene expression data in the liver treated by PBO and DAM was used for validation of constructed model.

DESIGN
There are four and three dosing groups including control group in PBO and DAM, respectively. The replicates is three samples in each dosing group. Doses for PBO are 0, 500, 1000 and 1500 mg/kg and those for DMA are 0, 800 and 2000 mg/kg.
