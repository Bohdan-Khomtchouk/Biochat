TITLE
Identification of MAF controlled genes in breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify relevant genes transcriptionally controlled by MAF in breast cancer, we focused on genes whose expression changed accordingly to MAF transcriptiion factor overexpression in MCF7. We used comparative RNA hybridization (Affymetrix) to this end.

DESIGN
Total RNA from parental and MAFshort or long isoform overexpressing MCF7 grown for 48 hours in regular media (see growth protocol) was isolated from in vitro cultured control and MAF expressing MCF7 parental cells. Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzolÂ® Plus RNA Purification Kit (Life Technologies).
