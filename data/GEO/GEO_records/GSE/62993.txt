TITLE
Expression data of MYB36 mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We have identified the causal genes, which is MYB36, of ionome mutants. To identify the genes regulated by MYB36, RNAs prepared from two alleles were applied for the micoarray analysis.

DESIGN
Two-weeks old roots grown under normal conditions were applied for the microarray analysis
