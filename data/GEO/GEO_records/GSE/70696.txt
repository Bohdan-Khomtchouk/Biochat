TITLE
Genome wide transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) of adult hippocampal neural stem cells in vitro a.k.a. HCN cells in quiescent and proliferative conditions in non-electroporated or electroporated with control empty vector or REST knock-down shRNA vector

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report the high-throughput transcriptome profiling of induced quiescent (iQNP) and proliferative (TAP) conditions in mammalian adult hippocampal stem cells in culture (HCN cells). By obtaining 145 to 78 million pair-end reads of sequence from isolated RNA from HCN cells in iQNP and TAP conditions. Thereafter, we intersected this gene expression data with REST bound ChIP-seq peaks within +/-10kb of transcription start site of genes also from HCN cells in iQNP and TAP conditions. We find that with +/-10kb of transcription start site of genes, REST efficiently binds neuronal genes and represses them in HCN cells in both iQNP and TAP conditions. Moreover, only in the iQNP REST also binds non-neuronal genes like DNA replication genes. We also report the high-throughput transcriptome profiling of iQNP and TAP condition HCN cells electroporated with a control empty vector or REST knock-down shRNA vector. By obtaining 145 to 78 million pair-end reads of sequence from isolated RNA from HCN cells in electroporated control empty vector or REST knock-down vector in iQNP and TAP conditions. In REST knockdown in iQNP and TAP conditions we found that predominantly non-neuronal genes and neuronal genes were derepressed. This study reveals that in addition to its well known function as a neuronal repressor in non-neuronal tissue, REST can also play other diverse roles in non-neuronal tissues.

DESIGN
Examination of global gene expression or transcriptome in two growth conditions in non-electroporated or with electroporation of a control empty vector or REST knock-down shRNA vector
