TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of  fungus Penicillium oxalicum and its set2 deletion strains

ORGANISM
Penicillium oxalicum

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to compare different gene expressions for Penicillium oxalicum wild type strain (WT), and set2 knockout strain (Δset2) in different carbon sources. The deletion of set2 upregulated genes involved in oxidation- reduction process, extracellular region, and plasma membrane ATP synthesis coupled proton transport both with 2% glucose or 1% cellulose and 1% wheat bran as carbon sources. We find the expression levels of 20 secondary metabolism gene clusters were upregulated or downregulated under different carbon sources in Δset2. This study provides the information that SET2 function are required in conidiation and hydrolase activity of P. oxalicum.

DESIGN
Examination of differential gene expressions by digital gene expression tag profiling in Penicillium oxalicum wild type strain and set2 knockout mutant strains in 24h in modifeid Czapek culture medium with 2% glucose or 1% cellulose and 1% wheat bran as carbon sources.Three replicates were included for each samples.
