TITLE
Expression profile of Imatinib treated BAF3 -BCR-ABL cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BAF3 cells harboring constitutively expressing BCR-ABL were grown with or without IL-3 supplement and treated with Imatinib and live cells from the IL-3 and without IL-3 were sorted by FACS.

DESIGN
Cell growing without growth factor are sensitive to iamtinib and undergo apototis while cells grown with IL-3 are resistant. The expression profile of cells that will undergo death compared to that will survive was compared.
