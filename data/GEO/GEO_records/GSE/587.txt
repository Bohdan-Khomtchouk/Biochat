TITLE
DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in neural stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neurosphere cultures were established from individually isolated E 14.5 forebrains of mouse embryos that carry a bcl2 transgene. Single-cell suspensions were prepared, seeded at 1x105 cells/ml and treated for two days with 150 nM Trichostatin A (TSA; histone deacetylase inhibitor), 500 nM 5-Aza-2â€™-deoxycytidine (AzaC; demethylating agent) or both compounds, or left untreated. Two independent experiments were performed. Keywords: other
