TITLE
Cfp1 is required for gene expression dependent H3K4me3 and H3K9 acetylation in embryonic stem cells (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) accumulates at promoters in a gene activity dependant manner. The Set1 complex is responsible for most H3K4me3 in somatic cells and contains the conserved subunit Cfp1, which is implicated in targeting the Set1 complex to CpG islands in mammals. In mouse embryonic stem cells, Cfp1 is necessary for H3K4me3 accumulation at constitutively active gene promoters, but is not required to maintain steady-state transcription of the associated gene. Here we show that Cfp1 is instrumental for targeting H3K4me3 at promoters upon rapid transcriptional induction in response to external stimuli. Surprisingly, H3K4me3 accumulation is not required to ensure appropriate transcriptional output but rather plays gene specific roles. We also show that Cfp1 dependant H3K4me3 deposition contributes to H3K9 acetylation genome wide; suggesting that Cfp1 dependant H3K4me3 regulates overall H3K9 acetylation dynamics and is necessary for histone acetyl transferase recruitment. Finally, we observe increased antisense transcription at start and end of genes that requires Cfp1 for accurate H3K4me3 and H3K9ac deposition. Our results assign a key role for Cfp1 in establishing a complex active promoter chromatin state and shed light on how chromatin signalling pathways provide context dependant outcomes.

DESIGN
wt (wtES) or Cfp1-/- (Cfp1null) ES cells were treated or not with doxorubicin (Dox) at 1uM for 6h and rRNA depleted total RNA was prepraed and analyzed by strand-specific RNA-Seq in 2 biological and 2 technical replicates per condition.
