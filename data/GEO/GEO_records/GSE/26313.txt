TITLE
Targeting of mitochondrial Hsp90 with Gamitrinib, G-TPP, in U251 glioblastoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
U251 gliolbastoma cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or G-TPP, a mitochondrial targeted version of 17-AAG. 6 hours after treatment RNA was harvested and subjected to microarray analysis on Human Gene 1.0 ST Array.

DESIGN
We sought to determine a mitochdondrial gene response after targeting inhibition of mitochondrial chaperones, Hsp90.
