TITLE
Effect of SRSF2 over-expression in a human lung carcinoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We showed that the over-expression of the SR protein SRSF2 led to the regulation of transcript abundance of many genes.

DESIGN
H358 cell line with 6 samples with SRSF2 over-expression and 6 samples as control.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
