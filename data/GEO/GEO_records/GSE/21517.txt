TITLE
ADAM13 knockdown in Xenopus laevis cranial neural crest

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
ADAMs are transmembrane metalloproteases that control cell behavior by cleaving both cell adhesion and signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic domain of ADAMs can regulate the proteolytic activity by controlling the subcellular localization and/or the activation of the protease domain. Here we show that the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM13 is cleaved and translocates into the nucleus. Preventing this translocation renders the protein incapable of promoting cranial neural crest (CNC) cell migration in vivo, without affecting its proteolytic activity. In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM13 regulates the expression of multiple genes in the CNC. This study shows that the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM metalloproteases can perform essential functions in the nucleus of cells and may contribute substantially to the overall function of the protein.

DESIGN
Total RNA from cranial neural crest explants dissected from Xenopus laevis embryos at stage 15 to 17. Embryos were injected with either control morpholino (CMO), morpholino to ADAM13 (MO13) or MO13 and a fusion between GFP- and the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM13 (GFP-C13). Triplicate microarray correspond to independent experiments labeled DA4, DA5 and DA2. For each sample 1 is CMO, sample 2 is MO13 and sample 3 is MO13+C13. Embryos were injected with 10 ng of morpholino and 0.5 ng of GFP-C13 mRNA. Supplementary files: [1] matrix2_sig-genes.txt CNC array: Genes significantly affected by the loss of ADAM13 p < 0.01.
