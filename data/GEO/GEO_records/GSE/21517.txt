TITLE
ADAM13 knockdown in Xenopus laevis cranial neural crest

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
ADAMs are transmembrane metalloproteases that control cell behavior by cleaving both cell adhesion and signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic domain of ADAMs can regulate the proteolytic activity by controlling the subcellular localization and/or the activation of the protease domain. Here we show that the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM13 is cleaved and translocates into the nucleus. Preventing this translocation renders the protein incapable of promoting cranial neural crest (CNC) cell migration in vivo, without affecting its proteolytic activity. In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM13 regulates the expression of multiple genes in the CNC. This study shows that the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM metalloproteases can perform essential functions in the nucleus of cells and may contribute substantially to the overall function of the protein.
