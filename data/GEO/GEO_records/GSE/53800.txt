TITLE
Targeting PBK/TOPK decreases growth and survival of glioblastoma stem cells in vitro and attenuates tumor growth in vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene knockdown of PBK led to decreased proliferation and sphere formation in the GSC cultures. Treatment of cells with different concentrations  of HI-TOPK-032 almost completely abolished growth and proliferation and elicited a large increase in apoptosis

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from GSC cultures featuring PBK gene knock-down (shRNA) was compared to that from non-silencing control GSC cultures (NS-shRNA). Total RNA isolated from GSC cultures treated with PBK-inhibitor was compared to that from untreated GSC cultures.
