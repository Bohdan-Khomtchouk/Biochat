TITLE
Genome wide analysis of rat renal gene expression at two different time points during hyperoxaluria development

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We are testing the ability of spironolactone as a NADPH oxidase inhibitor during an induced dietary oxalate overload by Ethylene Glycol in Sprague Dawley rats at two different time points. We looked into the development of hyperoxaluria and crystal deposition at two different time points and into differences between hyperoxaluria and crystal induced alterations in the kidneys. Eventually, we are expecting to see the role of spironolactone as an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase which is involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which leads to oxidative stress in the living organisms leading to a plethora of vascular diseases, hypertension, and kidney diseases.

DESIGN
In the present study male rats were divided into three groups. Rats in Group 1 were fed normal diet which was used as control (C), Group 2 were fed normal diet supplemented with 1.25% Ethylene Glycol (EG) and Group 3 were fed diet supplemented with 1.25% EG and 15 mg/kg/day spironolactone (ES). All the three groups were further divided into two sub groups (Day 14 and Day 28).  So there were 3 treatments (Control, EG and ES) and 2 sub-groups, so a total of 6 samples. We had 4 replications of these. Therefore we had a total of 6 x 4 = 24 samples for the microarrays. First 12 samples are from day 14 and the next 12 samples are from day 28
