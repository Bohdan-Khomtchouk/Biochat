TITLE
Murine Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells: Control vs.PJ34

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Treatment with PARP inhibitor (PJ34) suppressed the formation of neurospheres by NSPCs of wild-type or Trp53-/- through the suppression of cell cycle progression and the induction of apoptosis.  In order to identify the genes responsible for these effects.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wild-type vs. Trp53-/-  cells. Biological replicates: 2 wild-type replicates, 2 Trp53-/-  replicates.
