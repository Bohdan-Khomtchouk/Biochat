TITLE
gravitropic stimulation / isotropic light-Characterization of early molecular events of woody stem gravitropism independently of phototropic responses

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
12plex_poplar_2012-01 - gravitropic stimulation / isotropic light - The experiments were designed to identify genes responding to the gravitropic stimulus in the xylem of poplar stem independently of phototropic responses. - young poplar trees were staked one week before use. For the experiment, the plants were placed in an isotropic light environment and were tited at 35Â° during 30 min. Control plants were kept straight in the isotropic light device. Xylem samples were collected from the upper and lower face of the stems. 4 biological replicates were made (4 controls and 4 tilted plants). RNA was extracted from each xylem sample. cDNA was synthetized. The discovery of genes whose expression is modulated by tilting was performed by a microarray approach.

DESIGN
8 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison

PLATFORM
