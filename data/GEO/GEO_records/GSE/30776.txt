TITLE
L. lactis NZ9000 (pNZbcaP-H6) Vs. L. lactis NZ9000 (pNZ8048)

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363

SUMMARY
Our transcriptome data shows that the two-component system CesSR, which senses cell envelope stresses of different origins, is one of the major players when L. lactis is forced to overproduce the endogenous membrane protein BcaP, a branched-chain amino acid permease.
