TITLE
L. lactis NZ9000 (pNZbcaP-H6) Vs. L. lactis NZ9000 (pNZ8048)

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris NZ9000

SUMMARY
Our transcriptome data shows that the two-component system CesSR, which senses cell envelope stresses of different origins, is one of the major players when L. lactis is forced to overproduce the endogenous membrane protein BcaP, a branched-chain amino acid permease.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: nisin induced overproduction of BcaP vs. control. Biological replicates: 2 controls, 2 overproduction cultures; independently grown and harvested; dye swaped on the second array.

PLATFORM
GPL13944 University of Groningen Lactococcus lactis MG1363 amplicon/oligo 2 X 2.5K
