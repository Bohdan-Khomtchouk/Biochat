TITLE
Coffee leaf miner infestation in coffee plants

ORGANISM
Coffea

SUMMARY
Coffee leaf miner is an important plague in coffee crops. Using subtracted cDNA libraries and nylon filter arrays, we analyzed the expression profile of 1536 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of coffee plants from an hybrid progeny (C. arabica x C. racemosa), containg resistant (R) and susceptible plants (S) to the infestation of coffee leaf miner. Leaf discs were collected from non-infested plants (R control - RC; S control - SC), infested plants after moth oviposition (R oviposition - Ro; S oviposition - So) and infested after larvar eclosion (R eclosion - Re; S eclosion - Se). Isolation and characterization of Coffea genes induced during coffee leaf miner (Leucoptera coffeella) infestation. Plant Science 169(2):351-360 Keywords: ordered
