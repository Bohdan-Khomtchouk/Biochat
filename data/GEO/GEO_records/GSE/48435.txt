TITLE
The genetic landscape of mutations in Burkitt lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Burkitt lymphoma is characterized by deregulation of MYC, but the contribution of other genetic mutations to the disease  is largely unknown. Here, we describe the first completely  sequenced genome from a Burkitt lymphoma tumor and  germline DNA from the same affected individual. We further  sequenced the exomes of 59 Burkitt lymphoma tumors and  compared them to sequenced exomes from 94 diffuse large  B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors. We identified 70 genes that  were recurrently mutated in Burkitt lymphomas, including  ID3, GNA13, RET, PIK3R1 and the SWI/SNF genes ARID1A  and SMARCA4. Our data implicate a number of genes in  cancer for the first time, including CCT6B, SALL3, FTCD and  PC. ID3 mutations occurred in 34% of Burkitt lymphomas and  not in DLBCLs. We show experimentally that ID3 mutations  promote cell cycle progression and proliferation. Our work  thus elucidates commonly occurring gene-coding mutations in Burkitt lymphoma and implicates ID3 as a new tumor  suppressor gene.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling on 21 Burkitt lymphomas was performed using standard Affymetrix protocols as described previously. Briefly, 1 Î¼g of total RNA was reverse transcribed, using oligo(dT) primer to synthesize cDNA. T7 primer was used for in vitro transcription, resulting in labeled cRNA, which was fragmented and hybridized to Affymetrix Whole-Genome Gene 1.0 ST microarrays. Microarrays were washed and scanned, and the data were normalized as described previously.
