TITLE
Expression data of HepG2 cells treated with AP000770.1-1 siRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In our study, we found the expression of the novel long coding RNA (AP000770.1-1) was positively associated with cholesterol levels in human samples and HepG2 cells. The Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array were used to analyze the expression profile of mRNAs in l AP000770.1-1 knockdown HepG2 cells and control by siRNA methods.

DESIGN
Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2) were purchased from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM，Gibco, U.S. ), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, U.S.) as well as 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen , U.S.) and maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2. For transient transfections, cells were plated at 1 × 10^5 cells ml−1 for 24 hours  before transfection  with antibiotic free medium. Transfections (50 nM) were conducted with siRNA (targeting pool) against AP000770.1-1 (GenePharma, China) or nontargeting controls (GenePharma, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol for 48 hours.
