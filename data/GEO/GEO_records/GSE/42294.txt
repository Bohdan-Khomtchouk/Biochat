TITLE
Identification of BORIS-bound transcripts in neural progenitor cells and young neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study compares the transcripts bound to BORIS in neural progenitor cells and cells differentiated for 6 days into young neurons

DESIGN
We present expression profiles for neural progenitor cells (arrays hybridised in triplicate) and in young neurons (arrays hybridised in duplicate). Immunoprecipitated BORIS-mRNA complexes were used to assess the association of BORIS with target mRNAs in neural progenitor cells and in young neurons (both arrays hybridised in duplicate).
