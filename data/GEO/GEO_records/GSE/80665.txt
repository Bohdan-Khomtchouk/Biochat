TITLE
RNA-seq of porcine inner ear stria vascularis

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To clarify the effect of Mitf mutation on stria vascularis transcriptome and identify downstream-genes of Mitf pathway which responsible for hearing development, we employed high-throughput sequencing to analyze the transcriptome of MitfR/r and Mitfr/r stria vascularis.

DESIGN
Compare the transcriptome difference between MITF mutated homozygous and heterozygous pigs.
