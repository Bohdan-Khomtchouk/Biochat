TITLE
lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles during osteoclastogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total RNA were extracted from osteoclasts differentiated from RAW264.7 cells at different stages: Monocytes (0h), Pre-osteoclasts (24h), Mature osteoclasts (72h) and activated osteoclasts (96h). LncRNA and mRNA expression profiles were decided by microarray.

DESIGN
RAW264.7 cells were cultured with RANKL (100ng/ml) and M-CSF (50ng/ml) for 0h, 24h, 72h and 96h. TRAP stain, FAK stain, pit formation assay,  fusion assay and q-PCR were performed to validate the in vitro model.

PLATFORM
GPL19286 Arraystar Mouse LncRNA microarray V3B (Agilent-055750 custom Probe Name version)
