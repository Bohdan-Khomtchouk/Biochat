TITLE
Heterogeneity in MYC-Induced Mammary Tumors Determines Outcomes Following Loss of Myc Activity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to compare gene expression profiles between mouse mammary tumors initiated by Myc to those that have escaped Myc oncogene dependence.

DESIGN
We collected tumor biopsies of Myc-initiated tumors and samples of tumors that persisted or recurred after Myc withdrawal.  RNA was extracted from these tumors and hybridized to microarrays.
