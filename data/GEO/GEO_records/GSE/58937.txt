TITLE
The Drosophila Tis11 protein and its effects on mRNA expression in flies

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Insects generally express one tristetraprolin family member, proteins that in mammals promote mRNA decay. The Drosophila protein, Tis11, can promote mRNA decay in cells, and its deficiency in flies results in major changes in mRNA levels. Tis11 deficiency in Drosophila results in accumulation of potentialtarget transcripts. Tis11 can affect post- transcriptional gene expression in adult flies by regulating mRNA decay.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression differences between  wild-type, Tis11-knockout, and Tis11-mutated  flies
