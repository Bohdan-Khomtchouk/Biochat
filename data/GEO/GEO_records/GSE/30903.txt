TITLE
Expression data from untreated and ATP treated AML blasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study, we investigated whether, and to what extent, P2Rs and their ligands are involved in the regulation of AML cells. Our findings show that AML blasts express several receptors belonging to the P2X and P2Y family. Although different samples respond differently to ATP and UTP stimulation (reflecting the variability intrinsic to the group of acute myeloid leukemias), all the tested samples appear to be responsive to purinergic signalling, as demonstrated by intracellular calcium mobilization. GEP analysis demonstrated that ATP induced the expression of cell cycle inhibitors and negative modulators of cell motility, such as inhibitors of GTPase activity. On the contrary, ATP inhibits the expression cell-cycle related genes (cyclins and CDKs), activators of cell motility (Rho GTPases regulators, matrix degradation enzyme and cytoskeleton proteins) and adhesion molecules involved in homing and engraftment.

DESIGN
Blast cells obtained from 12 AML patients (3 M0/M1; 3 M2; 3 M4; and 3 M5) were cultured for 24 h with or without 1 mM ATP. Total RNA from 106 ATP-treated and untreated cells was extracted to study variation of gene expression profile induced by ATP treatment in leukemic cells.
