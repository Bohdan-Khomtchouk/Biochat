TITLE
Transcriptome profile form oviduct samples of endocrine manipulated cows (isthmus)

ORGANISM
Bos indicus

SUMMARY
Purpose: evaluate if different proestrus-estrus concentrations of estradiol (E2) and metestrus progesterone (P4) concentrations specifically regulate oviductal gene expression. Methods: ampulla and isthmus samples of animals whit a large pre-ovulatory follicle and a large CL (LF/LCL) and animals whit a small pre-ovulatory follicle and a small CL (SF/SCL) were collected after slaughter at day four of the estrous cycle. Total RNA was extracted and RNA sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiScanSeq (ampulla samples) and the Illumina HiSeq 2500 (isthmus samples) platforms. Results: After using HTSeq-count, approximately ~60% of the total reads uniquely mapped to the UMD 3.1 reference genome. In the ampulla samples, a total of 692 genes showed differential expression, of which 325 and 367 were up-regulated in the LF-LCL and SF-SCL samples, respectively. In the isthmus samples, a total of 590 genes showed differential expression, of which 274 and 316 were up-regulated in the isthmus of LF/LCL and SF/SCL samples, respectively. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of oviduct transcriptomes, generated by RNA-seq technology. Differential global gene expression profiles identified indicate that the biology of the bovine oviductal tissue is modulated by the periovulatory endocrine milieu. The LF-LCL group transcriptome may potentially reveal molecules associated with higher fertility.

DESIGN
