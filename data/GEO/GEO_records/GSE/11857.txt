TITLE
Gene expression patterns associated with grapevine resistance to downy mildew mediated by the Rpv1 and Rpv2 genes

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Grapevine downy mildew caused by the Oomycete Plasmopara viticola is one of the most important diseases affecting Vitis spp. However, all cultivated European grapevine varieties are susceptible to P. viticola and the resistance needs to be introduced from other Vitaceae. Segregating populations derived from Muscadinia rotundifolia, a species closely related to Vitis, lead to the identification and mapping of two resistance genes, named Rpv1 and Rpv2. The macroscopic phenotypes of the resistance mediated by the two loci are different. Rpv2 plants completely inhibit P. viticola sporulation and produce very small necrotic lesions. In contrast, Rpv1 plants allow a rather limited but visible sporulation of P. viticola. The aim of the study is to understand the gene expression changes associated with downy mildew resistance mediated by these two loci. Gene expression patterns after P. viticola inoculation or mock inoculation are compared in incompatible (resistant plants bearing Rpv1 or Rpv2 locus) and compatible (susceptible plants with no resistance loci) interactions, using the Vitis vinifera GeneChip from Affymetrix. In order to limit the effect of the genetic background, the plant material consists in three pools of genotypes called B, C and D, respectively corresponding to partially resistant plants (Rpv1+/Rpv2-), totally resistant plants (Rpv1-/Rpv2+), and susceptible plants (Rpv1-/Rpv2-) derived from a segregating population. Each pool consists in 3 different genotypes. Plant leaf discs were inoculated with P. viticola sporangium suspension (i) or mock-inoculated with water (ni) and analysed 6 hours post-inoculation. For each experimental condition, we performed two biological replicates. Keywords: normal vs disease comparison
