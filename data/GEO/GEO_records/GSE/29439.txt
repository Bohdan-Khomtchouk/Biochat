TITLE
Global transcriptome response of recombinant protein xylanase producing E. coli in high cell density fed batch culture

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Strong production of recombinant proteins interfere with cellular processes in many ways. The extent of the bacterial stress response is determined by the specific properties of the recombinant protein, and by the rates of transcription and translation. The consideration of bacterial stress and starvation responses is of crucial importance for the successful establishment of an industrial large scale bioprocess. Stress genes can be used as marker genes in order to monitor the fitness of industrial bacterial hosts during fermentation processes. For this purpose, here in our study we have applied transcriptome analysis for the description of general and specific stress and starvation responses of Escherichia coli. Producing recombinant protein (Xylanase) in high cell density fed batch culture.

DESIGN
Cells were grown in batch mode in TB media till an OD600 of 15. The specific growth rate of 0.3 h-1 was maintained by fed batch started at OD600 of 15. Cells were induced at an OD600 of 30 using 1 mM IPTG and the growth and product profile was monitored. Samples at different time points (2hrs, 4hrs, and 6hrs) were taken and frozen in liquid nitrogen quickly for transcriptome analysis.
