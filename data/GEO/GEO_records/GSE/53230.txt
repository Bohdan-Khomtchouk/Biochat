TITLE
Gene expression analysis in liver collected from mice administered non-toxic, toxic, or severely toxic LNA sequences

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Development of LNA gapmers, antisense oligonucleotides used for efficient inhibition of target RNA expression, is limited by non-target mediated hepatotoxicity issues. In the present study, we investigated hepatic transcription profiles of mice receiving non-toxic and toxic LNA gapmers after a single and repeat administration.

DESIGN
To understand the mechanism of LNA gapmer-induced heptotoxicity in mice, we investigated the transcription profiles of liver RNA isolated from mice receiving non-toxic sequence (NTS-1), toxic sequence (TS-2), or severely toxic sequence (HTS-3) of LNA gapmers at 25 mg/kg (dose volume of 10 mL/kg) at 8, 16, or 72 hrs after a single administration (by subcutaneous injection ) using microarray analysis. We also investigated the transcription profiles of liver RNA isolated from mice receiving non-toxic sequence (NTS-1) or toxic sequence (TS-2) of LNA gapmers at 25 mg/kg (dose volume of 10 mL/kg) at 2 weeks after repeated administration (by subcutaneous injection ) using microarray analysis.
