TITLE
CD4/CD25 subsets of mouse spleen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A comparison of CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25- splenic T cells.  Although both subsets have regulatory T cell activity in an induced transplantation tolerance model, the CD4+CD25+ subsets are apparently 10 fold enriched in regulatory T cells.  SAGE analysis is performed and compared both on resting and CD3 activated populations. Keywords: other
