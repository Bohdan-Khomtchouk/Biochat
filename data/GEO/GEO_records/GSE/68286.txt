TITLE
Altered gene expressions of mature dendritic cells in inducing T cell immune responses by the presence of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) or periodontal ligament stem cell (PDLSC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the effect of BMSC or PDLSC on mature dendritic cells (mDCs) in inducing T cell immune responses, we utilized the microarray to discover altered gene expressions in mDCs by the presence of each stme cell.

DESIGN
We prepared RNA samples from 2 sets of mDC only, 3 sets of both mDC-BM and mDC-PD, and analyized gene expressions via the microarray
