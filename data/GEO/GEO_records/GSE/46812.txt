TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for squamous cell carcinoma of base of tongue and healthy individuals samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (BTSCC) is a common tumor of oropharynx worldwide. In addition, BTSCC is a lethal disease and its treatment results in significant disability. Considerable importance is given in lifestyle, particularly tobacco and alcohol use, in cases of BTSCC. It was postulated that BTSCC arises if the ability to metabolize carcinogens, to repair DNA damage and to control cell signaling and cell cycle are defective in individuals with continued exposure to benzo(a)pyrene, ethanol and acetaldehyde. Since these abilities are inherited and vary among human beings, healthy individuals may be at distinct risks for BTSCC. Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples.

DESIGN
SNP analysis of Affymetrix 5.0 SNP arrays was performed for 49 BTSCC samples and 49 controls (healthy individuals) which were used as references.
