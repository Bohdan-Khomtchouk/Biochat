TITLE
DNA methylomes of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta.

ORGANISM
Solenopsis invicta

SUMMARY
We used whole bodies of four different adult fire ant morphs (alate queens, workers, haploid males, and diploid males) from a single polygyne colony to generate single-base resolution DNA methylation maps.

DESIGN
DNA was extracted from whole bodies of individual males, individual queens, and pooled workers.  Bisulfite conversion and sequencing was performed by Beijing Genomics Institute (Shenzhen, China).  Unmethylated enterobacteria phage lambda  DNA (GenBank accession: J02459.1) was added to each genomic DNA sample as a control for bisulfite conversion efficiency.
