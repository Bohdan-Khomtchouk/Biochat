TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana wild type control (C) vs Pseudomonas syringae infected (Pseu)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (WT) comparing Mg chloride infiltration (C) and Pseu infection (Pseu). The differences in the biochemical responses to bacterial infection seen when compared to the control sample prompted us to search for less obvious differences between the treatments using gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, MgCl2 vs. Pseu Arabidopsis leaves of WT plants. Biological replicates:  4 biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL6177 Agilent-015059 Arabidopsis 3 Oligo Microarray 4x44K G2519F (Feature Number version)
