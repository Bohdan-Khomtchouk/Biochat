TITLE
Identification of beta-catenin binding regions in SW480 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Deregulation of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is one of the earliest events in the pathogenesis of colon cancer. Mutations in APC or CTNNB1 (beta-catenin gene) are highly frequent in colon cancer and cause aberrant stabilization of b-catenin, which activates the transcription of Wnt target genes by binding to chromatin via the TCF/LEF transcription factors. Here we report an integrative analysis of genome-wide chromatin occupancy of b-catenin by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and gene expression profiling by microarray analysis upon RNAi-mediated knockdown of beta-catenin in colon cancer cells (GSE53656).

DESIGN
Immunoprecipitated samples from human colon cancer SW480 cells with antibodies against beta-catenin and control IgG respectively were used for ChIP-seq experiments.
