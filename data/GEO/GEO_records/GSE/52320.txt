TITLE
High temporal resolution of mRNA expression patterns during the early macrophage response to LPS [RNA_Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
When macrophages encounter pathogens, they transiently induce an orchestrated cascade of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes. To obtain a precise picture of transcriptome-wide mRNA expression patterns, we performed RNA-Seq of total RNA at a high temporal resolution during the first two hours of macrophage activation. We systematically analyzed the contribution of translational regulation to the early phase of macrophage activation. While the expression of most cytokines is pre-dominanatly regulated by changes in mRNA levels, de-repression of translation was found to permit expression of many feedback inhibitors of the inflammatory response.

DESIGN
Expression profiles of LPS-treated Raw264.7 cells (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 120 min after stimulation) were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000.

PLATFORM
