TITLE
Expression data from bladder tumors and adjacent normal tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNAs are involved in cancer development and progression,acting as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Half of the human miRNAs are located in cancer-associated genomic regions and can function as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes depending on their targets miRNA profiling was performed on paired bladder cancer tissues and differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in BC and adjacent noncancerous tissues of any disease stage/grade.

DESIGN
Ten paired bladder cancer tissues (5 low-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer[NMIBC] and 5 high-grade muscle-invasive bladder cancer[MIBC]) were sent to CapitalBio Corp. (Beijing) for noncoding RNA microarray analysis. The microarray analysis was done as described on the Web site of CapitalBio. NMIBC samples include 07A, 19A, 23A, 24A and T63 while coresponding pairs include 07B, 19B, 23B, 24B and 63. MIBC samples include 10A, 20A, 21A, 34A and 49A while coresponding pairs include 10B, 20B, 21B, 34B and 49B.
