TITLE
Expression data from bladder tumors and adjacent normal tissues

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
miRNAs are involved in cancer development and progression,acting as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Half of the human miRNAs are located in cancer-associated genomic regions and can function as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes depending on their targets miRNA profiling was performed on paired bladder cancer tissues and differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in BC and adjacent noncancerous tissues of any disease stage/grade.
