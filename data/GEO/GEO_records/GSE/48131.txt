TITLE
Ablation of Cdh1 and Trp53 in the uterus reveals novel mechanisms controlling tumor microenvironment in endometrial cancer.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Because TP53 mutation and CDH1 inactivation are the most common abnormalities found in human type II endometrial carcinomas, the contribution of dysfunctional TRP53 and CDH1 in the tumor microenvironment to induce type II endometrial cancer was characterized using mouse as a model. The results of our analysis revealed that conditional deletion of Cdh1 and Trp53 in the uterus regulated most of the genes categorized by their involvement in inflammatory responses, immune cell trafficking, cellular movement, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction and cellular growth and proliferation.

DESIGN
A direct comparison of mouse uteri (n=3) from control, single ablation of Cdh1 or Trp53, and ablation of both Cdh1 and Trp53 at 2 months of age.
