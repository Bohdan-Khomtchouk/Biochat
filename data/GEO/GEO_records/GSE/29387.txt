TITLE
gene profiling of viral sirna in mutants at generation g1.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
gnp06-03_microtrac - gene profiling of viral sirna in mutants at generation g1. Gene profiling of Turnip Crinkle Virus (TCV) siRNA in mutants at generation G1. What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of viral siRNA in diferent mutants?

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - gene knock out,treated vs untreated comparison

PLATFORM
GPL6403 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.3
