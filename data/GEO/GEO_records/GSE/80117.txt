TITLE
Transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa PA1 to bacteriophage PaP1 infection

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA1

SUMMARY
Explore the genome-scale phage-host interactions across different developmental infection stages

DESIGN
Samples were taken from the PA1 Lysates infected with phage PaP1 at four internal time (0, 5, 15 and 45min). Three independent experiments were performed at each time point.

PLATFORM
GPL21703 Agilent-028982 Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and bacteriophage PaP1 8X15K array [Probe Name Version]
