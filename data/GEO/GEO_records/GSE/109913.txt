TITLE
Gene expression profiling on alveolar epithelial cells from mice intratracheally instilled with or without bleomycin or LPS.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We applied next-generation sequencing to investigate the gene expression profiles in mouse alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). We identified a number of differentially regulated genes in the AECs of mice with bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis and LPS induced acute lung injury.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from AECs of mice intratracheally instilled with saline, bleomycin for 2 or 4 weeks or LPS for 1 day. The RNAs were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (RNA-seq), using Illumina HiSeq 4000. Gene expression profiles were compared between the saline and treatment groups.
