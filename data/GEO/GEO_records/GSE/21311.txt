TITLE
Maternal influences on the transmission of leukocyte gene expression profiles in population samples (Red Cross Donors)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is a companion study to (GSE21342).  Peripheral blood leukocyte samples were obtained with consent from 100 red cross blood donors sampled cross-sectionally across the city of Brisbane, Australia.  After correction for RNA integrity values, individuals fall into major profiles of expression variation suggesting environmental and cultural influences on immune gene expression.

DESIGN
100 individuals, 50 men and 50 women, were sampled with permission of the Red Cross Society of Australia and under informed consent. The age of individulas were between 18 and 68 (mean 44). BMI ranged from 17.7 to 51.3 with a mean of 26.6. Collection was carried out by EM at mobile Red Cross vans at 10 locations (Bellbowrie, Capalaba, Dayboro, Eagle Farm, Kenmore, Mount Ommaney, South Brisbane, St Lucia, Virginia, and Woolloongabba) distributed across the city.
