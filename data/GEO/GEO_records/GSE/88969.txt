TITLE
Gene expression analysis of the inflorescence of knu-1 and crc-1 knu-1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analyis gene expression in crc-1 knu-1 compared with knu-1 Initiation of the carpel primordia is marked by the termination of floral stem cells. Although genetic evidences have suggested that the YABBY gene CRABS CLAW (CRC) regulates the development of carpel, as well as the floral meristem determinacy as a target of the homeotic protein AGAMOUS, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we show that the tetraspanin-encoding gene TONADO2 (TRN2) and the auxin biosynthesis gene YUCCA4 (YUC4) act as downstream targets of CRC.

DESIGN
The knu-1 and knu-1 crc-1 seeds e were  grown at 22Â°C under continuous light conditions. The inflorescences with flower buds earlier than stage 10 were collected. Three independent sets of knu-1 and crc-1 knu-1 inflorescence mRNA samples were used for this array.
