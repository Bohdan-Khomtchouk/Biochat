TITLE
Gene expression profiles of human hematopoietic progenitors [BLUEPRINT hematopoietic progenitors]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An optimized whole genome bisulfite sequencing protocol (ÂµWGBS, Farlik et al. 2015 Cell Reports) was used to establish DNA methylation profiles of FACS-purified stem and progenitor cells types of the human blood lineage. Most cell types were sorted from the peripheral blood of three donors with eight pools of ten cells, two pools of 50 cells, and one pool of 1000 cells. Additionally, two cell types (HSC, MPP) were sorted from bone marrow, fetal liver, and cord blood; single-cell methylome sequencing (scWGBS, Farlik et al. 2015 Cell Reports) was done for selected cell types (HSC, MPP, CMP, GMP, CLP, MLP0); and gene expression profiling using the Smart-seq2 protocol (Picelli et al. 2013 Nature Methods) was done on all stem/progenitor cell types (HSC, MPP, CMP, MEP, GMP, CLP, MLP0, MLP1, MLP2, MLP3).

DESIGN
Gene expression was analyzed for stem/progenitor cell types and terminally differentiated cell types of the human blood lineage (HSC, MPP, CMP, GMP, CLP, MLP0, MLP1, MLP2, MLP3). -------------------- The raw sequencing data are available from EBI EGA under a data access agreement.
