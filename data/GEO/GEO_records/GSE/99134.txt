TITLE
Expression data from the RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cell line overexpressing the miR-183 family cluster

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The full genomic miR-183 cluster (4.8kb) was cloned into lentiviral vector CD511B-1 with polycistronic GFP. RWPE-1 were transduced with a lentivirus from this vector (RWPE-1 183FC), or a CD511B-1 scrambled control with polycistronic GFP (RWPE-1 control). RWPE-1 were FACS sorted by GFP expression and expanded in culture. In RWPE-1 183FC, the miR-183 family members, miR-182, miR-96, and miR-183  were confirmed to be over-expressed at physioloically relevent levels, similar to the increased expression observed in prostate cancer epithelium.

DESIGN
Six samples were analyzed, two sets of three replicates
