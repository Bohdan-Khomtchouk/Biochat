TITLE
Expression data from estrogen disrupted endometrium

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Placentation of the conceptus to the surface epithelium is governed through a tightly regulated temporal and spatial window.  Premature exogenous steriod exposure causes a shift in the maternal tissue's receptivity and prevents proper placentation. We used Affymetrix microarrays to detail the aberrant changes in uterine gene expression during this window, while removing all conceptus contribution to this dysfunction.

DESIGN
Porcine endometrium was selected at chronological stages of psuedopregnancy and psuedopregnancy post endocrine disrupted early for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain homogeneous populations of normal endometrium at days 13 and 15 of the pseudo pregnant, and endometrium at days 13 and 15 of the endocrine disrupted pseudo pregnant in order to identify the temporal resolution of expression profiles. In brief, days 13 through 15 accounts for the window of attachment during pregnancy in the pig, so we created pseudo pregnant endometrium and obtained samples from days 13 (PIG13UN_TX)and 15 (PIG15UN_TX) of pseudo pregnancy.  In the same, we created pseudo pregnant endometrium that was subjected to endocrine disruption of the pseudo pregnancy and collected samples on days 13 (PIG13_TX)and 15 (PIG15_TX) of pseudo pregnancy.
