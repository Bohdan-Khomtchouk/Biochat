TITLE
HK2/AA Stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) is characterised by rapidly progressive tubulointerstitial nephritis culminating in end stage renal failure and urothelial malignancy.  microRNAs (miRs) are small endogenous post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes.  We aimed to characterise the mechanism of AA induced cell cycle arrest and its regulation by miRs.  The microarray experiment was performed to identify differentially regulated microRNAs in human proximal tubulal epithelial cells treated with aristolochic acid (AA).

DESIGN
Analysis or differential miR expression in human proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) treated with 5ug/ml aristolochic acid, control (n=3) vs aristolochic acid (n=3)
