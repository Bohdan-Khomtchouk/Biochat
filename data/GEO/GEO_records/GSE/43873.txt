TITLE
Focal Adhesion Kinase Dependent Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify transcripts, which are differentially regulatulated in the presence and absence of Focal Adhesion Kinase. As Focal Adhesion Kinase activity can depend upon cell density (Snijder et al. Nature 2009), biological replicates where cells, were seeded very sparsely or confluently, were used.

DESIGN
Focal Adhesion Kinase Knockout (ATCC CRL-2644) and Rescue Cells (Sieg et al. 1998, clone DA2) were seeded at two different concentrations. Replicas refer to biological replicates, performed on different days. Only one single technical replicate has been done per biological replicate.

PLATFORM
