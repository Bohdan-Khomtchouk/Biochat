TITLE
long noncoding RNAs expression data from GM0637 with and without DNA damage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GM0637 cell were treated with or without DNA damaging agent neocarzinostatin (NCS), and cells were harvested after 4 hours and 8 hours for the microarray analyses of whole-genome long noncoding RNAs.

DESIGN
To examine how long noncoding RNAs are regulated in the DNA damage response, we assessed the genome-wide long noncoding RNA expression in GM0637 cells treated with or without DNA damage
