TITLE
Development of gene expression  for FMDV-infected RAW264.7 cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine whether type O FMDV-infected macrophage can release a variety of cytokines and activate innate immune responses, we have taken systematic functional genomics studies using microarray technology on differences expression gene of  FMDV-infected and FMDV-uninfected mouse monocyte macrophage (RAW264.7 cells). We examined the expression patterns of 39,430 mouse genes probes, using Agilent mouse gene expression microarray. The results showed that 2541 genes were differentially expressed after FMDV infection, with 1207 up-regulated and 1334 down-regulated. Based on our previous data, the differential regulation of genes most associate with innate immune response.
