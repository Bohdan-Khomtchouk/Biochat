TITLE
RNA profiling Analysis of the Serum Exosomes Derived from Active and Latent M.tuberculosis infectious Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-seq analysis on exosomes derived from the clinical specimens of healthy control (HC), active tuberculosis (ATB) and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) individuals. Our results revealed the distinguished gene expression panels and patterns of the exosomes for the LTBI and ATB patients: We identified many up-regulated and down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the LTBI and ATB samples, and further screened the top-20 DEGs, which might provide a clue to differentiate HC, LTBI and ATB;  We classified all the DEGs into six expression patterns, screened the top-20 genes in each pattern, and mainly focused on those highly expressed in LTBI and ATB; A lot of Mtb genes were only expressed and enriched in the exosomes of LTBI patients; Pathway and functional analysis further indicated the gradually increased deteriorated healthy signals in LTBI and ATB samples, including down-regulated signaling pathways/immune response, and up-regulated apoptosis/necrosis. Our findings not only add new data to tuberculosis clinical studies, but also facilitate the development of potential targets for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of tuberculosis.

DESIGN
Examined three samples and each has two repeats
