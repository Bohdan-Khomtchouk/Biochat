TITLE
Increased resistance to proteasome inhibitors in multiple myeloma mediated by cIAP2 overexpression - implications for a combinatorial treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we wanted to investigate the role of cIAP2 in drug resistance, the plausible mechanisms underlying this resistance and possible strategies to overcome this by combinatorial treatment in human MM cell lines containing a TRAF3 mutation

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of the human MM cell line LP-1 under 6 different experimental perturbations: untreated  or treated with bortezomib (10nM), 2 different timepoints (6 and 24 hours) and cIAP2 overexpression or endogenous cIAP2 level.
