TITLE
Secreted STIP1 stimulates cell proliferation of ovarian cancer through SMAD signaling pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) is a co-chaperone that regulates other chaperone proteins that was recently shown to be secreted by ovarian cancer cells to induce cell proliferation. In this study, we found that STIP1 induced the phosphorylation of endogenous SMAD1/5, and knockdown of SMAD1/4/5 blocked STIP1-activated ID3 expression. Inhibition of ALK2, a serine/threonine kinase receptor, with siRNA or the specific inhibitor LDN193189, blocked STIP1-induced phosphorylation of SMAD1/5 and inhibited STIP1-related cell proliferation. The signaling pathway was found to involve binding of secreted STIP1 to ALK2, phosphorylation of SMAD, and activation of ID3 to induce cell proliferation was identified not only by in vitro immunofluorescent microscopy and biochemical identification of complex formation, but also by in vivo immunohistochemical analyses of ovarian cancer tissues.
