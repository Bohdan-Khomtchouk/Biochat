TITLE
Region-specific identity of small intestinal stem cells from the ileum and jejunum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the expression profiles of three stem-cell varieties derived from the ileum and jejunum, focusing on gene signatures that are consistent in all stem cells of an intestinal location.  We find that intestinal stem cells establish and maintain a regional identity that is discernable through gene expression patterns consistent with intestinal function particular to that region.

DESIGN
Small intestines of mice aged 6-12 weeks were extracted, proximal tissues (5-8cm from the pylorus) and distal tissues (5-8cm from the cecum) were obtained.  Crypt stem cells, LGR5 stem cells, and CD44+/CD24lo/CD166+ stem cells were obtained from intestinal tissues after mechanical and enzymatic digestion.  Sorted cells were directly collected in RNA lysis buffer.
