TITLE
Differential Gene Expression between Active and Quiescent Stages of Ulcerative Colitis: Insights into a Distinctive Pathogenesis Profile

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our objective was to elucidate patterns of gene expression underlying the progression of UC disease. Single endoscopic pinch biopsies (n=40) were assayed using the Illumina cDNA-mediated Annealing, Selection, Extension, and Ligation (DASL) microarray. Tissue was sampled in consecutive active and quiescent stages at the same site in individual UC patients, and these stages (active and inactive) were compared with each other as well as to non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) healthy controls.

DESIGN
Gene expression of UC active and inactive is compared at a global level using total RNA from the same UC pateints using the Illumina microarray platform.
