TITLE
Whole blood gene expression from overweight women supplemented with quercetin or placebo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Flavonoids and fish oils have anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating influences. The purpose of the study was to determine if a mixed flavonoid-fish oil supplement (Q-Mix; 1000 mg quercetin, 400 mg isoquercetin, 120 mg EGCG from green tea extract, 220 mg EPA and 180 mg DHA from fish oil, 1000 mg vitamin C, 40 mg niacinamide, and 800 ug folic acid) would reduce inflammatory and oxidative stress markers and alter genomic profiles in overweight women. Women were assigned using a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial to Q-Mix or placebo groups. Overnight fasted blood samples were collected and subjected to RNA expression analysis on Affymetrix Hugene ST1_1 arrays.

DESIGN
Randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled study.Subjects were randomized to either mixed flavonoid-fish oil supplement group (Q-Mix; 1000 mg quercetin, 400 mg isoquercetin, 120 mg EGCG from green tea extract, 400 mg n3-PUFAs (220 mg EPA and 180 mg DHA) from fish oil, 1000 mg vitamin C, 40 mg niacinamide, and 800 Âµg folic acid) or placebo (n=29 samples, including pre- and post-treatment samples in the Q-Mix and placebo arms).The placebo did not contain quercetin, vitamin C, and niacin. Subjects were instructed to ingest two soft chew supplements twice daily (upon awakening, and between 6:00-7:00 pm) for 70 days. A three-day food record was used to assess typical energy and nutrient intake. No restrictions were placed on diet, supplement usage or medications with the exception that subjects agreed to avoid any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and dietary supplements that influence inflammation or oxidative stress.
