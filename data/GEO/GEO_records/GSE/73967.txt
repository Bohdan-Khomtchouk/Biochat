TITLE
The midguts transcriptome of Aedes aegypti (Liverpool strain) females blood fed DENV2 NS1 versus those blood fed BSA

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
We report the RNA-seq based analyses of the transcriptional changes in the Aedes aegypti midguts transcriptome 4,8,18 hours after blood feeding BSA or DENV2 NS1.

DESIGN
Comparison of the midguts transcriptome of Aedes aegypti females at two blood feeding conditions and three time points.
