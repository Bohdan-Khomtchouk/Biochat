TITLE
MicroRNAs expression profile in human hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Liver cancer tissue could be indentified from corresponding non-cancerous tissues and normal liver tissue with a microRNA expression profile including 69 microRNAs.Besides, one single microRNA could be used to predict the outcome of liver cancer patients. Keywords: molecular marker, predict prognosis
