TITLE
MicroRNAs expression profile in human hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Liver cancer tissue could be indentified from corresponding non-cancerous tissues and normal liver tissue with a microRNA expression profile including 69 microRNAs.Besides, one single microRNA could be used to predict the outcome of liver cancer patients. Keywords: molecular marker, predict prognosis

DESIGN
In this study, the microRNAs expression profile in liver cancer tissue  and corresponding non-cancerous tissues of 78 HCC cases followed up for up to 68 month, and in 10 normal liver tissue were analyzed by using microarray probed with 509 miRNAs. The analysis suggested one profile including 69 microRNAs expressed differentially between liver cancer tissues and noncacerous tissue, and some of micRNAs related to clinical factor, especially one single could be used to predict the prognosis of liver cancer patients.
