TITLE
Effects of dexamethasone on cultured lung explant

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The lung is a branched tubular network with two distinct compartments — the proximal conducting airways and the peripheral gas exchange region — separated by a discrete boundary termed the bronchoalveolar duct junction (BADJ).   Here we image the developing mouse lung in three-dimensions and show that two nested developmental waves demarcate the BADJ under the control of a global hormonal signal.  A first wave of branching morphogenesis progresses throughout embryonic development, generating branches for both compartments.  A second wave of conducting airway differentiation follows the first wave but terminates earlier, specifying the proximal compartment and setting the BADJ.  The second wave is terminated by a glucocorticoid signaling: premature activation or loss of glucocorticoid signaling causes a proximal or distal shift, respectively, in BADJ location.  The results demonstrate a novel mechanism of boundary formation in complex, three-dimensional organs and provide new insights into glucocorticoid therapies for lung defects in premature birth.

DESIGN
RNAs were extracted from E14 lungs cultured in control and dexamethasone media for 24 hours using Trizol reagents and Qiagen RNeasy Micro kit.  Two control and two treated samples were analyzed.
