TITLE
Coupling of cellular processes and their coordinated oscillations under continuous light in cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, a diazotrophic unicellular cyanobacteria

ORGANISM
Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of  a unicelluar diazotrophic cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 in constant light under nitrogen fixing condition. The controls comprised of equimolar pool of RNA from all time points.

DESIGN
Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 was grown in BG-11 medium without nitrate. The culture was entrained under 12 h alternate light/dark cycles for 96 h and released in constant light (LL). Nine samples were for two consecutive cycles under LL, at times when the culture underwent transitions in its photosynthetic and respiratory phases, as indicated by the exit CO2 and O2 profiles. Two biological replicates, two technical replicates and a dye swap were analyzed for each sample from individual time points.
