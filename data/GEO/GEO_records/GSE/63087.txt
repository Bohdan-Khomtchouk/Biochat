TITLE
Expression of viral and human microRNAs in blood in The Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study (BTDAS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional suppressors of gene expression and potential mediators of environmental effects.  In addition to human miRNAs, viral miRNAs expressed from latent viral sequences are detectable in human cells. We will use this dataset to investigate associations between air pollution exposures and clinical outcomes (such as lung function, blood pressure, etc.)

DESIGN
The Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study (BTDAS), conducted between June 15 and July 27, 2008, included two different groups with high exposure to air pollution: 60 truck drivers and 60 office workers (Baccarelli et al. 2011).  All participants lived in the Beijing metropolitan area and had been working in their current position for at least two years.  No subject was on regular medication, including anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin, during the course of the study.  We examined each participant on two separate days separated by a one- to two-week interval.  Truck drivers and office workers were similar by age, sex, smoking status, and education.  A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect detailed information on demographics, lifestyle, and other exposures. -------------------------------------- technical replicate: GSM1540856, GSM1540762 technical replicate: GSM1540857, GSM1540613 technical replicate: GSM1540858, GSM1540854 technical replicate: GSM1540859, GSM1540605 technical replicate: GSM1540860, GSM1540772 technical replicate: GSM1540861, GSM1540648 technical replicate: GSM1540862, GSM1540774 technical replicate: GSM1540863, GSM1540639 technical replicate: GSM1540864, GSM1540792 technical replicate: GSM1540865, GSM1540669 technical replicate: GSM1540866, GSM1540804 technical replicate: GSM1540867, GSM1540665
