TITLE
IFN type I-induced gene expression from brain endothelia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Brain endothelial cells are an essential part of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and, as such, are exposed to proinflammatory mediators as well as danger signals during infections. They might function as decisive cells mediating RNA virus- and IFN-mediated sickness behavior. To better understand how brain endothelial cells modulate sickness behavior associated with virus-induced IFN release, we challenged endothelia with IFNbeta and investigated the transcription profile after IFNAR1 engagement

DESIGN
Cultured brain endothelia isolated from adult mice were incubated with IFNbeta; 24h later cells were removed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix arrays.
