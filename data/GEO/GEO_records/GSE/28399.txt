TITLE
Transcriptional responses of uropathogenic E. coli to stresses caused by sodium chloride or urea.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli CFT073

SUMMARY
E. coli which cause urinary tract infections must respond to high osmolarity in the urinary tract as well as the presence of urea. We used microarrays to measure the differntial gene expression of uropathogenic strain CFT073 in conditions of high osmolarity of urea v. minimal media

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from CFT073 in each growth condition and hybridized to an Affymetrix microarray. The differentially expressed genes were analyzed by expression pattern and function.
