TITLE
Expression data from E11.5 mouse branchial arch 1 (BA1) - comparison between Ezh2lox/lox and Wnt1Cre Ezh2lox/lox embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Conditional ablation of Ezh2 in the neural crest lineage results in loss of the neural crest-derived mesenchymal derivatives. In this data sheet we determine gene expression analysis in Ezh2lox/lox and Wnt1Cre Ezh2lox/lox in E11.5 mouse BA1 cells.

DESIGN
Conditional ablation of Ezh2 in the neural crest lineage was achieved by crossing Wnt1creEzh2lox/wt mice with Ezh2lox/lox mouse lines. We analyzed a total of 6 samples including 3 biological replicates from Ezh2lox/lox embryos and 3 biological replicates from Wnt1cre Ezh2lox/lox embryos.
