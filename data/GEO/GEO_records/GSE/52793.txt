TITLE
Novel DNA methylation targets in oral rinse samples predict survival of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of oral rinse samples from a cohort of 82 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in oral rinse samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite lsconverted DNA from the 82 oral rinse samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
