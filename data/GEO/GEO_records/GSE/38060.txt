TITLE
Changes in mammary gene expression and morphology following consumption of soy protein isolate in female Sprague-Dawley rats differs from that produced by 17b-estradiol treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Soy foods have been suggested to have both positive health benefits and potentially adverse effects largely as a result of their content of isoflavone phytoestrogens. Since soy protein isolate (SPI) contains isoflavones, in addition to purported health benefits, safety concerns have been raised regarding the use of SPI and soy formulas, because of potential estrogenic actions during the neonatal period, including the potential for reproductive toxicity, infertility, and the possibility of increased risk for development and recurrence of estrogen sensitive cancers such as breast cancer. In the current study, we used a rat model to compare the effects of SPI with those of 17b-estradiol (E2), on global gene expression profiles and morphology in the female rat mammary gland. Rats were either fed AIN-93G diets containing casein (CAS) or SPI beginning on postnatal day (PND) 30.

DESIGN
Rats were ovariectomized (OVX) on PND 50 and treated with E2 or vehicle for 14 days. Microarray analysis was carried out to compare the effects of SPI and E2 alone or in combination on the mammary gene expression. The data suggest a non-estrogenic effect of SPI on the rat mammary even in the absence of endogenous estrogens.
