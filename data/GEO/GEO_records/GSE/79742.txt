TITLE
Expression data of ILC2 cells from Ets1-deleted and littermate control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ETS1 transcription factor is required for the development and cytokine-induced expansion of ILC2

DESIGN
ILC2 cells isolated from ETS1-deleted or litter mate control mice were cultured on OP9-DL1 with IL-7 and IL-33. Subsequently, RNA from ICOS+ cells was extracted, labelled and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. The goal of this study is to investigate ETS1-dependent genes in developing ILC2 cells.
