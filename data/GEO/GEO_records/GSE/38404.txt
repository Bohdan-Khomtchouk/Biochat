TITLE
Resistance to Irreversible EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors through a Multistep Mechanism Involving the IGF1R Pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The clinical efficacy of EGFR kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib is limited by the  development of drug resistance. The most common mechanism of drug resistance is the  secondary EGFR T790M mutation. Strategies to overcome EGFR T790M mediated drug  resistance include the use of mutant selective EGFR inhibitors, including WZ4002, or by the  use of high concentrations of irreversible quinazoline EGFR inhibitors such as PF299804. In  the current study we develop drug resistant versions of the EGFR mutant PC9 cell line which  reproducibly develops EGFR T790M as a mechanism of drug resistance to gefitinib. Neither  PF299804 resistant (PFR) or WZ4002 resistant (WZR) clones of PC9 harbor EGFR T790M.  Instead, they demonstrate activated IGF1R signaling as a result of loss of expression of  IGFBP3 and the IGF1R inhibitor, BMS 536924, restores EGFR inhibitor sensitivity.  Intriguingly, prolonged exposure to either PF299804 or WZ4002 results in the emergence of a  more drug resistant subclone which contains ERK activation. A MEK inhibitor, CI-1040,  partially restores sensitivity to EGFR/IGF1R inhibitor combination. Moreover, an IGF1R or  MEK inhibitor used in combination with either PF299804 or WZ4002 completely prevents  the emergence of drug resistant clones in this model system. Our studies suggest that more  effective means of inhibiting EGFR T790M will prevent the emergence of this common drug  resistance mechanism in EGFR mutant NSCLC. However, multiple drug resistance  mechanisms can still emerge. Preventing the emergence of drug resistance, by targeting  pathways activated in resistant cancers before they emerge, may be a more effective clinical  strategy.
