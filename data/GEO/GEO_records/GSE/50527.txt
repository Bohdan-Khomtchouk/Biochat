TITLE
Transcriptome of human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells induced by bisphenol A, S and AF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome expression data on transcriptome of human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells induced by bisfenol A (BPA), S (BPAS) and AF (BPAF) after short- (8 hours) and long-term (3 months) exposure at human-relevant (10 nM) concentrations.

DESIGN
8 experimental conditions, 4x2 design: 3 compounds (bisphenol A, S and AF) and a control, 2 exposure times (8 hours and 3 months). 3 replicates for each condition, 24 arrays in total.

PLATFORM
