TITLE
Gene expression in peripheral cells: effects of Foxp3 and PDE3B

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This data set is comprised of all peripheral (pooled lymph nodes and spleen) T cell subsets presented in this manuscript.  These include T-N, T-25, T-FN and T-R cells; T-25, T-FN and T-R cells from mice treated with IL-2; and T-R cells transduced with empty, PDE3B-expressing or PDE3B(H801A)-expressing retroviral vectors (after transfer into recipient mice). Keywords: cell type comparison, response to growth factor, genetic modification
