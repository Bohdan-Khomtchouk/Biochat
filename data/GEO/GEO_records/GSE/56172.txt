TITLE
Proteomic signatures of extracellular vesicles secreted by non-mineralizing and mineralizing human osteoblasts and stimulation of tumor cell growth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Beyond forming bone, osteoblasts play pivotal roles in various biological processes, including hematopoiesis and bone metastasis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have recently been implicated in intercellular communication via transfer of proteins and nucleic acids between cells. Here, we focused on the proteomic characterization of non-mineralizing (NMOBs) and mineralizing (MOBs) human osteoblast (SV-HFOs) EVs and investigated their effect on human prostate cancer (PC3) cells by microscopic, proteomic and gene expression analyses. Proteomic analysis showed that 97% of the proteins were shared among NMOB and MOB EVs, and 30% were novel osteoblast-specific EV proteins. Label-free quantification demonstrated mineralization stage-dependent five-fold enrichment of 59 and 451 EV proteins in NMOBs and MOBs, respectively. Interestingly, bioinformatic analyses of the osteoblast EV proteomes and EV-regulated prostate cancer gene expression profiles showed that they converged on pathways involved in cell survival and growth. This was verified by in vitro proliferation assays where osteoblast EV uptake led to two-fold increase in PC3 cell growth compared to cell-free culture medium-derived vesicle controls. Our findings elucidate the mineralization stage-specific protein content of osteoblast-secreted EVs, show a novel way by which osteoblasts communicate with prostate cancer, and open up innovative avenues for therapeutic intervention.

DESIGN
PC3 cells were treated with extracellular vesicles from non-mineralizing and mineralizing SV-HFOs for three different incubation times (4hrs, 24hrs, 48hr)
