TITLE
Microarray analysis of the oocyte quality

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed in ooplast samples to identify gene expression profiles associated with the embryo capacity to develop to blastocyst stage

DESIGN
A fraction of the cytoplasm from in vitro matured oocytes was collected and snap frozen. The oocytes were chemically activated and presumptive zygotes were in vitro cultured in individual medium microdrops. The embryo development was recorded and oocytes classified according to the stage of embryo development. Oocyte was considered of good quality if the development proceeded to blastocyst stage, whereas it was considered of bad quality if there was a development block between  8-16 cells stage and morula formation.
