TITLE
Regions of very low H3K27me3 partition the Drosophila genome into topological domains

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. We have investigated boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs) in the Drosophila genome and find that they can be identified as domains of very low H3K27me3. The genome-wide H3K27me3 profile partitions into two states; very low H3K27me3 identifies Depleted (D) domains that contain housekeeping genes and their regulators such as the histone acetyltransferase-containing NSL complex, whereas domains containing mid-to-high levels of H3K27me3 (Enriched or E domains) are associated with regulated genes, irrespective of whether they are active or inactive. The D domains correlate with the boundaries of TADs and are enriched in a subset of architectural proteins, particularly Chromator, BEAF-32, and Z4. However, rather than being clustered at the borders of these domains, these proteins bind throughout the H3K27me3-depleted regions and are much more strongly associated with the TSSs of the housekeeping genes than with the H3K27me3 domain boundaries. We suggest that the D domain chromatin state, characterised by very low H3K27me3 and established by housekeeping gene regulators, acts to separate topological domains thereby setting up the domain architecture of the genome.
