TITLE
Gene expressions in K67-treated or non-treated Huh1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify the genes affected upon exposure of K67.

DESIGN
Four independent experiments were performed using K67-treated or non-treated Huh1 cells for each experiment.
