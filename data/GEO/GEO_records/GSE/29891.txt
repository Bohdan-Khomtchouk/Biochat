TITLE
Systems analysis identifies an essential role for SHARPIN in macrophage TLR2 responses (Affymetrix)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our systems analysis reported here demonstrates that TLR-responses in macrophages are markedly impaired by SHARPIN deficiency, and that SHARPIN controls expression of a subset of TLR2-induced, NF-kB and AP-1 dependent genes that overlaps with those affected by the hypomorphic panr2 mutation in NEMO.

DESIGN
46 total RNA samples from murine bone marrow derived macrophages were analyzed (32 by Agilent array, 14 by Affymetrix Exon array) On Affymetrix Exon array, the responses of macrophages to 12hr stimulation with the TLR2 ligand PAM3CSK4 (300ng/mL) were analyzed in biological duplicates for the Map3k8(sluggish) mutant and respective controls and in singlet for the Tnf(KO) mutant compared to two respective WT controls.
