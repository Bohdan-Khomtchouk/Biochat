TITLE
MYC is an early response regulator of human adipogenesis in adipose stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MYC is induced early in human adipose stem cells in response to a standard MDIR adipogenic cocktail. The objective of this experiment was to identify key gene networks impacted by MYC loss-of-function in a mixed donor pool of human derived adipose stem cells. Microarray analysis was used to identify up- and -down regulated genes in control vs MYC knockdown adipose stem cells in response to adipogenic stimulus

DESIGN
Two sets of MYC siRNA oligos (pooled and s9129) were used to knockdown MYC 72 hours prior to induction of adipogenesis. Non-targeting siRNA was used as a control. Samples were induced to differentiate for 72 hours to assess early gene expression changes. Control samples not exposed to adipogenic cocktail were included as a reference. 3 independent replicates were run for each sample.
