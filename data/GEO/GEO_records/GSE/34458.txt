TITLE
Molecular Signatures of cardiac defects in Down syndrome lymphoblastoid cell lines (trisomy 21)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Molecular consequences of trisomy in lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with Down syndrome. This project analyses differentially expressed genes between humans with trisomy 21 and humans without trisomy 21.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human lymphoblastoid cell lines without trisomy 21 compared to cell lines from human with trisomy 21.
