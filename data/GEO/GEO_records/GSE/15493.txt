TITLE
Transcriptional response of ethanol-stressed vs. non-stressed culture

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is well known for its high ethanol production performances. An original fermentation process that allows the yeast S. cerevisiae to produce in less than 45 h more than 150 g/l ethanol (i.e. 18.9Â°GL) was set up in our laboratory [1]. Under this condition, the yeast cells induce a dynamic process to adapt to increased ethanol concentration by a mechanism that is likely different to the stress response triggered by sudden ethanol addition to exponentially growing cells [2]. Kinetic analysis of the growth curve identified two main phases: a growth phase that ended up at 90 g/l ethanol and then an uncoupling phase during which non-growing cells kept producing ethanol. This latter phase is also characterized with an increased loss of viability. In order to investigate on a genome scale the expression changes occurring during this process, gene expression was quantified using DNA chips technology at six different time-points during fed-batch fermentation.
