TITLE
A transcriptional signature of fatigue derived from patients with primary Sjögren's Syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fatigue is a debilitating condition with a significant impact on patients’ quality of life. Fatigue is frequently reported by patients suffering from primary Sjo ̈gren’s Syndrome (pSS), a chronic autoimmune condition characterised by dryness of the eyes and the mouth. However, although fatigue is common in pSS, it does not manifest in all sufferers, providing an excellent model with which to explore the potential underpinning biological mechanisms.

DESIGN
Whole blood samples from 131 fully-phenotyped pSS patients, stratified for the presence of fatigue, collected by the UK primary Sj ̈ogren’s Syndrome Registry were used for whole genome microarray. The resulting data were analysed both on a gene by gene basis and using pre-defined groups of genes. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used as a feature selection technique for input into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Classification was assessed using area under curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic and standard error of Wilcoxon statistic, SE(W). Contributor: The UK Primary Sjögren’s syndrome registry
