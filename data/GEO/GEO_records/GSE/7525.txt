TITLE
Mating response of three yeast species (S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus and S. mikatae)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Saccharomyces paradoxus ; Saccharomyces mikatae

SUMMARY
We examined the mating response of three yeast species, by subjecting a-type cells from each of them to alpha-factor (6uM). The expression of cells before and after (60min) addition of alpha-factor were compared using S. cerevisiae cDNA microarrays. In addition, we verified our results with a true mating experiment: the expression of a-type and alpha-type cells from S. cerevisiae were compared before and after mixing them for 90 minutes (i.e. allowing them to mate). Keywords: yeast mating response, comparison among species

DESIGN
Three (or four) samples were processed in parallel for each species (biological replicates). All samples were measured by hybridization to S. cerevisiae cDNA microarray
