TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of apoplastic reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling and dissection of the roles of WRKY25, WRKY33 and WRKY75 in the transcriptional reprogramming triggered by apoplastic ROS

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In order to dissect the roles of sequence-specific transcription factors WRKY25, WRKY33 and WRKY75 in apoplastic ROS signaling, a transcriptome profiling of ozone response was done using two arabidopsis mutants: a double mutant wrky25 wrky33 and a single mutant wrky75. The single mutant lines used for transcriptomic analyses were obtained from NASC: wrky25 (SAIL_529_B11) and wrky33 (SALK_006603) were crossed to generate double mutant wrky25 wrky33. T-DNA insertion mutant wrky75-25 (N121525) was obtained from NASC.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates, five plants per replicate, treated with 350 ppb ozone for 2 hours, were used for RNA-seq analysis. For each genotype, also non-ozone-treated samples were collected. For the Col-0 control line, an additional fourth replicate with/without ozone was done.
