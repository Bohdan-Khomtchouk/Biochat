TITLE
Transcriptome sequence analysis of Phormium tenax under drought stress

ORGANISM
Phormium tenax

SUMMARY
To clarify the molecular mechanism of drought resistance in Phormium tenax, transcriptome was sequenced by the Illumina sequencing technology under normal and dry conditions, respectively.  In total, 4,063,419 high quality sequencing contigs, 175,649 transcripts and 75,265 unigenes were obtained in this study. A total of 4,380 genes were differentially expressed, 2,698 of which were finally annotated under drought stress. Differentially expression analysis was also performed upon drought treatment.

DESIGN
Transcriptome of two kinds of plant leaves which were treated under normal and drought conditions was sequenced by the Illumina sequencing technology

PLATFORM
