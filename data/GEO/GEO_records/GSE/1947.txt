TITLE
Disease mechanisms in peripheral neuropathies due to altered Pmp22 gene dosage or a Pmp22 point mutation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression at ages P4 and P60 in sciatic nerve of wild type mice and mice with peripheral neuropathies caused by altered Pmp22 gene dosage (homozygous knockout or transgene) or a point mutation (Trembler). Keywords: parallel sample
