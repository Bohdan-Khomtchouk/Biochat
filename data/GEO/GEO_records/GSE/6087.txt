TITLE
Transcriptomes of Clostridium novyi-NT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus ; Clostridium novyi NT

SUMMARY
This study determined the patterns of gene expression of Clostridium novyi-NT in different growth phases in vitro as well as gene expression patterns from infection of tumors in vivo. Keywords: Growth phase analysis; tumor infection

DESIGN
For gene expression of Clostridium novyi-NT in different growth phases in vitro, we had 4 replicates for early log phase, 3 replicates for mid log phase, 4 replicates for late log phase and 5 replicates for mature spore. For gene expression of Clostridium novyi-NT from infection of tumors in vivo, we had 5 replicates for infected CT26 tumors and 5 replicates for infected HCT116 tumors.  To control for cross hybridization with mammalian mRNAs, we also included 2 replicates for uninfected CT26 tumors and 2 replicates for uninfected HCT116 tumors for hybridization to parallel arrays.
