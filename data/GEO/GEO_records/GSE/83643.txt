TITLE
Gene expression profiles of U87 cells after transfection with hsa-miR-145-5p and 31-5p

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the expression profiles of hsa-miR-145-5p or hsa-miR-31-5p-targeting genes relating to invasion or migration after co-overexpression of hsa-miR-145-5p and 31-5p

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of U87 cells after co-transfection with hsa-miR-145-5p and 31-5p mimics, and U87 cells after transfection miR mimic negative control
