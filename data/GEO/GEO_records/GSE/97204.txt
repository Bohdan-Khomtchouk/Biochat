TITLE
Effect of selective glucocorticoid receptor modulation (SGRM) on gene expression in human prostate cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human prostate cancer cell lines treated with androgen receptor (AR) agonists/antagonists and concurrent glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist/antagonists

DESIGN
Human prostate cancer cell lines in charcoal-stripped FCS-containing media were treated for 3 days with AR agonists (R1881 1nM) +/-antagonist (enzalutamide 10uM) and then pulsed with 2 or 6 hour treatment with GR agonist (Dex 100nM)  +/- antagonist (SGRM, 335 1uM and 297 1uM) after which RNA was collected and sequenced

PLATFORM
