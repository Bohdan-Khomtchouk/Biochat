TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of human placental trophoblasts in response to Enterococcus faecalis invasion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between E. faecalis and host placental barrier at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that E. faecalis influence the ranscriptomic profiling of human placental trophoblasts. Results provide important information of the response of human placental trophoblasts to E. faecalis, such as Several representative terms of the differentially expressed genes are involved in apoptosis, stress and stimulus response, placenta and embryonic development, immune response, and cell adhesion.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human placental trophoblasts subjected to 4 hours in vitro E. faecalis compared to untreated control.
