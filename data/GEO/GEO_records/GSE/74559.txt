TITLE
miRNA profile in the vitreous of proliferative vitreoretinal disease patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The microRNA profiles in the vitreous of proliferative vitreoretinal disease (PVD) such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy with fibrovascular membrane and macular hole (MH) patients were studied by RT-PCR.

DESIGN
From each individual in the two cohorts: the PVD (n=3) and MH patients (n=3), vitreous specimens were collected and microRNAs were extracted for miRNA profiles analysis.
