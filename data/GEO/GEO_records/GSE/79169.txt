TITLE
Determine the function of lncBATE10 in brown and white adipocyte culture

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Determine the function of lncBATE10 in brown and white adipocyte differentiation Methods: primary brown and white apreadipocytes were isolated by cell culture. We infected brown preadipocytes with retroviral shRNA targeting lncBATE10 or with retrovirus overexpressing lncBATE10. Cells were induced to differetinate for 5 days. Total RNA were harvested for RNA-seq Conclusions: Our study shows that lncBATE10 is required for BAT-selective program expression. Overexpression of lncBATE10 is not sufficient to promote BAT marker expression.

DESIGN
total RNAs from primary brown and white adipocytes cultures (sh-control, shRNA knockdown, overexpression vector, overexpression of lncBATE10)  were generated by deep sequencing using Hi-seq 2000
