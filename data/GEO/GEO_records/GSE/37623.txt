TITLE
Analysis of transcriptome changes in HeLa cells after knock-down of variant U1.8 snRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
U1 small nuclear (sn)RNA, required for splicing of pre-mRNA, is encoded by genes on chromosome 1p36. Imperfect copies of these ‘true’ (t)U1 snRNA genes, located on chromosome 1q12-21, were thought to be pseudogenes. However, many of these ‘variant’ (v)U1 snRNA genes produce fully-processed transcripts that are packaged into potentially functional particles. Using antisense oligonucleotides, we have achieved functional knockdown of a specific vU1 snRNA in HeLa cells and identified over 400 transcriptome changes following interrogation of the Affymetrix Human Exon ST 1.0 array.

DESIGN
Total RNA from 4 biological repeats of vU1.8 snRNA and control knock-down were analysed using Affymetrix Human Exon ST 1.0 Array.
