TITLE
Genomewide analysis of the human p53 transcriptional network unveils a lncRNA tumor suppressor signature (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of high-throughput sequencing to performed the p53 regulated trancriptome in HCT116 colon cancer cells treated with the DNA damage 5FU. To study the direct targets of p53 we performed ChIP-seq to deterrmined the p53 biding sites and associated with the expression levels. With this study we identified the new genomic regions regulated by p53 and with special attention in those regions that are non coding and are differentially expressed by the DNA damage drug.
