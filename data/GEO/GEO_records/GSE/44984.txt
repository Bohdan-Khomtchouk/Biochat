TITLE
Plant growth in Arabidopsis is assisted by whole soil microbial communities

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plants in their natural and agricultural environments are continuously exposed to a plethora of diverse microorganisms resulting in microbial colonization of plants in the rhizosphere. This process is believed to be accompanied by an intricate network of ongoing simultaneous interactions. In this study, we compared transcriptional patterns of Arabidopsis thaliana roots and shoots in the presence and absence of whole microbial communities extracted from compost soil. The results show a clear growth promoting effect of Arabidopsis shoots in the presence of soil microbes compared to axenically grown plants under identical conditions. Element analyses showed that iron uptake was facilitated by these mixed microbial communities which also lead to transcriptional downregulation of genes required for iron transport. In addition, soil microbial communities suppressed the expression of marker genes involved in oxidative stress/redox signalling, cell wall modification and plant defense. While most previous studies have focussed on individual plant-microbe interactions, our data suggest that multi-species transcriptional profiling, using simultaneous plant and metatranscriptomics coupled to metagenomics may be required to further increase our understanding of the intricate networks underlying plant-microbe interactions in their diverse environments.

DESIGN
Four samples were analysed in total. One corresponded to a pooled sample of RNA extracted from root tissues of 60 plants. The other three were biological replicates from shoot tissues, each of which contained 20 plants. Controls were used as reference and corresponded to tissues of plants grown in sterile conditions.
