TITLE
Microarray profiling and co-expression network analysis of lncRNAs and mRNAs associated with acute leukemia in adult

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the distinct mechanisms in leukemogenesis between ALL and AML and to identify markers for diagnosis and treatment, lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles of AML and ALL patients and healthy controls were generated by using microarray analysis

DESIGN
Differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in 12 leukemic (6 AML patient samples and 6 ALL patient samples) and 6 normal bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) controls were measured

PLATFORM
GPL21242 Agilent-060228 Human LncRNA microarray (Probe Name version)
