TITLE
PRC SiRNA vs scramble transfection in XTC.UC1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PGC-1 related coactivator (PRC) shares structural and functional features with PGC-1{alpha}. It regulates several metabolic pathways and mitochondrial biogenesis. Its specific role in the early programming of cell proliferation suggests a finely regulated crosstalk between the mitochondrial functions and the cell cycle status. To explore the PRC-regulated pathways, we used a cell-line model of mitochondrial-rich tumors, presenting an oxidative metabolism and a specific increase in PRC expression. Microarray studies of temporal PRC invalidation in these XTC.UC1 cells were compared to the functional status of the mitochondria as well as to the expression level of genes and proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation process. Compared with what was observed for PGC-1{alpha}, we explored the role of nitric oxide in the PRC-regulated mitochondrial biogenesis. We proved that nitric oxide rapidly influences the expression of PRC at the transcriptional level. Focusing on mitochondrial energy metabolism, we demonstrated that PRC differentially controls the respiratory chain complexes and the coupling efficiency, in order to conserve a sufficient level of ATP and to protect the cell from oxidative stress. Our results highlight the key role of the PRC coactivator in the fine modulation of metabolic functions in response to the cell cycle status. Keywords: Transcriptionnal coactivator invalidation by SiRNA

DESIGN
Expression profiles at 0h, 12h, 24h and 48h of PRC SIRNA treatment compared to scramble and referred to time of 20% serum induction. Expression profiles of PRC SIRNA and scramble during serum starvation were referred as -1.
