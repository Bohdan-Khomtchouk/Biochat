TITLE
Large genomic alteration of 7q in two patients with multiple primary cancers, including triple negative breast cancer, and family history of malignant neoplasms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A great percentage of patients with multiple primary cancers (MPCs) and family history of cancer are suspected to have a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome. However, only a small proportion of these cases are explained by mutations in high-penetrance genes, suggesting the involvement of undiscovered genes in cancer predisposition. In this study, we report the molecular and clinical characterization of two unrelated patients with MPCs, a positive family history of cancer, no germline pathogenic mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 genes and large genomic rearrangements mapped on chromosome 7q.

DESIGN
Genomic rearrangements were assessed with Affymetrix CytoScan HD Array platform in two unrelated patients (Patient 1 and Patient 2) with multiple primary cancers. The mother of Patient 2 and five children (two of Patient 1 and three of Patient 2) were also evaluated. In addition, we performed the transcriptome analysis of the triple negative BC from Patient 2 using the Affymetrix HTA 2.0 platform.
