TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing and Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and p110gamma-/- macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study were to identify quantitative gene expression differences between macrophages derived from wild type and PI3Kgamma null macrophages Methods: mRNA profiles of MCSF, IL4 and IFNg/LPS stimulated macrophage  wild-type (WT) and PI3Kinase gamma knockout (p110g-/-) mice were generated by single read deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina  HiSeq2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were aligned to mouse transcriptome using the bowtie2 aligner. Gene-level summaries were normalized and analyzed for differential expression using DESeq. qRTâ€“PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of the role of p110g in the control of the macrophage immune response, with biological replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology.

DESIGN
