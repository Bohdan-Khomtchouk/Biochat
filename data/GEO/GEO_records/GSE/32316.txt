TITLE
FGFR1 target genes in brown adipose tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify genes that are regulated by FGFR1 in brown adipose tissues of adult male ob/ob mice by injecting 1 mg/kg anti-FGFR1 agonistic antibody.

DESIGN
Brown adipose tissues were isolated from adult male ob/ob mice at day 4 after a single intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg/kg anti-FGFR1 agonistic antibody or pair-fed mice injected with control IgG. N=6 mice per each group.
