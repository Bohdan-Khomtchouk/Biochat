TITLE
DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 plays a role in Arabidopsis seed maturation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We analysed the transcriptome of dry seeds (the end product of seed maturation) of three genotypes with different DOG1 expression levels. These included the WT Ler (low DOG1 expression), the near isogenic line NILDOG1-Cvi (strong DOG1 expression) and the non-dormant dog1-1 mutant (absence of DOG1 expression). NILDOG1-Cvi is the Ler WT containing an introgression of the Cvi accession on chromosome 5, which includes the DOG1 gene (Bentsink et al., 2006). The dog1-1 mutant is in the NILDOG1-Cvi genetic background. The aim was to obtain a global overview of the effect of different levels of DOG1 expression during seed maturation on the dry seed transcriptome.

DESIGN
Gene expression in dry seeds of three genotypes was compared: Ler, NILDOG1 and the dog1-1 mutant. For each genotype, three replicates were used.
