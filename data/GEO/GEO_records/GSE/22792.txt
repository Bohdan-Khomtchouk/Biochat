TITLE
Comparison of hiPSCs, hESCs and fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In our study, PRDM14 and NFRkB were found to enhance the reprogramming of human fibroblasts to hiPSCs in the presence of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, with/without c-MYC (OSK/OSKC). To examnie if the obtained hiPSC share similar expression signature with hESC, we conducted the microarray analysis on the hiPSCs,  hESCs and fibroblasts. The result showed that all of the examined hiPSCs resembled hESCs, but differed from fibroblasts MRC5.

DESIGN
4 hiPSC lines, 2 hESC lines and 1 type of fibroblasts were analyzed in total.  Each sample is done in duplicates.
