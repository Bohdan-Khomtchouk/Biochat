TITLE
Hdac6 regulates Tip60-p400 function in stem cells (gene expression)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the functional role of Hdac6 in embryonic stem cells, we examined gene expression changes in mouse ES cells upon Tip60, Hdac6 and double knockdown.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates each for control (GFP), Tip60, Hdac6 and double KD in E14 mouse ESCs. Lentiviral-based shRNA was used and gene expression changes were determined 3 days after KD. The global gene expression profiles of Tip60, Hdac6 and double KD were compared to control KD cells.
