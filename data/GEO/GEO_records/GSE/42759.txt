TITLE
Analyses of lung early responses to RSV in the neonatal environment reveal key roles for DC and type I IFN in controlling immunopathologic imprinting.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The gene expression profile of neonatal versus adult lung, 2 days after an RSV or mock infection was analyzed using whole mouse genome agilent microarrays.

DESIGN
Total lung RNA were extracted, labeled with Cy3 and hybridized on Agilent G4122F slides. We used 4 biological replicates per condition.

PLATFORM
