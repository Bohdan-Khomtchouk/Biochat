TITLE
Nr4a1 and Nr4a3 upregulate cell cycle genes upregulated in the Nkx6.1 β-cell proliferation pathway

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Loss of functional β-cell mass is a hallmark of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, and methods for restoring these cells are needed. Nkx6.1 induces β-cell proliferation, but the pathway by which Nkx6.1 activates β-cell expansion has not been defined. Here we demonstrate that Nkx6.1 induces expression of the Nr4a1 and Nr4a3 orphan nuclear receptors, and that these factors are both necessary and sufficient for Nkx6.1-mediated β-cell proliferation. Overexpression of the Nr4a receptors results in increased expression of key cell cycle inducers E2F1 and cyclin E1. Furthermore, Nr4a receptors induce components of the anaphase-promoting complex, including Ube2c.

DESIGN
We set up a microarray using primary rat islets that were left untreated or transduced with adenoviruses overexpressing GFP, Nr4a1 or Nr4a3 for 48 h.
