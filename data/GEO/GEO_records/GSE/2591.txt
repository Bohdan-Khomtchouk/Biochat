TITLE
Genetic instability in colon cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Experimental set accompanying Giacomini et al publication " A legacy gene-expression signature of genetic instability in colon cancer " .  Includes 18 colon cancer cell line training set, 13 colon cancer cell line test set, and 3 cell lines (HCT116, HCT116+ch2, HCT116+ch3) used to evaluate signature after correcting underlying genetic instability.  Experiments were performed by comparing mRNA from each colon cancer cell line (Cy5; channel 2) to a " universal " mRNA reference (Cy3; channel 1). A disease state experiment design type is where the state of some disease such as infection, pathology, syndrome, etc is studied. Series type: disease_state_design Series_overall_design: Using regression correlation Keywords: other
