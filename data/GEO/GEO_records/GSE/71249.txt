TITLE
Quantitative Genomic Analysis of RecA Protein Binding During DNA Double-Strand Break Repair Reveals RecBCD Action in vivo

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Here we have developed a method that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and mathematical modeling to quantify RecA protein binding during the active repair of a single DSB in the chromosome of Escherichia coli.

DESIGN
Examination of RecA binding during double-strand break repair in Escherichia coli
