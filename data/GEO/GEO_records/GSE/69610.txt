TITLE
Genome wide mapping of H3K27me3 in differentiated mouse podocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We explored H3K27me3 binding sites in the genome of differentiated, conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes.  Cells were allowed to differentiate for 14 days, following thermoshifting, before treatment with either vehicle (DMSO) or the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep, 5ÂµM for 48 hours) which degrades the histone methyltransferase, EZH2 ordinarily responsible for H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3).  DNA was immunopreciptated with an H3K27me3-specific antibody.
