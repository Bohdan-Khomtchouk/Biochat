TITLE
Gene expression changes in liver tissues from alcohol treated mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
transcriptomic changes in the early stages of ALD in mice fed the Lieber-Decarli liquid diet with or without alcohol for four months to identify biomarkers for the early stage of alcohol induced liver damage. Mice were sampled after 1, 2 and 4 months treatment.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control vs. alcohol treated at specified time point. Sample pooled from six biological replicates in each group. Reverse-fluorescence replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
