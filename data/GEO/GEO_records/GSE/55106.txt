TITLE
Identification of a Facial Enhancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated a genome-wide map of candidate enhancers from the maxillary arch (primordium for the upper jaw) of mouse embryos

DESIGN
Examination of histone modification H3K27ac (distinguishes active enhancers from inactive enhancer elements)  in the maxillary arch tissue

PLATFORM
GPL15103 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Mus musculus)
