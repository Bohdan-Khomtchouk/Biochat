TITLE
Gene expression profiling of generated sunitinib-resistant RCC cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The clinical response to sunitinib in advanced renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) is frequently limited in magnitude and duration due to drug resistance, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To discover mechanisms of resistance, we developed drug-resistant cell lines and have their gene expressions profiled and compared. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying sunitinib-resistance.

DESIGN
RCC cell lines 786-O and ACHN, which were initially sensitive to Erlotinib treatment, are injected subcutaneously into the flanks of nude mice. Mice were treated with sunitinib orally (40 mg/kg/day) in a standard 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off treatment schedule. After one cycle of treatment, RCC cells dissociated from xenografts were transplanted into secondary mice followed with the same sunitinib-treatment. RCC cells are finally obtained from the 3rd generation xenografts. 7Su3rd is a shortcut of 786-O cells with sunitinib-resistance from the 3rd generation. ACSu3rd is a shortcut of ACHN cells with sunitinib-resistance from the 3rd generation.Gene expression profiles of acquired resistant RCC cells 7Su3rd, ACSu3rd were compared to their parental counterpart 786-O and ACHN, respectively. We designed this experiment to screen for lncRNA which is required for sunitinib-resistance.
