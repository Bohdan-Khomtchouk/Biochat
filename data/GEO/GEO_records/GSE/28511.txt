TITLE
Endothelial and Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma mRNA expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Frozen skeletal muscle, tumor adjacent skeletal muscle, Endothelial Rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) and Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS)  samples were profiled on Illumina bead array.

DESIGN
Total RNA from primary resected samples were profiled to allow comparison of 1) normal skeletal muscle tissue with RMS samples and 2) ARMS with ERMS tumors.

PLATFORM
GPL6947 Illumina HumanHT-12 V3.0 expression beadchip
