TITLE
Apoptosis gene signature of Survivin and its splice variant expression in breast carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Survivin was described as strongly expressed in human cancer. To date, little is known about the association between Survivin splice variants and the other apoptosis-related genes. In this study, we analyzed the apoptosis gene signature of Survivin and its variant expression in breast cancer. Methods: Expression of the 5 transcripts was measured by RT-PCR in 135 breast carcinomas. Human Apoptosis Gene Arrays were used to screen the genes that could be associated with Survivin variants. Cox survival analysis was analyzed according to the breast cancer patient outcome. Results: Significant associations between Survivin transcript and the apoptotic gene array were found. Interestingly, Survivin-3B variant showed major inverse correlations with the pro-apoptotic gene array. Overexpression of Survivin-3B strongly inhibits 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide induced-apoptosis in breast tumor cell lines. In breast carcinomas, uni- and multivariate analysis showed patients with high level of survivin-3B expression had a shorter overall (p=0.030 and p=0.042, respectively) and disease-free (p=0.024 and p=0.009) survival. Conclusion: Our data indicate Survivin-3B could have an anti-apoptotic activity and its expression level might be used as a prognostic marker in breast carcinoma.
