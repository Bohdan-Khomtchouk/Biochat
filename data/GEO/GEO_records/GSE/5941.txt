TITLE
Schizosaccharomyces pombe ployg mutant cells expression profile.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of polg mutant cells reveal that many genes encoding proteins involved in cell wall biogenesis and stress response are induced, suggesting that polg mutant cells attempt to maintain growth potential and undergo extensive oxidative metabolism.  Conversely, many genes encoding proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and respiration are repressed, indicating that cells depleted of mtDNA are adapted to grow slowly in absence of mitochondrial function. Keywords: Schizosaccharomyces pombe ployg mutant cells vs wild type cells.

DESIGN
We analyzed 5 arrays of polyg mutant cells vs wild type cells.

PLATFORM
GPL1932 S. pombe 10K long oligonucleotide array
