TITLE
Specific gene expression related to epiblast development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore genes involved in epiblast development, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes. Embryoid body (EB) formation induces embryonic stem (ES) cells to differentiate into germ layers via epiblasts and extra-embryonic tissues, whereas ES cells give rise only to extra-embryonic tissues in monolayer culture. We compared gene expression profiles of ES cells in each differentiation culture methods at day 1-3 or 4 of differentiation. The expression of organizer related genes (Lhx1, Cer1 and Foxa2) was specifically induced at day 3 of EBs, but not in monolayer culture. In epiblast model cells, the overexpression of Lhx1 induced gene expression of organizer and meso-endodermal markers, suggested that Lhx1 was related to epiblast differentiation.

DESIGN
Gene expression related epiblast development was measured at undifferentiated state and day 1-3 or 4 of differentiation. Two independent experiments were performed at each time using different people for each experiment.
