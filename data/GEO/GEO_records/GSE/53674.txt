TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Gossypium hirsutum in response to NO by high-throughput tag-sequencing

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
Nitric oxide(NO) is emerging as an important signaling molecule with diverse physiological functions in plants, leading to a necessity to discover the downstream genes and signal transduction network modulated by NO. In the current study, changes in gene expression in response to NO were studied in upland cotton(Gossypium hirsutum) using Solexa/Illumina’s digital gene expression (DGE) system, a tag-based transcriptome sequencing method. After mapping to an integrated reference sequence database, we obtained about 30,000 genes per library, and yielded 2,393 differential expressed genes in total.

DESIGN
Plants 3 hours after treatment with Mock(A), 100μM SNP(B), 250μM SNP(C), and 10μM cPTIO(D) were used for RNA extraction and library construction. To investigate the reliability and reproducibility of the sequencing method, another library was constructed for 250μM SNP(CR), forming a technical replicate.

PLATFORM
