TITLE
Helicobacter pylori pathogenic mechanism

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Helicobacter pylori infection reprograms host gene expression and influences various cellular processes, which have been investigated by cDNA microarray in vitro culture cells and in vivo patients of the chronic abdominal complaint. In this studyï¼Œthe effects of H. pylori infection on host gene expression in the gastric antral mucosa of patients with chronic gastritis were examined.

DESIGN
The gastric antral mucosa was obtained from a total of 6 untreated patients undergoing gastroscopic and pathologic confirmation of chronic superficial gastritis. Three patients infected by H. pylori and 3 patients uninfected were used to cDNA microarray experiment.
