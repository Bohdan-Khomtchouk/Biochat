TITLE
Comparing proteomics and RISC immunoprecipitations to identify targets of Epstein-Barr viral miRNAs [RISC-IP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epstein-Barr virus is a gamma-herpes virus that is causally associated with several lymphomas and carcinomas. This virus encodes at least 25 pre-miRNAs, which are expressed in infected cells to yield more than 50 detected mature miRNAs. miRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that inhibit gene expression by promoting the inhibition of translation or of degradation of mRNAs. Currently, the function of these viral miRNAs and the contribution they provide to EBV's life-cycle remain largely unknown, due to difficulties in identifying cellular and viral genes regulated by these miRNAs. We have compared and contrasted two methods to identify targets of viral miRNAs in order to identify the advantages and limitations of each method to aid in uncovering the functions of EBV's miRNAs.
