TITLE
B.thetaiotaomicron wt, TYG (in vitro) and NMRI (in vivo)

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles of B. thetaiotaomicron wild type. Bacteria harvested in duplicate from multiple time points during growth in Tryptone-YeastExtract-Glucose (TYG) medium in chemostats were profiled. Cecal populations of wt bacteria monoassociated 10d in NMRI gnotobiotic mice fed a standard-chow polysaccharide rich (PR) diet (n=6 samples) were profiled. Keywords: in vitro timecourse and in vivo study

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from harvested bacterium grown in TYG medium and cecal contents of 10 day monoassociated gnotobiotic mice and hybridized to B. thetaiotaomicron GeneChips.
