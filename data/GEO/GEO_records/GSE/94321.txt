TITLE
Embryonic signature distinguishes pediatric and adult rhabdoid tumors from other SMARCB1-deficient cancers

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to compare gene expression profilings in various SMARCB1-deficient tumors.

DESIGN
[human mRNA] 16 RT, 16 SD-NRT (8 Epithelioid Sarcomas, 3 Undifferentiated Chordomas and 5 Renal Medullary Carcinomas), 37 SMARCB1 deficient tumors.
