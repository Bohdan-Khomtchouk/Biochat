TITLE
Epigenetic Alterations in Dense Human Spermatozoa for Assisted Reproduction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Selected human sperms with ART technique demonstrate many changes in the genetic and epigenetic aspects. There are many evidances shown that DNA damange and histone retention ratio have significant improved after selection with different methods. These changes may relate with DNA epigenetic changes, however no evidance demonstate these relevance. In this study, MeDIP-ChIP method has been employed to detect DNA methylation loci in human sperm genome processed with density selection. Results demonstrated that DNA methylation changed in specific gene location.

DESIGN
comparison the DNA methylation site between 3 pair human sperm DNA samples before or after density selection
