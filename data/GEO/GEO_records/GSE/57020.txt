TITLE
Analysis of RNA from primary hepatocytes from hepatocyte-specific SRSF1 knockout mice vs. WT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA from primary hepatocyte cultures from three 3-month-old SRSF1HKO mice compared to RNA from three 3-month-old WT mice for changes in exon utilization and gene expression.

DESIGN
SRSF1 KO vs. WT, three replicates each.

PLATFORM
GPL6096 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
