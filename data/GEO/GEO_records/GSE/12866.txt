TITLE
PreA overexpression in Salmonella typhimurium

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Comparisons of overexpression of PreA (in wt or preAB mutant Salmonella) to Salmonella lacking preA or preAB in late log phase growth in LB

DESIGN
preA was externally supplied to wt or preAB mutant Salmonella typhimurium on a pBAD18 plasmid, which was then induced by 10mM arabinose and grown to late log phase (OD0.74). Transcription profiles were compared with those obtained from preA or preAB mutant Salmonella harboring pBAD18 only as vector control.
