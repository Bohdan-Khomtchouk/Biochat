TITLE
Expression data from human metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CXCR4 expression by metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma is heterogeneous among patients and among lesions We used microarrays for 57 ACC metastases from 42 patients to evaluate gene expression in different lesions from same patients and over time, focusing on CXCR4 expression and other genes correlating with CXCR4 expression

DESIGN
57 ACC metastases from 42 patients were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain data on CXCR4 expression by ACC metastases. Multiple lesion samples were aquired for 9 of the patients, labeled a thru i. Single samples were aquired from the other subjects.

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
