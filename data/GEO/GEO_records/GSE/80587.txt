TITLE
High-dose maternal folic acid supplementation before conception impairs reversal learning in offspring mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Folic acid supplements prior to and during gestation are recommended and necessary to prevent neural tube defects in developing embryos. But there are also studies suggesting possible adverse effects of high-dose folic acid supplementation. Here, we address whether maternal dietary folic acid supplementation at 40 mg/kg chow (FD), restricted to a period prior to conception, affects gene expression in the offspring generation.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from hippocampi of 6 control (CD) F1 mice and 5 FD F1 mice at the age of 14 weeks.
