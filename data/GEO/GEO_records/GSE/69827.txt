TITLE
Differential expression profiles of type I JAK inhibitor persistent vs. naïve MPN cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The type I JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib is approved for therapy of MPN patients but evokes resistance with longer exposure. Several novel type I JAK inhibitors were studied and we show that they uniformly induce resistance via a shared mechanism of JAK family heterodimer formation.Here we studied the expression profiles of SET2 cell lines persistent to several different type I JAK inhibitors in comparison to naive SET2 cells or in comparison to SET2 cells with acute exposure to ruxolitinib.

DESIGN
Analysis of RNA isolated from several type I JAK inhibitor SET2 cell lines in comparison to naïve SET2 cells
