TITLE
Cryptococcus neoformans gene expression in minimal media of wild type (WT) and all1all2Δ mutant cells

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans

SUMMARY
To examine the comparative transcription profile of WT and all1all2Δ mutant cells in in vitro conditions to determine genes resposible for hyporvirulent phenotype of all1all2Δ mutant cells. Using transcriptional profiling, we determined that many genes involved in amino acid transport were differentially transcribed between the wild type and the all1all2Δ mutant strain. The genes differentially expressed in double mutant of ALL1 ALL2 did not overlap with ALL1 and ALL2 comparative transcriptomes with RC2 (WT).

DESIGN
For arrays, total RNA was isolated from WT and all1all2Δ mutant using Qiagen RNeasy Kit. For RNA extraction, WT and all1all2Δ mutant were grown in minimal media. Cells were grown for overnight, diluted 1:100 and then again grown overnight or up to an OD of 0.6-0.7 with agitation (150rpm) at 37°C.
