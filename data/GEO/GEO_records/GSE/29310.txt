TITLE
R.palustris: cbbT1 overexpression and  cbbT2 overexpression

ORGANISM
Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Rhodopseudomonas palustris (R. palustris) comparing cbbT1 over-expressing strain with cbbT2 over-expressing strain. Goal was to discriminate the molecular mechanisms between transketolase I (cbbT1) and transketolase II (cbbT2). R.palustris is a purple non-sulfur anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium and transketolase (cbbT1 and cbbT2) is a key enzyme involved in the CBB cycle. Here, we investogated the functions of transketolase isoforms I (cbbT1) and II (cbbT2) in R. palustris through transcriptional profiling and other functional assays.
