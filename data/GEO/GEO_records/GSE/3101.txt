TITLE
Chitin oligosaccharide induction

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
Strain N16961 grown in M9 + 0.5 % lactate to OD 0.2. Culture was split and one part added 0.6 mM of indicated chitin oligosaccharide. Samples was isolated after 30 and 60 min. cDNA was prepared from 2 ug RNA and labeled with Cy3 (no induction) and Cy5 (induction with chitin oligosaccharide). Samples from at least two independent experiments and a total of four hybridizations for each chitin oligosaccharide and time. A growth condition experiment design type is where some part of the growth condition is changed for the purposes of the experiment, examples of growth conditions changed are media, temperature, humidity, light, nutrients.
