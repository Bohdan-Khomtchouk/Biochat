TITLE
Oxygen exposure increases resistance of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough to hydrogen peroxide inactivation

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio vulgaris str. Hildenborough

SUMMARY
Differences in gene expression between a mutant D. vulgaris strain missing the PerR transcriptional regulator gene and the wild-type strain.

DESIGN
For each condition (PerR_cDNA_vrs_gDNA, wild-type_cDNA_vrs_gDNA) 2 unique biological samples were hybridized to 4 arrays that each contained duplicate spots. Genomic DNA was used as universal reference. Log2 PerR mutant versus wild-type gene expresson with growth on WP-lactate. SUPPLEMENTARY FILES: * Log2 gene expression ratios of PerR mutant/wild-type (PerR/gDNA/ wildtype/gDNA) and q-values. * Wild type raw data. * PerR mutant raw data.
