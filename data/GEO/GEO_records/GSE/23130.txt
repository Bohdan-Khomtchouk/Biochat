TITLE
Gene Array Data from Human Annulus Disc Tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although it is well-recognized that apoptosis, senescence, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines and catabolic products are important factors in the degeneration of the human intervertebral disc, there is poor understanding of the underlying cause. The objective of the present study was to analyze gene expression patterns in the human annulus disc tissue.

DESIGN
Disc Tissue samples were obtained via the National Cancer Institute Cooperative Tissue Network (CHTN) as well as surgical disc procedures performed on patients with herniated discs and degenerative disc disease. Tissue was treated by one of the following methods: 1) fixed, paraffin embedded and standard laser capture microdissection (LCM) techniques used to collect cells or 2) homogenized in TRIzol reagent. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed via mircoarray.
