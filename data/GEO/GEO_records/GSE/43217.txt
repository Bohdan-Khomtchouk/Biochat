TITLE
Gene expression profile changes in PKC-inhibitor-pretreated HT1080 cells cells after TLR3 stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TLR3 stimulation by extracellular dsRNA (e.g. polyIC) induces expression of numerous genes. The inhibition of PKC by Go6976 prior to TLR3 stimulation leads to an ablation of expression of IRF-3-dependent genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from HT1080 cells with or without 1 h pretreatment with 5 uM Go6976, after 6 h of treatment with dsRNA (polyIC), compared to untreated controls

PLATFORM
GPL6883 Illumina HumanRef-8 v3.0 expression beadchip
