TITLE
Expression profiling of laser-microdissected tissue from APPPS1 plaque-depositing mouse model of Alzheimer's disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Amyloid-ß (Aß) plaques are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. However, the precise neuropathological changes that occur in brain in response to amyloid deposition are largely unknown. To study the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for Aß-mediated neuropathology, we performed a gene expression analysis on frontal neocortical brain tissue of APPPS1 mice compared to their littermate controls.

DESIGN
4 samples; 2 biological replicates of each condition = 2 transgenic versus 2 non-transgenic mice; no amplification of total RNA; Cy3/Cy5 dye-swap design
