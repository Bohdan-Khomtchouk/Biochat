TITLE
Expression data from Mammospheres

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The combined activation of Wnt/ÃŸ-catenin and MET/HGF is required for mammary cancer stem cell (MaCSC) maintenance. We generated mammospheres derived from tumors of mice harboring Wnt/Met signaling mutations on which we performed microarray analysis to evaluate gene expression signatures controlled by Wnt and MET pathways. We used the gene expression profiles to dissect the role and the functions of these pathways in MaCSCs.

DESIGN
We treated mammospheres with Wnt and MET pathway inhibitors alone or in combination. Samples treated with DMSO were used as vehicle control.
