TITLE
Short Read Sequencing Data of the Transcriptome of the Rheumatoid Arthritis Rat Model Treated with Acupuncture (HiSeq 2000, miRNA, batch 1)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report the application of Illumina Hiseq2000 sequencing technology for high-throughput miRNA profiling of the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rat model induced by collagen type II (CIA),  with acupuncture and placebo treatments.

DESIGN
The experiment is designed as 2 arms: epidermal needle manipulation (AP/MEC) and placebo (PLA, used as control) on CIA induced rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rats. Muscle tissue samples sampling was carried out before any therapy in RA rats (RA_T0), and after at 1 hour and 34 days of therapeutic treatments for both AP and PLA. From all the 10 blood collected samples (2 replicates for each group, for each timepoint), total RNA were extracted. Finally, purified RNA were analyzed using illumina hiseq 2000).
