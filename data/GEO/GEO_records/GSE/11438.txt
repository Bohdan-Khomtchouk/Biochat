TITLE
Spneu D39 wildtype grown in GM17 versus GM17 + 0.25 mM ZnSO4

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae

SUMMARY
This study addresses the response of Streptococcus pneumoniae to zinc. The wild-type strain D39 was grown in GM17 and GM17 with 0.25 mM of ZnSO4. The transcriptome under these conditions was compared by using microarrays. Keywords: transcriptome analysis of D39 wild-type compared with its isogenic glnPA double mutant

DESIGN
The wild-type strain D39 was grown in 4 biological replicates in GM17 and in GM17+0.25 mM ZnSO4 to an Optical Density at 600 nm of 0.3. From these cultures samples were prepared for transciptome determination with in-house printed microarrays covering the genomes of several S. pneumoniae species. The GM17 samples (CH1) and GM17+ZnSO4 samples (CH2) were labeled with Cy5 or Cy3. Samples were hybridized to glass-microarray slides. This work is part of a publication that is likely to be released in june/july 2008: 'Opposite effects of Mn2+ and Zn2+ on the PsaR-mediated expression of the virulence genes pcpA, prtA and psaBCA of Streptococcus pneumoniae " by Kloosterman et al.
