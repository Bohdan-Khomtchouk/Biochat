TITLE
Spneu D39 wildtype grown in GM17 versus GM17 + 0.25 mM ZnSO4

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4

SUMMARY
This study addresses the response of Streptococcus pneumoniae to zinc. The wild-type strain D39 was grown in GM17 and GM17 with 0.25 mM of ZnSO4. The transcriptome under these conditions was compared by using microarrays. Keywords: transcriptome analysis of D39 wild-type compared with its isogenic glnPA double mutant
