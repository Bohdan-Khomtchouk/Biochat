TITLE
RNAseq in C57Bl6 and congenic Atf3-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA expression from whole pancreatic tissue was assessed by RNA-seq following 4 hours into cerulein-induced pancreatitis in mice lacking the transcription factor ATF3 or congenic C57Bl6 mice. Three mice were used for each group and sequncing performed by Toronto Genomics Centre.

DESIGN
Groups included C57Bl6 and Atf3-/- mice; saline and cerulein treated; 4 hours after initial cerulein injection. Each animal received 4 injections over 4 hours of 50 ug/kg cerulein or saline. Each group consisted of three animals.
