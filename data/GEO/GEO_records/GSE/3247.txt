TITLE
Expression profile comparison among Listeria monocytogenes strains

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to contribute to the understanding of L. monocytogenes virulence and survival capabilities using global gene expression profiling by means of DNA macroarrays. Keywords: strain comparison; correlation between expression and behaviour

DESIGN
The nylon membrane contains probes for all L. monocytogenes (EGDe strain) genes plus some 4b specific genes.  All hibridizations were performed as 4-plicates. Since macroarray is a 'one-color' technology, there is no competitve hybridization, dye-swap and so on.

PLATFORM
GPL2811 Listeria monocytogenes (EGDe) macroarray, version 1
