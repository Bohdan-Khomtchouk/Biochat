TITLE
Ginger compound [6]-shogaol activates Nrf2 in human colon epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the direct molecular targets of 6S, gene microarrays were used to profile gene expression in HCT-116 cells treated with 6S (20 uM for 24 h) comparing with HCT-116 cells treated with DMSO (control).

DESIGN
Two-class comparisons. HCT-116 cells treated with 6S (20 uM for 24 h) vs. HCT-116 cells treated with DMSO control;Biological replicates: 4 replicates for each group.

PLATFORM
