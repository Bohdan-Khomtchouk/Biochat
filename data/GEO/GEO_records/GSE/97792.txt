TITLE
Inferring Gene Regulatory Networks that control maintenance and identity of the Arabidopsis Root Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We isolated QC cells and obtained their cell-type specific transcriptional profiles in a WT and in a pan mutant background by sorting GFP+ cells marked with pWOX5::GFP.

DESIGN
Seedlings were grown for 5 days.  WOX5::GFP sorted fluorecent cells were harvested for RNA extraction.

PLATFORM
GPL17639 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
