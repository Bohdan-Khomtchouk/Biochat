TITLE
Effect of splicing on histone H3 K36 methylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Histone H3 K36me3 and RNA pol II were localized by ChIP before and after inhibition of splicing by spliceostatin for 12 hr. Total matched reads for the control and SSA treated Hela samples were 11.6 and 8.2 million for anti-H3K36me3 and 6.6 and 5.0 million for anti-pol II.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of histone H3 K36me3 and RNA pol II in Hela cells before and after spliceosotatin treatment
