TITLE
Functional coordination and HuR-mediated regulation of mRNA stability during T cell activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We evaluated changes in mRNA stability and transcription using 4sU metabolic pulse labeling across a four hour time course following activation of Jurkat T cells with PMA and PHA

DESIGN
Measurement of total mRNA (T) and 4sU labeled mRNA (IP) in three biological replicates at five time points: prior to activation (U) and the first four hours after activation (1-4)

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
