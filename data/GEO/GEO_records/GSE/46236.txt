TITLE
Expression data from LPS-treated HBVP (human brain vascular pericytes)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of TLR4 as one of the most abundant RNA species in pericytes with respect to MSC, and corroboration of TLR4 expression on the cell surface, led us to obtain a comprehensive overview of the expression program of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated pericytes. Microarray analyisis demonstrated the significant upregulation of 76 annotated genes including transcripts for adhesion molecules, inflammation mediators, pro-angiogenic factors, transcription factors and anti-apoptotic proteins.

DESIGN
Cells were cultured in 24-w plates in complete medium for 24h before stimulation with 1 microgram/ml LPS for 4h. Samples are biological triplicates.
