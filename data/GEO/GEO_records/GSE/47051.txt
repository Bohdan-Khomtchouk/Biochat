TITLE
Genome-wide differential gene expression signatures in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia subtypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We surveyed the genome-wide DNA methylation levels and gene expression patterns in patients with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips, we identified a relatively small set of CpG sites that are highly correlated with gene expression.

DESIGN
Genome-wide expression analysis of 108 primary ALL samples by Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips used to investigate relationships between subtype-specific DNA methylation patterns and gene expression in 93 patients with both gene expression and DNA methylation data.
