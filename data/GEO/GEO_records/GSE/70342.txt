TITLE
LncPHx2 RNA-interactome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LncPHx2 RNA-interactome study realed that LncPHx2 is associated with multiple RNAs

DESIGN
Biotinylated DNA probes targeting LncPHx2 were used to precipitate endogenous LncPHx2 and associated RNAs from Hepa 1-6 cells. The associated RNAs were sequenced and 415 unique transcripts were identified.
