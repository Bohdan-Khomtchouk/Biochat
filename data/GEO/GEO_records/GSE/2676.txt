TITLE
Synovial fibroblast activated by IL-1beta; effect of prostacyclin signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Synovial fibroblasts were extracted from knee joints of naïve mice(DBA/1J, male 8-12 week old), and passaged 3-4 times. Cells were plated at a concentration of 1 X 106 cells/dish in 60 mm dish in 5 ml of RPMI1640 medium with 1% heat-inactivated FCS at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cells were treated vehicle or stimulated by IL-1beta. In IL-1beta(5ng/ml) stimulated groups, indomethacin (1 μM) and iloprost (1μM) were further added either alone or in combination. After 6 hour stimulation as described above, cells were isolated and frozen by liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80°C before use. Total RNA was extracted by RNAeasy Mini Kit. The RNA sample was labeled for hybridization onto the genechip array according to the standard affymetrix protcols. Keywords = arthritis prostacyclin Keywords: other
