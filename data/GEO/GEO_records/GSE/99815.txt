TITLE
Bulk cell RNAseq of putatative intestinal stem cell populations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A comparative bulk cell RNA-seq analysis of diverse intestinal stem cell populations was performed, for cells expressing the following markers: Lgr5-eGFPhi, Cd166+, Cd24lo, Grp78, upper side population (SP), Bmi1, mTert, Hopx, Dclk1, a lower side population (SP)

DESIGN
For each ISC population of interest, three independent mice (biological replicates) were used.  From each mouse, a marker-“positive” and a marker-“negative” population were collected, as well as a " total " population.
