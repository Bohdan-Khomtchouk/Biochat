TITLE
Characterization and clinical evaluation of CD10+ stroma cells in the breast cancer microenvironment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: There is growing evidence that interaction between stromal and tumor cells is pivotal in breast cancer progression and response to therapy. Since the pioneer work of Allinen et al. suggested that during breast cancer progression striking changes occur in CD10+ stromal cells, we aimed to better characterize this cell population and its clinical relevance. Results: This 12-gene CD10+ stroma signature includes among others genes involved in matrix remodeling (MMP11, MMP13, COL10A1) and genes related to osteoblast differentiation (periostin). The co-culture experiments demonstrated all three CD10+ cell types contribute to the CD10+ stroma signature. Of interest, this signature demonstrated an important role in differentiating in situ from invasive breast cancer, in prognosis of the HER2+ subpopulation of breast cancer only, and potentially in non-response to chemotherapy for those patients. Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of CD10+ cells in breast cancer prognosis and efficacy of chemotherapy, particularly within the HER2+ breast cancer disease.

DESIGN
We developed a CD10+ stroma gene expression signature (using HG U133 Plus 2.0) based on the comparison of CD10 cells isolated from tumoral (n=28) and normal (n=3) breast tissue. We further characterized the CD10+ cells by co-culture experiments of representative breast cancer cell lines with the different CD10+ stromal cell types (fibroblasts, myoepithelial and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)). We then evaluated its clinical relevance in terms of in situ to invasive progression, invasive breast cancer prognosis and prediction of efficacy of chemotherapy using publicly available datasets.
