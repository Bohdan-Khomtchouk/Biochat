TITLE
Oxidative burden and mitochondrial dysfunction in a mouse model of Rett syndrome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the detailed molecular causes of the mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative burden and more vulnerable redox balance in Rett mouse hippocampus, we screened for differential gene expression in the hippocampal CA1 subfield of adult male mice. A whole mouse genome microarray was performed to assess, whether key enzymes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain or major cellular radical scavenging enzymes are affected in this MeCP2-deficient mouse model of Rett syndrome.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression between male wildtype mice (Mecp2+/y) and mice lacking the MECP2 gene (Mecp2-/y) [B6.129P2(C)-Mecp2tm-1-1Bird (Guy et al. 2001, Nat. Genet. 27: 322-326)]. In total, 9 mice of each genotype were analyzed. The mRNA of groups of 3 animals was pooled to generate 3 independent biological samples, and finally three microarrays were run for each genotype.
