TITLE
Gene expression from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCHN) cancer cells before and after figitumumab

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients with palliative SCCHN were treated with figitumumab, an IGF-1R inhibitor. This receptor plays an important role in cell growth, proliferation and differentiation and is often overexpressed in SCCHN. No significant clinical activity was observed in our study We used microarray to establish hypothesis for treatment resistance

DESIGN
Tissue biopsies before and after figitumumab were stored in RNA later, total RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
