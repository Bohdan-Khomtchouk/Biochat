TITLE
Expression analysis of aging cardiac tubes in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Investigation of the whole genome expression levels from dissected adult cardiac tubes at 10 days and 40 day. We describe a functional genomic investigation of the genetic control of cardiac senescence in Drosophila. Molecular signatures of heart aging were identified by differential transcriptome analysis followed by a detailed bio-informatic analysis. This approach implicated the JNK/dJun pathway and the transcription factor Vri/dNFIL3 in the transcription regulatory network involved in cardiac senescence and suggested the possible involvement of oxidative stress (OS) in the aging process.

DESIGN
4 biological replicates for each time point (10 days and 40 days) were used. Dye-swap replications, in which each hybridization is done twice, with dye assignments reversed in the second hybridization, were used with a design which allows direct comparison between time points . This method allows technical replicates and eliminates variation that might result from differences in fluorescence dye intensities.
