TITLE
Rice A20/AN1 zinc-finger containing stress-associated proteins (SAP1/11) and a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (OsRLCK253) interact via A20 zinc-finger and confer abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The inbuilt mechanisms of plant survival have been exploited for improving tolerance to abiotic stresses. We have investigated the subcellular interactions of rice stress-associated proteins (SAPs) using yeast two-hybrid and FRET approaches and found that A20 domain mediates the interaction of OsSAP1 with self, its close homolog OsSAP11, and a rice receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, OsRLCK253. Such interactions between OsSAP1/11 and with OsRLCK253 occur at nuclear membrane, plasma membrane and in nucleus. Functionally, both OsSAP11 and OsRLCK253 could improve the water-deficit and salt stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants via a signaling pathway affecting the expression of several common endogenous genes. The yield in transgenic plants is also protected indicating the agronomic relevance of OsSAP11 and OsRLCK253 in conferring abiotic stress tolerance.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis transgenic plants expressing rice genes OsSAP11 and OsRLCK253  were compared with untransformed plants at seedling level
