TITLE
Transcriptional Networks in Mouse Trophoblast Stem Cell Self-Renewal

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Trophoblast stem cells (TS cells), derived from the trophectoderm (TE) of blastocysts, require transcription factors (TFs) and external signals (Fgf4, Activin/Nodal/Tgfb) for self-renewal.  While many reports have focused on TF networks that regulate embryonic stem cell (ES cell) self-renewal and pluripotency, little is know about TF networks that regulate self-renewal in TS cells.  To further understand transcriptional networks in TS cells we used chromatin immunopreciptiation and DNA microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) to investigate targets of TFs Ap-2g (Tcfap2c), Eomes, Ets2, and Gata3, and a chromatin remodeling factor, Brg1 (Smarca4).  We then evaluated the transcriptional states of target genes using transcriptome analysis and genome-wide analysis of histone H3 acetylation (AcH3).  Our results describe previously unknown transcriptional networks in TS cells, including TF occupancy of genes involved in ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency, co-occupancy of multiple TFs at target genes, and transcriptional regulatory circuitry within the 5 factors.  Through genome-wide mapping and global expression analysis of 5 TF target genes, our data provide a comprehensive analysis of transcriptional networks that regulate TS cell self-renewal.
