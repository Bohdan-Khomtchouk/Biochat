TITLE
UC San Diego_Friedmann_Kang_ESD3_Neuronal Differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The overall gene expression pattern of HPRT knockdown murine D3 stem cells during neuronal differentiation was invesitigated by microarray based gene expression analysis and the results were interpreted by GO, GSEA and signaling pathway analyses with GeneSpring GX and PANTHER Classification System.

DESIGN
For microarray experiment, total RNAs from replicated HPRT knockdown and control cultures were pooled and the microarray experiment with each pooled sample was triplicated, respectively.
