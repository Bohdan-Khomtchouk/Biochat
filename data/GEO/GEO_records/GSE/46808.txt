TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of wild-type NCTC11168 and Cj0480c mutant grown without fucose

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Strain specific growth of C. jejuni on fucose has been linked to a plasticity region of the chromosome (PR2) and confers a competitive advantage during intestinal colonization.  Growth on fucose induces gene expression of PR2 genes, but the regulatory mechanism of the structural genes involved with fucose utilization is unknown.  A mutant was constructed to examine the role of Cj0480c, a putative IclR-type transcriptional regulator, on PR2 gene expression.  Transcriptional profiles of wild-type C. jejuni and the Cj0480c mutant strain grown without fucose may provide insight in to the extent of the fucose regulon and genes that are necessary for fucose utilization.

DESIGN
The design utilized an available two color microarray slide for the entire transcriptome of Campylobacter jejuni wild type strain NCTC 11168. Each sample represents one competitive hybridization: wild-type NCTC 11168 v.s. Cj0480c isogenic mutant. There were four biological replicates of each sample with a dye swap introduced in alternating replicates. Samples were  independently grown, treated and harvested.

PLATFORM
GPL10622 JCVI PFGRC Campylobacter jejuni 16K v4 array designed primarily based on strain NCTC_11168
