TITLE
Circadian transcriptional profile of Synechococcus under the kaiA overexpression

ORGANISM
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942

SUMMARY
In the unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, essentially all promoter activities are under the control of the circadian clock in continuous light (LL) conditions. Here, we employed high-density oligonucleotide arrays to investigate comprehensive profiles of genome-wide Synechococcus gene expression in kaiA-overexpressor (Ptrc::[GTG]kaiA) strains under LL. KaiC has been proposed to globally activate gene expression, our analysis revealed that dawn expressing genes were downregulated by kaiA-overexpression, such that the clock was arrested at subjective dawn.

DESIGN
IPTG-inducible kaiA-overexpressor (oxA) S. elongatus PCC 7942 strains were analyzed under continuous light (LL) using Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide microarrays (GeneChip CustomExpress Arrays) representing predicted 2,515 protein-coding genes on the genome of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301, which can be used also to the almost homologous strain, S. elongatus PCC 7942: a single experiment in oxA under LL in the presence or absence of an inducer, IPTG, from hour 24 to 48 in LL timecourse data (24~48 hours under continuous light) from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (inducible kaiA-overexpressor) strains
