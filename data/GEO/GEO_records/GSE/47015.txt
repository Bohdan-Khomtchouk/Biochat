TITLE
Circadian transcriptional profile of Synechococcus under the kaiA overexpression

ORGANISM
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942

SUMMARY
In the unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, essentially all promoter activities are under the control of the circadian clock in continuous light (LL) conditions. Here, we employed high-density oligonucleotide arrays to investigate comprehensive profiles of genome-wide Synechococcus gene expression in kaiA-overexpressor (Ptrc::[GTG]kaiA) strains under LL. KaiC has been proposed to globally activate gene expression, our analysis revealed that dawn expressing genes were downregulated by kaiA-overexpression, such that the clock was arrested at subjective dawn.
