TITLE
H. ducreyi 35000HP grown in the presence or absence of FCS

ORGANISM
Haemophilus ducreyi 35000HP

SUMMARY
Haemophilus ducreyi 35000HP was subjected to different in vitro growth conditions that resemble the in vivo host environment (presence of serum), in order to ascertain the overall changes in gene expression.  This information might identify genes important for colonization and/or survival inside the host.

DESIGN
H. ducreyi 35000HP was grown for 8 hours in Columbia broth in the presence or absence of FCS.  After 8 hours total RNA was isolated and processed for DNA microarray analysis. This study includes four biological replicates (paired samples of bacteria grown in the presence/absence of FCS), one of which (Rep1) was selected for dye swap.
