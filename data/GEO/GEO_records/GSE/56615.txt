TITLE
Expression data from human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231-Luc knockdown for RRAS2 expression.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate gene expression changes induced by the inhibition of RRAS2 expression using shRNA techniques to stably knockdown the endogenous transcripts of this GTPase in human MDA-MB-231-Luc cells.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231-Luc shControl (MDA-Control) and RRAS2-deficient (KDRRAS2.p1) in exponential growth phase were selected for RNA extraction and and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
