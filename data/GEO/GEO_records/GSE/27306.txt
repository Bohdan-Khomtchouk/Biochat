TITLE
IRE1-dependent transcriptome remodelling upon ER stress in human glioma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigate the contribution of IRE1 signaling to the modulation of U87 glioma cells transcriptome upon various stresses. To this end, IRE1 control and IRE1 dominant negative expressing U87 glioma cells were subjected to environmental or chemical challenges and their transcriptome monitored using Affymetrix microarrays.

DESIGN
Stress-induced transcriptome modulation in function of IRE1 proficiency/deficiency
