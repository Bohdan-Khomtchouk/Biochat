TITLE
Regulation of gene expression by ATF2 in mouse melanocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
primary melanocytes from WT and ATF2 mutant (transcriptionally inactive) mice expressing the mutant N-ras transgene were prepared and assessed for changes in gene expression when maintained under normoxia and hypoxia growth conditions.

DESIGN
12 mouse melanocyte samples were analyzed during normoxia and hypoxia, with different ATF2 genotypes. The pivotal samples are represented as duplicates. Treatment of tamoxifen was used to induce recombination and expression of the mutant ATF2 (inducible Cre). Doxycyclin was used to induce expression of mutant N-Ras transgene.
