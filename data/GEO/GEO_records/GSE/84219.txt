TITLE
Expression analysis in ductal adenocarcinoma in patients with low and high survival after tumor resection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in pancreatic tumors. Results obtained show an expression gene profile associated with longer survival in patients.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from paraffined samples of ductal adenocarcinomas from patients with pancreatic cancer. Patients were grouped depending on their survival (higher or lower than 24 months) after tumor resection and their tumor stage.
