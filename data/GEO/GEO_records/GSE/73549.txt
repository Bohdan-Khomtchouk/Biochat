TITLE
Determining Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness Utilizing a Novel DNA Methylation Approach

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The clinical management of prostate cancer is challenging and currently relies primarily on staging, histological grading, and tumor size. In this study, we take advantage of the propensity of prostate cancer to be multifocal and categorize aggressiveness of individual prostate cancer foci based on DNA methylation patterns in primary and metastatic tumors.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from 92 samples was hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
