TITLE
Gene expression (RNA-Seq) analysis of primary human T cells reveals novel genes associated with Th2 memory differentiation and asthma susceptibility

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A characteristic feature of asthma is the aberrant accumulation, differentiation or function of memory CD4+ T cells that produce Th2 cytokines (Th2 cells). By comparing gene expression profiles of T cell subsets isolated from peripheral blood of healthy and asthmatic individuals, we identified genes with known and potential roles in the normal differentiation of human Th1 and Th2 cells.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression in 3 human cell types in healthy and asthmatic individuals.
