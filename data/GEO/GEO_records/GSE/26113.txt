TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of transfection of miR-141 or miR-200c in murine fibroblasts subjected to acute oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of abnormal cellular response to stress after overexpression of stress-induced microRNAs. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that miR-141 or miR-200c may influence transcription of stress-pathways related genes

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from fibroblasts transfected for 48h with Control, miR-141 or miR-200c. 2h hours before lysis, fibroblasts were stimulated with 400 uM H2O2.

PLATFORM
GPL6105 Illumina mouse-6 v1.1 expression beadchip
