TITLE
Chip-chip from THP1 and HUVEC cells with ROR-alpha

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ROR-alpha is a nuclear receptor, activity of which can be modulated by natural or synthetic ligands including cholesterol. Due to its possible involvement in, and potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis, we aimed to identify ROR-alpha target genes in monocyte and endothelial cell lines, THP1 and HUVEC, respectively. ChIP-on-chip analysis of ROR-alpha demonstrated that ROR-alpha may target more than 3000 genes in monocytic and endothelial cells.

DESIGN
Comparison of DNA immunoprecipated with anti-ROR-alpha antibody vs DNA immunoprecipated with anti-IgG antibody from CGP52608 treated cells.
