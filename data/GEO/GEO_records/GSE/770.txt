SUMMARY
The experiment was a time course experiment on LNCaP C4-2 human prostate adenocarcinoma cells following irradiation to a dose of 10 Sv from a Cesium-137 gamma source. Total RNA was extracted from cells at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hours after irradiation. The untreated control sample, labeled 0, was collected concurrently with the cells extracted at 24 hr. After extraction, the samples were processed and hybridized to the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, www.affymetrix.com) HG-U95Av2 chip, and then washed, stained and scanned according to Affymetrix's protocols contained in the GeneChip(R) Expression Analysis Manual. Transcript abundance data from the scans was processed initially with Affymetrix' Microarray Suite 5(R), then by Silicon Genetics' (Redwood City, CA, www.silicongenetics.com) GeneSpring(R).
