TITLE
Identification of a prognostic gene expression-based signature for patients with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was performed on tissue samples via a complementary DNA-mediated annealing, selection, extension, and ligation (DASL) assay (Illumina).  1536 were selected for profiling. 210 prostate cancer samples were used.Random forests classifcation was applied to the DASL data, and a set of genes was selected for further development.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from prostate cancer prostatecomy samples, purified,  cDNA generated, and DASL performed.
