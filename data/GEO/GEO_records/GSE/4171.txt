TITLE
Gene inductions in response to B-DNA transfection in Tbk1 and/or Ikbke-deficient embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
B-DNA-induced gene expression profile in wild-type, TBK1, IKKi(Ikbke), or TBK1 IKKi doubly deficient embryonic fibroblats; to elucidate how TBK1 and/or IKKi mediates B-DNA-mediated innate immune responses. Keywords: ordered

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from embryonic fibroblats transfected for 4 h with or without poly(dA-dT)-poly(dT-dA), after which cRNA was synthesized. Preparation of cRNA, hybridization and scanning of the microarray were done according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix). A microarray (MG U74A version 2; Affymetrix) was used with Microarray Suite software (version 5.0; Affymetrix) and GeneSpring software (Silicon Genetics).
