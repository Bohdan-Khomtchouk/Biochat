TITLE
Examining alterations in gene expression of PC3-wt (PSMA -ve) vs PC3-PSMA (PSMA +ve) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The biological role of PSMA, a biomarker expressed in prostate cancer and by the neovasculature of solid tumors, remains unknown. Although PSMA processes folates in our duodenum, and in the brain cleaves NAAG to control neuronal signaling, little is known about its role in cancer. We used microarrays to detail the glonal perturbations in gene expression in the absence of PSMA, in order to identify disease-specific driving pathways that may lead to new therapies for cancer.

DESIGN
PC3-wt (PSMA -ve) cells grown on Petri dishes and in complete media where compared with PC3 cells expressing PSMA

PLATFORM
GPL571 [HG-U133A_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array
