TITLE
miRNA expression profiles of Platelet microparticles (PMPs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the miRNA expressing profiles of Platelet microparticles（PMPs, we have employed the Agilent Human miRNA 8×60K (Design ID:046064) microarray. Platelet microparticles. The platelets were derived from citrated blood of healthy human donors under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. Platelets were isolated after centrifugation of blood (1200r for 30 min at 21℃), then the supernatant (platelet-rich plasma) was centrifuged at 2000r for 30 min at 21℃, and the pellet containing platelets was resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium (HyClone, Logan, UT). Platelets were counted (Clinical Laboratory, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai) and adjusted to a density of 150 × 106 cells/mL before supplement with 1.5% ACD(sigma ) and stimulated with thrombin (1.0 u/mL; Takeda Austria) for 1 h. PMPs were in the supernatant after centrifugation at 4000r for 10 min at 4℃,then the supernatants were centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellets containing MPs were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium and quantified by BCA method.

DESIGN
The gene expressions of three independent paired PMPs from platelets stimulated by thrombin or apoptosis.
