TITLE
Genetic analysis of radiation-induced changes in human gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to measure the expression levels of genes in irradiated immortalized B cells, lymphoblastoid cells, from members of Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) Utah pedigrees.  Data were collected for cells at baseline and 2 hour and 6 hour after exposure to 10 Gy of ionizing radiation (IR).
