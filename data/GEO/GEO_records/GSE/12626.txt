TITLE
Genetic analysis of radiation-induced changes in human gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to measure the expression levels of genes in irradiated immortalized B cells, lymphoblastoid cells, from members of Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) Utah pedigrees.  Data were collected for cells at baseline and 2 hour and 6 hour after exposure to 10 Gy of ionizing radiation (IR).

DESIGN
We used microarrays to measure the expression levels of genes in irradiated immortalized B cells, lymphoblastoid cells, from members of  15 Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) Utah pedigrees (CEPH 1333, 1341, 1346, 1362, 1408, 1416, 1420, 1421, 1423, 1424, 1444, 1447, 1451, 1454, 1582).  Expression data was obtained for cell lines derived from 2 parents and 8 children per each family. Cells were irradiated at 10 Gy in a 137Cs irradiator.  Cells were harvested prior to radiation and at 2 and 6 hours following exposure to IR.
