TITLE
Expression data from Regulatory T Cells either exposed to normal salt media or high salt media (+40mM NaCl)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sodium Chloride Inhibits Suppressive Function of Foxp3+ Regulatory T Cells Given the functional changes observed secondary to exposure to high-salt we wanted to know what expression based changes were taking place in the regulatory T cell population that might help to explain the evidenced functional deficits.

DESIGN
Regulatory T Cells (Tregs) were incubated either in the presence or absence of an additional 40mM NaCl for 3 days with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 to ascertain phenotypic and expression based changes in the cellular population.
