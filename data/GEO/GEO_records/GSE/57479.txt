TITLE
Expression profiles of human NK cell subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It is known that natural killer (NK) cells are a heterogeneous population of functionally distinct NK cell subsets. Here we report on different genomic, phenotypic and functional properties of human NK cell subsets derived from peripheral blood, thymus and bone marrow. NK cell subpopulations were defined via expression of CD56 and CD16.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in NK cell subsets freshly sorted from human tissues. Three different batches were analysed.
