TITLE
Involvement of viral miRNA in the regulation of antiviral apoptosis in shrimp

ORGANISM
Marsupenaeus japonicus

SUMMARY
In this study, the viral miRNAs from white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) were characterized in shrimp in vivo. On the basis of our previous study and small RNA sequencing in this study, a total of 89 putative WSSV miRNAs were identified. As revealed by miRNA microarray analysis, the expressions of viral miRNAs were tissue-specific in vivo.

DESIGN
In this study, the viral miRNAs from white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) were characterized in shrimp in vivo. On the basis of our previous study and small RNA sequencing in this study, a total of 89 putative WSSV miRNAs were identified. As revealed by miRNA microarray analysis and Northern blots, the expressions of viral miRNAs were tissue-specific in vivo. Therefore, our study presented the first report on the in vivo molecular events of viral miRNA in the antiviral apoptosis.
