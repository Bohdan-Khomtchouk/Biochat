TITLE
Microarray data from barley aleurone

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
The phytohormone gibberellic acid (GA) is well known to promote seed germination in plants. One of its functions is to stimulate the production of hydrolytic enzymes in the aleurone and their secretion to the adjacent endosperm. The storage in the endosperm is thus degraded by these hydrolases into small molecules, which are utilized as nutrients for embryo growth to establish the young seedling. ABA in contrast plays antagonistic role to GA to keep seed in dormancy. Cereal aleurone has been established as a model system to investigate giberrellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) responses. Using Barley 1 GeneChip, we examined the mRNA accumulation of over 22 000 genes in barley aleurone treated with GA, ABA, GA plus ABA, and sln1 mutant.

DESIGN
Barley aleurone tissues were separated from half-seed without embryo. Three independent RNA samples for each treatment including the control without any hormone were extracted and hybridized onto Affymetrix microarrays. We also did microarray in three replications for sln1 mutant aleurone without hormone treatment.
