TITLE
Comparative toxicogenomic response in developing zebrafish to the flame retardant, mono-substituted isopropylated triaryl phosphate Â 

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
mITP-induced transcriptional changes were measured in 48 hpf wild-type or ahr2hu3335 embryos exposed to 0 or 0.2 uM mITP from 6-48 hpf.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of at least 9 pooled whole embryos were used for each sample group, which included control and treated groups in either wild-type or ahr2hu3335 zebrafish
