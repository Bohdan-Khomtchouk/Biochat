TITLE
ADDITIVE EFFECTS OF MILLIMETER WAVES AND 2 DEOXYGLUCOSE CO-EXPOSURE ON THE HUMAN KERATINOCYTE TRANSCRIPTOME

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate the effect of millimeter waves (MMW) exposure on the gene expression, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling. Neonatal primary Keratinocyte cells pooled from 3 healthy donors were exposed ex vivo, by 60.4 GHz-MMW, at an incident power density (IPD) of 20 mW/cmÂ² (3 hours of treatment in athermic condition).No modification of keratinocyte transcriptome was observed. Considering that MMW could also impact the cell metabolism, we assessed then effect of glycolysis inhibitor 2 deoxyglucose treatment (2dG, 20 mM during 3 hours) in association with MMW co-exposure. 2dG treatment induces a high modification of the transcriptome (632 coding genes). Genes affected in their expression are linked with transcriptional repression, cellular communication and endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. The MMW/2dG co-exposition induced a slight modification of cell transcriptome, which reflects the capacity of MMW to interfere with bioenergetic stress response. After RT-PCR validation, 6 genes (SOCS3, SPRY2, TRIB1, FAM46A, CSRNP1 and PPP1R15A) were confirmed as sensitive to MMW exposure during 2dG treatment.

DESIGN
Gene expression in human keratinocytes was measured after a 60 GHz-exposure at 20 mW/cm2, for 3 h (Expo). It was compared to cells cultured in unexposed condition (Sham). As millimeter wave (MMW) exposure impact on metabolism we assessed then effect of glycolysis inhibitor 2 deoxyglucose treatment (2dG, 20 mM during 3 hours: Sham_2dG) in association with MMW co-exposure (Expo_2dG).
