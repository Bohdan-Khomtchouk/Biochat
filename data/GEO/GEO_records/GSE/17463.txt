TITLE
Somatic CNV profile of congenital ectopic thyroids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess whether specific genes have relevant somatic genetic or epigenetic alterations in ectopic tissue, we used a combined analysis of transcriptome (confirmed by qRT-PCR on 68 genes), methylome, structural genome variations (copy number variants, CNVs) and miRNA profile of ectopic compared with orthotopic thyroids.

DESIGN
DNA form three ectopic thyroid compared with matched leucocytes.
