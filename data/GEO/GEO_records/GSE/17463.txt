TITLE
Somatic CNV profile of congenital ectopic thyroids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess whether specific genes have relevant somatic genetic or epigenetic alterations in ectopic tissue, we used a combined analysis of transcriptome (confirmed by qRT-PCR on 68 genes), methylome, structural genome variations (copy number variants, CNVs) and miRNA profile of ectopic compared with orthotopic thyroids.
