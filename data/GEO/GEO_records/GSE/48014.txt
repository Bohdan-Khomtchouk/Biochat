TITLE
Gene expression in the liver, effect of maternal high-fat diet during or prior to pregnancy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The present study aimed to examine the effect of high-fat diet prior to pregnancy on the liver of mouse offspring. Female C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal chow (15.2% fat by energy) (CTR and CTR-PP groups) or a high-fat chow (31.2% fat by energy) (HFD and HFD-PP groups) for 3âˆ’4 weeks and then mated with male C57BL/6J mice fed normal chow. Some mothers continued on the same diet until pups reached 21 days of age (CTR and HFD), and others were fed the different chows from gestational day 0 (CTR-PP and HFD-PP) to determine the effects of a high-fat diet during the pre-pregnancy period in HFD-PP/CTR and HFD/CTR-PP comparisons.

DESIGN
RNA sample was taken from liver of 3-week-old mouse prenatally received high-fat diet prior to pregnancy, during pregnancy and lactation, or through prior to and during pregnancy and lactation, while control RNA was taken from control counterpart prenatally received normal diet alone. Comparisons among groups were made by one-color method with normalized data from Cy3 channels for data analysis.
