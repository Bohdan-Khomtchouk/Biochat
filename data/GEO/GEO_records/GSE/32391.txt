TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of exercise-responsive gene expression in murine hearts subjected to 7 days of voluntary wheel running

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To undertake transcriptome-wide microarray analysis to develop a view of molecular adaptations that may underpin any benefit associated with the mild exercise regime of voluntary running

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated whole hearts subjected to 7 days of voluntary exercise compared to sedentary control hearts (n=6/group).
