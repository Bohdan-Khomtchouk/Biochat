TITLE
Gene profiling of mouse liver NK and NKT  cell subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study shows that liver Eomes- NK cells are not precursors of classical Eomes+ NK cells but rather constitute a distinct lineage of innate lymphoid cells. Gene profile analyses show that Eomes- NK cells share part of their transcriptional program with NKT cells that includes genes involved in liver homing, NK cell receptors, and several cytokines and cytokine receptors.

DESIGN
Eomes- NK cells, Eomes+ Nk cells and NKT cells were sorted by flow cytometry from Eomes-GFP reporter mice. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
