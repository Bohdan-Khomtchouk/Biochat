TITLE
Analysis of global gene expression in uninduced and β-estradiol treated G1E-ER-GATA cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total RNA was analyzed from either uninduced or β-estradiol treated G1E-ER-GATA cells to determine changes in gene expression upon induction of erythroid maturation (treated).

DESIGN
Array data profiling expression in untreated and β-estradiol-treated (1 uM, 24 h) G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells (2 independent experiments).
