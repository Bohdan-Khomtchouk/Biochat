TITLE
S. coelicolor YSK4425 Time-course Study in R5- medium (Culture#2)

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
Antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces species is controlled by a complex genetic and biochemical network of global and pathway specific regulators.  Details of their precise interactions in mediating temporal and spatial expression of secondary metabolite genes remain poorly defined.  In this study, we employed whole-genome microarrays to investigate the temporal transcriptome profiles of S. coelicolor A3(2) afsS::apr mutant strain (YSK4425) and compare it to wild-type M145 strain. The regulatory protein encoded by afsS is known to affect antibiotic biosynthesis (Floriano, B., Bibb, M. 1996. afsR is a pleiotropic but conditionally required regulatory gene for antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Mol Microbiol, 21, 385-96). Keywords: Time course
