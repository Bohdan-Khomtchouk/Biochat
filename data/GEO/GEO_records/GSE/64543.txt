TITLE
Expression profiling of murine inner-ear hair cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine auditory and vestibular epithelia were separated into hair-cells (HCs), epithelial non-sensory cells (ENSCs) and non-epithelial cells (NECs) by flow cytometry. Gene expression levels were recorded in independent triplicates from the sorted cells using Illumina whole genome expression microarrays

DESIGN
Total RNA from 3 cell types (HCs, ENSCs, NECs) isolotaed from 2 inner-ear organs (cochlea and vestibular system)

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
