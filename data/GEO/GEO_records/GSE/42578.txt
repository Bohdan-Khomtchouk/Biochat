TITLE
Changes in Gene Expression within the Ventral Tegmental Area Following Loss-of-Control Alcohol Drinking by Alcohol-Preferring (P) Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to determine changes in gene expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) following loss-of-control alcohol drinking by alcohol-preferring (P) rats. Adult female P rats (n = 7) were given concurrent access to 10, 20 and 30% EtOH for four 1-hr sessions daily for 10 weeks followed by 2 cycles of 2 weeks of abstinence and 2 weeks of EtOH access. Rats were killed by decapitation 3 hr after the 4th daily EtOH-access session at the end of the second 2-week relapse period. An age-matched water control group of female P rats (n = 8) was also killed. RNA was prepared from micropunch samples of the VTA from individual rats; analyses were conducted with Affymetrix Rat 230.2 chips. Ethanol intakes were 1.5-2.5 g/kg per sessions, resulting in blood levels > 200 mg% at the end of the 4th session. There were 211 named genes that were significantly different (FDR = 0.1) between the water and EtOH groups. Bioinformatics analyses indicated alterations in (a) transcription factors that reduced excitation-coupled transcription and promoted exocitotic neuronal damage involving clusters of genes associated with Nfkbia, Fos and Srebf1; (b) genes that reduced cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, and increased protein degradation; and (c) genes involved in cell-to-cell interactions and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Among the named genes, there were 62 genes in common with differences between alcohol-na√Øve P and non-preferring (NP) rats, with 43 of the genes changing in the opposite direction following excessive binge-like drinking. These genes are involved in a pro-inflammatory response, and enhanced response to glucocorticoids and steroid hormones.  Overall, the results of this study indicated that excessive binge-like alcohol drinking by P rats may be altering the expression of genes that promote neuronal damage.
