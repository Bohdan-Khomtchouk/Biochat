TITLE
Transcriptional signature of SPCH mutants compromised in the bHLH domain in response to brassinosteroids

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In order to describe the molecular phenotype of spch-5 and to explore possible changes in gene expression underlying the effects on its epidermal development of BL treatment, we performed a microarray-based transcriptomic analysis. Using 3-days old seedlings grown in the absence or presence of BL, we compared the transcriptomic profiles of wild type (Col-0) and spch-5 plants. In addition, we analyzed a SPCHPPP-complemented spch-3 line to identify gene expression changes distinct of spch-5 or common to the two SPCH variants. We thus obtained six data sets (3 genotypes in two growth conditions).

DESIGN
3 days-old Arabidopsis plants grown in mock medium (DMSO) and brassinosteroids treatment (BL 50 nM) were used. Three genotypes were used: Col-0, spch-5 and SPCHPPP
