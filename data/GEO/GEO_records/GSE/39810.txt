TITLE
Gene expression profiles of AD 293 cells mediated by Chandipura virus nucleo (N) protein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recombinant adenovirus expressing Chandipura virus nucleo (N) protein (ADN) induces cell lysis in infected cells. In order to find out the pathway involved in cell lysis, we have employed micro array experiment using custom whole genome microarray 4x44k designed by Genotypic Technology private limited, India (AMADID 025085) to identify the genes which involved in apoptotic, cell cycle, signalling etc. AD 293 cells were infected with ADN and the total RNA was purified at 3 and 6 h post infection (PI). In control experiment, the total RNA was purified at 6 h PI from uninfected AD 293cells and cells infected with recombinant adenovirus without N gene. Gene expression profile of these samples was analysed. The data was analyzed using GeneSpring GX Version 11.5 software from Agilent. Normalization of the data was done in GeneSpring GX using the 75th percentile shift. Significant up and down regulated genes showing one fold and above within the group of samples were identified. Genes were classified based on functional category and pathways using Biointerpreter Tool -Biological Analysis Software.
