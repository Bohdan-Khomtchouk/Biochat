TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression patterns in mir-122 knockout mice livers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To invesigate the physiology roles of mir-122 in liver, we performed expression profiling of mir-122 knockout mice and the control B6/129 mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from four mir-122 knockout mice and three control mice of 2 months of age. Gene expression was quantified by robust multi-array analysis (RMA) using the Genomic Suite software from Partek.
