TITLE
Histone H2A K4,7G

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Total RNA from three replicate cultures of wild-type and mutant strains was isolated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix arrays. Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by the histone H2A K4,7G mutant. Keywords: histone H2A mutant, repeat

DESIGN
Comparison of genes whose mRNA levels are affected in a histone H2A K4,7G mutant yeast strain compared to wild-type yeast strain.
