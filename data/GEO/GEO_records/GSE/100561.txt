TITLE
DNA-methylation analysis of response to P.falciparum infection in Fulani and Mossi ethnic groups, Burkina Faso

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Fulani ethnic group is relatively protected from Plasmodium falciparum malaria, however a genetic basis for this is unknown. Therefore, we have performed a pilot study to examine global transcription and DNA methylation patterns in specific immune cell populations in the Fulani, compared to a sympatric ethnic group, the Mossi. When we compared uninfected and infected individuals in Fulani and Mossi, a strong transcriptional response was only detected in the monocyte fraction of Fulani, and this was not related to differences in DNA methylation.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing analysis of CD14+ (monocyte) and CD14- (predominantly lymphocyte), and DNA-methylation analysis of CD14+ (monocyte) fractions of PBMCs,  from of Fulani and Mossi individuals, uninfected or infected with P.falciparum. This Series represents the DNA-methylation dataset.
