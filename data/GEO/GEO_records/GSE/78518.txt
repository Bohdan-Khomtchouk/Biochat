TITLE
The extracellular interactome of the human Adenovirus family reveals diverse strategies for immunomodulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using a large collection of diverse viral immunomodulatory proteins, and comprehensive human protein microarray libraries, we identify more than 51 virus-host interactions that suggest new immunoregulatory strategies. Full description of this study will be detailed in Martinez-Martin et al., Nat Communications, under review (this information will be updated when manuscript is accepted).
