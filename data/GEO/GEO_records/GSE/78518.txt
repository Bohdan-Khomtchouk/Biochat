TITLE
The extracellular interactome of the human Adenovirus family reveals diverse strategies for immunomodulation

ORGANISM
Human mastadenovirus A

SUMMARY
Using a large collection of diverse viral immunomodulatory proteins, and comprehensive human protein microarray libraries, we identify more than 51 virus-host interactions that suggest new immunoregulatory strategies. Full description of this study will be detailed in Martinez-Martin et al., Nat Communications, under review (this information will be updated when manuscript is accepted).

DESIGN
In this study, we systematically analyze a diverse set of human adenovirus immunomodulatory E3 proteins against an unbiased large-scale protein microarray that consists of more than 1,500 secreted or single-transmembrane-containing human proteins. Here we identify and fully validate 51 novel virus-host interactions that suggest previously unidentified strategies of extracellular immunomodulation.
