TITLE
Gene expression profiling from cohesin knockdown cells obtained grown in methylcellulose

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-sequencing in c-Kit+ cells that were infected with retroviruses expressing shRNAs for Renilla, Rad21, Smc1a, Smc3 or Stag2. These cells were grown in methylcellulose (M3434) for either one passage (P1) or replated for five passages (P5).

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing control (Ren) and cohesin (Rad21, Smc1a, Smc3 and Stag2) knockdown cells.
