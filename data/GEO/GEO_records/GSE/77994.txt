TITLE
Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2 array data of iPSCs and iPSC-derived-NSPCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
iPSC-derived NSPCs, which were induced by two different protocols (Embryoid body or Neural rosette) followed by expansion in free-floating culture  (neurospheres), had closely resembled profiles.

DESIGN
Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus2 Array analyses were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on three iPSCs, and their neural induced derivatives using two different protocols. Two independent inductions were performd to each iPSC (T1 and T2).
