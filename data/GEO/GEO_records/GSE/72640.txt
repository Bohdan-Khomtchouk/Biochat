TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of MYCN binding in neuroblastoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the MYCN transcription factor binding sites across the genome, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) using anti-MYCN and anti-IgG antibodies on a MYCN-amplified NB cell line, SK-N-BE(2)-C.

DESIGN
Identification of MYCN binding in neuroblastoma cells.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
