TITLE
Expression data from directly induced neural stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells give rise to neural stem cells, which are applicable for therapeutic transplantation in treatment of neural diseases. However, generation of neural stem cells from iPS cells requires a careful selection of safe iPS clones. We sought to determine whether direct induction of neural stem cells from partially reprogrammed somatic cells is able to generate safer cells rapidly. We have successfully established direct induction system from fibroblast to neural stem cells. To characterize these directly induced neural stem cells, Gene expression profiles were compared with iPS cell or ES cell-derived neurosphere. We used affymetrix microarrays to compare the global gene expression of neurospheres prepared several method.

DESIGN
RNA extracted from neurospheres was hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. The mouse strain used in this study except ES/iPS cells was C57BL/6.
