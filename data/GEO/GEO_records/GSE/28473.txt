TITLE
Quantitative analysis of miRNA changes in CD4+ T cells responding to myelin antigen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were immunized with either MOG35-55 in CFA or with CFA alone and 14 days later PLN cells were isolated and stimulated in vitro with MOG35-55 for 3 days followed by CD4+ T cell sorting. Microarray analysis of miRNA expression profiles was performed comparing sorted CD4+ T cells from MOG35-55 in CFA immunized mice to CD4+ T cells from mice immunized with CFA alone.

DESIGN
The data are from magnetic beads sorted CD4+ T cells from peripheral lymph nodes from 5 pooled animals per data point
