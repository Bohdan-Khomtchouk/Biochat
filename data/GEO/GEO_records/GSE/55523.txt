TITLE
Study of microRNA associated with metformin treatment in a mouse model of NASH(MCD)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The microRNAs expression was altered with the treatment of metformin in vivo and several microRNAs induced by metformin also may contribute to suppressed of NASH.

DESIGN
Using a custom microarray platform, we analyzed the expression levels of 1135 mouse microRNA probes in liver tissue in vivo that were treated with and without metformin.

PLATFORM
GPL16362 3D-Gene Mouse miRNA Oligo Chip V17.1.0
