TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq of 444 epithelial cells from the mammary glands of pubescent and adult mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammary glands were collected from 8 pubescent (4.7-4.9 week-old) female mice and 8 adult (10 week old) female mice. Freshly sorted epithelial cells were submitted to a Fluidigm C1 System machine for single cell capture and cDNA synthesis. Cells were visualized under the microscope to ensure integrity of the captured single cells prior to cDNA preparation. Libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT kit and sequencing was carried out on an Illumina NextSeq 500 to achieve paired-end 75 bp reads.

DESIGN
RNA-seq profiling was completed for 221 cells from pubescent mice and 223 cells from adult mice.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
