TITLE
Huntingtonâ€™s disease biomarker progression profile identified by transcriptome sequencing in peripheral blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we investigated the suitability of blood to identify HD transcriptomic biomarkers, validated the outcome in an independent cohort and derived a first empiric panel of biomarkers capable of predicting HD motor scores. Finally we examined whether patient gene expression profiles could provide information about HD affected biological pathways.

DESIGN
Examination of differentially expressed genes in peripheral whole blood using linear modelling of  gene expression data (3' DGE) against UHDRS total motor scores of Huntington's Disease mutation carriers and controls.
