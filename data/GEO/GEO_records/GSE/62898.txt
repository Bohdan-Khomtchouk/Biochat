TITLE
Control of the E. coli SOS regulon expression by intracellular dNTP pool changes

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. EDL933

SUMMARY
We studied SOS mutator effect mediated by recA730 and changes in the dNTP pool. We found that established dNTP pool changes resulting from deficiencies in the ndk or dcd genes,  had a strongly suppressive effect on the recA730 mutator effect. To investigate whether the observed reduction in SOS mutator effect is due to lowered expression of the entire SOS regulon, we performed microarray analysis of gene expression profiles in each of the single ndk, dcd, and recA730 strains, as well as the double recA730 ndk and recA730 dcd strains.
