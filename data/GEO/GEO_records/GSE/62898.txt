TITLE
Control of the E. coli SOS regulon expression by intracellular dNTP pool changes

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We studied SOS mutator effect mediated by recA730 and changes in the dNTP pool. We found that established dNTP pool changes resulting from deficiencies in the ndk or dcd genes,  had a strongly suppressive effect on the recA730 mutator effect. To investigate whether the observed reduction in SOS mutator effect is due to lowered expression of the entire SOS regulon, we performed microarray analysis of gene expression profiles in each of the single ndk, dcd, and recA730 strains, as well as the double recA730 ndk and recA730 dcd strains.

DESIGN
Comparison of transcriptomes of the bacterium Escherichia coli six strains: wt, dcd, ndk, recA730, recA730 dcd and recA730 ndk. All strains were derivatives of the MC4100 strain, carrying a sulA366 allele (Î”(argF-lac)169 sulA366). dcd and ndk alleles used were dcd::kan and ndk::cam, respectively. Strains were compared in pairs: wt vs dcd, wt vs ndk, wt vs recA730, recA730 vs recA730 dcd and recA730 vs recA730 ndk. Two or three biological replicates for each strain  were used. Each biological replicate had two technical replicates with dye swapping.
