TITLE
Expression data from rice varieties IRAT109 and ZS97 for drought stress treatment in flag leaves

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group ; Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Comparative transcriptional profiling of two contrasting rice genotypes,IRAT109 (drought-resistant japonica cultivar) and ZS97 (drought-sensitive indica cultivar), under drought stress during the reproductive stage

DESIGN
Four samples with RWC in the range of 94–95% (no stress, D0), 83–88% (slight drought in which leaves were slightly rolled, D1), 74–78% (moderate drought in which about half of each leaf was rolled, D2), and 65–69% (severe drought in which all leaves were completely rolled, D3) were collected for expression profiling analysis using an Affymetrix GeneChip.

PLATFORM
GPL2025 [Rice] Affymetrix Rice Genome Array
