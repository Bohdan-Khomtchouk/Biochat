TITLE
Human gastric cancer cell MKN45: MKN45-GFP control vs. highly metastatic sublines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of in vitro selected highly metastatic MKN45-GFP sublines. The results were compared with MKN45-GFP control cell line to determine the metastasis associated genes.

DESIGN
Four pairs compared experiment. Each pair was used MKN45-GFP cells as correlated control. Determining on the gene expression trends were by various metastatic ability of each subline.

PLATFORM
