TITLE
Intermediate- and low-methylation epigenotypes do not correspond to CpG island methylator phenotype (low and -zero) in colorectal cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed comprehensive genome-scale DNA methylation profiling by Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 of 18 DNA pools that represent 84 colorectal cancer (CRC) samples divided according to their high-, intermediate-, and low-methylation epigenotypes (HME, IME, and LME, respectively) and 3 pools representing 70 normal-adjacent colonic tissues.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 21 DNA pools were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
