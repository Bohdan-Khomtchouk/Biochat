TITLE
Gene expression profiling of D. melanogaster strains with varied resistance and tolerance to L. monocytogenes infection

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We sequenced the mRNA of four D. melanogaster strains (w1118:BL6326, PBacCG2247:BL18050, PBacPCMT:BL18398, and RAL359:BL28131) during L. monocytogenes infection to determine the changes in gene expression dynamics responsible for resistance and tolerance phenotypes.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in groups of 20 adult males at 12 timepoints throughout infection and recovery. Flies were injected with 1000CFU of L. monocytogenes. On day 3 and onwards, flies were maintained on ampicillin supplemented food.

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
