TITLE
Expression data from Arabipdosis msh1 recA3 double mutant under heat stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In Arabidposis thaliana, the msh1 recA3 double mutant shows an extensive mitochondrial genome rearrangement and displays pronounced thermotolerance. We use microarray analysis to characterize genes and their response in the double mutant to a heat shock experiment in which plants were exposed to a temperature of 37 C for two hours.

DESIGN
Wild type and double mutant plant were exposed to a temperature of 37 C for two hours and RNA samples were collected for the wild type and the double mutant before and after the heat shock.
