TITLE
Single-tube Linear DNA amplification (LinDA) for robust ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide profiling of transcription factors based on massive parallel sequencing of immunoprecipitated chromatin (ChIP-seq) requires nanogram amounts of DNA. Here we describe a high-fidelity, single-tube linear DNA amplification method (LinDA) for ChIP-seq and reChIP-seq with picogram DNA amounts obtained from a few thousand cells. This amplification technology will facilitate global analyses of transcription-factor binding and chromatin with very small cell populations, such as stem or cancer-initiating cells.

DESIGN
In total 5 samples were generated from the F9 teratocarcinoma cell system: mRXRa-RARg-LinDA;mRXRa_100xfold-diluted_LinDA; mRXRa(1) and two others previously described in GSE30538 (mRXRa(2): !Series_sample_id=GSM757796; mRARg : !Series_sample_id=GSM757803). In addition, 14 samples were generated from the H3396 breast cancer cell system. Those samples containing the label " LinDA " has been amplified following the Linear DNA amplification method developed by Pattabhiraman et al. ((2011),  Nature Methods 8, 565-67) prior library preparation for Solexa sequencing.
