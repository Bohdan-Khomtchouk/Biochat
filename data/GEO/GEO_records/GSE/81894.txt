TITLE
Epithelial Splicing Regulatory protein 1 promotes human colorectal cancer cell growth and metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 (ESRP1) is an epithelial cell-specific RBP and splicing factor. Both a tumor suppressor role and a pro-metastatic function of ESRP1 have been reported.Our aim was to clarify the role of ESRP1 in colorectal cancer  setting.We employed both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches to study the role of ESRP1 in human colorectal tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo, as well as in the metastatic process in vivo.

DESIGN
RNA from 4 conditions was analyzed. Every condition is represented by a duplicate.
