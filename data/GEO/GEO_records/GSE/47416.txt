TITLE
Nucleosome occupancy measurments in Bptf knockout ESC, MEF and DP thymocytes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NURF is a remodleing complex expressed in many cell types.  Knockout of Bptf, the unique and essental subunit of NURF, results in altered nucleosome occupancy across the genome. To measure changes in nucleosome occupancy we hybridized nucleosomal DNA overdigested with MNase to 10 bp tiling arrays covering 3.3 Mbp of the mouse genome.

DESIGN
Comparison of nucleosome positions in control and Bptf knockout ESC, MEF and DP thymocytes.
