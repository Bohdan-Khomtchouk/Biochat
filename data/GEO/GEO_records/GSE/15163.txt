TITLE
Gene expression data from primate postnatal brain development - superior frontal gyrus

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta ; Pan troglodytes ; Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In development, timing is of the utmost importance, and the timing of various developmental processes are often changed during evolution. During human evolution sexual maturation has been delayed relative to other primates and this may have played a critical role for both the increase of human brain size and the rise of human-specific cognitive traits . We measured the timing of gene expression changes in the superior frontal gyrus region of the brains of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques throughout postnatal development. Keywords: Age series

DESIGN
Human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque post-mortem brain samples from the superior frontal gyrus region of the prefrontal cortex were collected. The age ranges of the individuals in all three species covered the respective species' postnatal maturation period from infancy to adulthood. RNA extracted from the dissected tissue was hybridized to AffymetrixÂ® Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
