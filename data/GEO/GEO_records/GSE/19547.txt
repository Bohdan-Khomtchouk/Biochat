TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of Myc binding site (K562)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Proto-oncogene c-myc encodes a bHLH leucine-zipper containing transcription factor which has a DNA binding domain and a transactivation domain. Myc can dimerize with other factors like Max, Mad, Mnt and Miz and can influence transcription of genes. The c-myc oncogene contributes to the genesis of a wide variety of human tumors. A higher than normal level of c-myc gene expression has been observed in 50-80% of colon and breast cancers and a large proportion of human mortality from cancer is caused by abnormal expression of c-myc.
