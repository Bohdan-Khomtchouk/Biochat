TITLE
Foxp3-deficient Treg cells do not revert into conventional Effector CD4+ T cells but constitute a unique cell subset

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were compared between regulatory T cells (Treg) and Effector CD4+ T cells in healthy B6 mice and sick mice with scurfy mutation. We used microarrays to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the suppression function of the Treg cells. Keywords: Cell type comparison
