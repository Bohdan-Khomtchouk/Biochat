TITLE
Effect of lipopolysachharide (LPS) on the expression of inflammatory mRNAs in the mouse oviduct

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our objective was to determine the effect of intraperitoneal (IP) administration of E. Coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the acute expression of inflammatory mRNAs in the mouse oviduct

DESIGN
On the day of estrus, 6-8 week old CD1 mice were treated IP with 0 (control), 2 µg (low dose) or 10 µg (high dose) of LPS from E. Coli serotype 055:B5 in 100 μL PBS.  Mice were killed 24 h later and the oviducts collected for determination of the effect of treatment on inflammatory mRNAs (n=4/treatment) by a targeted nanostring approach using the nCounter GX Mouse Inflammation Kit (Nanostring Technologies, Seattle, WA).  Real-time PCR was then used to verify a selection of mRNAs.  The effect of LPS on the expression of mRNAs was evaluated by one-way ANOVA and treatment means of differentially expressed mRNA (P < 0.05) were separated using a post-hoc LSD test.
