TITLE
Effect of sc3 and sc4 on aerial hypha formation

ORGANISM
Schizophyllum commune

SUMMARY
In order to study changes in gene expression during mushroom development in Schizophyllum commune, genome wide gene expression was analysed in 4 developmental stages: vegetative mycelium, stage I aggregates, stage II primordia and mature mushrooms. In order to study the effects of absence of expression of sc3 and sc4, genome-wide expression was analysed in a dikaryon in which those genes have been inactivated by targeted gene deletion.

DESIGN
5 samples: - vegetative mycelium - stage I aggregates - stage II primordia - mature mushrooms - deltaSC3 deltaSC4 dikaryon RNA was obtained from 3 biological replicates and pooled
