TITLE
Deciphering targets of CD271-dependent signaling mediating chemo-resistance in MeWo cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Parental MeWo cells sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs Etoposide, Fotemustine, Vindesine and Cisplatin, as well as their resistant derivatives, were analyzed for expression of potential mediators of resistance using genome-wide expression profiling.

DESIGN
11 samples of MeWo cells either sensitive or resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs were analysed.
