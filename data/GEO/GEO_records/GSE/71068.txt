TITLE
Yeast Whole Genome Analysis - Wild-Type vs kap108∆ cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
A total cellular RNA analysis was performed to determine differential gene expression between wild-type and kap108∆ S. cerevisiae cells under both normal and oxidative stress conditions. Goal was to determine which genes are differentially expressed in the absence of the Kap108 importin, and to see how that differential expression changes with the addition of oxidative stress. This information can then be used to help elucidate the function and transport cargoes of Kap108, which are currently unknown.

DESIGN
Two-Channel microarray analysis compared gene expression between wild-type and kap108∆ S. cerevisiae cells under four conditions: pre-oxidative stress, 10 min oxidative stress, 60 min oxidative stress, and 60 min oxidative stress followed by 60 min no oxidative stress. Three biological replicates were performed for each condition.
