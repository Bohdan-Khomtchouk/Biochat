TITLE
Identification of chemoresistant genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify chemoresistance-associated genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). cDNA microarray analysis was performed to compare the mRNA expression profiles of a human metastatic HCC cell line (named MHCC97Low) and its derived chemoresistant sublines including cisplatin resistant subline (named MHCC97L/CisR or C8) and doxorubicin resistant subline (named MHCC97L/DoxR or D5).

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from MHCC97Low (97Low as sample name), MHCC97L/CisR (C8 as sample name) and MHCC97L/DoxR (D5 as sample name), and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We planed to identify differential genes between 97Low and C8 (cisplatin resistant genes) as well as to identify differential genes between 97Low and D5 (doxorubicin resistant genes).
