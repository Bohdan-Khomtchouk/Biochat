TITLE
CC10 gene deletion: Effect on gene expression in the sinonasal mucosa

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of gene expression in murine sinonasal mucosa in wild-type and CC10-knockout littermates with allergic eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis. The data provide a comprehensive overview of genes expressed in the mouse sinonasal mucosa and show that the expression of several known and unidentified genes is modified by disruption of the CC10 gene.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from sinonasal mucosae of 6- to 8-week-old mice, C57BL/6 strain, was used for this comparison. Three groups: wild-type control, wild-type with allergic eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis, and CC10-knockout with allergic eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis.
