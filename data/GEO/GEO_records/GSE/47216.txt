TITLE
The Obesity-associated Fto gene regulates activity of the dopaminergic midbrain circuitry [FTO KO]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we use MeRIP-Seq to analyze global adenosine methylation (m6A) in mRNAs in the midbrain and striatum of Fto-deficient mice.  We find that Fto deficiency leads to increased methylation within a subset of mRNAs important for neuronal signaling, including many within the dopaminergic signaling pathway. Collectively, our results show that Fto regulates demethylation of specific mRNAs in vivo, and this activity relates to control of dopaminergic transmission.
