TITLE
GAL-NMD2

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The goal of this set of experiments was to identify transcripts that are differentially expressed upon reactivation of NMD in an nmd2::HIS3 strain by galactose-induced expression of the NMD2 gene. Keywords: Genetic modification and time course

DESIGN
Yeast strains harboring nmd2::HIS3 and the GAL1-NMD2 allele on a plasmid or the empty vector were grown in SC-medium containing raffinose but lacking uracile. Genome-wide expression profiles of the GAL-NMD2 and nmd2 deletion strains were analyzed over a 60-minute time course after adding galactose to the cell cultures. Four independent replicates were carried out for this experiment.
