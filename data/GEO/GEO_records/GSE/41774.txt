TITLE
Response of subgroup Ib 3xbhlh mutant and wild type at - Fe to +/- salicylic acid

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Subgroup Ib BHLH genes are induced by Fe deficiency. BHLH038 and BHLH039 were shown to be connected with salicylic acid. The triple knockout  3xbhlh  (bhlh039-1 bhlh100-1 bhlh101-1) shows a stronger leaf chlorosis at - Fe than the wild type. The responses of this triple mutant were studied at - Fe in comparison to the wild type in the presence and absence of salicylic acid (SA).

DESIGN
Wild type and 3xbhlh seedlings (bhlh039-1 bhlh100-1 bhlh101-1) were grown at – Fe and treated for six hours with or without 100 µM SA. Three biological replicates were generated.
