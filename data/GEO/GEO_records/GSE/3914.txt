TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of iron-inducible genes in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1

ORGANISM
Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1

SUMMARY
Deatails of the series are available in the publications Suzuki et al., The Journal of Bacteriology “Global gene expression analysis of iron-inducible genes in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1”, accepted for the publication. The gene expression profiles were categorized into 5 patterns. Abstract of the publication: " feo, tpd and ftr which encode ferrous transporters were up-regulated under iron-rich conditions.The concomitant rapid iron uptake and magnetite formation suggest that these uptake systems serve as iron supply lines for magnetosome synthesis. " Keywords: iron response
