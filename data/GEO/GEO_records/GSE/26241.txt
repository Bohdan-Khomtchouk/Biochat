TITLE
Expression data from TGFbeta-treated control or aPKC silenced A549 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant TGFbeta signalling is a hallmark of epithelial derived tumours. Signalling patterns can depend on the membrane trafficking and internalization of the TGFbeta receptors. Protein kinase C (PKC), particularly the atypical PKC isoforms, alter the trafficking of TGFbeta receptors and can alter TGFbeta induced gene expression. We used microarrays to detail the programme of gene expression underlying TGFbeta induction between control or aPKC silenced A549 cells.

DESIGN
Control or aPKC silenced A549 cells were serum starved and treated with TGFbeta for 1 hour. Total RNA was extracted from untreated or TGFbeta treated cells after 8 and 24 hours and analyzed using Affymetrix microarrays.  We sought to assess TGFbeta gene expression in aPKC silenced lung cancer cells, as we found that knockdown of aPKC extends TGFbeta signalling as assessed by phospho Smad2 levels. Furthermore, increased expression and oncogenic activity of aPKC (PKCiota) has been reported in lung cancer cells.
