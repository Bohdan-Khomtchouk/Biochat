TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Development of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia accompanies with multiple variable mutations. Beside the structural and chromosomal alterations, especially mutations in the regulators of B cell differentiation are common. Around 60% of the B-ALL show deletions of these genes.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from cryopreserved diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood samples. Copy number analysis of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays was performed for 20 pediatric B-ALL samples and intraindividually matching remission samples which were used as references.
