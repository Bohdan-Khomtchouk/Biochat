TITLE
Differentially expressed genes from different developmantal stages in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Rice is one of important crop and, the genome has been already completely sequenced. Moreover we collected more than 30K rice FL-cDNA clones as transcriptome resources. However, the cDNA collection did not reveal the transcription activity and specificity of expression. So, we designed 60-mer oligo array based on the array system of Agilent Technologies (GPL477) as custom array. For validation of the array, we tested the reproducibility of labeling and hybridization. After this validation, 22K rice oligo array was supplied from Agilent Technologies (GPL892). 2: reproducibility of hybridization-1: We made a dye-swap experiment to validate dye-effect and data reproducibility between arrays. We hybridized shoot (as control) and other developmental stage tissues. This data also indicated the diversity of gene expression profile among developmental stages. Keywords: variety among tissues

DESIGN
organisms: Oryza sativa ssp. japonica (Nipponbare) tissue: shoot, root, germinated seed, panicle, callus derived from more than 100 plants hybridization : two dye method hybridization: dye-swap experiment replication: germinated seed, panicle, and propagated callus were replicated twice, others were not replicated. array: 2 array per 1 experiment (total 26 arrays)

PLATFORM
GPL477 RICE oligo microarray ver1 GPL892 Agilent-012106 Rice Oligo Microarray G4138A (Feature Number version)
