TITLE
PCGF6-PRC1 suppresses premature differentiation of embryonic stem cells by silencing germ cell-related genes [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression data of ES cells with or without Pcgf6, Ring1A/B, Max and Mga. Expression data of ES cells with or without Cbx1/3.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic stem cells deficient for Pcgf6 and associating genes were evaluated using RNA-seq. Mouse embryonic stem cells deficient for Cbx1/3 and associating genes were evaluated using RNA-seq.

PLATFORM
