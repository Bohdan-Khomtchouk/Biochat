TITLE
Transcriptome analysis during the time course of regeneration of the human airway mucociliary epithelium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The regeneration of the airway mucociliary epithelium involves several sequential events including migration, proliferation, polarization and final differentiation (i.e ciliogenesis). We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression that occurs during regeneration and ciliogenesis of the human airway mucociliary epithelium.

DESIGN
The four time points of regeneration of the airway epithelium (ALI-D0 which corresponds to the end of proliferation step; ALI-D7 which corresponds to the polarization step; ALI-D14 which corresponds to the onset of ciliogenesis and ALI-D21 corresponding to the terminal differentiation step) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
