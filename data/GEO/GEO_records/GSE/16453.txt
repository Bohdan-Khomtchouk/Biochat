TITLE
Characterization of microRNA Expression Profiles in human primary differentiated T lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Activation of the T cell-mediated immune response has been associated with changes in the expression of specific miRNAs. However, the role of miRNAs in the development of an effective immune response is just beginning to be explored. Here we report a microRNA expression profile showing a list of microRNAs, which are highly up-regulated or down-regulated in human memory T cells compared to naive T cells, thus suggesting a possible role of these microRNAs in T lymphocyte differentiation. Keywords: Primary Tissue miRNA Expression profile

DESIGN
We used microarrays to profile miRNA expression in human naive and central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes
