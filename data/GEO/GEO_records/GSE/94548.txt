TITLE
Expression data from MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with Wild Type Tomato fruit  extract (WT) and transgenic lines tomato fruit extract (L6 and L7)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effects of transgenic lines L6 and L7 tomato fruits on total expression profile of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we treated MCF-7 cells with 1 ug/ml of tomato fruit extract for 24 hours and compare it with wild type tomato fruit extract Objectives for this study included the identification of genes that were up or down-regulated at the transcriptional level in MCF-7 cells treated with transgenic lines L6 and L7 tomatofruit  extract and compare it to wild type tomato fruit extract.

DESIGN
MCF-7 breast cancer cells were incubated with wild type (WT)  tomatofruit  extract (1 ug/ml),  line 6 (L6) transgenic line tomato fruit extract (1 ug/ml) and line 7 (L7) transgenic line tomato fruit extract (1 ug/ml) for 24 hours  and selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. cell death responses
