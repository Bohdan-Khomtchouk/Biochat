TITLE
In situ-synthesized novel microarray optimized for mouse stem cell and early developmental expression profiling: Part 3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E12.5 mouse whole embryos and placentas were pooled within 3 litters and total RNA was extracted. Fluorescently-labeled, linearly-amplified cRNA targets were prepared from the RNA samples at various input levels. A " full-scale " reference was prepared using the standard input level of 6.0 ug total RNA, and one round of amplification was performed with 250 ng and 50 ng total RNA inputs.  For 10 ng and 2 ng inputs, two rounds of amplification were used.  Targets were compared on a microarray platform designed for this test using a " dye-swapped " experimental design, and sets of significantly differential genes were compared to the full scale reference's list to determine specificity and sensitivity in terms of detection of significant expression differences. Keywords: dye swap design,quality control testing design
