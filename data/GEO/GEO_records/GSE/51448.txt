TITLE
Gene expression analysis of estrogen receptor mutants, S463P, Y537S and D538G in MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF7 cells transfected with ER mutants (S463P, Y537S and D538G) in phenol-red free, charcoal stripped FBS media and regular DMEM/F12 media. Results provide insight on the gene expression profiles induced by the various ER mutants. Total RNA extracted from transfected cells 48 hours after transfection

DESIGN
36 samples were analyzed, triplicates for each constructs (GFP vector control, WT, S463P, Y537S, D538G and S463P/D538G) for each type of media

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
