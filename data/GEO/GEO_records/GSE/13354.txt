TITLE
Taura Syndrome Virus or Yellow Head Virus infection in two strains of L. vannamei different in their resistance to TSV

ORGANISM
Litopenaeus vannamei

SUMMARY
The transcriptomic response of two strains of the Pacific whiteleg shrimp, different in their resistance to Taura Syndrome Virus (TSV), in response to infection with TSV and Yellow Head Virus (YHV). Changes in gene expression in the shrimpâ€™s hepatopancreas were assessed using a cDNA microarray containing 2,469 putative unigenes. The patterns of gene expression between the shrimp strains were considerably similar, except for the more advanced stages of Taura Syndrome. Between the different treatments approximately 250 genes were differently expressed. The most advanced stages of YHV infection showed the highest number of differently expressed genes. During infection there were profound changes in the expression of genes related to lipid and protein metabolism, cellular trafficking, immune defense and stress response. Keywords: Disease state analysis, disease resistance

DESIGN
There were 5 biological replicates for each of the groups in this experiment.  Also, two strains of Litopenaeus vannamei were used: a strain resistant to TSV and a strain susceptible to TSV (Kona line).  The treatments consisted of injecting both strains with 60mL of a shrimp extract made from shrimp previously injected with either a SPF shrimp extract (1x10-4), Taura Syndrome Virus (1x10-5) or Yellow Head Virus (1x10-4).  The 2 initial control groups were composed of hepatopancreas samples from both strains prior the injections.  Samples were also collected from at days 1 and 2 from both strains from the 3 different treatments (control, TSV and YHV).
