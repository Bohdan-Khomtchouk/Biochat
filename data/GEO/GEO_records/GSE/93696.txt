TITLE
Gene expression in microvascular endothelial cells co-cultured with dorsal root ganglion cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expressions in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC)s following co-cultured with mouse dorsal root ganglion cells. Results provide insight into a role for responses of neurovascular interaction in endothelial cell in angiogenesis and vascular remodeling.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of primary human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) co-cultured with primary mouse dorsal root ganglion cells (DRGs) in comparison with separately cultured HMVECs and DRGs.
