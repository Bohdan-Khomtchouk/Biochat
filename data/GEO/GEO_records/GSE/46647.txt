TITLE
Expression analysis of neural progenitor cells derived from iPS cells generated from skin fibroblasts and umbilical cord mesenchymal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in neural progenitor cells derived from iPS cells generated from umbilical cord mesenchymal cells, compared to neural progenitor cells derived from iPS cells generated fromskin fibroblasts. Analyze the difference between neural progenitor cells derived from iPS cells generated from different origins. The method to induce reprogramming of somatic cells and human iPS cells for neural differentiation is described in Cai J, Li W, Su H, Qin D, Yang J, et al. (2010) Generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells from umbilical cord matrix and amniotic membrane mesenchymal cells. J Biol Chem 285: 11227-11234. and Kim DS, Lee JS, Leem JW, Huh YJ, Kim JY, et al. (2010) Robust enhancement of neural differentiation from human ES and iPS cells regardless of their innate difference in differentiation propensity. Stem Cell Rev 6: 270-281.

DESIGN
A two-chip study using total RNA recovered from one neural progenitor cell line derived from iPS cells generated from skin fibroblasts (GZF1C7NSCP3) and one neural progenitor cell line derived from iPS cells generated from umbilical cord mesenchymal cells (VMC2C7NSCP3). No replicates were made. Each chip measures the expression level of 45,033 genes from the two samples with fourteen 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
