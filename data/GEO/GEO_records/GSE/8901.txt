TITLE
Targeted deletion of AIF decreases mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and protects from obesity and diabetes_Muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of muscle and liver samples from muscle- and liver-specific AIF knockout mice respectively. Samples obtained from 8 week old, male knockouts, backcrossed 8 times onto the C57Bl6 background are compared to those obtained from littermate control mice. Keywords: disease state analysis, AIF knockout, metabolism

DESIGN
For the muscle experiment single samples from three different knockout mice are compared with samples fom three independent control mice. For the liver experiment samples are obtained from 4 liver AIF knockouts and compared with a pooled sample obtained from 4 different control mice.
