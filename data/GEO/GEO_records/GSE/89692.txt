TITLE
Transcriptional response to early life stress in mouse ventral tegmental area

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study explored the interaction of early life and adult stress on transcriptional and chromosomal states in a 2x2 design. Male mice were subjected to early life stress (ELS) or were standard-reared (Std), were housed normally through adolescence, and were then exposed to 10 days of control (Ctl) or chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) conditions in adulthood. Long-lasting transcriptional and chromatin alterations were assessed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain in adulthood.

DESIGN
VTA was punched from adult male mouse brain and flash frozen. Punches from 3 mice were pooled per sample before RNA extraction or for HeK4me1 ChIP. H3K4me1 ChIP samples are matched to corresponding Input. RNA-seq was performed using Illumina TruSeq kits according to protocol and read at 100-bp. Library multiplexing was counterbalanced across groups. ChIP-seq and Input libraries were prepared with NEB Ultra kits with Illumina adaptors according to protocol and read at 100-bp.

PLATFORM
