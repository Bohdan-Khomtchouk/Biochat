TITLE
MX1 is Silenced in Permissive HRP4 Cells Supporting HCV Replication

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MX1 is a well-characterized interferon-induced antiviral gene. MX1 is activated by viral infection due to interferon production in cells. We treated non-permissive Huh7 cells and permissive HRP4 cells with interferon. We compared the expression of genes induced by interferon to determine host factors affecting HCV replication.

DESIGN
Huh7 cells and HRP4 cells were treated with 40U/ml interferon-Î± for 6h. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays
