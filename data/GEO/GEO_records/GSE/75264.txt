TITLE
Expression data from the brain of cynomolgus macaques upon intrastriatal administration of baculoviral vectors

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Recombinant insect baculoviral vectors efficiently transduce several types of cells in the brain and can possibly be used for gene therapy for brain disorders. To verify the suitability of using these viral vectors to develop gene therapy strategies in the brain, we evaluated immune reactions upon acute administration of baculoviral vectors into the brain of the cynomolgus macaque using microarray global gene expression profiling.
