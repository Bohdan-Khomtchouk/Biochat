TITLE
shGFP- and shQk-transduced Ink4a/Arf-/- Pten-/- primary mouse astrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identify potential QK-regulated mRNAs and linked pathways by comparing the transcriptional profiles of shGFP- and shQK-transduced Ink4a/Arf-/- Pten-/- primary mouse astrocytes

DESIGN
Ink4a/Arf-/- Pten-/- primary mouse astrocytes infected with shQk-1, shQk-2 and infected with shGFP as control
