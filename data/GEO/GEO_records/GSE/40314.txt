TITLE
FOXC1 in human trabecular meshwork cells is involved in regulatory pathway that includes miR-204, MEIS2, and ITGÎ²1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes whose expressions in primary human trabecular meshwork (TM) cell cultures are affected by the transcription factorfoxc1 and to identify genes that may have roles in glaucoma. Expression profiles derived using microarrays were compared between TM control cells and cells treated with foxc1 siRNAs.

DESIGN
TM1 and TM2 cells were cultured in 6 well plates were transfected with either of two FOXC1 specific siRNAs or scrambled siRNA (as control). The scrambled siRNA treatment was performed in duplicate for each TM. Forty eight hours after exposure to siRNAs, cells were harvested and RNA was extracted. Considering the two siRNAs for FOXC1 transcription factor, the two scrambled siRNA treatments, and the two TM primary cultures, we performed 8 array hybridizations.
