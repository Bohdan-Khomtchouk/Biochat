TITLE
Merlin/NF2 Suppresses Tumorigenesis by Inhibiting the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase CRL4DCAF1 in the Nucleus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Current models imply that the FERM domain protein Merlin, encoded by the tumor suppressor NF2, inhibits mitogenic signaling at or near the plasma membrane. Here, we show that the closed, growth inhibitory form of Merlin accumulates in the nucleus, binds to the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4DCAF1, and suppresses its activity. Depletion of DCAF1 blocks the promitogenic effect of inactivation of Merlin. Conversely, enforced expression of a Merlin-insensitive mutant of DCAF1 counteracts the antimitogenic effect of Merlin. Re-expression of Merlin and silencing of DCAF1 induce a similar, tumor-suppressive program of gene expression. Tumor-derived mutations invariably disrupt Merlinâ€™s ability to interact with or inhibit CRL4DCAF1. Finally, depletion of DCAF1 inhibits the hyperproliferation of Schwannoma cells from NF2 patients and suppresses the oncogenic potential of Merlin-deficient tumor cell lines. We propose that Merlin suppresses tumorigenesis by translocating to the nucleus to inhibit CRL4DCAF1.

DESIGN
To examine if Merlin controls gene expression through inhibition of CRL4DCAF1, and define the general function of this ligase, we compared the gene expression program activated by expression of Merlin or by depletion of DCAF1 in Merlin-null FC-1801 mouse Schwannoma cells
