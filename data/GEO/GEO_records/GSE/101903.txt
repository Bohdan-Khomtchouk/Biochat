TITLE
RNA-sequencing of stably engrafted miR-99 KD LSKs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We FACS-purified GFP+ LSK cells from mice transplanted with stably engrafted miR-99 KD and Scr HSCs and performed RNA-sequencing, demonstrating miR-99 KD results in significant depletion of hematopoietic stem cell gene expression signature and induces a differentiated progenitor gene expression signature.

DESIGN
FACS purification of Scr and miR-99 KD LSKs from 2 mice in each group

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
