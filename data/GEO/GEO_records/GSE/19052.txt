TITLE
Identification of genes differentially regulated upon infection of Thp-1 cells with H37Rv

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Perturbation of host physiology by intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv) can be reflected by changes in gene expression pattern of host genes. Total RNA was isolated from PMA differentiated uninfected cells or cells infected with H37Rv for 16, 48 or 90 hours and gene expression profile was obtained.

DESIGN
There are in all 8 samples, two replcates of each 4. Two samples, namely 1D,1E (replicates of one) are control (PMA differentiated Thp-1 cells Uninfected controls). Cells were infected with H37Rv at an MOI of 1:10 and samples were collected at 16 hours, 48 hours and 90 hours post-infection.
