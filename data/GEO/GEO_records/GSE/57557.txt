TITLE
Hypersensitive Nucleosomes in Chromatin Are Intrinsic to the Structure of Active, Tissue-Specific Enhancers [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In higher eukaryotes, enhancers and promoters share many properties, including binding of transcription factors, existing in open chromatin, and bidirectional transcription.  Yet the structural features that distinguish enhancers and promoters are unclear.  Genome-wide micrococcal nuclease (MNase) studies previously interpreted MNase hypersensitivity to indicate that active enhancers and promoters are nucleosome-free, yet other studies found histone variants and post-translational modifications at active enhancers.  We find that prior MNase genomic studies have an overdigestion bias and that low-level MNase digestion, coupled with mapping core histones, reveals two classes of MNase-hypersensitive sites:  at active promoters, which are nucleosome depleted, and at tissue-specific enhancers, which retain core histones and co-bound transcription factors substantially more than promoters.  Hypersensitivity of active enhancer nucleosomes may reflect their preferential exposure in chromatin and can be maintained by pioneer transcription factors such as FoxA.  These findings unveil fundamental differences in the chromatin structure of active enhancers and promoters.

DESIGN
We include two biological replicates for each of H2B and H3 and one sample for each of FoxA2, H3K4me2 and input.  All data was collected from adult mouse liver.
