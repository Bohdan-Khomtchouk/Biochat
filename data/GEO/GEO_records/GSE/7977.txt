TITLE
comparison ws vs haf2_gcn5-histone acetylation required for gene expression during germination

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
af31_haf2_gcn5 - comparison ws vs haf2_gcn5 - Genes whose expression during seed germination is affected by the mutation of two histone acetyltransferase genes GCN5 and HAF2 (the later encodes TAF1).  - mRNA extraxted from 72h germinating seed of the mutants gcn5 and haf2 were used for comparison with Ws seed at the same satge. 2 repetitions techniques + 1 repetition biologique. Keywords: wt vs mutant comparison

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL5337 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.1
