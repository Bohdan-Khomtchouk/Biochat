TITLE
Gene expression signature of paclitaxel resistance in human esophageal squamous cell cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the microarray-based expression profiles of the cells to identify genes associated with paclitaxel resistance

DESIGN
Using parental and paclitaxel resistant cell lines, we studied mRNA transcription levels by microarray analysis to see if there are any of the key molecules for development of acquisition of the paclitaxel resistance.
