TITLE
Human Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) and Progenitor Cell (HPC) Expression Profilies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The global gene expression profiles of human umbilical cord blood and adult bone marrow CD34+CD33-CD38-Rho(lo)c-kit+ cells, enriched for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC) with CD34+CD33-CD38-Rho(hi) cells, enriched in committed hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), were compared to identify candidate regulators of HSC self-renewal versus differentiation fate decisions. Keywords: parallel sample
