TITLE
Gene expression in human post-mortem brain samples from schizophrenic subjects and matched controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This laboratory focuses on the molecular mechanisms of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders

DESIGN
Gene expression patterns from the pefrontal cortical region (Brodmann Area 46) of subjects with schizophrenia and age- and sex-match control subjects was analyzed. The prefrontal cortex was chosen since it is a primary brain region implicated in the pathophysiological of schizophrenia. Furthermore, this region was used in our previous proteomics studies, allowing for the direct comparison of changes in protein levels to gene expression results. 16 schizophrenic subjects were studied, consisting of 8 subjects with duration of illness (DOI) < 5 years and 8 subjects with DOI > 22 years. 16 age- and sex-matched controls were also studied. Gene expression profiles were analyzed from individual subjects; a total of 32 samples were hybridized to the custom designed CFG GLYCOv2 glycogene array.
