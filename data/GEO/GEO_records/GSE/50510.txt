TITLE
Gene expression data for mock and 5-Aza-CdR treated colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines SW480, HCT116 and RKO

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA hypermethylated genes undergo silencing and show re-expression in response to 5-Aza-CdR treatment. Agilent arrays were used to determine the genes that get reactivated in response to the drug treatment.

DESIGN
To determine expression levels of genes in SW480, HCT116 and RKO.
