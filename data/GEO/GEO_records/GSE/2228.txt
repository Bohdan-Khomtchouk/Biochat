TITLE
E-Predict Training Data Set and Examples

ORGANISM
Viruses

SUMMARY
This series includes a 32-array training dataset used to evaluate E-Predict normalization and similarity metric parameters as well as 13 microarrays used as examples in (Urisman, et. al 2005). Training data set includes 15 independent HeLa RNAhybridizations (microarrays 1-15), 10 independent nasal lavage samples positive for Respiratory Syncytial virus (microarrays 16-25), and 7 independent nasal lavage samples positive for Influenza A virus (microarrays 26-32). Examples iclude a serum sample positive for Hepatitis B virus (microarray 33), a nasal lavage sample positive for both Influenza A virus and Respiratory Syncytial virus (microarray 34), and culture samples of 11 distinct Human Rhinovirus serotypes (microarrays 35-45).
