TITLE
Neuroblastoma cell lines treated with DAC (2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine), a DNA-methylation inhibitor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
8 neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines (CLB-GA, IMR-32, SH-SY5Y, N206, CHP-902R, LAN-2, SK-N-AS, SJNB-1) were profiled on the Affymetrix HGU-133plus2,0 platform before and after treatment with DAC (2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine) to investigate the influence on expression after inhibiting DNA-methylation

DESIGN
8 NB cell lines were included (CLB-GA, IMR-32, SH-SY5Y, N206, CHP-902R, LAN-2, SK-N-AS, SJNB-1), before and after treatment with 3 micromolars of DAC for 3 days
