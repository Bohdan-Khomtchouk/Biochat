TITLE
Gene expression data from iPSC-derived astrocytes, comparison

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alexander disease (AxD) is a fatal neurological illness characterized by white-matter degeneration and formation of Rosenthal fibers, which contain glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as astrocytic inclusion. AxD is mainly caused by a gene mutation encoding GFAP, although the underlying pathomechanism remains unclear.

DESIGN
We differentiated human iPSCs into astrocytes and analyzed gene expression profiles of control and the AxD astrocytes. Comparison between control (n=3) and AxD (n=1)
