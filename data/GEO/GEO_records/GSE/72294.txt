TITLE
De novo assembly in defense against pests in Pinus massoniana

ORGANISM
Pinus massoniana

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from the insect-resistant and poor insect resistance Pinus massoniana to discover metabolic pathways and genes that are involved in defense against pests.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in strain insect-resistant and poor insect resistance Pinus massoniana
