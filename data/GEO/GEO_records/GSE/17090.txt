TITLE
Expression data from human adipose stem cells expanded in allogeneic human serum and fetal bovine serum

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human adipose stem cells (ASCs) have been shown, in pre-clinical studies, to have therapeutic applicability in diverse fields, but a standard expansion method for clinical applications remains yet to be established. Isolated ASCs are typically expanded in medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS). However, sera and other animal-derived culture reagents stage numerous safety issues in clinical therapy, including possible infections and severe immune reactions. By expanding the ASCs in medium containing human serum (HS), the problem can be eliminated. To define how allogeneic HS performs in ASC expansion compared to FBS, we used microarrays to explore differences in gene expression between human adipose stem cells expanded in allogeneic human serum and fetal bovine serum.

DESIGN
Adipose stem cells from 5 human donors were cultured in two media containing either 1) 10 % fetal bovine serum or 2) 15 % allogeneic human serum, and collected for RNA extraction and hybridization to 10 Affymetrix arrays. This experiment represents a paired design since cells of each donor were cultured in both conditions.
