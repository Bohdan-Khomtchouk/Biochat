TITLE
Effect of Spargel on transcriptional changes mediated by the insulin-signalling pathway

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Insulin signalling activity is well known to mediate transcriptional changes in response to nutrients and it is changed in the spargel mutant. We performed a  genome-wide microarray study to investigate the role of Spargel as a transcriptional coregulator downstream of insulin receptor signalling.

DESIGN
To investigate the effect of Spargel on transcriptional changes mediated by the insulin-signalling pathway we analyzed 12 samples in total: three biological replicates of the control with or without UAS-Inr (Inr_wt and ctrl_wt) and three biological replicates of the spargel mutant with or without UAS-Inr (Inr_KGand ctrl_KG).
