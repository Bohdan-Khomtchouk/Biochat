TITLE
Ewing samples and EWS-FLI-1 inhibited Ewing cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cellular origin of Ewing tumor (ET), a tumor of bone or soft tissues characterized by specific fusions between EWS and ETS genes, is highly debated. Through gene expression analysis comparing ETs with a variety of normal tissues, we show that the profiles of different EWS-FLI1-silenced Ewing cell lines converge toward that of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Moreover, upon EWS-FLI1 silencing, two different Ewing cell lines can differentiate along the adipogenic lineage when incubated in appropriate differentiation cocktails. In addition, Ewing cells can also differentiate along the osteogenic lineage upon long-term inhibition of EWS-FLI1. These in silico and experimental data strongly suggest that the inhibition of EWS-FLI1 may allow Ewing cells to recover the phenotype of their MSC progenitor. Keywords: expression analysis

DESIGN
Ewing tumors and EWS-FLI-1 inhibited cell lines were profiled on Affymetrix U133A (GPL96) arrays.
