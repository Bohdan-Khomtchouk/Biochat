TITLE
Sex comb on midleg (Scm) is a functional link between PcG repressive complexes in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We profiled Sex comb on midleg (Scm), Pc and E(z) in fly embryos and S2 based on BioTAP-XL ChIP-seq. ChIP-seq revealed that Scm is co-localized with PRC1, PRC2, and H3K27me3 in both S2 cells and embryos.

DESIGN
Genomic binding/occupancy profiling of Scm, Pc and E(z) by high throughput sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL17275 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
