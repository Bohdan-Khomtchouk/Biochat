TITLE
Transcriptome-profiling (RNA-seq) and Ribosome-profiling (Ribo-seq) of BJ cells treated with Nutlin-3a, an MDM2 inhibitor, which induces p53.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied in parallel RNA-Seq and Ribosome-profiling analyses to immortalized human primary BJ fibroblast cells in which p53 was induced by Nutlin-3a

DESIGN
RNA-seq, using Illumina HiSeq 2000, was applied to BJ cells treated with Nutlin-3a, at 5 timepoints: 0, 2, 4, 6, 19 hrs Ribosome profiling was applied to BJ cells treated with Nutlin-3a, at 5 timepoints: 0, 2, 4, 6, 19 hrs
