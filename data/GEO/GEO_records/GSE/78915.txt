TITLE
Histone posttranslational modification ChIP-chip from Oikopleura dioica gonads

ORGANISM
Oikopleura dioica

SUMMARY
In multicellular organisms, histone posttranslational modifications plays roles in transitions associated with the cell cycle, development, germline specification, gametogenesis and inheritance. Here we defined adaptations of an epigenome in tunicates, sister group to vertebrates, to strong secondary genome compaction in the larvacean, Oikopleura dioica, that has separate sexes and male heterogamy. We profiled 19 histone post-translational modifications in homogeneous ovary and testis samples and used the combinatorics of these marks to define chromatin states. We supplemented these with profiles of RNA polymerase II, CTCF and p300 binding sites and integrated existing annotation and expression data to characterize distinct epigenomic landscapes of the ovary and testis.

DESIGN
Comparison of chromatin landscapes of polyploid nurse nuclei and mitotic male germ line in early branching chordate
