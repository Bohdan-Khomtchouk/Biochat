TITLE
Growth inhibition of ovarian tumor-initiating cells by niclosamide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gene expression profile in treated CP70 side population spheroid cells (CP70sps cells) was analyzed to investigate the effect of niclosamide inhibition on ovarian tumor-initiating cells. CP70sps cells are isolated and characterized as one kind of ovarian tumor-initiating cells, and they show stemness properties and drug resistance capacity. According gene expression profiles and mechanistic analysis, all evidences revealed niclosamide disrupted multiple metabolic pathways affecting biogenetics, biogenesis and redox regulation. These studies support niclosamide as a promising therapeutic agent for ovarian cancer.

DESIGN
CP70sps cells were treated with niclosamide for 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours respectively, and then cells were harvested and analyzed their gene expression profiles.
