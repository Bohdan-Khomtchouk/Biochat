TITLE
Gene expression in canine adipose stromal vascular fraction

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Microarray studies were performed to identify expression patterns by cryopreserved adipose stromal vascular fraction (SVF) preparations that were prepared by three different veterinary stem cell companies from the same source of canine adipose tissue.

DESIGN
[Samples 1 - 3] Three equal samples of approximately 20 grams of adipose tissue were shipped on ice to 3 different companies which specialize in adipose-derived veterinary stem cell therapy.  All 3 SVF preparations were cryopreserved at their respective facilities.  Approximately one month later, cryopreserved samples were retrieved from all companies and transported frozen to the University of Kentucky for gene profiling and viability analysis. [Samples 4 - 11] Groups of cells (samples 5, 7, 9, 11) were treated by the stem cell company with photo-activated platelet-rich plasma (PRP) according to their proprietary procedures in order to enhance regenerative properties of the adipose stem cells.  These PRP-treated cells were incubated in the investigator's lab for 6 hours at 37 degrees Celsius to allow for expression of genes that were induced by PRP treatment.
