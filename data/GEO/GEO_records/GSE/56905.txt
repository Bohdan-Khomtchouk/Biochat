TITLE
Study of the cross-talk between two distant tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We demonstrated that a visceral immunosuppressive tumor can influence a distant, normally-responsive tumor, located in the skin and rend it resistant to a particular immunotherapy.

DESIGN
Examination of the transcriptome of sub-cutaneous tumors that were growing in a mouse model, in the presence or in the absence of a concomitant intra-kidney immunosuppressive tumor

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
