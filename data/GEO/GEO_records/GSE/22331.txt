TITLE
Expression data from ejaculated spermatozoa of normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic men

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of ejaculated spermatozoav from normozoospermic men and asthenozoospermic men. Some of genes were up-regulated or down-regulated in asthenozoospermia, and their abnormal expression were the causes of the impaired sperm motility. Results provide insight into the mechanisms by which asthenozoospermia is controlled. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression of ejaculated spermatozoa between normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic men and identified distinct classes of genes expressed differentially in two groups.

DESIGN
The liquefied semen samples from normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic men were purified by Percoll on a discontinuous density gradients for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. 30 sperm samples of each group were pooled to abtain enough total RNA.
