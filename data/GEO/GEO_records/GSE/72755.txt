TITLE
Toxicogenomics on mice liver of coumarins from Calophyllum brasiliense

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A toxicogenomic analysis from liver of different pharmacological active coumarins (mammea A/BA+A/BB 3:1 and soulatrolide ) was performed on mice treated (20mg/kg/daily) for a whole week  to evaluate if such compounds possess or could develop  a hazardous profile on liver. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from dissected liver mouse treated with active coumarins (obtained from Calophyllum brasiliense) and control (SSI) for a whole week. Livers from 4 animals per treatment and control were subjected to RNA extraction. These data showed 46 genes up and 72 downregulated genes for mammea coumarins and 665 up and 1077 downregulated genes .

DESIGN
Expression data from liver of mice treated with different coumarins (mammea and soulatrolide) from Calophyllum brasiliense 12 Total samples were analyzed. Liver from 4 animals per treatment groups were subjected to mRNA expression analysis. We generated the statistical computing and metrics in the arrayQualityMetrics data were normalized with RMA method and differential expressed genes obtained with Ingenuity Software. Genes with an FDR≤10% and a fold-change ≥2 were selected.
