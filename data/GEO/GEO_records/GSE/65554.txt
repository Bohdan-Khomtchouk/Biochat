TITLE
Tumor Suppressor IKZF1 Mediates Glucocorticoid Therapy Resistance in B Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of Prednisolone in mouse splenocytes with and without Ikzf1 at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that loss of Ikzf1 affects the induction and repression of the Glucocorticoid receptor target genes. Results provide important information of the differentially expressed genes regulated by Ikzf1 upon Prednisolone treatment, explaining the resistance towards Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in splenocytes  harboring Ikzf1 loss.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from WT and Ikzf1+/- splenocytes subjected to 16 hours Prednsiolone treatment compared to untreated cells.
