TITLE
UPF1 helicase promotes Tudor-SN-mediated miRNA decay

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The helicase activity of UPF1 remodels miRNPs so as to render miRNAs susceptible to Tudor-SN (TSN)-mediated miRNA decay

DESIGN
We performed miR-seq on five biological replicates of Control siRNA-, TSN siRNA or UPF1 siRNA-treated T24 human bladder cancer cells. We aimed to define the pool of miRNAs that are upregulated in TSN-knockdown and UPF1-knockdown cells relative to Control siRNA-treated cells
