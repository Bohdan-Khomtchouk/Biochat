TITLE
miRNA  profiling of gastric epithelium from Pten mutant mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates cell survival and proliferation by antagonizing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K)/protein kinase B(PKB/Akt) signaling. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of PTEN, reduced expression of PTEN and overexpression of phosphorylated Akt are frequently found in human gastric cancer, and their changes correlate with tumor progression and prognosis. Previous studies have shown that the deregulated miRNAs in human gastric cancer play important roles in gastric cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis and inflammation. However, miRNAs downstream PTEN/Akt signaling is poorly investigated. To clarify whether PTEN is involved in gastric tumorigenesis, we have generated a gastric epithelium specific PTEN knockout mouse which  exhibited gastric tumor formation with enhanced cell proliferation.So the objectives of the microarray experiment were to, a) screen miRNAs which might be regulated by PTEN/Akt signaling by comparing the miRNA expression profiles between PTEN deficient and control gastric epithelia. 2) explore the microRNA mechanism involved in gastric cell proliferation and gastric tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
miRNA profiling of mouse gastric epithelium,comparing Pten mutant mouse with controls. 4 samples. Experiments in 2 different time point, 20 days and 60 days after birth, 2 Biological replicates. Mutant tissue vs. controls from mixture of 3-4 mouse.
