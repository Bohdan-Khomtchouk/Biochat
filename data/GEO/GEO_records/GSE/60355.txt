Retinoic acid signaling constrains the plasticity of Th1 cells and prevents development of pathogenic Th17 cells [Agilent experiments]

SUMMARY
CD4+ T cells differentiate into phenotypically distinct T-helper cells upon antigenic stimulation. Regulation of plasticity between these CD4+ T-cell lineages is critical for immune homeostasis and prevention of autoimmune diseases. However, the factors that regulate lineage stability are largely unknown. Here we investigate a role for retinoic acid (RA) in the regulation of lineage stability using T helper 1 (Th1) cells, traditionally considered the most phenotypically stable Th subset. We found that RA, through its receptor RARa, sustains stable expression of Th1 lineage specifying genes as well as repressing genes that instruct Th17 cell fate. RA signaling is essential for limiting Th1 cell conversion into Th17 effectors and for preventing pathogenic Th17 responses in vivo. Our studies identify RA-RARa as a key component of the regulatory network governing Th1 cell fate and define a new paradigm for the development of pathogenic Th17 cells. These findings have important implications for autoimmune diseases in which dysregulated Th1-Th17 responses are observed.

DESIGN
Th1 cells; comparing dnRARa to WT
