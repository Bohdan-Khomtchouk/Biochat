TITLE
SNAI1-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition confers chemoresistance and cellular plasticity on MCF10A cells by regulating signaling pathways involved in apoptosis and stem cell maintenance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stable expression of SNAI1 in MCF10A cells enhanced resistance to cell death and cellular plasticity by regulating signalling pathways involved in apoptotis and stem cell maintenance.

DESIGN
To identify changes on gene expression upon SNAI1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, total RNA was purified from MCF10A cells and MCF10A cells stably expressing SNAI1. Three biololgical replicates were used.
