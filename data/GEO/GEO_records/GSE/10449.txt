TITLE
Genetic Analysis of opaque 2 Modifier Loci in Quality Protein Maize

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Quality Protein Maize (QPM) was created by selecting for genetic modifiers that convert the starchy endosperm of an opaque2 (o2) mutant to a hard, vitreous phenotype.  Genetic analysis has shown there are multiple, unlinked o2 modifiers (Opm), but their identity and mode of action are unknown.  A microarray hybridization performed with RNA obtained from true breeding o2 progeny with vitreous and opaque kernel phenotypes identified a small group of differentially expressed genes, some of which map at or near the Opm QTLs. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Compared 18 days after pollination endosperm transcript profiles in true breeding modified (vitreous; V) and non-modified (opaque; O) opaque 2 kernels. Used four vitreous biological reps (V1-V4) and four opaque biological reps (O1-O4). Each biological rep is a pool of 25 kernels representing 5 kernels form each of 5 uniform phenotype ears (vitreous or opaque). Four arrays used: Array 1= V1 vs O1, Array 2 = V2 vs O2, Array 3 = V3 vs O3, Array 4 = V4 vs O4
