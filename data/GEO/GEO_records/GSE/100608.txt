TITLE
Hepcidin is regulated by promoter-associated histone acetylation and HDAC3Â 

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used NGS sequencing of RNA (RNA-Seq) in livers of mice treated with a 3 week low iron (2-6 parts per million) diet, and treatment with either RGFP966 (an HDAC3 specific inhibitor) or vehicle. Our primary interest is in the role of HDAC3 in expression of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin (Hamp1 in mice).

DESIGN
C57Bl/6 mice were treated with 3 weeks low iron diet, then treated with  2 doses of either RGFP966 20mg/kg i.p. or vehicle.

PLATFORM
