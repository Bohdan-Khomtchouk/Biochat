TITLE
Gene expression changes induced by LKB1 expression in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LKB1 is a tumor suppressor lost in approximately 30% of lung adenocarcinomas. It is a serine-threonine kinase involved in regulating metabolism, proliferation, and cell polarity. We have characterized its association with mRNA expression profiles in resected tumors and in cell lines, but little is known about the direct effects of LKB1 on the regulation of these genes. This study investigates the effects of LKB1 activity on mRNA expression in two LKB1-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, H2122 and A549. Wild-type LKB1 has been stably expressed in these cell lines using a pBABE retrovirus as well as an empty pBABE control and a kinase-dead mutant of LKB1 (K78I) control (Addgene). Samples submitted are two cell lines, three experimental conditions, and three replicates, for a total of 17 samples (one sample was excluded for poor RNA quality). Gene expression of these samples are analyzed to determine transcriptional regulatory effects of LKB1 expression. Results of this analysis are compared to our analysis of resected human tumors to determine gene patterns that are differentially expressed between LKB1-deficient and LKB1-wild-type tumors whose expression is also affected by restoration of LKB1 in vitro.

DESIGN
RMA gene expression was taken from two cell lines stably expressing LKB1 or controls of K78I mutant LKB1 or empty pBABE vector. Log2 average expression differences are calculated and compared to results from analysis of gene expression associated with LKB1 loss in resected human tumors.
