TITLE
Comparative genomic hybridization of a Burkholderia cenocepacia collection

ORGANISM
Burkholderia cenocepacia ; Burkholderia seminalis

SUMMARY
Individual normalized intensity of Burkholderia cenocepacia and Burkholderia seminalis hybridized in a B. cenocepacia array

DESIGN
A collection of 199 Burkholderia isolates were hybridized against an array targeting five B. cenocepacia strains in order to understand the gene distribution within this species. Burkholderia cenocepacia (n=191) as well as Burkholderia seminalis (n=8, as controls) were used in this analysis.

PLATFORM
