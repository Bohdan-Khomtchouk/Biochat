TITLE
Human carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF): co-culture with cancer cells vs. CAF only

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of CAF co-cultured with human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells compared with mono-cultured CAF. To identify key molecular regulators expressed by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) that promote cancer cell invasion, microarrays were performed by comparing co-cultured OSCC cells and CAF with monoculture controls.

DESIGN
comparison 1: CAF co-cultured with OSCC vs. mono-cultured CAF comparison 2: OSCC co-cultured with CAF vs. mono-cultured OSCC 1.7X10(5) YD-10B OSCC cells and 1.7X10(5) CAF were seeded in the upper chamber and lower chamber, respectively, of 6-transwell plates containing collagen-coated 1 micrometer pore transmembrane filters (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Monoculture control samples were generated by culturing only CAF or OSCC on the same side of the filter as in the co-culture design.
