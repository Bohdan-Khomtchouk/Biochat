TITLE
Histone Methylation Regulates Nephron Progenitor Cell Fate in Mice

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We report the use of high-throughput sequencing of histone methylation ChIP to compare the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 methylation states in sequential mouse nephron progenitor lineages

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different histone modifications in 2 cell types.
