TITLE
Expression data from Smarcd1 knockdown R1 embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify the gene expression changes after Smarcd1 knockdown in ESCs and 4 day RA differentiated ESCs

DESIGN
Actively growing ESCs and 4d RA differentiated ESCs were harvested and RNA was extracted immediately.
