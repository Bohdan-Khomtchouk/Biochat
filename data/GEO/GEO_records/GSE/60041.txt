TITLE
miRNA expression profile in CCR6+ regulatory T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To detect the miRNA expression profile in CCR6+ regulatory T cells

DESIGN
In this study, the total RNA was extracted from CCR6+ regulatory T cells and CCR6- regulatory T cells. Then, the expression profile of miRNA on these cells was detected by microarray.
