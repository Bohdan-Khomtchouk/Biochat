TITLE
Gene expression study in WT and NOTCH1 mutated CLL cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stabilizing mutations of NOTCH1 have been identified in about 10% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases at diagnosis, with a higher frequency in unmutated IGHV (IGHV-UM) CLL, chemorefractory CLL and CLL in advanced disease phases. Clinically, the presence of NOTCH1 mutations is an independent predictor of overall survival in CLL and associates with resistance to anti-Cd20 immunotherapy. The Gene Expression Profile was generated to identify the peculiar molecular signatures of NOTCH1 mutated CLL in the context of IGHV-UM CLL.

DESIGN
Constitutive gene expression in CLL cells bearing or not NOTCH1 mutation (c.7541_7542delCT). Five samples were selected for each category (WT vs MUT).

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
