TITLE
Expression data from Murine T cell in response to cycloheximide treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cycloheximide has been used for inhibiting protein synthesis in order to identify IL-2 direct targeted genes in T cells, but the effects of cycloheximide itself on genomewide genes are not well defined We conducted a global analysis of cycloheximide regulated genes in mouse T cell line CTLL-2 using Affymetrix mouse genome array, and identified 213 genes differentially expressed (?1.5-fold change) in response to cycloheximide 30min after adding cylcoheximide to T cells cultured without IL-2 for 14 hours. These genes involve in a number biological processes. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Murine cytotoxic T lymphocyte cell line CTLL-2, derived from a C57BL/6 mouse, is an IL-2 dependent cell line. Cells were cultured in D10 medium in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37oC to mid-log phase (~2 X 105 cells/mL), and collected by centrifugation, washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen), resuspended at 1 X 106 cells/mL in the medium without IL-2 (IL-2 starvation) and cultured for 14 hours (No IL-2 stimulation, T0, 5 reps), followed by adding cycloheximide (20 ?g/mL) for 30min (T4-CHX, 4 reps). Total RNA were extracted from the cells and was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
