TITLE
Tissue-Specific Transcriptional Profiling of Epigenetic Asymmetry in Porcine Parthenogenetic Fetuses1

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Using two complementary approaches, analysis of imprinting of candidate genes by pyrosequencing and expression profiling of parthenogenetic fetuses, we carried a comprehensive survey of genomic imprinting in swine. In the case of imprinted genes where transcription of one of the two parental alleles is silenced, uniparental embryos like parthenotes can be used to measure transcript dosage effects. Using Affymetrix Porcine GeneChip microarrays, four tissues of day 30 fetuses were profiled: brain, fibroblast, liver, and placenta. Keywords: Transcriptional profiling of epigenetic asymmetry in porcine day 30 parthenogenetic and biparental fetal tissues

DESIGN
24 samples total of Day 30 occidental porcine fetuses: 2 treatments (parthenote, control); four tissues (brain, fibroblast, liver, placenta); technical replicates (3 fibroblast only)

PLATFORM
GPL6472 Affymetrix GeneChip Porcine Genome Array probe-level
