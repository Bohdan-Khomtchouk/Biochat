TITLE
Grape berry developmental series from a vineyard in Willunga, South Australia (WIL-04)

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Changes in gene expression during berry development during a grape growing season were analysed. Grape berries were collected and pooled on a weekly basis to obtain a developmental series comprising of 19 developmental stages from flowering until harvest across the grape growing season. Gene expression patterns during development were obtained. Keywords: Time course, developmental series

DESIGN
Nineteen consecutive developmental stages were analysed for gene expression changes using the Affymetrix one colour array platform. The developmental stages were numbered 1 to 19. Two biological replicates were collected for each developmental stage. Biotin labeled probes were prepared from the extracted RNA from each of the pooled berry samples and hybridised to the Vitis vinifera GeneChip. The sample/GeneChip position on the Affymetrix hybridisation station was randomised using the AlgDesign package from R.
