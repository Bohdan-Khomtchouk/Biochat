TITLE
Grape berry developmental series from a vineyard in Willunga, South Australia (WIL-04)

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Changes in gene expression during berry development during a grape growing season were analysed. Grape berries were collected and pooled on a weekly basis to obtain a developmental series comprising of 19 developmental stages from flowering until harvest across the grape growing season. Gene expression patterns during development were obtained. Keywords: Time course, developmental series
