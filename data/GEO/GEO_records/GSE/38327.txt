TITLE
Comparison of transcript abundance in aerial mycelium of the Magnaporthe oryzae FLB3-deleted mutant and its parental strain 70-15

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe grisea

SUMMARY
Genes potentially regulated by the Flb3p transcription factor were identified by microarray-based transcriptome analysis of the flb3- mutant and the parental strain 70-15.
