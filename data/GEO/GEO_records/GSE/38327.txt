TITLE
Comparison of transcript abundance in aerial mycelium of the Magnaporthe oryzae FLB3-deleted mutant and its parental strain 70-15

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe oryzae

SUMMARY
Genes potentially regulated by the Flb3p transcription factor were identified by microarray-based transcriptome analysis of the flb3- mutant and the parental strain 70-15.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wild-type vs. FLB3-deleted mutant. 3 biological replicates with dye-swaps

PLATFORM
GPL9203 Agilent-015060 Magnaporthe grisea 2.0 4 X 44K (Probe name version)
