TITLE
Molecular karyotype analysis of 25 clinical-grade human embryonic stem cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clinical-grade human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) from 4 centres in the UK were cultured in self-renewal conditions Genomic DNA was isolated from low passage hESCs and submitted for SNP analysis using Illumina HumanCytoSNP-12 v2.1 BeadChip arrays

DESIGN
Evaluation of molecular karyotype of multiple clinical-grade hESC lines.
