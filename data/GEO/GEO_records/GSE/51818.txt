TITLE
Expression data from HepG2 (liver hepatocellular cells)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify the effects of ATP7B H1069Q overexpression on the liver transcriptome, we performed Affymetrix GeneChip hybridization experiments. Transcriptome analysis of the hepatocytes overexpressing ATP7B H1069Q, compared with hepatocytes overexpressing ATP7B WT.

DESIGN
For the analysis on the hepatocytes overexpressing ATP7B H1069Q, total RNA was extracted from HepG2 cells; RNA extracted from hepatocytes overexpressing ATP7B WT was used as control.
