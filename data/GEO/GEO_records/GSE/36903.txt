TITLE
Gene regulation by the lysine demethylase KDM4A in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Lysine methylation of histones is associated with both transcriptionally active chromatin and with silent chromatin, depending on what residue is modified. Histone methyltransferases and demethylases ensure that histone methylations are dynamic and can vary depending on cell cycle- or developmental stage. KDM4A demethylates H3K36me3, a modification enriched in the 3’end of active genes. The genomic targets and the role of KDM4 proteins in development remain largely unknown. To investigate the link between dKDM4A and transcription, and to unravel molecular targets on a genome-wide scale, we used microarrays to decipher gene expression changes in dKDM4A mutant 1st instar larvae and identified classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
Three replicates of 200 dKDM4A KG04636 / ∆dKDM4A and dKDM4A precise KG06436 / dKDM4A precise NP0618 Drosophila 1st instar larvae for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
