TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of mouse mature CD4SP thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) from electronically sorted mature CD4SP thymocytes. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by oligo(dT) priming with the QuantiTect Reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). The expression of 84 key genes involved in apoptosis, or programmed cell death was performed with mouse apoptosis RT2ProfilerTM PCR array system (PAMM-012 E; SABiosciences). PCR Array data were analyzed by the Ct data analysis method.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling.  CD4SP thymocytes from WT and Ik7Tg mice were used.
