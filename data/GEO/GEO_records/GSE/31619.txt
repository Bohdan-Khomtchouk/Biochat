TITLE
Right ventricular failure due to coronary artery ligation

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
A porcine microarray study of acute right ventricular failure due to coronary artery ligation of the right ventricular free wall. 1. Baseline sample from the free right ventricular wall. 2. Ligation of the coronary arteries on the right ventricular free wall induced right ventricular heart failure. When the pressure in the right atrium rose to > 20 mmHg, heart failure samples were taken from the free right ventricular wall.

DESIGN
A series of nine pigs, two samples from each animal: baseline and heart failure
