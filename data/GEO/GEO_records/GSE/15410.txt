TITLE
AB* zebrafish embryos exposed to 1 ng/mL TCDD from 1d to 5d post-fertilization.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of the response to dioxin in developing zebrafish embryos, at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h post-fertilization. The goal was to elucidate mechanisms by which dioxin causes toxicity in zebrafish; this dose was previously shown to induce teratogenesis.

DESIGN
Two conditions (dioxin or DMSO exposure), 5 timepoints, 4 replicates per timepoint derived from 4 entirely separate experiments; multiple pooled embryos per replicate. Embryo RNA was compared on each chip to a universal reference RNA obtained from zebrafish Zf4 cells (embryonic fibroblast cells).

PLATFORM
GPL2878 Agilent-013223 D. rerio (Zebrafish) Oligo Microarray G2518A Option 001 (Feature Number version)
