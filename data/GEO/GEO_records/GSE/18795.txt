TITLE
Expression data from zebrafish embryos homozygous mutant for the cohesin subunit Rad21

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Rad21 is a subunit of cohesin.  The main function of cohesin is to hold replicated chromosomes together until cells divide, but it also plays a role in gene expression.  To find out which genes might be regulated by cohesin, a study was conducted to look for global changes in gene expression in zebrafish embryos lacking cohesin component Rad21. The zebrafish Rad21 mutant used for expression analysis was rad21nz171, an allele isolated in a forward genetic screen for regulators of runx1.

DESIGN
RNA from rad21nz171 mutant and wild type zebrafish embryos collected at 24 hours post-fertilization (h.p.f.) and 48 h.p.f. was hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays (Gene Chip zebrafish genome arrays cat. no. 900488).  Four pools of 50 embryos for each genotype and time point were used as the RNA source, and RNA from each pool was hybridized independently such that the experiment had four biological replicates.
