TITLE
Acute high dose X-irradiation-induced genomic changes in a lung tumor cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Accidents with ionizing radiation (IR) often involve acute high dose exposures that can lead to acute radiation syndrome and late effects. IR can induce genomic lesions, cell death or carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated acute IR-induced cellular genomic signatures at the genome wide level. After exposing  the adenocarcinoma cell line A549 to an acute 6 Gy 240 kV X-Ray dose, four surviving clonogenic cells were recovered by minimal dilution and further expanded and analyzed by cytogenetics, chromosome painting and tiling-path array CGH, with the non-irradiated clone0 serving as control. It was found that acute X-ray exposure induced changes in modal chromosome number and specific translocations in the four irradiation surviving clones. Furthermore, clone4 displayed an increased radiosensitivity at D > 5 Gy. Array CGH disclosed unique and recurrent genomic changes, predominantly gains, and disclosed fragile sites FRA3B and FRA16D as preferential regions of genomic alterations in all irradiated clones, which likely relates to irradiation-induced genomic stress. Gene expression analysis revealed a specific profile of 364 genes in clone4, of which p53 pathway genes may contribute to its increased radiosensitivity. IR-induced genomic changes AND  fragile site expression highlight the capacity of a single acute radiation exposure to resculpture the genome of tumor cells by inflicting genomic stress.

DESIGN
Gene expression and array-CGH in A549 cell line was analysed after exposure to 6Gy X-rays at a dose rate of 1Gy/min.
