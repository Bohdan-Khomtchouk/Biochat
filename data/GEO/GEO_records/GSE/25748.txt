SUMMARY
These libraries represent Cancer Genome Anatomy Project libraries, which are either produced through CGAP funding, or donated to CGAP. The Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP: http://cgap.nci.nih.gov ) is an interdisciplinary program established and administered by the National Cancer Institute (NCI: http://www.nci.nih.gov ) to generate the information and technological tools needed to decipher the molecular anatomy of the cancer cell.

DESIGN
This GEO Series was created by the GEO staff as part of a cleanup effort to ensure that all GEO Samples are included within a Series entry.
