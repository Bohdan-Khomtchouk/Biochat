TITLE
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization study of human embryonic stem cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
G-banding of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) has proved their predisposition to aneuploidy of chromosomes 12, 17 and X. Now, using array-based comparative genomic hybridization, we find that hESC also accumulate other recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, such as duplications of stemness genes, submicroscopic instability of 20q11.21 and the appearance of a derivative chromosome 18. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization, genomic integrity of human embryonic stem cells
