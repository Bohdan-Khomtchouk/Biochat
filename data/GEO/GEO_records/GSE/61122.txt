TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for homozygosity mapping of segregating anhidrosis

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
A consanguineous family segregating anhidrosis (recessive, familial) Shared homozygous regions were identified by comparing SNP genotyping results from four affected family members

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples.
