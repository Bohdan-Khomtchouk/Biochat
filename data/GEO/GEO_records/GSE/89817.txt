TITLE
RNA sequencing reveals resistance of TLR4 ligand-activated microglial cells to inflammation mediated by the selective jumonji H3K27 demethylase inhibitor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Persistent microglia activation is associated with the production and secretion of various pro-inflammatory genes, cytokines and chemokines, which may initiate or amplify neurodegenerative diseases. A novel synthetic histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases JMJD3 inhibitor, GSK-J4, was proven to exert immunosuppressive activities in macrophages. However, a genome-wide search for GSK-J4 molecular targets has not been undertaken in microglia. To study the immuno-modulatory effects of GSK-J4 on a transcriptomic level, triplicate RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analyses were performed with resting, GSK-J4, LPS and LPS+GSK-J4 challenged primary microglial (PM) and BV-2 microglial cells. Among the annotated genes, transcriptional sequencing of microglia that were treated with GSKJ4 revealed a selective effect on LPS induced gene expression in which the induction of cytokines/chemokines, interferon-stimulated genes, and prominent (transcription factors) TFs as well as previously unidentified genes that are important in inflammation was suppressed. Furthermore, we show that GSK-J4 controls important inflammatory genes targets by modulating STAT1, IRF7, and H3K27me3 level at their promoter site. These unprecedented results demonstrate the histone demethylases inhibitor GSK-J4 could have therapeutic applications for neuroinflammatory diseases.

DESIGN
Examination of the effects LPS on GSKJ4-treated PM microglial cells, were generated by deep sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (101 cycles PE lane).
