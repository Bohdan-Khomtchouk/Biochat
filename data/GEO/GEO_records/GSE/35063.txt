TITLE
Efficient derivation of purified lung and thyroid progenitors from embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Two populations of Nkx2-1+ progenitors in the developing foregut endoderm give rise to the entire post-natal lung and thyroid epithelium, but little is known about these cells, as they are difficult to isolate in a pure form. We demonstrate here the purification and directed differentiation of primordial lung and thyroid progenitors derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Inhibition of TGFÎ² and BMP signaling, followed by combinatorial stimulation of BMP and FGF signaling can specify these cells efficiently from definitive endodermal precursors. When derived using Nkx2-1GFP knock-in reporter ESCs, these progenitors can be purified for expansion in culture and have a transcriptome that overlaps with developing lung epithelium. Upon induction, they can express a broad repertoire of markers indicative of lung and thyroid lineages and can recellularize a 3D lung tissue scaffold. Thus, we have derived a pure population of progenitors able to recapitulate the developmental milestones of lung/thyroid development.

DESIGN
Comparison between Nkx2-1 positive and Nkx2-1 negative cells derived after 14 days of differentiation of mouse ES cells carrying a knock-in reporter gene, Nkx2-1GFP.
