TITLE
Gene expression profiles of mouse myeloid progenitors stimulated with IL-33

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of IL-33 on mouse myeloid progenitors at gene expression level.  Results provide that myeloid progenitors should act as effector cells in IL-33-related diseases by producing cytokines and chemokines.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples were obtained from mouse myeloid progenitors such as eosinophil progenitors (EoPs), basophil progenitors (BaPs), mast cell progenitors (MCPs) and megakaryocyte / erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs) cultured for 48 hours with or without IL-33.
