TITLE
Genes regulated by Sox9

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression profile of jejunum crypt samples of Sox9 deficient mice and wild type control mice in order to identify the genes that are regulated by SOX9 in the small intestinal crypt epithelial cells.

DESIGN
The intestinal epithelial cells were collected from crypts of jejunum of three 3-mo-old Sox9 mutant mice and three littermate controls.
