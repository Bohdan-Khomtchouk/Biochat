TITLE
Expression data of colony-stimulating factor (CSF) grown bone marrow derived cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Granulocyte-Macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) devlops heterogenous myeloid cell populations from bone marrow progenitor cells. In vitro generated bone marrow derived cells are excellent sources for obtaining dendritic cells or macrophages, but it is still not clear about the exact mixed population characteristics of GM-CSF grown cells. We revealed here that GM-CSF grown bone marrow cell derived attaching cells were composed of dendritic cells (GM-BMDC) as well as macrophages (GM-BMM). We compared the transcriptome profiles of these cell populations as well as M-CSF grown bone marrow derived macrophages (M-BMM). We used microarrays to detail the global profile of gene expressions between three populations of CSF-grown bone marrow derived cells: GM-CSF derived dendritic cells (GM-BMDC), GM-CSF derived macrophages (GM-BMM) and M-CSF derived macrophages (M-BMM).

DESIGN
Bone marrow cells were differentiated for 7 days with 25 ng/ml GM-CSF or 20% L cell conditioned media as a M-CSF supplier. GM-BMDCs were sorted from MHCIIhighF4/80low population and GM-BMMs were sorted in the MHCIIlowF4/80high population. M-BMMs were sorted from CD11b+F4/80+ population.
