TITLE
Regulation of gene expression by JMJD5 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to define the cohort of genes whose expression is regulated by JMJD5 function in prostate cancer.  Towards this goal, LNCaP sublines stably expressing wld-type JMJD5 (LNCaP-JMJD5) were established.  In addition, a control subline(LNCaP-Vector) was generated by transfection with empty vector.  Both sublines were cultured in either androgen-deprived medium or in the presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT).  Subsequently, total RNA was isolated and then subjected to microarray gene expression profiling with Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.

DESIGN
A total of 4 samples were analyzed in this study.  The study included two cell lines, LNCaP-Vector and LNCaP-JMJD5, that were cultured under conditions of androgen depivation (-DHT) or supplementation with dihydrotestosterone (+DHT).  The LNCaP-Vector cell line served as the control for the study.
