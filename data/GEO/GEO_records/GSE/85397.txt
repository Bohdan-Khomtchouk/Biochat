TITLE
Gene expression data from murine CAR T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Compare the gene expression profile among Mouse m19delta.GFP and m1928z.GFP T cells and examine the differential upregulation of Bim, Bid, FasL and Apaf1 in m1928z T cells.

DESIGN
GFP+ mouse CAR T cells were sorted by FACS from ABM-- > BM12 recipient splenocytes 14 days after HSCT for RNA extraction and hybridization for Affymetrix microarrays.
