TITLE
p53 status and BaP or BPDE gene expression response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human colon carcinoma cells (HCT116) differing in p53 status were exposed to benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) (2.5 and 5 uM for up to 48 h) or anti-benzo(a)pyrene-trans-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE)(0.5 and 1 uM for up to 24 h), and their gene expression responses compared by cDNA microarray technology. Keywords: BaP or BPDE exposure
