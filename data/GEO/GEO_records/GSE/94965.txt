TITLE
RNA-seq of IL-4 complex treated tissue resident macrophages vs. monocytic macrophages from LysM Cre+ (WT litermate control) and LysM Cre+ RICTOR KO (myeloid specifically RICTOR deleted) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was performed on sorted peritoneal tissue resident macrophages (CD11b+F4/80hiTIM4+) and monocytic macrophages (CD11b+F4/80loTIM4-) from IL-4c (recombinant IL-4 (5µg) and anti-IL-4 ab (12.5µg) IP injection on days 0 and 2 and sorted on day 4) treated 6-8wks old LySM Cre+ and LysM Cre+ RICTOR KO  (C57BL/6 background) for expression profiling

DESIGN
Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing (Illumina NextSeq 500  V2 - PE 150 Cycle) on sorted peritoneal macrophages from WT and LysM RICTOR KO

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
