TITLE
Functional genomics of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) midguts and fatbodies

ORGANISM
Dendroctonus ponderosae

SUMMARY
Survey of relative gene expression profiles in larvae, pupae, and midguts and fatbodies of teneral, unfed, and fed adult mountain pine beetles from western Nevada, USA.

DESIGN
Array prepared on 4-tile chips (4-plex custom arrays), each feature represented by six different oligonucleotides, three replicate blocks/tile, hybridized with total RNA from 11 samples, each replicated four times. Vector (pDONR222) and two plant sequences included as negative controls.
