TITLE
Expression data from MDA-MB-231 cells treated with dinaciclib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dinaciclib potently inhibits CDK12, resulting in decreased mRNA from many genes associated with DNA damage signaling and repair. We used microarrays to assess changes in global mRNA levels following dinaciclib treatment in breast cancer cells

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 12 hours with dinaciclib before cells were trypsinized and treated with trizol for mRNA extraction
