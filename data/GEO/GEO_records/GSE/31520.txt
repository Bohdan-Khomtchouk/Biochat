TITLE
Chip-chip from Mouse MEFs cells for H3K36me3, Srsf1, Psip1(A300-847 antibody).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The p52 isoform of Psip1/Ledgf links histone H3K36 methylation and the regulation of alternative splicing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of Psip1 together with H3K36me3 and Srsf1 and by ChIP-on-chip analysis demonstrated that  H3K36me3, Psip1 and SRSF1 enrichment correlates on the gene bodies

DESIGN
Array design includes 2 dye swap replicates for Srsf1 and Psip1-/- samples, and single arrays for PSIP and H3K36me3 samples

PLATFORM
GPL14175 NimbleGen Hox plus regions strand array [110215_PM_MM9_regions; design id: 548631]
