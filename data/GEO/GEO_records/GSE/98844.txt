TITLE
Analysis of gene expression changes in the cranial base (chondrocranium) of Memo1 mutant embryos versus controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the gene expression changes in the embryonic day (E) 15.5 mouse cranial base associated with loss of Memo1, as assessed by next-generation RNA-sequencing

DESIGN
E15.5 cranial base samples dissected from 3 control and 3 Memo1 mutant mouse embryos - total RNA extracted using Norgen Biotek Total RNA Purification Kit
