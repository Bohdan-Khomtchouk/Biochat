TITLE
Gene expression data from irradiated mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In previous studies, it was observed that survivors who received stem cell transplantation and whole body irradiation showed development of NAFLD as a chronic effect. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of radiation-induced NAFLD, we conducted transcriptoic analysis in mice which received whole body irradiation and developed NAFLD.

DESIGN
The 4-week-old C57BL/6 mice were treated with 6 Gy of single gamma-ray and incubated for 5 weeks. Total RNA was isolated from liver tissue and subjected to microarray
