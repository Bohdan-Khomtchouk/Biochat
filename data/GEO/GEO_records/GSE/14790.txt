TITLE
Expression data from blood samples of piglets experimentally infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
This study aimed to characterize differences in gene expression in piglets inoculated with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), the essential causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Comparisons between control and PCV2-inoculated pigs were done at five different time points: 0, 7, 14, 21 and 29 days post-inoculation. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Seven-day-old caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived piglets were distributed into two groups: control (n=4) and inoculated with 105.2 TCID50 of the Burgos PCV2 isolate (n=4). Pigs were bled at 0, 7, 14, 21, and 29 days post-inoculation.
