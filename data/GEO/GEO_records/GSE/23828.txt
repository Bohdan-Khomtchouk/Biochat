TITLE
Contribution of CgPDR1-regulated genes in enhanced virulence of azole-resistant Candida glabrata (part 2)

ORGANISM
[Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
In this study, we aimed to determine genome-wide changes in gene expression driven by seven individual CgPDR1 hyperactive alleles as compared to wild-type allele to identify i) the CgPdr1p target genes differentially expressed in presence of CgPDR1 hyperactive alleles and ii)  potential virulence factor(s) regulated by CgPDR1 hyperactive alleles. Microarray experiments revealed a high number of genes (ranging from 80 to 400 genes) differentially regulated by individual CgPDR1 hyperactive alleles.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in 2 C. glabrata clinical isolates (DSY717 and DSY2317). DSY2317 is azole-susceptible and contains a wild-type CgPDR1 allele. DSY717 is azole-resistant and contains a CgPDR1 allele with the gain-of-function mutation L1081F.
