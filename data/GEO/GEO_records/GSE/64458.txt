TITLE
Genetic Variation Determines PPARγ Function and Antidiabetic Drug Response In Vivo [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SNPs affecting disease risk often reside in non-coding genomic regions. Here we show that SNPs are highly enriched at mouse strain-selective adipose tissue binding sites for PPARγ, a nuclear receptor for antidiabetic drugs. Many such SNPs alter binding motifs for PPARγ or cooperating factors, and functionally regulate nearby genes whose expression is strain-selective and imbalanced in heterozygous F1 mice. Moreover, genetically-determined binding of PPARγ accounts for mouse strain-specific transcriptional effects of TZD drugs, providing proof-of- concept for personalized medicine related to nuclear receptor genomic occupancy. In human fat, motif-altering SNPs cause differential PPARγ binding, provide a molecular mechanism for some expression quantitative trait loci, and are risk factors for dysmetabolic traits in genome- wide association studies. One PPARγ motif-altering SNP is associated with HDL levels and other metabolic syndrome parameters. Thus, natural genetic variation in PPARγ genomic occupancy determines individual disease risk and drug response.

DESIGN
6 ChIP-seq experiments conducted in mice and 5 in human subjects. Deep sequencing carried out using Illumina HiSeq2000 and the Solexa Analysis Pipeline eWAT; epididymal White Adipose Tissue iWAT; inguinal White Adipose Tissue 12wLFD; mice were fed a control low fat diet (Research Diet D12450B) chow; mice were fed standard rodent chow Diet GR; Glucocorticoid receptor
