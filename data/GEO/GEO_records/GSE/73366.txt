RNA IP Seq analysis of Cnot7 in 4T1 mammary tumor cells

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Native RNA immunoprecipitation of Cnot7-bound transcripts. Abstract: Accumulating evidence supports the role of an aberrant transcriptome as a driver of tumor cell metastatic potential. Deadenylation is a general regulatory node for post-transcriptional control by microRNAs and other determinants of RNA stability. We show here that CCR4-NOT subunit CNOT7 is a deadenylase-dependent driver of tumor cell autonomous metastatic potential. Metastasis promotion by CNOT7 is dependent on contact with CNOT1 and TOB1. We further show TOB1 independently drives metastasis. RNA-immunoprecipitation and integrated transcriptome wide analyses reveal that CNOT7-regulated transcripts are enriched for a tripartite 3â€™UTR motif bound by RNA-binding proteins known to complex with CNOT7, TOB1, and CNOT1. Collectively, our data support a model of CNOT7, TOB1, CNOT1, and RNA-binding proteins collectively exerting post-transcriptional control on a metastasis suppressive transcriptional program to drive tumor cell metastasis.
