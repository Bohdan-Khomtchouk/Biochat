TITLE
Effect of 4-Hydroxynonenal on gene expression. Comparison of HSF1-siRNA silenced vs control cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE), a cytotoxic and diffusible electrophile generated by the spontaneous decomposition of oxidized lipids, has a suspected role in neurodegenerative and inflammatory disease processes. In addition to promoting cell death, elevated levels of HNE lead to the engagement of cytoprotective signaling pathways, including the heat shock, antioxidant, DNA damage, and ER stress responses. Activation of the heat shock response, mediated by the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), is critical for maintaining cellular viability in the presence of HNE. Accordingly, silencing HSF1 expression using siRNA enhances the toxicity of HNE. Microarray analysis of samples from control and HSF1-silenced cells was performed to investigate which associated changes in gene could be responsible for the decrease in cellular viability.

DESIGN
Four different experimental conditions were investigated. Samples were prepared and analyzed in triplicate. Samples 1-3 received NEG control siRNA and DMSO (vehicle) for 6 h. Samples 4-6 received NEG control siRNA and 50 uM HNE for 6 h. Samples 7-9 received HSF1 siRNA and DMSO (vehicle) for 6 h. Samples 10-12 received HSF1 siRNA and 50 uM HNE for 6 h.
