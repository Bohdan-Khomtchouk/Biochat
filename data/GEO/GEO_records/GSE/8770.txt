Niemann-Pick type C fibroblast analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary skin fibroblasts from four Niemann-Pick type C patients homozygous for the I1061T mutation and four control individuals were cultured under identical conditions in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum.  Cells were harvested at 50-70% confluency.      mRNA was isolated with the FastTrack 2.0 mRNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).  A reference RNA comprised of 10 cell lines was used as the control for each hybridized sample (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).  Both sample and reference RNAs were amplified using the MessageAmp II aRNA amplification kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments Keywords: Biological Replicate
