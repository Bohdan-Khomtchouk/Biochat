TITLE
Transcriptomic comparison of E13.5 Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) from Fancg-/- and WT mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed in order to detail the global changes of gene expression in  Fancg -/- embryonic  Primordial Germ Cells and decipher molecular pathways underlying defects of primordial germ cell development in KO embryos.

DESIGN
PGC from  E13.5 male embryos were sorted by flow cytometry, RNA exracted and used for Affymetrix microarray analysis. Three individual samples of 10,000 PGCs (pooled from at least five embryos for each sample) were processed for WT and KO genotypes

PLATFORM
GPL18802 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [mogene20st_Mm_ENTREZG_18.0.0]
