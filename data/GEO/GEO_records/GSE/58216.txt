TITLE
Transcriptional profile of bovine chorioallantoic membrane explants in response to wild type, Î”virB2 or Î”btpB Brucella abortus

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In this study the transcription profile of bovine trophoblastic cells infected with Brucella samples was evaluated. Chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) explants inoculated with wild type (strain 2308), and to compare with the transcription profile of trophoblastic cells infected with mutant strains lacking virB2 or btpB.Î”virB2 or Î”btpB by microarray analysis at 4 hours post infection. Genes with significant variation in levels of transcripts (fold change > 2 and P < 0.05) were functionally classified, and transcripts related to defense and inflammation were assessed by quantitative real time RT-PCR.

DESIGN
Chorioallantoic membrane explant culture (CAM) were obtained from 7 intact pregnant bovine uteruses at the final third of gestation. Three-condition experiment, wild type B. abortus 2308, DvirB2 or DbtpB in 4 control replicates and Microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL11648 Agilent-023647 B. taurus (Bovine) Oligo Microarray v2 (Feature Number version)
