TITLE
CIRCULATING MICRORNAs PREDICT SURVIVAL OF PATIENTS WITH TUMORS OF GLIAL ORIGIN

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed serum extracellular vescicles (SEV) of 28 patients with glioma tumors and 8 normal samples by Nanostring, and validated a microRNA profile that can differentiate between and among some classes of CNS tumors.

DESIGN
A total of 28 glial tumor SEV samples were collected from UCFS, and 8 SEV normal control samples from The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.

PLATFORM
GPL24781 Nanostring human miRNA panel (NS_H_MIR_V3A)
