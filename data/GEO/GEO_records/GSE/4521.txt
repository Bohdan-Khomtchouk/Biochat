TITLE
B virus and HSV-1 Infected Human Foreskin Fibroblast (HFF) expression profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The overall cellular gene expression patterns engaged as a result of B virus (E2490) and HSV-1 (MacIntyre) infection at 1h, 3h, and 5h post infection were analyzed. Differentially regulated immune responsive genes during the early infection stage were identified. Keywords: B virus, HSV-1

DESIGN
The variables tested were infection (Mock, BV, HSV-1) and time (1, 3, 5h). Samples were performed in biological duplicate.
