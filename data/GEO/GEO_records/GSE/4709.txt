TITLE
Gcn4p-mediated transcriptional stress response

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The transcriptional data from an integrative analysis of transcriptional and metabolic stress responses that provides a more complete understanding of the mechanisms by which genetic regulatory circuits mediate metabolic phenotype. Keywords: stress response, genetic modification

DESIGN
Our investigation disrupts native transcriptional control of amino acid biosynthesis via the Gcn4p- mediated transcriptional stress response.  Specifically, genetic perturbation of transcriptional regulator Gcn4p in a stress condition is achieved via wild-type S288C and gcn4-delta strains in a pH-controlled chemostat environment in which a titrated inhibitor creates near histidine starvation and glucose supply limits growth to a pre-defined rate (0.10 hr^-1).  The gene expression chip titles indicate the condition.
