TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in cancerous and normal human bladder tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of differential gene expression in urothelium cancer cells compared to healthy bladder cells. The goal of researh was to discover any differences in signaling pathways regulation between cancer and normal cells and searching potential molecular markers for early cancer diagnostics.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 9 cancerous tissue samples obtained during cystectomy and 3 normal bladder tissue samples obtaind post mortem from donors without bladder cancer.
