TITLE
Gene expression changes in Piloderma croceum-Quercus robur ectomycorrhizal roots compared to Piloderma croceum free-living mycelium

ORGANISM
Piloderma croceum

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from Piloderma croceum ectomycorrhizal roots compared to free-living mycelium . Mycorrhizal roots  were harvested after 8 weeks, pooled and used for RNA extraction. Reads of 2X100bp were generated and aligned to Piloderma croceum ( http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Pilcr1/Pilcr1.home.html ) using CLC Genomics Workbench 6.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Piloderma croceum ectomycorrhizal roots and free-living mycelium were generated by paired-end (2x100bp) Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing. Three biological replicates were sequenced for mycorrhizal and mycelium samples.
