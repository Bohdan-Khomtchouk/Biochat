TITLE
Effect of Cited2 knockdown on global transcript expression in Rcho-1 cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We had previously discovered that the transcription factor Cited2 was highly induced during trophoblast differentiation. In this study, we used an lentiviral shRNA strategy to decrease Cited2 expression in Rcho-1 trophoblast cells. A RNA-seq approach was used to determine global transcript differences inRcho-1 knockdown cells compared to control cells.

DESIGN
Rcho-1 cells transduced with control shRNAs were used as controls. Cells transduced with shRNAs targetingCited2 were used as treatment.Cells were differentiated for 8 days and the analyses were done.
