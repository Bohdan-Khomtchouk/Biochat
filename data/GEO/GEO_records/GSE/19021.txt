TITLE
Global gene expression analyses of the Nr5a2 reprogrammed cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression of  ESCs, Nr5a2 reprogrammed iPSC lines and MEFs.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates for ESCs, each iPSC line and each type of MEF. The global gene expression profiles of the Nr5a2 reprogrammed iPS cell lines were compared to ESCs and MEFs.
