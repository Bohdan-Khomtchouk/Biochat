TITLE
Genome wide binding sites of BAP1, HCF1 and OGT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the genome wide binding sites of BAP1, HCF1 and OGT in bone marrow derived macrophages. De-ubiquitinating enzyme BAP1 is mutated in a hereditary cancer syndrome with increased risk of mesothelioma and uveal melanoma. Somatic BAP1 mutations occur in various malignancies. We show that mouse Bap1 gene deletion is lethal during embryogenesis, but systemic or hematopoietic-restricted deletion in adults recapitulates features of human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Knockin mice expressing BAP1 with a 3xFlag tag revealed that BAP1 interacts with host cell factorâ€“1 (HCF-1), O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), and the polycomb group proteins ASXL1 and ASXL2 in vivo. OGT and HCF-1 levels were decreased by Bap1 deletion, indicating a critical role for BAP1 in stabilizing these epigenetic regulators. Human ASXL1 is mutated frequently in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) so an ASXL/BAP1 complex may suppress CMML. A BAP1 catalytic mutation found in a MDS patient implies that BAP1 loss of function has similar consequences in mice and humans.

DESIGN
For BAP1, bone marrow derived macrophages were used differentiated from bone marrow cells of BAP1-3X Flag Tagged KI mice we generated. For OGT and HCF1, bone marrow derived macrophages were used from BAP1 WT mice.
