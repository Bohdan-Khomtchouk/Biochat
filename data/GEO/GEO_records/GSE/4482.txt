TITLE
Microarray based Gene expression profiling of Cervical Cancer in India

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is a study to identify clinically relevant molecular signatures of gene expression in cervical cancer samples fro m patients in India Keywords: Cancer versus normal study

DESIGN
Cervical cancer and non-malignant cervical cancer tissues are obtained from consenting patients following hospital ethics committee approved protocols. The samples are profiled against universal Human reference RNA from Stratagene on 19K EST microarrays from Microarray Center, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada. Cancer samples are compared against normal samples and outliers belonging to identifiable clusters, following unsupervised hierarchical clustering are validated by other biochemical means such as real time PCR and western blot.
