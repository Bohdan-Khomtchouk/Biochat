TITLE
miRNA and mRNA profiling of tumor-educated macrophages (miRNA 1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled miRNA and mRNA expression of in vitro tumor-educated macrophages (TEM) by indirectly co-culturing with estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
2 biological replicates of untreated and co-cultured macrophages, parallel analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression

PLATFORM
GPL7731 Agilent-019118 Human miRNA Microarray 2.0 G4470B (Feature Number version)
