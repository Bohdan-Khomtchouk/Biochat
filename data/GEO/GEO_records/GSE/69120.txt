TITLE
Gene expression signatures of iNKT-subpopulations sorted from thymus of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
iNKT cells can be classified based on functional criteria into iNKT1, iNKT2 and iNKT17 cells, respectively. Here, a protocol was applied allowing sorting of living cells from thumus of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. The obtained gene expression profiles confirmed already existing information regarding the iNKT subtypes and will therefore provide useful hints for further investigations.

DESIGN
Samples of iNKT1, iNKT2 and iNKT17 cells were obtained in two completely independent flow cytometric sorts for both, (BALB/c) and (C57BL/6). As a source, cells from thymi from 5 to 6 female mice were prepared for each sort. Moreover, iNKT1 cells from BALB/c thymus were sorted into CD4(lo-int) and CD4 (int-hi) fractions.
