TITLE
drn/drn-l expressing cells vs non-expressing cells-Embryonic patterning in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
adt05-04_drn - drn/drn-l expressing cells vs non-expressing cells - DRN targets - In primordia timing (pt) mutant background DRN::erGFP transgenic cell culture (somatic embryos suitable to regenerate plants) has been protoplasted and protoplasts have been sorted for GFP+ and GFP- cells. Total RNA was extracted and sent to Evry for comparison (samples DRN a,b,c). DRN-L::erGFP transgenic cell culture has been protoplasted and protoplasts have been sorted for GFP+ and GFP- cells (samples DRN-L-2-1 and DRN-L-3-1). Keywords: null

DESIGN
5 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL9553 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 34.6K CATMA_v5
