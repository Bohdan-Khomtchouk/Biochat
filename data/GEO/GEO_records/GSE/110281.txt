TITLE
Expression data of e13.5 Sox-GFP forming digit, e14.5 Lgr5-GFP+ interzone and e14.5 GFP- surrounding tissues in digit

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lgr5 is a novel marker expressing in the interzone from around e14.5 of developing synovial joint. By comparing the expression profiles of e14.5 Lgr5+ interzone cells, surrounding Lgr5- non-interzone cells and also e13.5 digit, we have identified some differential expressing genes in the interzone. We have generated bulk RNAseq data of e14.5 Lgr5+ interzone cells, surrounding non-interzone cells and e13.5 Sox9+ chondrocytes cells in digit.

DESIGN
Sox9+ and Lgr5+ cells were isolated from e13.5 Sox9-eGFP and e14.5 Lgr5-GFP-CreERT mice, respectively, GFP+ve and -ve cells were sorted and collected with FACSAria I flow cytometer. Total RNA was extracted from the collected cells with mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA libraries were constructed with 10ng of RNA using SMARTer Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (v3, Illumina) and DNA sequencing performed using the Illumina HiSeq platform.

PLATFORM
