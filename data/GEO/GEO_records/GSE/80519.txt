TITLE
Genomic landscape affected by allelic imbalance in the cancerization filed of normal appearing airway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal appearing airway samples from non-small cell lung (NSCLC) cancer patients were profiled using illumina sequencing arrays. Allelic imbalance was detected in normal-appearing large and small airway samples and affected known lung cancer driver genes.

DESIGN
Multiple airway samples from 45 patients were analyzed using illumina sequencing arrays in order to comprehensively asses the genomic landscape of airway epithelia adjacent to NSCLC. For each patients there was at least one small airway sample, a tumor samples, as well as germline control sample (blood and/or normal uninvolved lung). In addition to these samples additional samples were analyzed for a subset of patients these included large airway, nasal, and multiple core needle biopsies from the tumor.
