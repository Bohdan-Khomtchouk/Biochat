TITLE
B. subtilis: temporal expression response to amino acid treatment

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
Microorganisms can restructure their transcriptional output to adapt to environmental conditions by sensing endogenous metabolite pool. In this study, an Agilent customized microarray representing approximately 4,106 genes was used to study temporal transcript profiles of Bacillus subtilis in response to valine, glutamate and glutamine pulses. Amino-acid-regulated genes were identified having significantly changed expression at one or more time points in response to pulses of valine, glutamate, and glutamine, respectively, and Val-, Glu and Gln-specific genes were further distinguished from them. Different amino acid treatments were compared in terms of both the global temporal profiles and the 5-minute quick regulations, and between-experiment differential genes were identified. The highlighted genes were analyzed based on diverse sources of gene functions using a variety of computational tools, including T-profiler analysis, hierarchical clustering and enrichment of functional categories. The results revealed the common and distinct modes of action of these three amino acids, and should help to elucidate the specific signaling mechanism of each amino acid as an effector.

DESIGN
Three amino acids (Glutamate, Glutamine, and Valine) were adopted to perturb the culture of subtilis. Four time-points were investigated for each perturbation. There are two replicates for the first time-point of Valine-treatment experiment.
