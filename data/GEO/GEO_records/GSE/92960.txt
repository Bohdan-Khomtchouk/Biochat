TITLE
Identification of the Lgr5+ population in human colorectal samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lgr5+ cell population is the stem cell population that fuels intestinal growth in homeostatic conditions. Here, we have labeled with EGFP the Lgr5 expressing population in patient derived organoids, injected them subcutaneously in mice and disaggregated the tumors to sort the EGFP+ population and characterize its gene expression profile. This Lgr5-EGFP population is more proficient in comparison to the negative in propagating tumors both in vitro (assessed by organoid formation) and in vivo (assessed by Tumor initiation experiments)

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from the EGFP+ (Lgr5+) population and EGFP- (Lgr5-) population after FACs sorting
