TITLE
Expression data from murine bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells at two early stages of development.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was designed to define erythropoietin (EPO) regulated genes in murine bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells at two stages of development, designated E1, and E2. E1 cells correspond to CFUe- like progenitors, while E2 cells are proerythroblasts.

DESIGN
14 samples were analyzed. 8 samples belong to the E1 stage and the remaning 6 samples correspond to the E2 stage. In the E1 stage, there are 4 controls and 4 treatment samples. The 4 samples in each group are biological replicates. Likewise in the E2 stage, there are 3 control and 3 treatment samples and the 3 samples in each group are biological replicates.
