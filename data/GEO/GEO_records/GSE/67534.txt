TITLE
Identifying PD0325901-regulated genes in the J1 mESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It has been demonstrated that PD0325901 promotes self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells, however, the target genes of PD0325901 are not fully understood. To better understand the downstream target genes of PD0325901, we performed Microarray analyses to identify their downstream targets. The data show the genes regulated by PD0325901.

DESIGN
J1 mESCs maintained in  medium containing 1000 U/mL LIF and supplemented without or with PD0325901 for 24 hours, then total RNA was extracted for analysis.
