TITLE
Decline of Nucleotide Excision Repair Capacity in Aged Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We used gene expression profiling to address several specific questions that arose in a study of repair of ultraviolet C radiation in C elegans, as well as to generate hypotheses regarding the possible mechanism(s) of decreased DNA repair observed in old adults in that study. This analysis was performed in order to analyze gene expression in the strain (JK1107) and experimental conditions that we used for our DNA repair studies. The supplementary file GSE4766_Resolver_all_data.txt includes  Resolver generated fold-changes and p values based on ratios built in Rosetta Resolver as described in the Rosetta Biosoftware Technical Note (Lee Weng, 2004), Data processing and analysis methods in the Rosetta Resolver system ( http://www.rosettabio.com/tech/default.htm ). Keywords: C elegans, glp-1, age, nucleotide excision repair, ultraviolet radiation, DNA damage

DESIGN
Gene expression data for glp-1 (strain JK1107) nematodes were obtained by comparing mRNA expression level in replicate pools of 2000-3000 mixed-stage embryos, young (1-day) adults, and old (6-day) adults raised at 25ÂºC. Three replicate pools of embryo and young adult samples were analyzed, but only two replicate pools of 6-day adults were analyzed due to low RNA recovery.
