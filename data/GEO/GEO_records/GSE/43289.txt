TITLE
Gene expression profiles of gliomas with Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Correlate the gene expression profiles with the most relevant patterns of chromosome abnormalities (cytogenetic subgroups of gliomas) and the histopathology.

DESIGN
We analyzed the gene expression profiles (U133 Plus 2.0 Array) of 40 gliomas (35 astrocytic tumors, 3 oligodendrogliomas, and 2 mixed tumors) and their association with tumor cytogenetics and histopathology.
