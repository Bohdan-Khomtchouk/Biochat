TITLE
Digital expression profiling highlights a distinct live RNA signature in high-risk Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using outcome after long term follow-up to define risk at disease presentation high risk (n=9 who went on to require liver transplantation) and low risk (n=7 who responded fully to UDCA) patients were identified and their first liver biopsies retrieved. RNA was successfully extracted and analysed using nanostringÂ® transcriptomics. Patients with progressive disease appear to have a distinct molecular signature.

DESIGN
high risk (n=9 who went on to require liver transplantation) and low risk (n=7 who responded fully to UDCA) patient material was processed along with non-diseased control liver (n=8)

PLATFORM
