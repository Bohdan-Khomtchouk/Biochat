TITLE
Activated Notch-induced transcriptional profile modulation in human primary dermal lymphatic endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) was overexpressed in human primary lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) for 10 and 24 hours by adenovirus. A GFP-control adenovirus-infected cells (24hours) and uninfected cells were also analysed as controls. Total RNAs were harvested and subjected to Affymetrix U133A microarray.

DESIGN
Human primary lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were isolated from human foreskin and cultured and expanded to population passages 5~6. Healthy subconfluent primary LECs were infected with adenovirus expressing human Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) for 10 or 24 hours. In parallel, LECs were also infected with a GFP-expressing control adenovirus for 24 hours. Uninfected LECs were also used as a negative control in the same experiments *** CEL files unavailable/unrecoverable. ***
