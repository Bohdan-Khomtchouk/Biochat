TITLE
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris GE2-14 (GE2-14) vs Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris GE2-14 ΔaguR (GE2-14 ΔaguR)

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris GE214

SUMMARY
Trancriptional profiling of  GE2-14 ΔaguR mutant strain in which the aguR gene of the agmatine deiminase cluster has been deleted. We compared the expression profiling of GE2-14 cells with the expression profiling of GE2-14 ΔaguR mutant cells. The goal was to determine the effect of the aguR deletion on the transcriptional profiling of GE2-14

DESIGN
Two strains GE2-14 (reference) vs. GE2-14 ΔaguR (test) cells in same conditions. Three biological replicates, two technical replicates and one dye swap.

PLATFORM
GPL18969 Agilent-040255  Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris GE214 array (Feature number version)
