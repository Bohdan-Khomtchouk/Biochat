TITLE
Genome-wide effect of constitutive interferon on gene-expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using mice deficient for several genes that contribute to constitutive levels of type I interferon, we compared genome-wide expressionof RNA in rested macrophages of these mice.

DESIGN
To look for the role of constitutive interferon, we matured bone marrow derived macrophages from different mouse strains including strains with deficiency for IFNAR (interferon receptor) and STING (Stimulator if Interferon Genes) and compared levels of expression of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). One replica of each sample is provided
