TITLE
Detection of oncoantigens suitable for lung cancer vaccination

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The lung cancer tumor K-rasLA1/ p53 R172HDeltag mouse model was used to identify genes associated to the tumor mass increase in lungs. Those genes were then ranked on the basis of their oncogenic potential using a metadataset encompassing 695 human lung adenocarcinomas and ranking them on the basis of their expression in normal tissues. The genes characterized by the higher oncogenic potential combined to a low expression in normal tissues were selected as putative targets for preclinical studies on lung cancer vaccination.

DESIGN
Two prototypic situations (WT, and MUT) were examined using Exon arrays over a three-points time course (10, 20, and 30 weeks old animals), for each time point two/three male and female animals were used. A total of 30 mouse Exon 1.0 arrays were hybridized.

PLATFORM
GPL6096 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
