TITLE
A global comparative analysis of gene expression in ovules and leaves based on integrated De Novo transcriptome assembly of Ginkgo biloba L.

ORGANISM
Ginkgo biloba

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from mature ovules and fully expanded leaves of female G. biloba to generate a  comprehensive gene expression profile. These results provide valuable gene expression information, which will contribute to facilitate our understanding of various biological mechanisms between ovules and leaves and uncover a more important molecular insight toward ovule evolution in early seed plants.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in ovules and leaves

PLATFORM
GPL19583 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Ginkgo biloba)
