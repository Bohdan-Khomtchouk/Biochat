TITLE
The JMJD3-IRF4 axis regulates M2 macrophage polarization and host responses against helminth infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Polarization of macrophages to M1 or M2 cells is important for mounting responses against bacterial and helminth infection respectively. Jumonji domain containing 3 (JMJD3), a histone 3 K27 demethylase, has been implicated in the activation of macrophages. Here we show that JMJD3 is essential for M2 macrophage polarization to helminth infection and chitin, though JMJD3 is dispensable for M1 responses. Furthermore, Jmjd3 is critical for proper bone marrow macrophage differentiation in a demethylase activity-dependent manner. Jmjd3 deficiency affected trimethylation of H3K27 in only a limited numbers of genes. Among them, we identified Irf4 as the target transcription factor critical for controlling M2 macrophage polarization. Collectively, these results show that JMJD3-mediated H3K27 demethylation is critical for regulating M2 macrophage development leading to anti-helminth host responses.
