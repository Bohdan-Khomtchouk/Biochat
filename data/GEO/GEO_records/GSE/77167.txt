TITLE
Differential gene expression analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes reveals overexpression of tumor progression-related genes in patients with intra-abdominal infection after surgery for colon cancer: a prospective matched cohort study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim was to investigate the effect of postoperative intra-abdominal infection on the gene expression patterns of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) after surgery for colorectal cancer

DESIGN
Prospective matched cohort study. Patients who had an anastomotic leak or intra-abdominal abscess were included in the infection group (n=23). For each case patient, another patient with an uncomplicated postoperative course was selected for the control group (n=23). Some other unmatched samples are included in this data set
