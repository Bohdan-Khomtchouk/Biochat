TITLE
ChIP-seq from SK-N-MC (ENCSR152QRE)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq against H3K4me1 using SK-N-MC cell line which was previously described as a neuroepithelioma (ATCC HTB-10). However recent evidence reveals it is Ewing's Sarcoma (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15548687, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25453903, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/3151999).
