TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Bacillus subtilis WT (ABS2005) and ydcH mutant (ASEC56)

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
With these experiments we investigate the impact of the deletion of the ydcH gene on the transcriptomes of Bacillus subtilis strains ABS2005.

DESIGN
Mutant and parental background of the strain were subjected to stranded RNA-Seq profiling in both exponential and stationary phase. A total of 12 biological samples were examined with triplicates for each condition.

PLATFORM
GPL24109 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Bacillus subtilis)
