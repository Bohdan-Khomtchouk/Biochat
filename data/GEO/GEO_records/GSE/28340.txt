TITLE
Expression data from mouse dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DCs) are pivotal for both recognition of antigens and control of an array of immune responses by recognizing microbes through distinct pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The first microbial component to be  studied in detail and known to cause septic shock is endotoxin (LPS). DCs recognize LPS via Toll-like receptor TLR-47. LPS causes many changes in the DCs, but the elicitation of cytokine production is perhaps the one with clear biologic relevance. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying regulation of TLR 4 signaling and identified the upregulated and downregulated genes in response to LPS treatment in mouse dendritic cells. We use microarray to determine the conserved hematopoietic miRNAs to study their potential  contribution  to regulating many different immunological cellular processes and contexts.

DESIGN
To obtain  overall gene expression profile, we extracted bone marrow cells from at least 3 mice for each experiment.  Purified ( 97~98% purity) mouse dendritic cells, treated with LPS or control diluent, were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To obtain  overall miRNA expression profile, we extracted bone marrow cells from at least 3 mice (C57BL/6)   for each experiment.  Purified ( 97~98% purity for CD11C+ ) mouse dendritic cells were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Exiqon miRCURY LNATM microRNA array.
