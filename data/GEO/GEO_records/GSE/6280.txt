TITLE
Expression data for normal and tumor kidneys

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
End stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with hyperplastic-cystic remodelling of the kidneys (ARCD) and increased rate of kidney tumours. Using the Affymetrix oligoarray, we have established the gene expression signature of ESRD/ARCD kidneys and compared to those of normal kidneys and of distinct types of renal tumours. Keywords: normal and different tumor tissues

DESIGN
We analysed several array per specific type of renal tumor and normal kidney tissue
