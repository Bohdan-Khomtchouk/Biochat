TITLE
Identification of HOXB8 and K LK11 expression levels as potential biomarkers to predict the effects of FOLFOX4 chemotherapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To measure global gene expression in primary advanced colorectal cancer patients who have undergone fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4)  chemotherapy and screen valuable biomarkers to predict the effects of chemotherapy Samples from primary advanced colorectal cancer patients were collected. The effects of chemotherapy were evaluated, and patients were divided into an experimental group and a control group.

DESIGN
All patients underwent standard FOLFOX4 regimen chemotherapy in four cycles after signing the chemotherapy agreement; subsequently, they were evaluated in accordance with the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST).Each samplewas collected immediately following resection. Each sample was divided in half: one half was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin; the other half floated in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and was stored in liquid nitrogen until total RNA extraction. CEL files available for only 16/30 samples. Remaining CEL files have been lost.
