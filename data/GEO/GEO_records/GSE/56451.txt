TITLE
Fezf2 overexpression in murine cortical progenitors in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) are one specialized class of cortical excitatory neurons, which connect layer Vb of the cortex to the spinal cord. a master transcription factor –Forebrain expressed zinc finger 2 (Fezf2) – has been identified that is necessary for the fate specification of CSMN. Fezf2 alone can cell-autonomously instruct the acquisition of CSMN-specific features when expressed in diverse, permissive cellular contexts, in vivo. In order to understand the molecular logic underlying the acquisition of CSMN traits upon Fezf2 expression, we compared the in vivo gene expression of FACS-purified cortical progenitors that ectopically expressed Fezf2 to control progenitors.

DESIGN
We used in utero electroporation to deliver Fezf2GFP or CtrlGFP expression vectors to neocortical progenitors at E14.5, when they primarily generate CPN of the upper layers. Overexpression of Fezf2 in these progenitors is sufficient to instruct a fate-switch resulting in the generation of CSMN and other subtypes of corticofugal projection neurons. Fezf2GFP- and CtrlGFP -electroporated progenitors were FACS-purified at 24 and 48 hours after surgery and acutely profiled by microarrays.
