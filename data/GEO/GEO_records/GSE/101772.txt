TITLE
Fibroblast-specific genetic dissection of TGFβ-Smad2/3 signaling in cardiac fibrosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Overall goal: To elucidate fibroblast-specific role of TGFβ-Smad2/3 signaling in fibroblast activation and their differentiation to myofibroblasts. Purpose of analysis: To generate transcriptional profile of Smad2/3 and TGFβreceptors1/2-deficient fibroblasts in the context of pathological cardiac fibrosis.

DESIGN
Experimental structure: Transcriptional profile generated using RNAseq and differential gene expression analyses of fibroblasts lacking either Smad2/3 or TGFbreceptors1/2 fibroblasts isolated from stressed/diseased hearts.

PLATFORM
