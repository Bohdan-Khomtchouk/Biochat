TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of endothelial progenitor cells in multiple myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In multiple myeloma (MM), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) regulate tumor angiogenesis and disease progression. EPCs from 20 newly diagnosed patients with advanced MM were examined for genomic instability by RNA microarrays to assess changes in gene expression.

DESIGN
EPCs were derived from single-cell suspensions of bone marrow (BM) aspirates from newly diagnosed MM patients, and RNA was extracted for microarray hybridization.
