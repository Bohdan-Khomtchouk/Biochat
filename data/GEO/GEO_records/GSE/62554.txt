TITLE
Rare Allele of A Novel Histone H4 Acetyltransferase Enhances Grain Weight, Yield and Plant Biomass Presumably Through the Regulation of Transcription

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Grain weight is an important crop yield component; however, its underlying regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we identify a grain-weight quantitative trait locus (QTL) encoding a new-type GNAT-like protein that harbors intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (OsglHAT1). Our genetic and molecular evidences pinpointed the QTL-OsglHAT1â€™s allelic variations  to a 1.2-kilobase region upstream of the gene body, which is consistent with its function as a positive regulator of the traits. Elevated OsglHAT1 expression enhances grain weight and yield by enlarging spikelet hulls via increasing cell number and accelerating grain filling, and increases global acetylation levels of histone H4. OsglHAT1 localizes to the nucleus, where it likely functions through the regulation of transcription. Despite its positive agronomical effects on grain weight, yield and plant biomass, the rare allele elevating OsglHAT1 expression has so far escaped human selection. Our findings reveal the first example, to our knowledge, of a QTL for a yield component trait being due to a chromatin modifier that has the potential to improve crop high-yield breeding.

DESIGN
Two replicates of Nipponbare as control, three replicates of GW6a-4.6 substitution lines and three replicates of OsglHAT1-OE transgenic lines.
