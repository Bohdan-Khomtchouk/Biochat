TITLE
LAP2beta-induced change in gene expression in gastric cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knock-down or overexpression of LAP2beta regulated migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells in vivo and in vitro studies. To investigate the underlying mechanism for LAP2beta-regulated migration and invasion, we compared the gene expression changes between the mock cells and the stable cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was purified from the mock cells and the stable cells overexpressing LAP2beta
