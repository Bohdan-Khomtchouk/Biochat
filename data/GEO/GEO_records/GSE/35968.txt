TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of prebiotic uptake and catabolism by Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM

SUMMARY
The global transcriptome of the wild type Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM strain (NCK56) was measured during exponential growth on 11 prebiotic carbohydrates and glucose to identify the specific gene cluster differentially upregulated in response to each carbohydrate.

DESIGN
Oligoarray hybridization experiments were performed to compare the differential transcriptional profiles of the NCK56 at the early-log (OD600nm 0.3-0.5) phase when cultured in semi-synthetic medium (SSM, Barrangou et al., 2003 PNAS. 100:8957-8962, supplemented with a range of 1% (w/v) carbohydrates, at 37 Â°C and harvested by centrifugation and flash freezing.     A total of 12 NCK56 cultures were prepared by growing in SSM supplemented with each one of the 12 tested carbohydrates.  Each culture was grown in fresh carbohydrate supplemented SSM with a 1% inoculum from an overnight culture for a total of five subcultured passages. Aliquots of cells were collected at OD600nm of 0.3-0.5 (early log-phase) for total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Labeled cDNA samples from NCK56 were coupled with mono-reactive Cy3 and Cy5 dyes (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ),  for two technical replicates on each carbohydrate (e.g. cy3-GOS and cy5-GOS). Comparative hybridizations were performed on samples representing two different carbohydrate cultures at same growth phases labeled with either cy3 or cy5 using a loop design for 12 hybridizations.
