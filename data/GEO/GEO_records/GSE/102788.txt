TITLE
Adult parotid gland RNA-seq libraries, and embryonic submandibular gland RNA-seq libraries

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adult parotid gland RNA-seq libraries and embryonic submandibular gland RNA-seq libraries were created to examine the mRNA species present in these secretory glands, as part of a project to understand acinar glands in general.

DESIGN
For adult animals, each RNA-seq library was synthesized from parotid RNA of a single animal. For embryonic samples, each library was synthesized from submandibular gland RNA isolated from pools of dissected glands.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
