TITLE
Identification of transcript dysregulation in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to unveil the molecular mechanisms at play during the development of autistic brains, we studied cells that are representative of the very early stages of ontogenesis, namely stem cells. We used nasal olfactory stem cells that are readily accessible and can be biopsied safely. We recruited a relatively homogeneous cohort of nine adults with severe autism and low to very low developmental disabilities, and included two more adults with either Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism, to enlarge the spectrum. The cohort was then paired with 11 age- and gender-matched control individuals. Stem cells were purified, banked and used for a transcriptomic study.

DESIGN
Two-colors experiment. The cohort was then paired with 11 age- and gender-matched control individuals. Stem cells were purified, banked and used for a transcriptomic study. Validation by reverse transcription design.
