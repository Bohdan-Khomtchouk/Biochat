TITLE
Expression data from human (h-) growth hormone-treated and untreated chimeric mouse liver repopulated with human hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated h-hepatocyte chimeric mice with livers that were predominantly repopulated with h-hepatocytes in a h-growth hormone (GH)-deficient state. Using microarray profiles, comparison between h-hepatocytes from h-GH-treated and untreated mice identified 14 GH-up-regulated and four GH-down-regulated genes, including IGF-1, SOCS2, NNMT, IGFLS, P4AH1, SLC16A1, and SRD5A1, and FADS1 and AKR1B10, respectively.

DESIGN
The chimeric mice were treated or untreated with h-GH at 2.5 mg/kg b.w. /day for 2 weeks before sacrifice. Hepatocytes or liver tissue were isolated from the mouse livers and their cDNAs were used  for microarray analysis.
