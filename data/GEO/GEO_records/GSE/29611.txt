SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly ( ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track displays maps of chromatin state generated by the Broad/MGH ENCODE group using ChIP-seq. Chemical modifications (methylation, acetylation) to the histone proteins present in chromatin influence gene expression by changing how accessible the chromatin is to transcription. The ChIP-seq method involves first using formaldehyde to cross-link histones and other DNA-associated proteins to genomic DNA within cells. The cross-linked chromatin is subsequently extracted, mechanically sheared, and immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies. After reversal of cross-links, the immunoprecipitated DNA is sequenced and mapped to the human reference genome. The relative enrichment of each antibody-target (epitope) across the genome is inferred from the density of mapped fragments. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
