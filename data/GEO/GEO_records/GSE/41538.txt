TITLE
Transcript expression levels of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes mock-transfected, or transfected with cel-miR-67, hsa-miR-590-3p or hsa-miR-199a-3p

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the relevant targets of the selected miRNAs, we assessed global transcriptome changes by deep-sequencing total neonatal mouse cardiomyocyte RNA after transfection with hsa-miR-590-3p or hsa-miR-199a-3p

DESIGN
Four condition experiment; one replicate per condition; mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes transfected with cel-miR-67, hsa-miR-590-3p and hsa-miR-199a-3p; samples collected 72 hours after transfection

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
