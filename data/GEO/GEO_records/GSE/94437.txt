TITLE
Comprehensive analysis of gene expression in human retina and supporting tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: To identify the differences of gene expression between the macula and periphery of the eye. Methods: RNA Seq was performed on 8 normal postmortem eyes. Results: Significant differential expression was found between the layers of the posterior part of the eye and also between locations of a tissue layer. Conclusions: These results potentially provide a path to more rapidly elucidate not only the genetic basis of eye disease but also the impact of gene expression on molecular networks that in turn induce variations in disease associated traits.

DESIGN
Retinal and RPE/choroid/sclera RNA profiles from macula and periphery of each eye were generated by deep sequencing on an Illumina Hi-Seq. 32 biological samples were analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
