TITLE
Identification of genes involved in the cell growth arrest by knockout of BAG3 in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BAG3 (BCL2-associated athanogene 3) is a member of the BAG protein family. BAG3 affects a wide variety of cellular events including cell proliferation, apoptosis and autophagy. Recently our data demonstrated that knockout (KO) of BAG3 induces the cell growth arrest in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. In the present study, to identify genes involved in the cell growth arrest by BAG3-KO in HeLa cells, global-scale gene expression analysis was carried out using a GeneChip® system.

DESIGN
Human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa cells (wild type), and BAG3-KO HeLa cells (clone 1 and clone 2) were used. These cells were cultured in Eagle's Minimum Essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells, and quality of the RNA was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100. Gene expression was analyzed by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with a Human Genome U133-plus 2.0 array. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacturer’s instructions.
