TITLE
Agilent 244A aCGH array for comparison of lung tumor CNA to high-throughput sequencing data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
1 lung tumor was profiled for copy-number alterations with the high-resolution Agilent 244A aCGH Array.

DESIGN
One lung tumor sample were assayed on the Agilent Human Genome CGH 244A Microarrays with the intent of comparing the genomic alterations reported by the array platform with those reported by high-thoughput sequencing. Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.
