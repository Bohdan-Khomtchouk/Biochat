TITLE
The idiopathic preterm delivery methylation profile in umbilical cord blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation differences in umbilical cord blood  (UCB) of preterm and term born neonates. The Illumina 450K Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain the DNA methylation profiles of 12 preterm and 12 term UCB samples  across 450,000 CpGs. 2 samples were removed due to failed quality control, and BMIQ normalization was done with 11 preterm and 11 term samples.

DESIGN
The bisulphite converted DNA of 12 preterm and 12 term samples was subjected to whole genome amplification, fragmentation followed by hybridization on Illumina 450K Human methylation bead chip array.
