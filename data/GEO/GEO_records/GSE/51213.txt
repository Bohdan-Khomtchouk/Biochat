TITLE
Effect of chronic glucocorticoid (GC) treatment on neonatal mouse whole cerebellum and whole lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dexamethasone (1ug/g, Dex) or vehicle (saline) injected into postnatal days 0-7 (P0 to P7) of C57BL6J mouse pups every day. Whole organ were harvested at P7.

DESIGN
Biological replicates (n = 4) per condition: whole cerebellum or whole lung, treated with dexamethasone or vehicle. This microarray experiment was performed concurrently with the study described in PMID:19164857.  The culture and experiment designs in PMID:19164857 are identical to those in this microarray experiment. KEYWORDS: cell type comparison, treatment comparison.
