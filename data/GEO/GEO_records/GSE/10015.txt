TITLE
Expression data from rat tissues dosed with AMG A or AMG B

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To evaluate and characterize gene expression changes and toxicity following oral gavage administration of AMG A & AMG B in male Sprague Dawley rats. Keywords: dose response

DESIGN
This toxicogenomics study is designed to determine the toxicity and gene expression of AMG A and AMG B dosed orally daily (AMG A at 0mg/kg, 3mg/kg and 30 mg/kg and AMG B at 0mg/kg, 3mg/kg and 60mg/kg) for 1, 4 and 14 days. These doses are expected to produce mild and moderate changes in clinical pathology and histology associated with the pharmacologic antiangiogenic effect.
