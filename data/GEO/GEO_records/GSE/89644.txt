TITLE
The microbial functional diversity in response to warming incubation at Alaska as characterized by GeoChip

ORGANISM
soil metagenome

SUMMARY
Microbial decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) in Arctic permafrost is one of the most important, but poorly understood, factors in determining the greenhouse gas feedback of tundra ecosystems to climate. Here, we examine changes in the structure of microbial communities in an anoxic incubation experiment at either –2 or 8 °C for up to 122 days using both an organic and a mineral soil collected from the Barrow Environmental Observatory in northern Alaska, USA. Soils were characterized for SOC and geochemistry, and GeoChips 5.0 were used to determine microbial community structure and functional genes associated with C availability and Fe(III) reduction.

DESIGN
30 samples were collected under 10 conditions from Barrow, Alaska, with 3 replicates in each treatment

PLATFORM
GPL22652 Geochip 5.0
