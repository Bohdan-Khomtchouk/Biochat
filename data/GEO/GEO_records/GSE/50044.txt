TITLE
In situ synthesis of peptide microarrays - shadow mask design [2]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An experiment was designed to use a computer program to create lithography masks using a pseudo-random pattern generator.  The data in this file are results from immunosignaturing 8 different monoclonals using a 10,000 peptide random-sequence microarray.  Peptides were synthesized by Sigma Aldrich, and printed onto glass slides and used to test several different parameters.

DESIGN
One replicate of each peptide was printed on 1 CIM_10K_v2 peptide microarray. One microarray were tested for each sample. Image was qualified using in-house metrics for quality assurance.

PLATFORM
GPL17600 10K immunosignaturing peptide microarray version 2
