TITLE
Comparison of developmental stage transcripts in the K1 strain

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
To identify the developmentally regulated genes, which could confound identification of PN and CQ drug responsive genes, RNA samples from drug-free synchronized cultures from ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages were individually labelled and hybridized with a pooled sample from the three stages.  The data from this experiment were used to compare the developmental profile of the K1 strain with the data from other P. falciparum strains.

DESIGN
9 samples were obtained from three developmental stages of parasite development (3 each from ring, trophozoite and schizont synchronized parasites). Three independent cultures were obtained, synchronized on different days.
