TITLE
Spatial reorganization of telomeres in long-lived quiescent cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Two conditions experiment, ChIP-chip anti-Sir3 comparing Sir3 occupancy in exponentially growing S.cerevisiae cells to Sir3 occupancy in the dense fraction of 7 days YPD culture of S.cerevisiae

DESIGN
Two conditions experiment with biological duplicates. Both conditions were processed on the same array, duplicates have been carried separately
