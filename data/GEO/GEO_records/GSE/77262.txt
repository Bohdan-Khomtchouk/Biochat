TITLE
RNA-seq of mouse P19 half-life samples upon loss of UPF3A

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene duplication is a major evolutionary force driving adaptation and speciation, as it allows for the acquisition of new functions and can augment or diversify existing functions. Here, we report a gene duplication event that yielded another outcome – the generation of antagonistic functions. One product of this duplication event – UPF3B – is critical for the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway, while its autosomal counterpart – UPF3A – encodes an enigmatic protein previously shown to have trace NMD activity. Using loss-of-function approaches in vitro and in vivo, we discovered that UPF3A acts primarily as a potent NMD inhibitor that stabilizes hundreds of transcripts. Evidence suggests that UPF3A acquired repressor activity through simple impairment of a critical domain, a rapid mechanism that may have been widely used in evolution. Mice conditionally lacking UPF3A exhibit “hyper” NMD and display defects in embryogenesis and gametogenesis, consistent with UPF3A serving as a molecular rheostat that directs developmental events.
