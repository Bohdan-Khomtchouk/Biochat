TITLE
Microarray-based Gene Expression Analysis in the Silkworm Bombyx mori After Parasitization by Tachinid Flies

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
We identified genes regulated by parasitization of the silkworm Bombyx mori by three tachinid parasitoid species, Exorista japonica, Drino inconspicuoides and Pales pavida, using oligonucleotide microarrays. The numbers of genes and their intensity of expression varied with the species of parasitoid, within silkworm hemocytes and fat body.

DESIGN
Bombyx mori hemocyte, silkgland and fat body samples parasitizated by Exorista japonica, Drino inconspicuoides and Pales pavida were prepared. Gene expression was compared in these two groups: control and parasitized.
