TITLE
Control, low water potential (drought) stress and stress release transcriptome analysis of mutants impaired in proline (Delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase1-4; p5cs1-4) or abscisic acid (aba2-1) synthesis.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
mRNA sequencing was used to identify genes differentially expressed in  Delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase1-4 (p5cs1-4) mutants deficient in low water potential-induced proline accumulation and the Abscisic Acid (ABA) deficient mutant aba2-1 compared to Col-0 wild type.  Three treatments were analyzed for each genotype: unstressed control, a 96 hour low water potential (-1.2 MPa) treatment and a stress-release treatment where seedlings were removed from the stress treatment and transferred back to control media for 10 hours.  Approximately 100 genes were found to be significantly up-regulated in p5cs1-4 compared to wild type in both the control and stress treatments with an equal number down regulated.  There was also a substantial transcription response to the stress release treatment which varied between wild type, p5cs1-4 and aba2-1.

DESIGN
Wild type (Col-0), p5cs1-4 and aba2-1 Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were germinated on agar plates and after seven days of growth, seedlings were transferred either to fresh plates of control media or to low water potential (-1.2 MPa) stress plates.  Samples were collected 96 h after transfer (Control and stress treatments).  At 96 h, additional seedlings were transferred from the stress treatment back to control agar plates and samples collected 10 h after this stress release.  Three independent biological experiments and mRNA extractions were performed for each genotype/treatment (27 mRNA extractions.  After quality check and quantitation, the mRNA samples were pooled to produce a set of 9 samples for sequencing.
