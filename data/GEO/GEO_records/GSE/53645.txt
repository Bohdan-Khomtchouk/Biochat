TITLE
Expression data in human esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line KYSE150 with LOXL2 delta 72 over-expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have identified a new novel spliced variant of Lysyl Oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2), termed LOXL2 delta72, in human oesophageal carcinoma cells (ESCC). To explore the biological function of this variant, the cDNA microarrays was perform to assess the genes expression induced by its over-expression in ESCC KYSE150. We used microarrays to detail the global programmed of genes expression when LOXL2 delta72 over-expressed in KYSE150 cells compared with wild-type LOXL2.

DESIGN
KYSE 150 cells were transfected with vector, pcDNA3.1 LOXL2 WT or pcDNA3.1 LOXL2 delta72, respectively. After 48 hours transfection, RNA extractions were carried out, and the expressions of LOXL2 were examined by RT-PCR. The samples were sent to perfor hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
