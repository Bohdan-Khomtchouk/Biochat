TITLE
Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells by efficient reprogramming of adult bone marrow cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Reprogramming of somatic cells provides potential for the generation of specific cell types, which could be a key step in the study and treatment of human diseases. In vitro reprogramming of somatic cells into a pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cell–like state has been reported by retroviral transduction of murine fibroblasts using four embryonic transcription factors or through cell fusion of somatic and pluripotent stem cells. The generation of reprogrammed pluripotent cells using a somatic cell donor source such as bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood is of particular therapeutic interest because of the relative ease of harvesting these cell types. Here we show that mouse adult BM mononuclear cells（BM MNCs）are competent as donor cells and can be reprogrammed into pluripotent ES cell-like cells. We isolated BM MNCs and embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Oct4-EGFP transgenic mice, fused them with ES cells and infected them with retroviruses expressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Fused BM cells formed more ES-like colonies than did MEFs. Infected BM cells gave rise to iPS cells, although transduction efficiencies were not high. It was more efficient to pick up iPS colonies as compared with MEFs. BM-derived iPS (BM iPS) cells expressed embryonic stem cell markers, formed teratomas, and contributed to chimera mice with germline development. Clonal analysis revealed that BM iPS clones had diversity, although some clones were found to be genetically identical with different phenotypes. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the induction of pluripotent cells directly from hematopoietic tissue.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed in mouse BMMNCs, ES and BMMNC derived iPS cell lines.
