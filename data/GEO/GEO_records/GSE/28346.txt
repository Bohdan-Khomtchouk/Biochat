TITLE
SMAD3 ChIP-on-chip on A549 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to identify SMAD3 binding targets affected by the TGFb1/SMAD3 signal transduction on a genome-wide scale

DESIGN
Formaldehyde cross-linked, sonicated chromatin was prepared from non-stimulated A549 cell line and stimulated with TGFb1. Chromatin immunoprecipated with anti-SMAD3 antibody is labeled with Cy5 and mock IP (with anti-FLAG antibody) is labeled with Cy3 and co-hybridized on Agilent Human Promoter Set arrays. Two biological replicates were performed.
