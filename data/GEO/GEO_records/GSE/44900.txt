TITLE
Small RNA genes of Physcomitrella patens

ORGANISM
Physcomitrella patens

SUMMARY
Small RNA-seq from 10 day-old wild-type Physcomitrella patens was performed using 5 biological replicates. Replicates were grown in three batches at different times.  Batch 1 had one replicate from strain " old WT " , Batch 2 had two replicates from strain " old WT " , and batch 3 had two replicates from strain " 2009 WT " .  Old WT and 2009 WT were collected from Gransden wood, England; " old " has been in lab cultivation for at least 10 years, while " 2009 " was more recently collected from the wild (in 2009.)
