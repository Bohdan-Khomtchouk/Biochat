TITLE
Intestinal gene expression in 10-day Giardia duodenalis GS infected mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C57BL/6 mice were infected with the GS strain of G. duodenalis and total RNA prepared from the duodenum on day 10. Age matched controls were compared using Affy chips to determine changes in gene expression induced by infection. The majority of induced transcripts are invlved in antibody production. Genes exhibiting the greatest increase in expression are all mast cell transcripts.

DESIGN
This is a 4X4 comparison, 4 infected mice and 4 uninfected mice
