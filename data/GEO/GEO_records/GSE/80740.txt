TITLE
Investigation of ripk3-dependent IAV-induced genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ripk3-deficient fibroblasts and lung epithelial cells are resistant to influenza-induced cell deaths. However, Ripk3 is required for protection against influenza infection in vivo. Here, we examine the influenza-regulated gene expressions between wild type and knock out MEFs as well as an involvement of kinase activity if any.

DESIGN
Ripk3-/- or Ripk3+/+ MEFs treated with inhibitor of RIPK3 infected with PR8-Î”NS1 virus
