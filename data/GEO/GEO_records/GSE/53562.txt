TITLE
Time-series transcription microarray data of Streptomyces coelicolor M145

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
The present work aimed at providing noval reference genes (RGs) for streptomycetes by global quantitative analysis of gene expression profile. By using the time-series microarray data obtained in different culture medium (SMM in the present work and modified R5 from publication), the stably expressed genes of S. coelicolor were screened. Further statistical, bioinformatic and biological function analysis picked out 13 candidate RGs. According to qRT-PCR assays, 5 genes with high stability were selected and used for  validation in other streptomycetes to assess their prevalence. Additionally, the absolute gene expression level reflcted by RNA-seq was also taken into consideration in the present work to guide the appropriate RGs selection for streptomycetes.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of S. coelicolor M145 at different growth phases (exponential, transitional and stationary phase)
