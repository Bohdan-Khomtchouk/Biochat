TITLE
Effect of litter birth weight phenotype on transcriptomic response to swine influenza virus infection in pig lung

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in the lungs of pigs from high and low litter birth weight groups (HBW and LBW) inoculated with swine influenza virus. The aim of the experiment is to determine whether litter birth weight has an effect on the innate immune response to infection in pigs, and whether differences in gene expression can be linked to epigenetic differences between the two birth weight groups.

DESIGN
A two condition experiment: lung tissue RNA from HBW and LBW SIV-infected pigs. 16 biological replicates for each condition, each hybridized with a reference to separate arrays. 32 arrays in total.

PLATFORM
GPL15007 Agilent-026440 Sus scrofa (Pig) Oligo Microarray v2 (Feature Number version)
