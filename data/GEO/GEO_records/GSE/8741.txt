TITLE
DELLA protein direct targets in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to identify early DELLA protein-responsive genes using a Dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible system. Two transgenic lines were used: one induces the expression of a dominant, gibberellin non-responsive DELLA protein (rga-delta17); the other is a control line that carries the same vector, but lacks the rga-delta17 transgene. By comparing the gene expression changes in the line that expresses the rga-delta17 protein in the presence or absence of DEX it is possible to identify putative targets of DELLA proteins. An empty vector transgenic line was included in this study to identify genes that might be regulated by the DEX inducible system that are not dependent on the DELLA protein. Keywords: Dexamethasone treatment, gibberellin treatment, time course, transgene effect
