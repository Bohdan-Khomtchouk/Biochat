TITLE
Localization of Cdc7 Protein Kinase During DNA Replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Cdc7 kinase is known to initiate DNA replication, but it is unknown where Cdc7 is found within the genome.  We modified the Calling Cards method that uses the Ty5 retrotransposon to investigate Cdc7 binding in the genome.  The Ty5 retrotransposon is inserted into the genome by DNA transcription factors or replication factors binding within the genome.  We find that Cdc7 inserts Ty5 transposons throughout chromosomes and furthermore creates more Ty5 insertions into regions of DNA that are known to replicate early.  Cdc7 does not solely integrate Ty5 at origins or replication, but rather throughout the genome.

DESIGN
4 single read sequencing runs. All using Calling Cards to identify binding sites of cdc7kd, cdc7kdÎ”cterm and Gal4 transcription factor within the yeast genome.

PLATFORM
