TITLE
Systems level analyses establish CodY as a multifaceted metabolic regulator integrating metabolism, motility and virulence in Listeria monocytogenes [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
To gain knowledge on L. monocytogenes differential CodY activity, we set on analyzing CodYâ€™s regulon in L. monocytogenes in both rich and minimal growth conditions using genome wide sequencing techniques. Remarkably, we identified for the first time a global regulatory role for CodY when BCAAs are limited, that are similar to those within the mammalian niche. Furthermore, our data establish CodY as a central regulator that integrates metabolism, motility, stress responses and virulence in L. monocytogenes.

DESIGN
Examination of CodY regulon in rich and minimal conditions.
