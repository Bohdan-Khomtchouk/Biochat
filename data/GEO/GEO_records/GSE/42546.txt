TITLE
Whole transcriptome analysis of postmortem human hippocampus dentate gyrus granlule cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the transcriptome of dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells in postmortem hippocampus from 79 subjects with mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression) or non-psychiatric controls.

DESIGN
Material for RNA-seq analysis was harvested from tissue slides using laser capture microdissection (LCM) and aRNA amplification. Equimolar amounts of triplicate aRNA samples for each of the 79 subjects were then pooled for the preparation of sequencing libraries. Sequencing libraries were prepared using Applied Biosystem's Total RNA Sequencing Kit, following the directions for Whole Transcriptome Libraries, and analyzed with an Applied Biosystems SOLiD 4 high-throughput sequencer. We compared the performance of different normalization methods (length normalization vs. noise reductin scaling), and assembled evidence for dysruption of signaling by the micro RNA miR-182 in subjects with major depression and schizophrenia.
