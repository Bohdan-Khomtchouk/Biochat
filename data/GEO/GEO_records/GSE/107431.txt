TITLE
Small RNA deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
33 miRNAs significantly decreased and 75 miRNAs significantly increased in BCR-ABL+ LSK compared with BCR-ABL- LSK cells, suggesting distinct BCR-ABL-dependent mechanisms of microRNA regulation.

DESIGN
LSK cells from non-induced and induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) mice were sorted and total RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Small RNA sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq2500 at the COH Integrative Genomics Core following the manufacturer's sample preparation protocol (TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep kit, Illumina, Inc.) with some modifications.

PLATFORM
