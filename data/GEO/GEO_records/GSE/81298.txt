TITLE
Identification of Kdm4a, b and c target genes in MLL-AF9 transformed mouse GMPs (L-GMP) [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we identify genes, that are deregulated in Kdm4a, b and c triple knockout L-GMP cells compared WT L-GMP cells.

DESIGN
Four MLL-AF9 transformed L-GMP cell lines conditional knockout for Kdm4a, b and c, were derived from leukemic mice.  The cells were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen and total RNA was prepared from 0h, 48h and 96h time points.
