TITLE
Heparins treated human breast cancer MCF-7 cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To inquire the a possible mechanism for heparin treatment improved cancer survival, three type of heparins: one standard heparin (unfractionated heparin (UFH), and two of  low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) Fragmin and Clexane were used to treat cell for 24 hours. Total RNA was used for cDNA Microarray assay.

DESIGN
Untreated cells were used as controls. Cell were treated by three type of heparins one standard heparin (unfractionated heparin (UFH), and two of  low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) Fragmin and Clexane (40 IU/ml for each) were used to treat cell for 24 hours.  Triplicate samples were prepared.
