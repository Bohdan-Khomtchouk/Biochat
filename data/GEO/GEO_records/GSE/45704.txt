TITLE
Expression data from FDC-induced myeloid cells (FDMCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We observed that follicular dendritic cell line induced a new type of CD11b+ myeloid cells (FDMCs) when cultured with a lineage-negative c-kit+ population from mouse spleen cells. Thus, we used microarrays to characterize gene expression of FDMCs.

DESIGN
FDMCs were induced on FDC line for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Microarray data of " FDC-induced myeloid cells (FDMCs) " sample were combined with a large collection of other cell- and tissue-specific gene expression data sets (total: 205 individual data sets).  Raw data (.cel) files were normalized using Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA Express; http://rmaexpress.bmbolstad.com/ ), annotated using the latest libraries available from Affymetrix, and arranged according to cell-type grouping.
