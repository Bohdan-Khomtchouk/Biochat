TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Wnt effector Tcf7l2/Tcf4 occupancy in oligodendrocyte during CNS myelination

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide profiling of Tcf7l2 occupancy during oligodendrocyte differentiation and identified the  key enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism and essential for CNS myelination.

DESIGN
Examination of Tcf7l2 chIP-seq in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell and 2 differentiation oligodendrocytes.
