TITLE
Expression data from Smad3 knockout embryonic stem cells and wild type embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
smad3 is the central component of TGF-beta pathway. We examined the role of Smad3 in ES cell differentiation and teratoma formation. In this data set, we include expression data from Smad3 knockout ES cell and wild type ES cells.

DESIGN
total 2 samples.
