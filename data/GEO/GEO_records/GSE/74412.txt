TITLE
Expression data from the process of chilling stress causing Alternaria alternata infection and leading to cotton leaf senescence

ORGANISM
Gossypium barbadense

SUMMARY
Cotton premature leaf senescence often occurred with an increasing frequency in many cotton growing areas and caused serious reduction in yield and quality of cotton has been one of the impontant factors that restrict severely the production of cotton.Our laboratory studies showed chilling stress is the key factor that induced A. alternatia infection, caused Alternaria disease and then lead to cotton leaf senescence, but the molecular mechanism of cotton premature leaf senscence is still unclear. We used microarrays to study molecular mechanism of chilling stress causing Alternaria alternata infection and leading to cotton leaf senescence and find the key genes during this process.
