TITLE
Integrated analysis of genetic, behavioral, and biochemical data implicates neural stem cell-induced changes in immunity, neurotransmission and mitochondrial function in Dementia with Lewy Body mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We previously demonstrated that transplantation of murine neural stem cells (NSCs) can improve motor and cognitive function in a transgenic model of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB).  The underlying neurobiology that mediates such restoration no doubt involves numerous genes acting in concert to modulate signaling within and between host brain cells and transplanted NSCs. In order to identify functionally connected gene networks and additional mechanisms that may contribute to stem cell-induced benefits, we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on striatal tissue isolated from NSC- and vehicle-injected wild-type and DLB mice. WGCNA is proved to be a powerful approach; revealing significant alterations in immune response, neurotransmission, and mitochondria function in response to NSC treatment.

DESIGN
Age- and sex-matched transgenic mice over-expressing human wild-type alpha-synuclein (PDGF-Î²-ASO line D, ASO) and wild-type littermates maintained on a congenic C57B6/J background were examined. Hippocampal/cortical GFP-expressing mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) were microdissected from syngeneic GFP-transgenic mice at postnatal day 1 and transplanted at passage 15. Wild-type (WT) and transgenic littermates (ASO) were randomly divided into groups and received intrastriatal injections of either saline (Veh) or haplotype-matched NSCs. The combination of genotype and treatment resulted in four experimental groups: WT-Veh, WT-NSC, ASO-Veh, ASO-NSC. After one month of treatment, all animals were sacrificed and total RNA extracted from microdissected striatum.Then, RNA was processed and subjected to WGCNA analysis.
