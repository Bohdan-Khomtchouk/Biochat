TITLE
Arabidopsis inflorescence stems: upper flanks vs lower flanks after gravi-stimulation at 10 min and 30 min

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of upper flanks and lower flanks of Arabidopsis inflorescence stems after gravistimulation. Candidate genes which were up-regulated in the lower flanks relative to the upper falanks after gravi-stimulation at 30 min were identified.

DESIGN
Two time-points experiments, at 10 min and 30 min. Biological replicates: 2 replicates for each experiments (as color swapped data)

PLATFORM
GPL888 Agilent-011839 Arabidopsis 2 Oligo Microarray G4136A (Feature Number version)
