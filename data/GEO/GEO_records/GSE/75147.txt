TITLE
RNA splicing alteration on glioblastoma and normal neural stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified PHF5A as a functional synthetic-lethal hit in glioblastoma stem cells compared to normal neural stem cells. We wanted to perform analysis of RNA isoforms present in glioblastoma or normal neural stem cells with or without PHF5A depletion. We performed shRNA knockdown of PHF5A or used non-silencing shRNA as a control, selected infected cells with puromycin, and isolated RNA for sequencing.

DESIGN
We analyzed RNA from either normal neural stem cells or two different glioblastoma specimens aster either control knockdown, or two different shRNA sequences against the PHF5A gene transcript.
