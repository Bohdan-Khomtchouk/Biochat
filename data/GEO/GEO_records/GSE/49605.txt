TITLE
Screening for novel immungenic proteins of Salmonella Enteritidis 125109

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The screening of a cDNA derived expression library of Salmonella Enteritidis 125109 expressed in E. coli using a fusion construct and specific HaloTag interaction to a modified surface is shown. Thus, 1536 different clones were screened including positive (fimA) and negative (argC, gapA) reference proteins. The goal of the screening was to identify potential novel immunogenic proteins from S. Enteritidis by selecting clones showing a high signal intensity in comparison to the known antigens used as positve markers. Afterwards, the most promising clones were sequenced to identify the gene and corresponding protein and these proteins were then investigated further. Consequently, 9 novel immunogenic proteins could be identified.
