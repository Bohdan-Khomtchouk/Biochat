TITLE
Mesenchymal stromal cell transcriptome study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomes of mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow (bmMSC) were compared to MSC from term placenta (pMSC). Cells were expanded under GMP-compliant conditions. The transcriptome was explored to compare the regenerative potential of bmMSCs and pMSCs in a pre-clinical and eventually in a clinical context

DESIGN
25 samples, 11 bone marrow (no replicates) from male and female donors, 14 healthy human term placentas from planned cesareans. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
