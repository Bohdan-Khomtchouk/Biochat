TITLE
Expression data from murine follicular dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Germinal centers (GCs) are clusters of activated B cells built on stromal cells known as follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). In the Peyer’s patches (PPs), GCs are chronically induced by bacteria and are the major sites for generation of gut IgA immune responses. Whether FDCs directly contribute to the IgA production in PP GCs is unknown. To investigate the role FDCs in gut immune system, we examined comprehensive gene profiles of FDCs purified from PPs or perypheral lymph nodes (pLNs) with or without immunization. We also tried to reconstitute the PP FDC signature in vitro by pulsed or continuous stimulation of pLN FDCs through TLRs, RARs or simultaneously through TLRs and RARs.

DESIGN
The number of samples is as follows; ex vivo naïve pLN FDC=3, ex vivo immunized pLN FDC=2, ex vivo PP FDCs=3, in vitro without stimulation=2, in vitro with LPS stimulation for 5 hours=1, in vitro with LPS stimulation for 72h=1, in vitro with Pam2CSK4 (Pam) stimulation for 96h=2, in vitro with retinoic acid(RA) stimulation for 96h=2,in vitro with RA+Pam stimulation for 96h=2. In addition, ex vivo FDCs with or without immunizations were compared (3 samples), or in vitro cultured FDCs with or without various stimulations were compared (6 samples)
