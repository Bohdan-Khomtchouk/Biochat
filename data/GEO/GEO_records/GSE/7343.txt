TITLE
Dicer conditional knockout embryonic heart mutant vs control array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal is to find out the gene expression changes when Dicer was inactivated in the murine heart. Keywords: Dicer mutant

DESIGN
Dicer gene was specifically inactivated in the mouse heart using cardiac specific Nkx2.5 Cre knock-in line. Embryonic day 11.5 heart from mutant and control hearts were  compared in triplicates.
