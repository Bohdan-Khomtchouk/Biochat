TITLE
Identification of candidate genes for processing quality for good chapatti (flat unleavened bread)

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Gene-specific two-way ANOVA analysis for identification of candidate genes for processing quality, seed development, and interaction (quality x development)

DESIGN
Gene expression data of two good chapatti making varieties, C306 and Lok1 and two poor chapatti making varieties, sonalika and WH291 at three seed development stages (7, 14, and 28 days after anthesis) were analyzed using gene-specific two-way ANOVA to partition variation in gene expression due to quality, seed development, and their interaction (quality x development).
