TITLE
UTX/KDM6A Loss Enhances the Malignant Phenotype of Multiple Myeloma and Sensitizes Cells to EZH2 inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this project we analyze the transcriptome of the human multiple myeloma isogenic cell lines ARP-1 (UTX wild-type) and ARD (UTX null). The transcriptome is studied at baseline, upon restoration of UTX levels in ARD cells for 3 and 6 days, and upon treatment of the cell lines with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK343. Moreover, we analyzed the transcriptome of a ARD resistant cell line that we generated.

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptome of two cell lines upon restoration of UTX and treatment with EZH2 inhibitors

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
