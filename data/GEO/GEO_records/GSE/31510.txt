TITLE
Host cell gene expression in Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) infected MDCK cells at 10 hour post infection

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
We used the microarray data to analyze host cells response on MDCK cells infected with A/WSN/33 (H1N1)

DESIGN
A/WSN/33 (H1N1) infected MDCK cells were harvested at 10 hpi and RNA extraction was performed using standard protocol as described by Affymetrix. The aim of this experiment is to analyze host response to Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) infection.
