TITLE
Impact of pre-analytical handling on neuroblastoma cells mRNA gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analyses of disseminated tumor cells can provide indispensable biological and clinical information at diagnosis, during therapy and at relapse. So far, however, disseminated tumor cells expression analyses have been hampered by insufficient infiltration rates and/or unclear consequences of transport duration, temperature and other pre-handling procedures. This study, using neuroblastoma as a model, focuses on the influences of pre-analytical procedures like tumor cell enrichment, transport time and temperature on the disseminated tumor cells expression profile.
