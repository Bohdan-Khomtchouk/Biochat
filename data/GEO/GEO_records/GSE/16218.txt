TITLE
Mapping Replication Fork Pause Sites in S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Replication forks face multiple obstacles that slow their progression. By two-dimensional gel analysis, yeast forks pause at stable DNA protein complexes, and this pausing is greatly increased in the absence of the Rrm3 helicase. We used a genome wide approach to identify 96 sites of very high DNA polymerase binding in wild type cells. Most of these binding sites were not previously identified pause sites. Rather, the most highly represented genomic category among high DNA polymerase binding sites was the open reading frames (ORFs) of highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes. Twice as many pause sites were identified in rrm3 compared to wild type cells as pausing in this strain occurred at both highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes and the previously identified protein DNA complexes. ORFs of highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes are the first class of natural pause sites that are not exacerbated in rrm3 cells. We alse mapped pause sites using a second replication fork component, Rrm3-13MYC and got similar results.

DESIGN
Genomic input (labelled with Cy3) and IP'ed DNA (labelled with Cy5) using a MYC Ab of either DNA Pol2-13MYC or Rrm3-MYC from asynchronously grown S. cerevisiae cells in rich media were hybridized to whole-genome PCR-based arrays containing ORF and intergenic regions of the entire genome (Ivery et al 2001). At least three biological replication and one technical replicate (dye swap) were performed. Log2 transformed median normalized ratios (IP/IN) were averaged for each experiment and significant peaks of either DNA Pol2 or Rrm3 association were identified
