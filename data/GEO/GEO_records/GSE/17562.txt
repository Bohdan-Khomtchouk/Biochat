TITLE
Campylobacter jejuni murine adaptation: unadapted v. adapted

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni NCTC 11168 = ATCC 700819

SUMMARY
Expression arrays comparing Campylobacter jejuni 11168 before and after serial passage in C57 BL/6 IL-10 deficient mice.  Gene expression was compared during exponential growth in Bolton broth.

DESIGN
Unpassaged (p0) C. jejuni 11168 was compared to the same strain after 1 passage (p1) and after three passages (p3) through the mice.  Biological replicates: 4 for p0 v. p1, 3 for p0 v. p3
