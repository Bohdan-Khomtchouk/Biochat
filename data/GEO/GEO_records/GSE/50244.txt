TITLE
Global transcriptomic analysis of human pancreatic islets reveals novel genes influencing glucose metabolism [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we harnessed the potential of RNA sequencing in 89 human pancreatic islet donors to identify genes and exons regulated in this relevant tissue for T2D.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 89 human pancreatic islet donors having different levels of blood glucose (HbA1c) with and without T2D. The data was generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000.

PLATFORM
