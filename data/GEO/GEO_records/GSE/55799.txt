TITLE
Expression data from  Arabidopsis wild type and cdm1 young floral buds

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used microarray analysis to examine transcriptomic changes in cdm1 mutant, identifying genes potentially regulated by CDM1 by comparing gene expression between cdm1 and wild type young floral buds. Among 375 genes that showed differential expression (P-value < 0.05) with > 1.5-fold changes between wild type and cdm1, 185 genes were down-regulated by 1.5 to 7.10-folds, whereas 190 genes were up-regulated by 1.5 to 5.82-folds.

DESIGN
Wild type and cdm1 young floral buds were used to isolate total RNA, with two biological replicates for each. Microarray analysis was performed using 500ng of total RNA per sample as described in the Genechip Expression Analysis Technical Manual.
