TITLE
Effect of Th-POK deficiency on global gene expression in liver Va14i NKT cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to identify genes regulated by the transcription factor Th-POK (Zbtb7b) in liver Va14i NKT cells, by RNA microarray analysis of global gene expression in Va14i NKT cells from mice homozygous for the Th-POK-inactivating hd point mutation as compared with the same cell population isolated from heterozygous or wild-type age-matched mice.

DESIGN
Two sample set pairs of hd/hd and either hd/+ or +/+ age-matched Va14i NKT cells were prepared via magnetic selection and cell sorting, and total RNA prepared using a Qiagen Rneasy mini kit.  IVT probe generation and hybridization to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays was carried out by the Veterans Medical Research Foundation GeneChipTM Microarray located at UCSD.
