TITLE
Comparison of transciptome of hiPS-MSC versus MSC (2D culture) and  analyze regulated trascripts during differentiation of hiPS-MSC and MSC on a 3D scaffold

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data from hiPS lines after commitment towards mesenchymal lineage (hiPS-MSC) and expression data of mesenchymal lines (MSC), used as positive control of commitment. Following this, hiPS-MSC and MSC are seeded on scaffold to differentiate in a ligamentous (middle) and osseous (edges) part  (post 21 days 3D differentiation) We used microarrays to validate efficient commitment of hiPS to generate hiPS-MSC and do whole transcriptome comparison of hiPS-MSC vs isolated MSC (positive control) and then compare the enhanced biological functions after differentiation of these cells on a scaffold

DESIGN
3 different hiPSMSC lines and 3 independent MSC isolated populations were selected (before and after seeding and differentiating on the scaffold) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to validate that the regulated trascriptomes of hiPS-MSC are highly similar to isolated primary MSC
