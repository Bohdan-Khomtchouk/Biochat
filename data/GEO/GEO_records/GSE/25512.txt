ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida KT2440

SUMMARY
Our first aim was understand whole genome expression dynamics of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 surface colonies under water stress. Therefore, we wanted to identify significantly differentially expressed genes of at -0.4 MPa matric potential relative to the -0.5 kPa (near saturation condition) at different stress durations. Aliquots of overnight grown P. putida KT2440 cells were inoculated (approx. 100 Âµl and 1x107 cells) on the surface of ceramic plates. Prior to matric stress, the cells were incubated for 120, 116, 96, and 48 hr at-0.5 kPa to allow formation of a mature cell loan. -0.4 MPa matric potential was applied for the last 0 (control), 4, 24, and 72 hr of incubation periods, respectively, so that the total incubation time (at (-0.5 kPa) and (-0.4 MPa)) was kept constant as 5 days. Our second aim was to find out how the gene expression profile would change when we use PEG-8000 to simulate matric stress. To that effect, similar incubations were performed where the direct matric potential was -0.5 kPa, but supplemented with PEG-8000 to set a matric potential equivalent of -0.5 or -1.0 MPa. Incubations were again 5 days. In addition, we tested the effect of gas pressure on gene expression profile of cells in liquid medium.  20 ml of overnight grown KT2440 cells were exposed to 0.4 MPa (gauge) and 0.1 MPa (atmospheric) pressures.
