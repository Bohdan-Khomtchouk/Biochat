TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 Response to L-Glutamate or D-Arginine

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Arginine utilization in Pseudomonas aeruginosa with multiple catabolic pathways represents one of the best examples of metabolic versatility of this organism. To identify genes of this complex arginine network, we employed DNA microarray to analyze the transcriptional profiles of this organism in response to L-arginine. While most genes in arginine uptake, regulation and metabolism have been identified as members of the ArgR regulon in our previous study, eighteen putative transcriptional units of 38 genes including the two known genes of the arginine dehydrogenase (ADH) pathway, kauB and gbuA, were found inducible by exogenous L-arginine but independent of ArgR.
