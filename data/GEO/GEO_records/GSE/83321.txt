TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Analysis of control and DEHP exposure HepG2 cell Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we treated the HepG2 cells with low concentration or control solvent for a long time. Then we extracted the RNAs and performed the next generation sequencing. By comparing sequcing data from control and DEHP treated samples, we profiled the gene expression regulated by low concentration exposure.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells mRNA profiles of Control and DEHP treated samples were generated by deep sequencing, using ABI Ion Proton.
