TITLE
Exon expression for NCI small cell lung cancer cell line panel

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characterization of 63 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines and a comparator set of non-small cell lung cancer and normal counterpart cells, including drug sensitivity testing, gene expression profiling and microRNA expression profiling have been completed. Data and tools for searching these data will be made publicly available through the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program at SCLC is an aggressive, recalcitrant cancer and have seen limited treatment advances in the last 30 years. Drug sensitivity data coupled with the transcription and microRNA profiles of a cohort of SCLC cell lines may help define novel treatment paradigms.

DESIGN
For each cell line, exon expression was measured using Genechip Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays from Affymetrix, to provide comprehensive coverage of the entire genome at the exon and gene expression level.
