TITLE
Response to low dose ionizing radiation in male mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Male mice 10-14 weeks of age were exposed in vivo to 10 rad X-ray.  The objective is to extract information on gene networks from the microarray data. Keywords: Ionizing radiation

DESIGN
Control mice were sham-exposed.  Spleen was harvested 3.5 hrs post-irradiation.  Each hybridization consists of one control mouse and one exposed mouse randomly paired to form a biological replicate.  Each biological replicate was hybridized in duplicate, incorporating a dye swap to control for dye-specific effects.
