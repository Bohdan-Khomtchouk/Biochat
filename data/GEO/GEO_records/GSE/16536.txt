TITLE
Using pooled earthworm RNA to test 244K probes on TA-1 test array design 2520022 sense 1

ORGANISM
Eisenia fetida

SUMMARY
To validate the 244K 60-mer probes using a custom-designed Agilent oligo array and assuming sense orientation of all target sequences.

DESIGN
A total of four test arrays were designed assuming both sense and antisense orientations. A sole pooled RNA was used for testing all 4 designs. Two arrays were hybridized for each design. This series contains test results for design 2520022.

PLATFORM
GPL8680 Eisenia fetida 244K oligo test array version 1
