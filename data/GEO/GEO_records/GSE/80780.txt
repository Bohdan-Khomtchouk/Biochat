TITLE
Human islets contain four distinct subtypes of Î² cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptomes of four subpopulations of beta cells isolated by FACS from five healthy human donors. Populations were defined using cell surface-labeling antibodies, avoiding the need for fixation.

DESIGN
There are 5 biological replicates of 4 different cell types.   Each donor yielded all 4 subtypes.
