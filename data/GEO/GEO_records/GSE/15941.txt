TITLE
DNA packaging of Murine spermatozoal chromatin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During mammalian spermiogenesis, the majority of the nucleosomes packaging the male haploid genome are replaced by protamines to produce a highly compact chromatin architecture that is critical to male fertility. We have carried out a genomewide survey of murine spermatozoal chromatin using a  micrococal nuclease approach to characterise the DNA sequences that remain packaged by histones.

DESIGN
Limited digestion with micrococcal nuclease facilitates the release of a nucleosome-rich chromatin from mature spermatozoa. Whole genome CGH arrays were used to map the histone and protamine bound portions of spermatozoal DNA.
