TITLE
Genome-wide nucleosome, histone and Pol II maps for wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae induced with 3-aminotriazole (3AT)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Paired-end sequencing study of (1) nucleosome core particles and under-digested chromatin from MNase-treated nuclei; (2) ChIP samples for HA-tagged histone H4 and H2B; (3) ChIP for the Rpb3 subunit of Pol II.

DESIGN
Nucleosomal DNA and immunopurified sonicated DNA fragments were subjected to paired-end sequencing.

PLATFORM
