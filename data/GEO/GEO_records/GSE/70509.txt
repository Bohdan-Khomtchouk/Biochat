TITLE
Toxicogenomic responses of Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to  sulfidized silver nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We assessed the whole genome response of C. elegans exposed for 48 hours from L1 to the pristine silver nanomterials, artifically aged silver nanomatierls, and AgNO3.

DESIGN
Single time point RNA extraction from a population of 2000-3000 nematodes exposed to the EC30 for reproduction.

PLATFORM
GPL200 [Celegans] Affymetrix C. elegans Genome Array
