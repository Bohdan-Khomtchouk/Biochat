TITLE
ChIP-chip from Candida albicans cells with GFP-LYS142, GFP-LYS143, GFP-LYS14, and GFP-LYS144

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
LYS142, LYS143, LYS14 and LYS144 compose a family of recently duplicated transcription regulators in C. albicans. They have differentiated from one another by acquiring a largely separate set of target genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of GFP-LYS142, GFP-LYS143, GFP-LYS14 and GFP-LYS144 followed by array hybridization (Agilent) uncovered a network of target genes controlled by these regulators in the yeast C. albicans.

DESIGN
Comparison of IP/input in tagged strains to untagged cells immunoprecipitated with the same antibody.

PLATFORM
