TITLE
Transcription factor activating protein 2 beta (TFAP2B) mediates noradrenergic neuronal differentiation in neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Single-color gene expression profiles from IMR-32 neuroblastoma cell lines were generated using 44K oligonucleotide microarrays. To gain insights into the molecular processes occurring upon TFAP2B re-expression, we performed gene expression measurements in TFAP2B and GFP expressing transgenic IMR-32 neuroblastoma cell lines at d2 and d7 of transgene induction.

DESIGN
Single-color gene expression profiles from IMR-32 neuroblastoma cell lines were generated using 44K oligonucleotide microarrays. Total RNA of TFAP2B- and GFP-expressing IMR-32 cells was isolated at day 2 and day 7 using Trizol.
