TITLE
Loss of MBNL Leads to Disruption of Developmentally Regulated Alternative Polyadenylation in RNA-Mediated Disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mapping MBNL-regulated genome-wide alternative polyadenylation: We report that depletion of Mbnl proteins in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), DM mouse model quadriceps muscle, and DM-autopsy muscle tissue leads to mis-regulation of alternative polyadenylation

DESIGN
We compared WT, Mbnl1/2KO, Mbnl1/2KO/3siRNA, and Mbnl1/2KO/scrambled siRNA MEFs (n=2 for each group) to evaluate alternative polyadenylation shifts that occur due to progressive loss of Mbnl proteins. We also compared WT (1 day old, and 4 months old, n=2 each) and HSALR mouse model (4 months old, n=2) of myotonic dystrophy for developmental alternative polyadenylation defects in myotonic dystrophy. Finally, we compared control and DM1 autopsy muscle tissues (n=3) for changes in alternative polyadenylation. We performed HITS-CLIP analysis of binding sites of Mbnl1, Mbnl2 and Mbnl3 in MEFs (n=3 each). We also performed HITS-CLIP analysis for major skeletal muscle Mbnl protein, Mbnl1 in FVB WT adult muscle (4 months, n=3). Finally we performed HITS-CLIP analysis for CPSF6 in WT and Mbnl1/2 KO MEFs (n=3 each) Please note that the 'readme_Table.txt' describes the contents of 'Table S*.xlsx' files, and the readme_method.txt include additional details about experiemenal procedures.
