TITLE
Genome-wide maps of REST and its cofactors in mouse E14 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for REST and its cofactors genome wide binding sites in E14 cells.We then combine these binding sirtes with REST regulating gene profiling, to understand REST binding and regulation in E14 cells.

DESIGN
Examination of REST and 5 cofactors(RCOR1, RCOR2,RCOR3,SIN3A,SIN3B) in E14 cells, REST and SIN3A endogenous antibody were used for ChIP experiment. The stable E14 cells expressing low level exogenous RCOR1, RCOR2, RCOR3,and SIN3B with V5 tag were used for ChIP experiment with V5 antibody to obtain individual ChIP DNA.

PLATFORM
