TITLE
Long-term administration of nicotinamide mononucleotide mitigates age-associated physiological decline in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NAD+ availability decreases with age and in certain disease conditions.  Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a key NAD+ intermediate, has been shown to enhance NAD+ biosynthesis and ameliorate various pathologies in mouse disease models.  In this study, we conducted a 12 month-long NMN administration to regular chow-fed wild-type C57BL/6N mice during their normal aging.  Orally administered NMN was quickly utilized to synthesize NAD+ in tissues.  Remarkably, NMN effectively mitigates age-associated physiological decline in mice.  Without any obvious toxicity or deleterious effects, NMN suppressed age-associated body weight gain, enhanced energy metabolism, promoted physical activity, improved insulin sensitivity and plasma lipid profile, and ameliorated eye function and other pathophysiologies.  Consistent with these phenotypes, NMN prevented age-associated gene expression changes in key metabolic organs and enhanced mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and mitonuclear protein imbalance in skeletal muscle.  These effects of NMN highlight the preventive and therapeutic potential of NAD+ intermediates as effective anti-aging interventions in humans.

DESIGN
To evaluate anti-aging effects of NMN on molecular events, we conducted microarray analyses and compared global gene expression profiles in key metabolic organs including skeletal muscle, WAT, and the liver between 6- and 12-month time points in each group of control and 300 mg/kg/day NMN-administered mice.
