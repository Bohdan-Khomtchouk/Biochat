TITLE
Global gene expression profile of small intestine from wild-type and NHE2-knockout mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify changes in gene expression levels between wild-type and NHE2-knockout small intestine.

DESIGN
8 wild-type and 8 NHE2-knockout small intestine RNA samples were compared.  Total RNA was collected from both male and female 8-week old wild-type and NHE2-null mice on an inbred FVB\N background. All comparisons were done between wild-type and NHE2-null samples from age- and gender-matched mice. NHE2 Small Intestine Arrays Cy3 253 +/+  male 262 +/+  male 265 +/+  female 274 +/+  female 231 -/-  female 292 -/-   male 296 -/-   female 299 -/-   female Cy5 247 -/-   male 263  -/-  male 264 -/-   female 275 -/-  female 229 +/+    female 290 +/+  male 295 +/+  female 302 +/+   female
