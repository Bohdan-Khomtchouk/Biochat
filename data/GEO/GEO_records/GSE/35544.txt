TITLE
Root nitrate response of Ws plants and afb3-1 mutant plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Auxin is a key phytohormone regulating central processes in plants that include embryo development, lateral root growth and flower maturation among others. Auxin is sensed by a set of F-Box proteins of the TIR1/AFB3 family triggering auxin dependent responses by a pathway that involves an interplay between the Aux/IAA transcription repressors and the ARF transcription factors. We have previously shown that the AFB3 auxin receptor has a specific role in coordinating primary and lateral root growth to external and internal nitrate availability (Vidal et al., 2010). In this work, we used an integrated genomics, bioinformatics and molecular genetics approach to dissect regulatory networks acting downstream AFB3 that are activated by a transient nitrate treatment in Arabidopsis roots.  Our systems approach unraveled key components of the AFB3 regulatory network leading to changes in lateral root growth in response to nitrate.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis seedlings of the Ws and afb3-1 genotypes were grown on hydroponic medium containing 1X MS salts without Nitrogen, supplemented with 0.5 mM ammonium succinate as Nitrogen source and 3 mM sucrose on a Percival chamber under a photoperiod of 16 hours of light (100 μE/m2/sec) and 8 hours of dark at 22°C for 14 days. The plants were treated at the onset of the light cycle with 5 mM KNO3 or 5 mM KCl as control for 2 hours. Whole roots were cut from seedlings and frozen on liquid Nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using the TriZol reagent. 3 independent biological replicates were performed.
