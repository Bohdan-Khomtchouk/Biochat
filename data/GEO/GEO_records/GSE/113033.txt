TITLE
Gene expression profiling of novel hematopoietic stem cell subpopulations defined by CD35 expression and progenitor populations in human adult hematopoiesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cannonical hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population is phenotypically defined as Lin- CD34+ CD38- CD45RA- CD90+ in human adult bone marrow. We recently identified novel HSC subpopulation defined as CD35+ HSCs. We performed microarray analysi to clarify the characteristics of CD35+ HSCs in comparison with other stem/progenitor populations. As compared to CD35- HSCs and progenitor populations, CD35+ HSCs showed lower expression of cell-cycle- or lineage-affiliated genes.suggesting their dormant or immature state.

DESIGN
To undertake gene expression profiling of the newly identified HSC and other stem/progenitor populations, we purified target populations by FACS Aria III. Extracted RNA from these populations were subjected to Agilent microarray analysis.
