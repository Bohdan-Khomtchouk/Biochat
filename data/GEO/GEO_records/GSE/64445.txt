TITLE
Identification of host microRNAs potentially related to SGIV infection in grouper Epinephelus coioides

ORGANISM
Epinephelus coioides

SUMMARY
microRNAs (miRNAs) are an evolutionarily conserved class of non-coding RNA molecules, which regulate kinds of biological processes at post-transcriptional level. Investigation of miRNAs expression profiles using high-throughput strategies is efficiently conductive to identify and characterize miRNAs. In this study, through Solexa deep sequencing approach, we obtained 115 orange spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) encoded miRNAs. Among them, 107 miRNAs shared high similarity with miRNAs encoded by zebrafish (Danio rerio) and other four vertebrates, indicating that cellular miRNAs are highly conserved between species.

DESIGN
18-26 nt small RNAs from GS cells were sequenced in one Solexa lane
