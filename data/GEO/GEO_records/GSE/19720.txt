TITLE
Human primary meningioma vs. non-neoplastic adult meningeal tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Meningiomas are common brain tumors that are classified into three World Health Organization grades (Grade I: benign, Grade II: atypical and Grade III: malignant) and are molecularly ill-defined tumors. The purpose of this study was identify microRNA (miRNA) molecular signatures unique to the different grades of meningiomas correlating them to prognosis. We have used a miRNA expression microarray to show that meningiomas of all three grades fall into two main molecular groups designated “benign” and “malignant” meningiomas. While all typical meningiomas fall into the benign group and all anaplastic meningiomas fall into the malignant group, atypical meningiomas distribute into either one of these groups. We have identified a miRNA signature that distinguishes benign meningiomas from malignant meningiomas.

DESIGN
We studied the gene expression profiles of 340 mammalian miRNAs in 37 primary meningioma tumors by means of DNA microarrays.
