TITLE
Expression data in colon mucosa samples from individuals with ulcerative colitis and normal controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide expression profiling of ulcerative colitis, and normal colon mucosa samples. The GeneChip PrimeView Human Gene Expression Array was used to obtain expresion profiles across colon mucosa samples. Samples came from 5 ulcerative colitis affected, and 5 normal individuals.

DESIGN
RNA from the 10 samples were hybridized to the GeneChip PrimeView Human Gene Expression Array

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
