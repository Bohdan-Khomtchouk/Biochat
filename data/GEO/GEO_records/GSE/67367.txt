TITLE
Expression data from root segments of barley (Hordeum vulgare) during a transient water deficit repressing lateral root formation

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
In the lateral root repression system described by Bab√© et al. (2012), the first asymetric divisions of pericycle cells preceding lateral root formation are repressed during water deficit treatments. During an 8-hr long treatment, an 8-mm long root segment is formed where LR formation has been repressed. The experiment was designed to monitor changes in gene expression during early events of LR formation in barley using this LR repression system.

DESIGN
In barley, the first assymetric division occurs ca. 12 mm proximal from the root tip, while the next divisions occur ca. 20 mm from the tip. A sample length of 5 mm was chosen, as a compromise between maximising the amount of RNA per sample and minimising the probablity to capture cells undergoing the second round of divisions. The sampling strategy was designed to monitor gene expression at -4, -2, 0, 2 and 4 hours relative to the first asymetric division, in conditions that enable (A, control, plants watered normally) or repress (B, water deficit WD) LR formation. 5-mm long segments were sampled such that the first sampling (-4h position) targets a region distal to the first asymetric divisions, and the last sampling (+4h position) targets a region proximal to the first asymetric division.
