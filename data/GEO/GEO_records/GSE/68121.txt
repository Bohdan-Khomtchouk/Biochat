TITLE
Trancriptomic profiling of liver tumors in rats after chronical phenobarbital treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Here we investigate the difference in global gene expression in different tumor types found in the liver of rats after NNM-initiation/PB-promotion of tumor growth. We aim to identify tumor characteristic expression in nodules, focii, adenomas and carcinomas.

DESIGN
4 weeks old male Wistar rats received a tumor initiation dose of 250 mg/kg NNM followed by daily administration of 50 mg/kg/day Phenobarbital (PB) for 17 months. We profiled mRNA expression in liver tumor tissues (carcinomas, adenomas, nodules, foci) to assess the differences between different tumor types. Surrounding liver tissue was used as control.
