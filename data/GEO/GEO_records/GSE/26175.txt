TITLE
Functional evidence that Drosha over-expression in cervical squamous cell carcinoma affects cell phenotype and microRNA profiles [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of miRNA expression profiles in cervical carcinoma cell lines to study the effects of Drosha expression levels

DESIGN
Analyzed global miRNA expression profiles from 18 samples  (7 samples in duplicate, 4 single sample) representing cervical carcinoma cell lines with either relative Drosha over-expression (Cluster 2) or Drosha under-expression (Cluster 1),  due to wild-type expression in those cell lines or manipulation with RNAi.
