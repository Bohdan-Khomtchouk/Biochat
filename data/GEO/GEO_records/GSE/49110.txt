TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of ERR alpha orphan nuclear receptor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Determination of the genes regulated by ERRalpha nuclear receptor in MDA-MB231 cells

DESIGN
MDA-MB231 cells were inactivated for ERRalpha using siRNA. Three different siRNAs were used (siE1, siE2, siE3). Cells treated with a control siRNA (siC samples) were used for comparison. Duplicate samples were analyzed. Transcriptomic analysis was performed by RNA-Seq

PLATFORM
