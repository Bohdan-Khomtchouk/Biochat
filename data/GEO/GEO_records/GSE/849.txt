TITLE
Genomic profile of the mouse intestine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
8 week-old male Hsd:ICR(CD-1) mice were fed ad libitum a standard chow (Harlan Teklad diet 2018S) and housed in groups of five. Animals were then divided into 3 pools (n=10) and sacrificed. The small intestine was extracted and divided into three sections, where the first 2-3 cm after the stomach comprised the duodenum, the middle third the jejunum, and the section before the ileo-ceco-colic junction comprised the ileum. Colon was not divided into proximal and distal sections and was treated as a single intestinal section. Keywords: other
