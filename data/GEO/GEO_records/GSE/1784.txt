TITLE
Temperature shift time-course of Pre-mRNA splicing factor mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Measurement of expression levels as a time course after shifting temperature-sensitive splicing factor mutant cells from 23C to 37C. Analysis of WT SS330, prp17 null, prp17-1 and prp22-1 cells. Samples were analyzed at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min. Keywords = pre-mRNA splicing Keywords = time course Keywords = intron Keywords: time-course

PLATFORM
