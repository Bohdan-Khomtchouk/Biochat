TITLE
GY118F downstream effect in EpiSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This microarray was performed to gain insight in the effect of GY118F stimulation in EpiSCs. This array is part of the following paper to be published in Nature Communications: “JAK/STAT3 signalling is sufficient and dominant over antagonistic cues for the establishment of naïve pluripotency” by Anouk L. van Oosten, Yael Costa, Austin Smith & José C.R. Silva

DESIGN
Gy0 a, gy0 b, gy0 c (triplicate samples for GY118F EpiSCs in N2B27+Activin+Fgf)   c0 a, c0 b, c0 c (triplicate samples for Control EpiSCs in N2B27+Activin+Fgf)   gy3 b, gy3 c (duplicate samples for GY118F EpiSCs in N2B27+Activin+Fgf stimulated with GCSF for 3 hours)   c3 a, c3 b, c3 c (triplicate samples for Control EpiSCs in N2B27+Activin+Fgf stimulated with GCSF for 3 hours)     Within the manucript genes of interest were defined as those that were significantly upregulated (P < 0.01) above a 1.4 fold change  threshold in GCSF stimulated GY118F EpiSCs as compared to those not stimulated, but for which the expression did not significantly change upon GCSF stimulation in the control.   The fold change in expression was calculated by 2^absolute value of subtracted normalised data.
