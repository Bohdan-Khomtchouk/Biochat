TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in thyrocytes between wildtype and thyroid-specific IFNg transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hürthle cells are found in thyroid tumors and autoimmunity, and have a unique appearance characterized by swollen eosinophilic cytoplasm filled with mitochondria and hyperchromatic nucleus. The pathogenesis of Hürthle cells remains unknown. We have generated transgenic mice expressing IFNg specifically in thyroid gland, and shown they develop changes in the thyroid follicular cell that resemble those of the human Hürthle cell.  Transcriptome analysis by serial analysis of gene expression revealed an increased expression of immunoproteasome subunits in transgenic thyrocytes. LMP2, an immunoproteasome subunit also known as PSMB9 or ib1, provided critical for Hürthle cells and hypothyroidism development. Transgenic mice treated with a proteasome inhibitor ameliorated the Hürthle cell phenotype, and failed to develop it when crossed to LMP2 deficient mice. LMP2 was expressed in Hürthle cells from Hashimoto thyroiditis and thyroidal cancer patients. We propose that LMP2 is a nobel therapeuetic target for Hürthle cell lesions.

DESIGN
We used 16 wildtype female mice for " Thyroid_wildtype_CD45depleted " and 3 thyroid specific IFNg transgenic female mice for " Thyroid_IFNg_transgenic_CD45depleted " . Both wildtype and transgenic mouse thyroids have hematopoiteic cells, especially transgenic mouse have numerous mononuclear cell infiltration.  We purely wanted to study gene expression of thyrocytes, because Hürthle cell is a follicular cell and a majority of thyrocytes are follicular cells. A difference of number of mice between two groups are due to a difference of size of thyroid lobes (Kimura et al. Int J Exp Pathol 86, 97-106, 2005).
