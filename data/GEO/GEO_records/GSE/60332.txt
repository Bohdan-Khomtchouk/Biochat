TITLE
Effect of Glucocorticoids on lncRNA and mRNA Expression Profiles of the Human Bone Microcirculatory Endothelial Cells from Femoral Head

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Appropriate gene expression patterns form the basis for bone microcirculatory endothelial cells’ function and bone morphology. Although previous studies have elucidated the impact of hydrocortisone on bone microcirculatory endothelial cells’ specific gene expression, the exact differential transcriptomes and comprehensive gene expression profiles remain unknown. We have investigated the mRNA and lncRNA expression patterns before and after hydrocortisone administration of bone microcirculatory endothelial cells. At mRNAs level totally 518 differentially expressed genes were identified. Furthermore, we identified 73 upregulated and 166 downregulated long non-coding RNAs after administration of hydrocortisone. These RNAs appeared to be highly important to gene co-expression network. Transcriptomic analysis of bone microcirculatory endothelial cells from human samples is highly informative due to their relevance to the large number of expressed genes. Our study provides a very valuable basis for investigation of genes, regulation and their co-expression network contributing to hydrocortisone induced disorders.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, hydrocortisone treated vs. untreated bone microcirculatory endothelial cells. Biological replicates: 8 control replicates, 8 treated replicates.
