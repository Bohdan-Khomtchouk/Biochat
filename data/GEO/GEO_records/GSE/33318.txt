TITLE
ChIP-chip from pregnant female mouse pituitary with POU1F1 (PIT-1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
POU1F1 regulates, in the pituitary, the development of the prolactin-, growth hormone- and thyrotropin ÃŸ-expressing lineages and the expression of these hormone in the mature pituitary through the direct regulation of their promoters. Besides these functions, POU1F1 is also involved in other cellular processes in the pituitary, such as cell division and survival, but the genomic targets involved in these actions are not known. The present ChIP-chip study identified a large number of hitherto unknown potential direct targets that might be involved in these actions, such as Tcf4, Lmo4, Pax6, Trp53 etc.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip was done from pregnant female mouse (C57Bl/6J) pituitary (3 pools of 12 pituitary anterior lobes, corresponding to three biological replicates) with POU1F1 (PIT-1)
