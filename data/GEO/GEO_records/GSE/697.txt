TITLE
CVB3-infected HeLa cells (multiple time points and triplicate sample per time point)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HeLa cells were serum starved and either preincubated with DMSO (vehicle), preincubated with U0126 (10µM in DMSO) and infected with CVB3 (MOI 10), or preincubated with DMSO (vehicle) and infected with CVB3.  Following infection, virus was removed and fresh media containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added for the remainder of the infectious process.  At 0, 30 minutes, 3 and 9 hours following CVB3 infection (N=3 plates per time point), RNA was isolated, processed and hybridized to GeneChip®s (N=3 per sample) Keywords: time-course
