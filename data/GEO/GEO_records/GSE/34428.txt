TITLE
miRNA profiles in unstimulated and TLR stimulated MDMs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Macrophages play a crucial role in HIV-1 pathogenesis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are fundamental for innate and adaptive immune responses, but their role in HIV-1 infection is still incompletely understood. The TLR3 and TLR4 ligands poly(I:C) and LPS are known to modulate HIV-1 infection of and replication in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), but the mechanism is incompletely understood. We found that MDMs stimulation with poly(I:C) or LPS abrogated infection by CCR5-using, macrophage-tropic HIV-1, or by VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 virions, while TLR7 and TLR9 agonists Imiquimod and CpG only reduced infection to varying extent. Suppression of infection, or lack thereof, did not correlate with differential effects on CD4 or CCR5 expression, type I interferon induction, or production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, integrated pro-viruses were readily detected in unstimulated, TLR7- and TLR9-stimulated cells, but not in TLR3- or TLR4-stimulated MDMs, suggesting the alteration of post-entry, pre-integration event(s). MicroRNA (miRNA) microarray and real time PCR demonstrated increased miR-155 levels in MDMs upon TLR3/4, but not TLR7, stimulation, and a miR-155 inhibitor partially restored infectivity in poly(I:C)-stimulated MDMs. Finally, miR-155 over-expression in MDMs and cell lines remarkably diminished HIV-1 infection, inducing an accumulation of late reverse transcription products, concurrently with a decrease in mRNA levels of several HIV-1 dependency factors involved in nuclear import of pre-integration complexes. Our results suggest that miR-155 may target mRNA(s) for host cell protein(s) that either participate in or facilitate post-entry, pre-integration events, resulting in severely diminished HIV-1 infection.

DESIGN
miRNA profiles were investigated in total RNA isolated from unstimulated and TLR3-, TLR4- and TLR7-stimulated human MDMs from a single normal donor
