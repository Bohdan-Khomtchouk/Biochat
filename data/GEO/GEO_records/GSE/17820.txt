TITLE
HuR differentially regulates unique subsets of mRNAs in estrogen receptor negative and positive breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of RNA immunoprecipitation of HuR, a RNA binding protein (RBP), in breast cancer cell lines. This approach, utilizing RNA immunoprecipitation hybridized to microarray (RIP-Chip), provides global identification of putative endogenous mRNA targets of different RBPs.  HuR is an RBP that binds to the AU-rich (ARE) regions of labile mRNAs, such as proto-oncogenes, facilitating their translation into protein. HuR has been shown to play a role in cancer progression and elevated levels of cytoplasmic HuR directly correlate with increased invasiveness and poor prognosis for many cancers, including those of the breast.  We used HuR RIP-Chip as a comprehensive and systematic method to survey breast cancer target genes in both MCF-7 (estrogen receptor positive, ER+) and MDA-MB-231 (estrogen receptor negative, ER-) breast cancer cell lines. We identified unique subsets of HuR associated mRNAs found individually or in both cell types. Two novel HuR targets, CD-9 and CALM-2, were identified and validated by quantitative RT-PCR and biotin pulldown analysis. Our findings reveal that the differential regulation of these two cancer-related genes by HuR was contingent upon the cellular environment.

DESIGN
RNA immunoprecipitation of the HuR RNA binding protein by 3A2 antibody and IgG (control) from two human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 .
