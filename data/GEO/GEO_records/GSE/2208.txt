TITLE
gene expression study of blood monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Monocytes were isolated from 30 ml of whole blood from each of 19 women, 10 with high BMD and 9 with low BMD, using monocyte negative isolation kit from Dynal Biotech Inc. Total RNA was extracted from monocytes using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. Targets were produced for each subject using standard Affymetrix procedures from about 4ug of total RNA. Hybridization was made for each subject. Comparison was performed between 10 high BMD and 9 low BMD subjects.
