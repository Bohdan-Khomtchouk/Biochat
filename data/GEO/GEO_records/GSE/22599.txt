TITLE
ChIP-chip from HEK293 cells with YY2-antibody

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Yin Yang 2 (YY2) gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that is not well characterized, yet. By using chromatin immunoprecipitations combined with whole-genome human promoter microarray (ChIP-chip) in HEK293 cells, we identified a multiplicity of YY2-bound annotated promoters as well as additional chromosomal regions. Interestingly, gene ontology analyses linked YY2 to fundamental biological pathways associated to cancer and developmental processes.

DESIGN
Identification of YY2 target genes in HEK293 cells in vivo
