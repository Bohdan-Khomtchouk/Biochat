TITLE
Effects of 2'-deoxymugineic acid application on the rice seedling under different pH conditions

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We revealed that an enhancement of rice growth by 2'-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) application was observed not only under high pH conditions where iron availability for plant uptake was reduced but also under normal pH conditions. This result indicates that DMA application improves not only Fe availability for plants but also plant productivity. To explain a mechanism caused by the DMA application, molecular regulation in rice treated with or without DMA was analyzed using microarray analysis and qRT-PCR. Results provide insight into advantages of DMA application in rice seedlings.

DESIGN
Gene expression patterns induced by DMA and EDTA in root and shoot were analyzed with control experiment (no chelator). One independent experiment was performed at each pH (pH 5.8 or pH 8.0).
