TITLE
Dendritic Cell Vaccine against Glioblastoma Multiforme Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human Glioblastoma Multiforme tumors taken before dendritic cell vaccination, the recurrent tumors taken after vaccination and control GBM tumors from non vaccinated patients. Keywords: Disease State Analysis

DESIGN
Six Glioblastoma Multiforme patients underwent surgery. Their brain tumors were removed and analyzed via microarray. The lysate from the tumors were cultured with the patients' dendritic cells and the DCs were injected back into the patients. The patients GBMs returned and they underwent surgery a second time and those tumors were also analyzed via microarray. Tumors from the first and second GBM surgeries of 5 patients who did not receive DC vaccines are included as controls.
