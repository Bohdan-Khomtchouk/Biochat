TITLE
A novel YY1-miR-1 regulatory circuit in skeletal myogenesis revealed by genome-wide prediction of YY1-miRNA network

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, and mounting evidences support the prevalence and functional significance of their interplay with transcription factors (TFs). Here we describe the identification of a regulatory circuit between muscle miRNAs (miR-1, miR-133 and miR-206) and Yin Yang 1 (YY1), an epigenetic repressor of skeletal myogenesis.  Genome-wide identification of potential YY1 down-stream targets by combining computational prediction with expression profiling data reveals a large number of putative miRNA targets of YY1 during skeletal myoblasts differentiation into myotubes with muscle miRs rank on top of the list.
