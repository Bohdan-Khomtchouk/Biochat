TITLE
Laser capture microdissection of endothelial and neuronal cells from human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used laser capture microdissection to isolate both microvascular endothelial cells and neurons from post mortem brain tissue from patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and healthy controls. RNA was isolated from these cell populations, amplified, and analysed using Affymetrix HG133plus2.0 GeneChips. In the first instance, we used the dataset to compare the neuronal and endothelial data, in order to demonstrate that the predicted differences between cell types could be detected using this methodology. Keywords: cell type comparison, laser capture microdissection

DESIGN
The dataset consists of endothelial cell samples from 18 individuals and neuronal samples from an overlapping population of 18 individuals.
