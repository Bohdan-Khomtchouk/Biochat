TITLE
miRNA reponse to bleomycin instillation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of C57BL/6 (sensitive) and BALB/c (resistant) mice challenged by intratracheal bleomycin instillation: miRNA expression profiles were established from lungs derived from the two strains, following a 7- or 14-days PBS or bleomycin administration.

DESIGN
One color -experiment with 2 strains of mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) following a 7- or 14-days PBS or bleomycin administration (n=3), corresponding to a total of 24 samples.
