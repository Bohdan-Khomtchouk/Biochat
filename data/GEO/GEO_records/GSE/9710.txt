TITLE
Telomerase inhibitor TMPyP4 induced widespread gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effect of TMPyP4, the well established anticancer telomerase inhibitor on genome wide expression of genes, analyzed across different cell-lines, was investigated Keywords: Comparative gene-expression profiling

DESIGN
Cells were treated with TMPyP4 for 48 hours before RNA isolation. Untreated cells were taken as controls and the TMPyP4 treated cells as treatments. Experiments in each cell-line (A549 and HeLa S3) were replicated four times.
