TITLE
Whole translatome profiling of Human Hepatoma culture Huh7.5 and Huh7.5M

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Huh7.5 cells, when grown in presence of 1-2mg/ml of Geneticin, generarated colonies with cells that were morphologically distinct from the parental cells. These cells were substantially smaller in size, had spindle like features and grew faster. They expressed mesenchymal markers and were named as Huh7.5M cells.
