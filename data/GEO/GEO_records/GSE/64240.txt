TITLE
Identification of Tox chromatin binding properties and of its downstream targets by DamID

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study was to characterize the chromatin binding features and the transcriptional target genes of a new key player during corticogenesis, the transcription factor Tox Methods: DamID was performed using two cell lines, the Neuro-2a and the HEK-293T cells. Experiments were performed in duplicates for each cell line by infecting them with pLgwV5Eco-ToxDam lentiviruses and using the pLgxV5Dam viruses as control. DamID was performed as described in Vogel et al., 2006. Results: Our analysis identifyed ca. 13,000 Tox chromatin binding regions
