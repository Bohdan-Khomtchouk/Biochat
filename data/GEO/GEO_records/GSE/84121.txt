TITLE
Expression data from HCT116 wild-type and RAP1-knockdown cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
knockdown of RAP1 decreased colorectal cancer cell migration by downregulation of Vimentin We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying HCT116 wild-type and RAP1-knockdown cells and identified disparate classes of regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
HCT116 cells were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain a disticnt impact of RAP1 on colorectal cancer cells. To that end, we selected HCT116 cells, which were infected with lentivirus sh-negative-control and lentivirus sh-RAP1-4#, separately.
