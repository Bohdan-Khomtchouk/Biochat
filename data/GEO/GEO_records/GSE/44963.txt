TITLE
Expression data from BCG-immunized monkey PBMCs stimulated with lipid antigen

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
The role of CD1-restricted, lipid-specific T cells in vivo remains to be elucidated. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression accompanied by the activation of CD1-restricted, lipid-specific T cells.

DESIGN
Monkeys were immunized with BCG bacteria to evoke CD1-restricted, mycolyl glycolipid-specific T cell responses at high frequency. The PBMCs were stimulated in the presense or absense of mycolyl glycolipid antigen, followed by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
