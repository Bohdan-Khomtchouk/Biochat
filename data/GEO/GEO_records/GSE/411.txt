SUMMARY
Effects of SOCS3 on the transcriptional response of bone marrow-derived macrophages to IL-6. Fetal liver cells from SOCS3+/+ or SOCS3-/- embryos were used to reconstitute recipient mice. Donor derived bone marrow from these mice was differentiated to macrophages.  Macrophages were either unstimulated, or stimulated for 100 or 400 minutes with 10 ng/ml IL-6. Keywords = macrophage, SOCS3, IL-6, interferon Keywords: repeat sample
