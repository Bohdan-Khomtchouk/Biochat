TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles in erythroblasts and progenitor cells of mDia2 conditional KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to investigate the transcriptional network regulated by DIAPH3 gene (mDia2) using the conditional hematopoietic specific knockout mouse model, especially in the cell proliferation, cell survive (including oxidative stress), cell adhesion & migration, cell cycle and hematopoiesis pathway-related genes.

DESIGN
Two groups of mice (WT vs KO) were sacrificed to purify erythroblast (Ter119+) cells from total bone marrow for RNA preparation. Each group contains three mice, the WT group includes 917,1125,1136 and 907,914,1122 belong to the conditional KO group. There is biological triplication in each group.
