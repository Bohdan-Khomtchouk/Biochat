TITLE
Multiple tissue expression data from inbreds and F1 of CAST, PWK, and WSB

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We create catalogues of genes showing significant strain, parent-of-origin, dominance, sex effect in inbreds and reciprocal F1 hybrids of three wild-derived strains (CAST, PWK, WSB) across 4 different tissues (brain, kidney, liver, and lung) We used microarrays to validate the Brain results of RNAseq from inbred and F1 of 3 by 3 diallel.

DESIGN
Brain, liver, kidney and lung RNA from the same mice used for RNAseq were hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.1 ST 96-Array Plate arrays using a GeneTitan instrument from Affymetrix.

PLATFORM
