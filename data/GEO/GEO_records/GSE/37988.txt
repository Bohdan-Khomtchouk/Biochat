TITLE
Methylation in Taiwanese HCC tumor and adjacent tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 62 Taiwanese HCC cases using Illumina HumanMethylation 27 chips. After Bonferroni adjustment, a total of 2,324 CpG sites significantly differed in methylation level, with 684 CpG sites significantly hypermethylated and 1,640 hypomethylated in tumor compared to non-tumor tissues. Array data were validated with pyrosequencing in a subset of 5 of these genes; correlation coefficients ranged from 0.92 to 0.97.

DESIGN
62 tumor and 62 adjacent non tumor tissues

PLATFORM
