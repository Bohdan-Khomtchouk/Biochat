TITLE
UPF2 establishes testis-specific transcriptome enriched in transcripts with shorter 3’UTRs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This report not only adds a novel mechanism to the current dogma on achieving global shortening of 3'UTRs, but also unveils a novel function of the NMD pathway in establishing tissue-specific transcriptome identity

DESIGN
We first generated prospermatogonia-specific Upf2 conditional knockout mice (Ddx4-Cre; Upf2 fl/Δ, hereafter called Ddx4-KO) by crossing Ddx4-Cre13 with Upf2 floxed.

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
