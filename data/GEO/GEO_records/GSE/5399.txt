TITLE
Pre- and postnatal hepatic expression profiles of two pig breeds differing in body composition

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In order to gain insight into hepatic metabolic pathways and key transcripts affecting traits related to body composition we aimed to compare samples of pigs of two breeds, the “obese” German Landrace (DL) and the “lean” Pietrain (Pi) obtained at prenatal stages (35, 63, and 91 days post conceptionem) and at adult age (180 days).   In terms of number of genes regulated the most striking differences between DL and Pi were found at adult age with upregulation of key genes of lipid biosynthesis/metabolism pathways (FASN, ACSS2, ACACA) in obese DL pigs on the one hand and upregulation of genes of cell growth and/or maintenance, protein syntheses as well as cell proliferation pathways (PPARD, POU1F1, IGF2R) in lean Pi pigs on the other hand. Time course analysis of expression profiles of breed differences from foetal to adult stage and functional cluster analysis of the biological processes confirmed the trend of differences between genetically different obese and lean breeds. The highlighted classes of genes showed common breed-typical expression throughout prenatal development and at adult age. The transcriptional differences between obese and lean pigs involving lipid pathways and cell activity are already initiated during early prenatal development. The information about genetic differences between obese and lean pigs reveals a number of functional candidate genes for traits related to obesity and leaness. Keywords: pig, oligo-microarray, prenatal liver expression, adult liver expression, obesity, leaness

DESIGN
Porcine liver from three prenatal stages (35, 63, and 91 day post conceptionem, dpc) plus adult age (180 days) of 10 animals of each of the breeds DL and Pi, which differ in body composition, were collected. The hepatic gene expression patterns of DL and Pi breeds were compared at each of the four stages of development. Three or four biological replicate microarray hybridisations were performed for each stage with DL pools labelled with Cy5 and Pi pools labelled with Cy3.
