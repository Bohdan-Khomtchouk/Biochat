TITLE
Transcriptome-wide characterization of gene expression associated with unruptured intracranial aneurysms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The biological mechanisms by which cerebral aneurysms emerge, enlarge and rupture are not totally understood. In the present study, we analyzed the genome-wide gene expression profile in human intracranial aneurysms using cDNA microarrays.

DESIGN
Intracranial arterial aneurysm samples (n = 3) and normal superficial temporal artery samples (control, n = 3) were obtained from individual subjects. All aneurysm samples were unruptured aneurysms confirmed by Magnetic Resonance Image or Digital Subtraction Angiography. Affymetrix HU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays were used to compare gene expression levels between aneurismal and normal blood vessels.
