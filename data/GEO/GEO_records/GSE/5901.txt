TITLE
Expression profiling of the mouse prostate after castration and hormone replacement

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we used microarray analysis to determine gene expression profile changes in the mouse prostate following castration and hormone replacement. We first identified genes with significant expression changes in each of these two processes and then generated a list of androgen responsive genes and a list of genes whose expression were inversely correlated with the presence of androgen. The analysis of this data set is described in Wang et al., Differentiation, 2006 Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
C57/B6 mice of 10-12 weeks old (Charles River, Hollister, CA) were used. Mice were castrated, and at 3 or 14 days after surgery (C3 or C14), mice from these groups were sacrificed and whole prostates were collected. Prostates were also collected from sham-treated mice for control (N3). To obtain re-growing or regenerating prostate, mice that had been castrated 14 days before were implanted with testosterone (T) pellet (15 mg/pellet/mouse, Innovative Research, Sarasota, FL). Three days after pellet implantation, mice were sacrificed and prostates were collected (C14+T3). Five mice were used for each treatment/time point. Total RNA was purified with RNeasy kit.
