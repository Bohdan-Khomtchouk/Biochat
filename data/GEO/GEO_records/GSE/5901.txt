TITLE
Expression profiling of the mouse prostate after castration and hormone replacement

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we used microarray analysis to determine gene expression profile changes in the mouse prostate following castration and hormone replacement. We first identified genes with significant expression changes in each of these two processes and then generated a list of androgen responsive genes and a list of genes whose expression were inversely correlated with the presence of androgen. The analysis of this data set is described in Wang et al., Differentiation, 2006 Keywords: Time course
