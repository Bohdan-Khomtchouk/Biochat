TITLE
Identification of miRNAs in sheep heart

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
MicroRNA profiling of myocardium of ovine comparing normal (Control), paced-induced heart failure (HF) and heart failure recovery (HF-R) after discontinuation of pacing.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment: Control vs HF vs HF-R. Biological replicates: 2 control, 4 HF and 3 HF-R. One replicate per array.
