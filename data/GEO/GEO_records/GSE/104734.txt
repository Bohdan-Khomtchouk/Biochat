TITLE
RNA-Seq Profiling of Pharmacological Activation of PXR and CAR Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to quantify and compare the mRNA abundance of major xenobiotic processing genes in liver following activation of PXR and CAR using RNA-Seq

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of liver in adult male C57BL/6 mice treated with corn oil, PCN (mouse PXR-ligand), or TCPOBOP (mouse CAR ligand) were determined by RNA-Seq, n=3 per group, using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer.

PLATFORM
