TITLE
CITE-seq: Large scale simultaneous measuremnt of epitopes and transcriptomes in single cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent high-throughput single-cell sequencing approaches have been transformative for understanding complex cell populations, but are unable to provide additional phenotypic information, such as protein levels of cell-surface markers. Using oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies, we integrate measurements of cellular proteins and transcriptomes into an efficient, sequencing-based readout of single cells. This method is compatible with existing single-cell sequencing approaches and will readily scale as the throughput of these methods increase.

DESIGN
Cord blood mononuclear cells were profiled by CITE-seq using a panel of 13 antibodies.

PLATFORM
