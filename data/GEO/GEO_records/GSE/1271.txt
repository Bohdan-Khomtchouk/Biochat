TITLE
Operon array expression profile apetala2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression profiles of wild-type and apetala2 inflorescences. This series contains the data for four replicate experiments performed with four sets of biologically independent samples. Cy3 and Cy5 dyes were used as follows: Set 1:	wild type-Cy3	mutant-Cy5 Set 2:  	wild type-Cy5	mutant-Cy3 Set 3:	wild type-Cy3	mutant-Cy5 Set 4:	wild type-Cy5	mutant-Cy3 Keywords: repeat sample
