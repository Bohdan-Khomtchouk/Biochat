TITLE
Regulation of inflorescence architecture by inter-tissue-layer ligand-receptor communication between endodermis and phloem

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Inflorescence architecture of Arabidopsis thaliana is regulated by ER-EPFL4/6 signaling module. To analyze the genes governed by this module, the transcriptional profiles of er-2 (allelic to er-106) mutant and epfl4 epfl6 double mutant were investigeted.

DESIGN
9 samples are included in this study. Three biological replicates of 33 d post germination inflorescence tips of er-2  (allelic to er-106, Lease et al., 2001) and epfl4 epfl6 were compared with wild type (Col-0) sample for changes in gene expression.
