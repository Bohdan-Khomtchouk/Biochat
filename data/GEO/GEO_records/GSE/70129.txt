TITLE
miR-153 overexpressing NSPCs derived from mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammalian neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) sequentially generate neurons and glia during central nervous system (CNS) development. Several transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the temporal regulation of NSPC differentiation. miRNA-153 (miR-153) as a modulator of NSPC specification. Overexpression (OE) of miR-153 delayed the onset of astrogliogenesis and maintained NSPCs in an undifferentiated state in vitro.

DESIGN
miR-153-OE and control NSPCs (tertiary neurospheres (TNs) derived from mouse ES Cells via embryoid body formation) subjected to the gene expression microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
