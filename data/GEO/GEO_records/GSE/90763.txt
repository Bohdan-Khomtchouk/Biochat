TITLE
A model of exposure to extreme environmental heat uncovers the human transcriptome to heat stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanisms by which individuals subjected to environmental heat stress either adapt or develop heat-related complications are not well understood. We analysed the changes in blood mononuclear gene expression patterns in human volunteers exposed to an extreme heat in a sauna (temperature of 78 ± 6 °C).

DESIGN
Fifteen male and female volunteers were subjected to heat stress, and PBMCs were analyzed from three time points, namely: before exposure (T0), at the end of heat exposure (T1), and 1 hour after the end of heat stress (T2).
