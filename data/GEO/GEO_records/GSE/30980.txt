TITLE
Gene profiling on mandibular arches (MdPA1) from Tbx1+/+ and Tbx1-/- mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Velo-cardio-facial syndrome/DiGeorge syndrome/22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) patients have a submucous cleft palate, velo-pharyngeal insufficiency associated with hypernasal speech, facial muscle hypotonia and feeding difficulties. Inactivation of both alleles of mouse Tbx1, encoding a T-box transcription factor, deleted on 22q11.2, results in a cleft palate and a reduction or loss of branchiomeric muscles. To identify genes downstream of Tbx1 for myogenesis, gene profiling was performed on mandibular arches (MdPA1) from Tbx1+/+ and Tbx1-/- mouse embryos.

DESIGN
To obtain enough RNA for microarray hybridization experiments, dissected mandibular arches from three Tbx1+/+ and three Tbx1-/- E10.5 embryos were pooled according to genotype, with three microarrays performed in total per genotype. The tissue was homogenized in Buffer RLT (QIAGEN). Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Micro Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quality and quantity of total RNA was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and an ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop), respectively. Biotinylated single-stranded cDNA targets were amplified from 100 nanograms (ng) starting total RNA using the Ovation RNA Amplification System V2 and FL- Ovation cDNA Biotin Module V2 (NuGEN). A total of 3.75 μg of cDNA from the last step was hybridized to the GeneChip Test3 array (Affymetrix) to test the quality of the labeled target. Nucleic acid samples that passed quality control were then hybridized to the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix). Hybridization, washing, staining and scanning were performed in the Genomics Core at Einstein ( http://www.einstein.yu.edu/genetics/CoreFacilities.aspx?id=23934 ) according to the Affymetrix manual.
