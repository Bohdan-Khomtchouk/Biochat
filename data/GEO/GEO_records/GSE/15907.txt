TITLE
Immunological Genome Project data Phase 1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene-expression microarray datasets generated as part of the Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen). Primary cells from multiple immune lineages are isolated ex-vivo, primarily from young adult B6 male mice, and double-sorted to > 99% purity. RNA is extracted from cells in a centralized manner, amplified and hybridized to Affymetrix 1.0 ST MuGene arrays. Protocols are rigorously standardized for all sorting and RNA preparation. Data is released monthly in batches of cell populations.

DESIGN
This Series record provides access to Immunological Genome Project data submitted to GEO.
