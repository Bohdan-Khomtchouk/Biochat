TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of transcription factor PPARγ-responsive gene expression in the nodose ganglion (NG)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression regulated by PPARγ in the nodose ganglion of Phox2b::Cre; PPARγ fl/+ and Phox2b::Cre; PPARγ fl/fl mice. Resutls demonstrate potential PPARγ transcriptional targets in neurons

DESIGN
RNA was purified from laser-captured nodose neurons.  Three independent biological replicates were prepared by pooling RNA of nodose neurons from multiple animals of the same genotypes.  Genomics and Microarray Core Facility at UT Southwestern ( http://microarray.swmed.edu/ ) checked RNA quality and performed the hybridization with a Mouse-6 V2 BeadChip (Illumina Inc.).  We used Partek Genomics Suite 6.5 (Partek Inc.) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems Inc.) for data and pathway analysis respectively.
