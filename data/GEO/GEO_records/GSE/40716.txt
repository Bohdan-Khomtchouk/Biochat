Offspring from oocytes derived from in vitro primordial germ cell-like cells in mice

SUMMARY
Reconstitution of female germ-cell development in vitro is a key challenge in reproductive biology and medicine. We show here that female (XX) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in mice are induced into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs), which, when aggregated with female gonadal somatic cells as reconstituted ovaries, develop pre-meiotic germ cell characteristics, including X-reactivation, imprint erasure, and cyst formation. Upon transplantation under ovarian bursa, PGCLCs in the reconstituted ovaries mature into germinal vesicle-stage oocytes, which, through in vitro maturation and fertilization, contribute to fertile offspring. Our culture system serves as a robust foundation for the investigation of key properties of female germ cells, including the acquisition of totipotency, and for the reconstitution of whole female germ-cell development in vitro.

DESIGN
We performed expression analysis of female PGC-like cells [PGCLCs; day 3 (d3), day 6 (d6), and day 3 followed by day 6 in aggregation with female embryonic day (E) 12.5 gonadal somatic cells (d3ag6)] in comparison to in vivo embryonic PGCs (E12.5 female PGCs and E9.5 PGCs) and male d6 PGCLCs. PGCLCs were marked with fluorescence of Blimp1-mVenus, stella-ECFP transgenic reporters (BVSC). PGCs were marked with fluorescence of the stella-EGFP transgenic reporter.
