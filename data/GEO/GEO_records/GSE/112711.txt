SUMMARY
Host and genetic viral adaptations enable development of an immunocompetent mouse model of Zika virus infection. This study explored the effect of wildtype Zika virus (ZIKV) and mouse adapted ZIKV infection on the transcriptional profile of mouse adult neuronal stem cells.

DESIGN
Mouse adult neuronal stem cells were isolated from 4-6 week old C57BL/6 mice, and infected with wildtype ZIKV-Dakar or ZIKV-Dakar NS4B G18R.  scRNA-seq was performed according to 10x Genomic Technology.

PLATFORM
GPL21103 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)
