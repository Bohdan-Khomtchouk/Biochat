TITLE
TET2 Regulates Mast Cell Differentiation and Proliferation through Catalytic and Non-catalytic Activities.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dioxygenases of the TET family impact genome functions by converting 5-methylcytosine in DNA to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, but the individual contribution of the three family members to differentiation and function of myeloid cells is still incompletely understood. Using cells with a deletion in the Tet2 gene, we show that TET2 contributes to the regulation of mast cell differentiation, proliferation and effector functions. The differentiation defect observed in absence of TET2 could be however completely rescued or further exacerbated by modulating TET3 activity, and it was primarily linked to dysregulated expression of the C/EBP family of transcription factors. In contrast, hyper-proliferation induced by the lack of TET2 could not be modified by TET3. Together, our data indicate the existence of both overlapping and unique roles of individual TET proteins in regulating myeloid cell gene expression, proliferation and function.

DESIGN
Total mRNA of FACS-sorted Kit+ FcεRIα+ populations of primary bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) from Tet2-/- and Tet2+/+ animals was extracted and subjected to multiparallel sequencing.
