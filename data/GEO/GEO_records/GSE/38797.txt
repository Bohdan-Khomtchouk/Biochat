TITLE
Expression values from wild-type retinas and retinas with a mutant Rhodopsin transgene (Tg(RHO P347S)) with and without Endothelin-2 (EDN2)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression of the Endothelin-2 (Edn2) mRNA is greatly increased in the photoreceptors (PRs) of mouse models of inherited PR degeneration. To identify retinasl gene whose expression is directly or indirectly regulated by EDN2 in the presence of the Tg(RHO P347S) mutant allele, we defined mRNAs that were differentially expressed in Edn2+/+, Edn2-/-, Tg(RHO P347S) Edn2+/+, and Tg(RHO P347S) Edn2-/- retinas.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from Edn2+/+, Edn2-/-, Tg(RHO P347S) Edn2+/+, and Tg(RHO P347S) Edn2-/- retinas at postnatal day 21 (PN21) and hybridized to Affymetrix arrays
