TITLE
Global transcriptome profiling of poplar bark during stored N remobilization

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
Seasonal nitrogen (N) storage and reuse is important to the N-use efficiency of temperate deciduous trees. In poplar, bark storage proteins (BSPs) accumulate in protein storage vacuoles of the bark parenchyma and xylem ray cells in the fall. During spring growth, N from stored BSPs is remobilized and utilized by growing shoots. The goal of this study is to investigate global gene expression changes in the bark during BSP remobilization and shoot regrowth under long-day conditions.
