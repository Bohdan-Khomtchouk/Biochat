TITLE
Arrays of time course experiment (2-28 d) laser microdissected samples of H. pylori -infected mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were infected with Helicobacter pylori strain SS1 for 2, 7, 14 or 28 days or left uninfected. They were sacrificed at the appropriate times, the stomachs were removed and one half was plated for colony counts. The other half was embedded in OCT and cryosections were produced for 6-7 animals per timepoint. The sections were stained using the Histogene dye and roughly 500-1000 cells per gastric epithelial cell type were harvested by laser microdissection. RNA was prepared from these samples, subjected to two rounds of amplification, labelled and hybridized to 40.000 element murine cDNA arrays. The array names are composed as follows: " LCM " stands for laser capture microdissection; " mock " or " SS " stands for mock-infected or SS1-infected, respectively; " 2,7,14 and 28 " refers to the length of infection; " 1-4 " corresponds to the numbers given to every animal.The cellular origin of the RNA is represented by " mucus producing " or pit cell, " parietal " or acid-producing cell and " chief " or zymogenic cell. Between 5 and 7 samples were harvested per timepoint and cell type. Where the first labelling reaction and hybridization did not produce sufficiently good data (less than half of all spots made a regression correlation cutoff of > 0.6), both were repeated (indicated by the addition of " relabeled " to the array name).  The differential regulation of genes can be analyzed in both a time and cell type specific manner using publicly available software. Cell Type: " mucus producing " or pit cell (pit), acid-producing cell (parietal) and zymogenic cell (chief)
