TITLE
Mutations in GlnA, NifA and NifK enabling photosynthetic growth of Rhodobacter sphaeroides in the absence of CO2 fixation

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1

SUMMARY
Previously isolated spontaneous mutants of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, which were initially compromised in their ability to assimilate carbon dioxide through the reductive pentose phosphate pathway, were found to exhibit abnormal nitrogenase gene regulation as well as altered patterns of nitrogenase enzymatic activity. The genomes of these strains were studied by whole genome pyrosequencing and whole genome microarray analysis to identify possible loci responsible for the observed phenotypes.
