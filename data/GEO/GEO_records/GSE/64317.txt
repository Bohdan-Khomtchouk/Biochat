TITLE
Bromodomain inhibition of the transcriptional coactivators CBP/EP300 as a therapeutic strategy to target the IRF4 network in multiple myeloma (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pharmacological inhibition of chromatin co-regulatory factors represents a clinically validated strategy to modulate oncogenic signaling through selective attenuation of gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition preferentially abrogates the viability of multiple myeloma cell lines. Phenotypic effects are preceded by the direct transcriptional suppression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor IRF4 and the subsequent down-regulation of the IRF4 transcriptional program. Ectopic expression of IRF4 antagonizes the phenotypic effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition and prevents the suppression of the IRF4 target c-MYC. These findings suggest that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition represents a viable therapeutic strategy for targeting multiple myeloma and other lymphoid malignancies dependent on the IRF4 network.

DESIGN
Through the use of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors (CBP/EP300i), we demonstrate that MYC expression in BETi-resistant cells is dependent on CBP/EP300 bromodomains and that treatment with CBP/EP300i restores phenotypic sensitivity.
