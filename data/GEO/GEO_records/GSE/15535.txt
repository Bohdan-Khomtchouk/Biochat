TITLE
Genome-wide identification of the occupancy of RNA polymerase II (POL II) at L4/young adult stage in C. elegans

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
We acquied the RNA polymerase II binding profiles in ama-1 transgenic worms. The large subuint of POL II, AMA-1, was C-terminally tagged with GFP, the binding regions were determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP and anti-polymerase II antibodies followed by illumina high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq).
