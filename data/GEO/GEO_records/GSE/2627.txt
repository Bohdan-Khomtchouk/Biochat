SUMMARY
Human paclitaxel-resistant (SKOV-3TR) ovarian cancer cell line and the parent SKOV-3 cell line were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The experiment was done to compare the expression differences between the parent SKOV-3 cell line and the derived SKOV-3TR cell line. Cells were plated in T75 flasks. They were cultured until they were 80% confluent and harvested by trypsinization followed by pelleting of the cells. All RNA isolation was accomplished with the Tri-Reagent (SIgma) and purified using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit reagents. The RNA (50 ug) was annealed with a random hexamer primer, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with Powerscript (Clontech) reverse transcriptase for 2h at 42 degrees in the presence of amino-allyl dUTP. The cDNA from SKOV-3 RNA and SKOV-3TR RNA was covalently coupled separately with Cy3 and Cy5 monoreactive fluors in 50 mM sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.0. The Cy3 and Cy5 labelled cDNAs were combined and purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit and hybridized to the microarray using the Hybrite chamber (Vysis). Fluorescent array images were collected for both Cy3 and Cy5 with a ScanArray 4000 (Perkin Elmer) at a resolution of 10 um at maximum laser power and photo-multiplier tube voltage of 50 to 60%. Segmentation was performed using the histogram method of the QuantArray (Perkin Elmer) package. Data was transformed into log base 2 expression ratios and normalized using scaled loess normalization.
