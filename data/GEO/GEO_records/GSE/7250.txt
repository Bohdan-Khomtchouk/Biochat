TITLE
Treated Lymphoid ES cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
lymphoid Es cell line Keywords: cDNA array, ES cells

DESIGN
DNA chip technology has been exploited for RNA expression profiling analyses. Close to genome-wide microarrays were used for identification of changes in gene expression levels in lymphoid ES cell line. In total 15chip hybridisations were performed including 7 dye swap experiments.

PLATFORM
GPL3697 GSF/IEG mouse array
