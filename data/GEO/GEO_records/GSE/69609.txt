TITLE
Identification and Comparative Analyses of Myocardial miRNAs Involved in Fetal Response to Maternal Undernutrition

ORGANISM
Papio hamadryas

SUMMARY
Poor maternal nutrition during pregnancy causes intrauterine growth retardation, which, in turn,  is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in later life

DESIGN
Fetal hearts were collected from baboon fetuses born to regularly fed and undernurished mothers.  Total RNA was isolated, and fetal cardiac miRNA were  profiled
