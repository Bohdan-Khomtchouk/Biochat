TITLE
High-Resolution DNA Binding Specificity Analysis of Yeast Transcription Factors

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying rRNA processing gene regulation during heat shock.  PBF1 is YBL054W (TOD6) and PBF2 is YER088C (DOT6).

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae cells were grown @ 25 ºC to O.D. 600 of 0.3~04, in triplicate. Half of the cells were collected at T0 and half of the cells were subjected to 25 ºC-- > 37 ºC heat shock and cells were collected after 20 min, as samples T20. Total RNAs were collected and used to perform expression microarray analysis on Affymetrix Yeast Array 2.0 platform. The changes of gene expression upon heat shock were analyzed for four strains, wild type BY4741, single deletion mutants delta-pbf1, delta-pbf2 and double mutant delta-pbf1 delta-pbf2.
