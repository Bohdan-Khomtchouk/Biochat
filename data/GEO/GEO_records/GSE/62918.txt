TITLE
Expression data from Escherichia coli strains with increased or decreased levels of Obg (ObgE, CgtA, YhbZ)

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We measured transcriptional changes resulting from overexpression or downregulation of the GTPase Obg.

DESIGN
Four samples were run in triplicate. Samples include a wild-type control (WT), a strain overproducing wild-type Obg (pBAD-obgWT), a strain overproducing Obg containing a G166V substitution (pBAD-obgG166V), and a strain displaying moderate depletion of Obg (pHN1009-obg).
