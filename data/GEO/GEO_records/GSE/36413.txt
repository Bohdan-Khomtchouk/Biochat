TITLE
C. elegans young adults: Exposed to Bacillus thuringiensis DB27 versus exposed to E. coli OP50 : 4 hours

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of C. elegans young adult worms exposed to pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis DB27 for 4 hours versus age-matched worms exposed to onctrol lab food E. coli OP50. The goal was to identify genes regulated in response to pathogen. The broader goal of study was to study evolution of pathogen response by comparing this expression profile to that obtained by exposing the nematode Pristionchus pacificus to the same pathogen. Other experiments which are a part of this study include expression profiling of C. elegans and P. pacificus on other pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Xenorhabdus nematophila. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
One-condition experiments. C. elegans young adults: Exposed to Bacillus thuringiensis DB27 versus exposed to E. coli OP50 : 4 hours. 3 biological replicates for each condition, including 1 dye-swap.
