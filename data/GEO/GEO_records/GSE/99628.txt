TITLE
The functional enhancer repertoire of human embryonic stem cells [isolated plasmid DNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We combined Self-Transcribing Active Regulatory Region Sequencing (STARR-seq) with an enrichment step using chromatin immunoprecipitation in a massively parallel reporter assay. We applied this assay, termed ChIP-STARR-seq, to normal (primed) and naive human embryonic stem cells, building up a comprehensive catalogue of functional enhancers. This database record describes the DNA-seq component from isolated plasmids.

DESIGN
For each ChIP-seq library in primed hESCs: DNA-seq of plasmid libraries from primed hESCs after re-isolation from transfected cells (in dulicate) = 10 datasets in total

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
