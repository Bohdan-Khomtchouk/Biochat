TITLE
RNA seq analysis of adipocyte precursor cells (APC) from Per3 KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Understanding the differences in the transcriptome of adipocyte precuror cells in Per3 KO mice compared with wild type mice

DESIGN
In order to understand the transcriptome of APCs from Per3 KO mice, we FACS sorted APCS and isolated RNA at ZT2 from young Per3 KO and littermate control WT mice.

PLATFORM
