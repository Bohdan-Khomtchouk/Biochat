TITLE
Identifying radiation exposure biomarkers from mouse blood transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we present a whole-genome survey of the murine transcriptomic response to physiologically-relevant radiation doses, 2 and 8 Gy.

DESIGN
There are 18 distinct biological samples here.  Mice were exposed to ionizing radiation (Cesium-138 source) and whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture 6 hours post treatment.  Doses were 0 (7 samples), 2 (5 samples), and 8 (6 samples) gy.
