TITLE
Genome-wide microRNA-expression analysis after p53 activation in hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to characterize the differentially expressed miRNAs after the p53 activation , small RNA-seq were used after the overexpression of p53 in HepG2 cells.

DESIGN
Four samples of HepG2 cells were subjected to small RNA-seq in two biological replicates.The HepG2 cells were treated with 1µg/ml doxorubicin for 24 hours to induce the expression of p53. The experimental group(dox-treated HepG2：HepG2_24h_rep1 and HepG2_24h_rep2) and control group(untreated HepG2: HepG2_0h_rep1 and HepG2_0h_rep2) were subjected to small RNA-seq to identify the p53-regulated miRNAs.
