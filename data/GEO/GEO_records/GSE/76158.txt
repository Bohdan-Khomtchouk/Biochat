TITLE
Global gene expression in response to genetic and growth factor manipulation of TWIST1 expression and function

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In addition to their stem/progenitor properties, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) also exhibit various effector functions  potent effector (angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory) functions that are largely  paracrine in nature. It is widely believed that effector functions underlie most of the therapeutic  potential of MSCs and are independent of their stem/progenitor properties. Here we demonstrate  that stem/progenitor and effector functions are coordinately regulated at the cellular level by the  transcription factor Twist1 and specified within populations according to a hierarchical model.  We further show that manipulation of Twist1 levels by genetic approaches or by exposure to  widely used culture supplements including fibroblast growth factor 2 (Ffg2) and interferon  gamma (IFN-gamma) alters MSC efficacy in cell-based and in vivo assays in a predictable  manner. Thus, by mechanistically linking stem/progenitor and effector functions our studies  provide a unifying framework in the form of an MSC hierarchy that models the functional  complexity of populations. Using this framework, we developed a Clinical Indications  Prediction (CLIP) scale that predicts how donor-to-donor heterogeneity and culture conditions  impact the therapeutic efficacy of MSC populations for different disease indications. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression in response to genetic and growth factor manipulation of TWIST1 expression and function.

DESIGN
Mesenchymal stem cells at subconfluent culture in growth media (CONTROL), or supplemented with FGF2 (20 ng/ml) (FGF2), trasfected with scrambled (SCRAMBLED) or TWIST1 siRNA (TWIST1) were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affimentrix microarrays. We pooled three independently extracted RNA samples per group.
