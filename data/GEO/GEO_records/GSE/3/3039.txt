TITLE
Innate vs. adaptive lymphocyte gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Three innate (B1-B, NKT, CD8aaT cells) and adaptive (B2-B, CD4T, CD8abT cells) cell-types were sorted by FACS.  Three biological replicates for NKT, CD4T, CD8aaT, CD8abT cells and two biological replicates for B1 and B2 cells were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Mu74Av2 chip.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes differentially expressed between the innate and adaptive cell-types. Keywords: cell type comparison, innate vs. adaptive
