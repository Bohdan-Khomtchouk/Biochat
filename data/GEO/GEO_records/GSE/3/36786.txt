TITLE
Regulation of sialidase production in clostridium perfringens by the orphan sensor histidine kinase ReeS

ORGANISM
Clostridium perfringens str. 13

SUMMARY
ReeS, previously named as CPE1512, was originally annotated as the only hybrid sensor histidine kinase/response regulator in Clostridium perfringens.  Further evidence suggests that ReeS is more likely to function as an orphan sensor histidine kinase.  A reeS deletion mutant was constructed and the transcriptome analysed using microarrays.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the reeS mutant and the wild-type control cells during exponential phase growth.  Gene expression levels were compared between the reeS mutant and wild-type strain 13
