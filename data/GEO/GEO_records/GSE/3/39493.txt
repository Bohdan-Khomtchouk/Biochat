TITLE
Gene expression profiling after S1004A induction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microarray analyses before and after induction of S100A4 using PCI-35 and PCI-43, and identified 72 and 18 genes that were two fold or more commonly upregulated or downregulated, respectively, in these two cell lines.

DESIGN
Using two cell lines, PCI-35 and PCI-43, transfected with S1004A expression construct, we studied mRNA transcription levels by microarray analysis to see if there are any of the key molecules for malignant phenotype.
