TITLE
Expression pattern in HaHB1 overexpressor plants under normal growth conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plants deal with cold temperatures via different signal transduction pathways. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which HaHB1 conferred tolerance to cold temperatures, we performed an exploratory transcriptome analysis comparing RNAs of 3-week-old transgenic and WT plants. Several transcripts encoding glucanases and chitinases were induced. Notably, there was not a considerable overlap with CBF regulon genes previously described in cold tolerance molecular mechanism. We propose that HaHB1 is involved in plant cold tolerance via the induction of proteins able to stabilize cell membranes and inhibit ice growth.

DESIGN
Transgenic vs WT experiment under normal conditions. Two independent transgenic lines. Two biological replicates for each line.
