TITLE
Vibrio vulnificus: Wild-type vs. smcR mutant (V. vulnificus quorum sensing master regulator)

ORGANISM
Vibrio vulnificus

SUMMARY
Two-condition experiment,  Wild-type vs. smcR mutant. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 mutant strains, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array. A significant portion of the SmcR regulon predicted on the basis of microarray analysis results is indeed regulated by SmcR and that SmcR is a global regulator in V. vulnificus.

DESIGN
For transcriptome analysis, the V. vulnificus whole genome TwinChip, manufactured and kindly provided by the 21C Frontier Microbial Genomics and Applications Center(Daejeon, South Korea), was used.
