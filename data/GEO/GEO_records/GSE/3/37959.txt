TITLE
E.coli Infected Bladder Samples (PBS, WT and 2 mutants)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Study of host response in mice to uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) infection and the contribution of deletion of the Cnf and HlyA1 toxins to the host response. Mice were infected with UPEC in the bladder for 24 hrs and RNA was isolated from whole bladder to analyze on Agilent whole mouse 2-channel arrays against normal untreated mouse bladder RNA. Biological replicates were analyzed for each condition. Infection: genotype of E. coli CP9 strain
