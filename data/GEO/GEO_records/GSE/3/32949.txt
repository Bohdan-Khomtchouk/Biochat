TITLE
Expression data from C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate the effects of microgravity and space radiation on the genome-wide expression of the C. elegans.

DESIGN
Three technical replicates of wild type C. elegans (CC1 strain) which exposed to space radiation are analyzed along with ground control.
