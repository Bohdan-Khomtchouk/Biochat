TITLE
Identification of hormone-correlated genes as biomarkers for menstrual cycle phases and menopausal status

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene and protein expression in the breast varies relative to menopausal status (MS) and menstrual phase (MP), but cancer risk biomarker research using archived benign breast samples is usually uninformed by MS-MP data. We hypothesized that gene expression variation relative to ambient hormones can be exploited to develop markers of MS-MP that can be measured directly in breast tissue.

DESIGN
Random fine needle aspiration samples from the unaffected breasts of 18 women were utilized for Illumina microarray analysis. Gene expression was correlated with simultaneous serum levels of estradiol, progesterone, and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). True MS-MP states were defined by age and serum hormones. Genes highly correlated to serum hormones were used to classify samples into 2 MS groups: premenopause or postmenopause. The premenopausal samples were further classified into 3 MP groups: early follicular, late follicular or luteal.
