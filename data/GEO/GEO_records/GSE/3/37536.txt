TITLE
Genome wide identification of ORE1 early target genes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Global transcriptome patterns were performed using ORE1-IOE-2h (2h after Estradiol and Mock treatment) as well as transiently (6h) overexpressed Arabidopsis mesophyll cell protoplasts

DESIGN
To identify genes more rapidly responding to elevated ORE1 expression we here repeated the previous experiment (Balazadeh et al., 2010), but shortened the EST induction time to 2 h (ORE1-IOE-2h dataset). Furthermore, to exclude potential misinterpretation due to EST treatment we also included an experiment where we transiently expressed a 35S::ORE1 construct in Arabidopsis mesophyll cell protoplasts and extracted RNA 6 h after the transfection (35S::ORE1-6h dataset);
