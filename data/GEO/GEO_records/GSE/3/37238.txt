TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in adipose tissue of female mice after continuous high fat diet feeding

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in adipose tissue of female mice after continuous high fat diet (HFD) feeding for three generations. The hypothesis in this study is that continuous HFD feeding has transgenerational amplification effects to the offspring. Results provide important information on the impacts of over-nutrition over one generation on the offspring, such as transgenerational up-regulated or down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from adipose tissue of the HFD fed mice, including F0, F1 and F2 generations. Normal chow fed mice were used as controls.
