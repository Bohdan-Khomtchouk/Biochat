TITLE
Transcritome in the absence of FUN30

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome in the absence of the chromatin remodeler Fun30

DESIGN
A wild type and a fun30 null strain were grown in rich medium. Each culture was divided in two before RNA extraction. Two hybridizations were performed, both using independent RNA preparations from WT and the fun30 null mutant.
