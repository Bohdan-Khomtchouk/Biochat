TITLE
Transcriptional signatures of thymic epithelial cells with distinct Meis1 expression levels

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of thymic epithelial cells with distinct Meis1 gene expression levels using Meis1-EGFP reporter mice. Meis1 is a TALE class homeodomain transcription factor that critically regulates numerous embryonic developmental processes. Results provide insight into the role of Meis1 in the maintenance of postnatal thymic epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression in CD45- EpCAM+ thymic epithelial cells with distinct Meis1 expression levels (Meis1high, Meis1low and Meis1-) was measured by using Meis1-EGFP BAC-transgenic reporter mice. Two independent experiments (pools of 6 mice; 2 pools per genotype) were performed.
