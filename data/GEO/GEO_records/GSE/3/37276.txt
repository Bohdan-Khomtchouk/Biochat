TITLE
MiR-23b suppresses IL-17 associated autoimmune pathogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated as fine-tuning  regulators controlling diverse biological processes at the level of posttranscriptional repression. Dysregulation of miRNAs has been described in various disease states, including inflammatory autoimmune diseases. By using high-throughput microRNA profiling analysis, we identified a series of miRNAs dysregulated in local inflammatory lesions of human patients with autoimmune diseases such as SLE. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
