TITLE
Comparative analysis of regulatory elements between Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae by genome-wide transcription start site profiling [TSS-Seq]

ORGANISM
Klebsiella pneumoniae

SUMMARY
We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of transcription start sites for two enterobacteria: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.By obtaining over fourteen billion bases of sequence from 5' RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) followed by deep sequencing, we generated genome-wide TSS (transcription start site) maps for those two species. With experimentally derived TSS datasets, we examined usage of multiple TSSs, length of 5' UTR (untranslated region), SD (Shine-Dalgarno) sequence motif, promoter sequence motif, and dinucleotide preference near TSS site. In addition, we used the TSS datasets to identify sRNAs (small RNAs) in E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Based on these analysis, we compared regulatory elements including promoter, 5' UTR and sRNAs between two species, and investigated similarities and differences of upstream regulatory regions. Moreover, sRNAs were also compared and analyzed in terms of their sequences and target sequences, presenting possible working mechanisms of K. pneumoniae sRNAs by transferring prior knowledge from E. coli sRNAs.

DESIGN
Examination of transcription start sites by biological duplicates from E. coli and K. pneumoniae
