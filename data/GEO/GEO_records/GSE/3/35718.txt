TITLE
Pulmonary gene expression in MutaTMMouse orally gavaged with three doses of benzo(a)pyrene and vehicle control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigate mRNA profiles in lung of mice exposed to benzo(a)pyrene. Male mice were exposed to three doses (25, 50, and 75 mg/kg/day BaP) for 28 days and profiles were examined three days post-exposure. Our analyses reveal that BaP causes pulmonary specific cellular transformation indicative of carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
Individual total RNA (200 ng) from 5 mice per treatment group (control, 25mg/kg/day, 50mg/kg/day, and 75mg/kg/day) and universal reference total RNA (Stratagene, Mississauga, ON, Canada) was used to synthesize double stranded cDNA.
