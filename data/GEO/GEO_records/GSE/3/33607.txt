TITLE
Expression data from mouse B16-F10 cells exposed to hypoxic conditions in vitro.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profile of B16-F10 murine melanoma cells exposed to hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen) or hypoxia mimicry (cobalt chloride) for 24 hours. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using MG-U74Av2 oligonucleotide microarrays.   Data analysis revealed 2541 probesets (FDR < 5%) for 1% oxygen experiment and 364 probesets (FDR < 5%) for cobalt chloride, that showed differences in expression levels. Analysis of hypoxia-regulated genes (1% O2) by stringent Family-Wise Error Rate estimation indicated 454 significantly changed transcripts (p < 0.05). The most upregulated genes were Lgals3, Selenbp1, Nppb (more than ten-fold increase). Both hypoxia and hypoxia-mimicry induced HIF-1 regulated genes. However, unsupervised analysis (Singular Value Decomposition) revealed distinct differences between gene expression induced by these two experimental conditions.

DESIGN
We investigated transcriptional activity of B16-F10 murine melanoma cells cultured for 24h under hypoxic (nominal 1% oxygen; 9 experimental samples and 6 controls) and hypoxia-mimicking conditions (cobalt chloride, 100 μM or 200 μM, 2 samples each and 2 controls).
