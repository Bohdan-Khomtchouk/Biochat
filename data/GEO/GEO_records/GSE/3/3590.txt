TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Gene Expression during Bacteriophage T4 Infection

ORGANISM
Enterobacteria phage T4

SUMMARY
Genomic microarrays were used to examine the complex temporal program of gene expression exhibited by bacteriophage T4 during the course of development.The microarray data confirm the existence of distinct early, middle, and late transcriptional classes during the bacteriophage replicative cycle.This approach allows assignment of previously uncharacterized genes to specific temporal classes.The genomic expression data verify many promoter assignments and predict the existence of previously unidentified promoters. Keywords: time course
