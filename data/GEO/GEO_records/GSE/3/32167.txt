TITLE
Expression data from FCA-csRRM2 transgenic B. napus

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
Over-expression of a conserved RRM domain (csRRM2) improves Brassica napus yield components by regulating cell size

DESIGN
Leaf tissues of one-month-stage transgenic and nontransgenic seedlings (3 plants each),respectively,were selected.
