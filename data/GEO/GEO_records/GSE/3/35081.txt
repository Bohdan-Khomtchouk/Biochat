TITLE
miRNA profiling of double-positive thymocytes transduced with a retrovirus encoding Lin28a compared to untransduced controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used the NanoString mouse nCounter miRNA expression platform to compare the miRNA expression in double-positive (DP) thymocytes that developed in the presence (GFP+) or absence (GFP-ve) of ectopic mLin28 expression.

DESIGN
Transduced (GFP+) and untransduced (GFP-ve) CD4+ CD8+ CD3- thymocytes were FACS sorted and pooled from three recipients of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with Lin28-RV six weeks post-reconstitution (bone marrow chimeric mice). Total RNA was extracted and used for sample preparation and hybridization per manufacturer's recommendations.
