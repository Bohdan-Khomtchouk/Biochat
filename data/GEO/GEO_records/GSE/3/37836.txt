TITLE
Differentially expressed zinc finger proteins during human adipogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the collective role of zinc finger proteins in adipogenesis, we induced adipogenesis using human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and compared the gene expression profiles using human Illumina beads arrays. We performed three independent experiments of time-series analysis (0h, 1h, 12h, 24h, 2d, 4d, 6d, 9d, 12d, 15d after induction of adipogenesis) in order to comprehensively capture the dynamic profiles of transcriptome during differentiation. Statistical filtering based on Analysis of Variance (ANOVA; p-value < 0.001, FDR 5%) and Gene Ontology classification using the Human Gene Nomenclature Database (HGNC) identified 618 out of 678 zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) that were significantly expressed during adipogenesis. Moreover, 34 out of 618 genes were differentially expressed more than 2-fold up or down regulated. The K-means clustering analysis further revealed four dynamic expression patterns: one gene in early-response, seven genes in transient, twenty genes in progressively-induced and four genes in the down-regulated, demonstrating the dynamic involvement of ZFPs in the process of adipocyte differentiation and maturation.

DESIGN
Total RNA obteind from 10  different time points (0h, 1h, 12h, 24h, 2d, 4d, 6d, 9d, 12d, 15d) during adipogenesis from human Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) to Adipocyte (ADP). Adipogensis was induced by the different cocktail of  chemical compunds  containing human-insulin, dexamethasone, indomethacin and IBMX.
