TITLE
miRNA reponse to bleomycin instillation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of C57BL/6 (sensitive) and BALB/c (resistant) mice challenged by intratracheal bleomycin instillation: miRNA expression profiles were established from lungs derived from the two strains, following a 7- or 14-days PBS or bleomycin administration.
