TITLE
Expression data from WT and VAChT KDHOM whole hearts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
VAChT KDHOM mice have a 70% decrease in the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and this leads to a systemic decrease in ACh release and cardiac dysfunction. We used this microarray to determine whether there were transcriptional alterations in the cardiomyocytes of mutant mice as a result of this long-term decrease in cholinergic tone. We used this microarray to determine whether there were transcriptional alterations in the hearts of mutant mice as a result of this long-term decrease in cholinergic tone.

DESIGN
We isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes from the hearts of 3-month-old WT and VAChT KD mice and used them for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain homogenous populations for each sample and, as such, pooled together two RNA samples to generate one microarray sample.
