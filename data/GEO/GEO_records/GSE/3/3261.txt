TITLE
Global gene expression in catfish spleen after injection of lipopolysaccharide

ORGANISM
Ictalurus punctatus

SUMMARY
A high-density oligonucleotide microarray for channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) was designed and produced with Maskless Array Synthesizer technology (MAS). The microarray contained ~379,652 24-mer oligonucleotides covering ~18,999 catfish unique sequences. The global expression profiling of the catfish spleens stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 2h, 4h, 8h and 24h was investigated with the microarray.  In the spleen samples, 409 genes were identified to be induced or repressed greater than 2-fold by LPS treatment.   Self-organizing maps (SOM) clustering analysis was applied to interpret gene expression patterns, and 84 of these genes were clustered into six expression patterns.  Real-time RT-PCR was used to verify the microarray results for 9 selected genes representing different expression levels. The results from real-time RT-PCR were positively correlated (R^2 = 0.87) with the results from the microarray. Keywords: time course
