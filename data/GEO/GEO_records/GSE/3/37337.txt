TITLE
Immune response of germline-ablated P. pacificus exposed to S. marcescens

ORGANISM
Pristionchus pacificus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of germline-ablated P. pacificus worms exposed to S. marcescens for 8 hours versus germline-ablated P. pacificus exposed to the control E. coli OP50. First goal was to identify genes that are involved in immune response of germline-ablated P. pacificus when exposed to S. marcescens. Second, this was compared to longevity-regulating genes in germline-deficient animals (see series GSE37331).

DESIGN
One-condition experiments. Germline ablated P. pacificus worms exposed to S. marcescens for 8 hours versus germline-ablated P. pacificus exposed to the control E. coli OP50. 4 biological replicates for each condition, including 2 dye-swaps.
