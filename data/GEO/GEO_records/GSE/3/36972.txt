TITLE
Expression data for nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line 5-8F stably expressing either LTF gene or empty vector.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LTF (lactotransferrin, lactoferrin) is a key component of innate immune defense. It has recently been found to have antitumor and antimetastatic activity in different cancers. We previously reported LTF to be the most significantly downregulated gene in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) specimens relative to normal nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues and it was also negatively associated with the progression and metastasis of NPC. However, the mechanism underlying this remains unclear. In the current study, we performed genome expression profiling analysis using the Affymetrix genome wide microarray system to identify broad scale changes in gene expression associated with LTF gene overexpression in NPC cell line 5-8F.

DESIGN
NPC cell line5-8F were transfected with either PIRES empty vector (Clontech) or PIRES-LTF vector by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).  Cells stably expressing either LTF or empty vector were generated by selection with growth medium supplemented with 400 Î¼g/mL G418. When cells were growing at 80% confluence, total RNA were extracted and detected by Affymerix GeneChip Human Gene U133 plus2.0.
