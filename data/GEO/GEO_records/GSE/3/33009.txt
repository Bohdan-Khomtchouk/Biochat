TITLE
Molecular characterisation of transport mechanisms at the developing mouse blood-CSF interface: a transcriptome approach

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of lateral ventricular choroid plexus epithelial cells of embryonic day 15 (E15) and adult mice.

DESIGN
We analyzed total RNA extracted from plexus epithelial cells from 6 pooled samples (3 E15, 3 adult) using the Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST platform.
