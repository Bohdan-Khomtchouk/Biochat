TITLE
Expression analysis of Shewanellla oneidensis MR-1  to Fe nanoparticle decorated anodes in microbial electrolysis cells

ORGANISM
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 to Fe nanoparticle decorated anodes, compared to the carbon plate anodes in microbial electrolysis cells. Whole genome microarray analysis of the gene expression showed that the encoding biofilm formation genes were significantly up-regulated as response to nanoparticle decorated anodes which indicated thickness improvements contributed to enhance current density. The increased expression genes related to nanowire, flavins and c-type cytochromes also have partially contributed to enhance current density by Fe nanoparticle decorated anode. The majority of additional differentially expressed genes associated with electron transport, anaerobic metabolism in response to the nanostructured anodes possibly play roles in current density enhancement.
