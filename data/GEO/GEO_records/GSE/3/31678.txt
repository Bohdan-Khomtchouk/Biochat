TITLE
MAP Kinase Phosphatase-1 Modulates Regional Effects of Injurious Mechanical Ventilation in Rodent Lungs

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Scientific knowledge on the subjects: Injurious mechanical ventilation amplifies acute lung injury in a heterogeneous and regional fashion but the molecular mechanisms underlying regional lung injury and the protective effects of prone positioning are unclear. Regionally injurious ventilation is associated with discrete differential lung transcriptomic changes. Ventilating in the prone, compared with the supine position abrogates regional injury by depressing MKP-1.

DESIGN
Adult rats were ventilated with high (18 mL/Kg, PEEP 0) tidal volume (Vt) in supine or prone position. Non ventilated rats were used as controls. Dorsal-caudal lung mRNA was analyzed by microarray.
