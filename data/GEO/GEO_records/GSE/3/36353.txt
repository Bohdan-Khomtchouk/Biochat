TITLE
Genome wide DNA Methylation analysis of benign and malignant adrenocortical tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal adrenocortical tissue, adrenocortical adenomas and adrenocortical carcinomas. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles. Samples included 6 normal adrenocortical tissue samples, 27 adenomas and 15 carcinomas.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 48 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
