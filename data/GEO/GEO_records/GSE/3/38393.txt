TITLE
Hi-seq 2000 sequencing facilitates quantitative analysis of transcriptomes in LNCaP cells with or without SiGATA2 treatment.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We obtained 1,367 GATA2 up-regulated and 759 GATA2 down-regulated genes (p < 0.001).

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of LNCaP cell treated with or without SiGATA2 were generated by deep sequencing  in duplicate using Hi-Seq 2000.
