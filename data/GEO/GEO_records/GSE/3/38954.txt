TITLE
Epstein-Barr virus LMP1 and LMP2A transgenic B lymphocytes and lymphoma cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile of splenic B cells (CD19+) from transgenic mice expressing the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane proteins (LMP) 1 and/or LMP2A. Freshly harvested primary B cells were profiled.  B lymphocytes from transgenic LMP1, LMP2A, LMP1/2A mice and negative littermates were profiled from 6 month old adult mice; lymphoma cells were passaged in SCID mice and profiled for three LMP1 positive lymphomas and one negative lymphoma.

DESIGN
12 total samples.  4 transgenic B lymphocyte samples pooled from multiple biological replicates were hybridized to duplicate microarrays: LMP1 (pooled from 2 replicates), LMP2A (pooled from 3 replicates); LMP1/2A (pooled from 5 replicates), negative littermates (pooled from 4 replicates).  3 biological replicates of LMP1 lymphomas expressing high, medium and low levels of LMP1 and; 1 negative lymphoma was hybridized to 1 microarray chip.  The reference sample consisted of 4 biological replicates of splenic B cells (CD19+) pooled from 4-7 month old non-transgenic Balb/c mice.  The same reference was used for all hybridizations.
