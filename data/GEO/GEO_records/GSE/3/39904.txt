TITLE
Role of TAZ as mediator of Wnt signaling (SW480)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of TAZ downstream of the abberrant Wnt signaling in CRC cells, we compared the expression profiles of parental SW480 cells (empty vector) transfected with siControl, siTAZ, sibeta-catenin or reconstituted with wild type APC and transfected with siControl Keywords: expression profiling by array

DESIGN
We collected RNA from parental SW480 cells (empty vector) transfected with siControl, siTAZ, sibeta-catenin or from SW480 cells reconstituted with wild type APC and transfected with siControl. Cells were left untreated in normal culturing conditions before harvesting. Samples were then processed for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Four biological replicas (A, B, C, D) were used for each of the 4 conditions (1: siControl, control cells; 2: siTAZ cells; 3: sibeta-catenin (sibcat) cells; 4.APC reconstituted cells) for a total of 16 samples.
