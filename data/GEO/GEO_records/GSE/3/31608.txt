TITLE
Effect of IL-11 on gene expression in JEG-3 and HTR-8/SVneo trophoblastic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IL-11 increases the invasiveness of JEG-3 cells while, reduces the invasiveness of HTR-8/SVneo cells. This study examines the effect of IL-11 on gene expression in trophobalstic cell models  viz. JEG-3 and HTR-8/SVneo cells to resolve the controversies associated with the IL-11 mediated regulation of the invasiveness of these two cell lines.

DESIGN
JEG-3 and HTR-8/Svneo cells were stimulated with IL-11 (200 ng/ml) for 24 h in pain medium keeping un-treated cells as control. After 24 h of stimulation, total RNA was isolated from these cells and used for the microarray experiments. These experiments were performed once.
