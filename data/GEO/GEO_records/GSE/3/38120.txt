TITLE
Aorta profiling HMDP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identify genes in the aorta whose expressions under genetic regulation in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP). The HDMP is comprised of classical inbred and recombinant inbred wild-type mice. The RMA values of genes were used for genome-wide association as described in Bennett et al. Genome Research 2010 (PMID 20054062). These data were used to identify candidate genes at loci associated with atherosclerosis.

DESIGN
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) for expression in aorta of inbred strains.
