TITLE
Expression data for program activation by IR-induced DNA breaks in G1 phase Murine PreB cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this set of samples is to identify genes that are differentially expressed following the introduction of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by ionizing radiation in wild-type murine pre-B cells.  The data generated in this project will be compared to the data generated in GSE9024, in which genes that are differentially expressed following the introduction of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by the Rag proteins in murine pre-B cells were examined.  In order to understand the differences between the physiologic and genotoxic responses to DSB DNA damage, we need to compare cells that are all in the same compartment of the cell cycle.  We are therefore examining the response to IR-induced damage in cells that are arrested in G1, which would correspond to our previous study of G1 arrested cells with Rag-induced breaks.  This will illuminate the difference directly, allowing us to better understand the signaling responses to the different types of DNA damage.

DESIGN
Murine v-abl-transformed pre-B cells were treated with 3 uM STI571 for 48 hours. The cell type is Wild type (3 biological replicates).  For each wild type cell line, cells were treated with 1 Gy ionizing radiation or no ionizing radiation.  Each sample was hybridized once using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 2.0 GeneChip arrays (Mouse 430 v2, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Data were analyzed using the unirradiated samples as the controls.
