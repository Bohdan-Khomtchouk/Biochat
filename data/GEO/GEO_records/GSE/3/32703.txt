TITLE
Signal-dependent dynamics of transcription factor translocation controls gene expression

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Time course transcription profiling of S. cerevisiae in response to different dynamics of protein kinase A inhibition

DESIGN
Time course experiments to analyze dynamics of whole-genome transcription in response to different temporal patterns of protein kinase A inhibition.
