TITLE
Expression data from RKO cells transfected with SPARCL1 and vector control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Colon cancer cell line RKO grown on Matrigel form a luminal-like structure after the transfection of SPARCL1 gene, which may imply the differentiation of the cells. To indentify genes regulated by SPARCL1, we built two stable cell lines: RKO with pLXSN-SPARCL1 plasmid (RKO-SPARCL1) and RKO with pLXSN plasmid (RKO-pLXSN). Then we cultured these two cell lines on both plastic dish and dish cover with a layer of Matrigel. We used microarrays to undentify global gene expression change in RKO cells after the tranfection of SPARCL1.
