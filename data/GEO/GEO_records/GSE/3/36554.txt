TITLE
Identification of a new pathway for Th1 cell development induced by cooperative stimulation with IL-4 and TGFbeta [Agilent]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IL-4 plays an important role in the induction of Th2 and Th9 cells as well as in the inhibition of Th1 cell generation.  We herein show that a combination of IL-4 and TGFbeta augment the development of Th1 cells that express CD103 (CD103+ Th1 cells) if IFNgamma is present.  The T-box containing transcription factor, eomesodermin (Eomes) is preferentially expressed in CD103+ Th1 cells, and is involved in IFNgamma production.  The induction of T-bet during early T cell activation is essential for the formation of the active chromatin at both the Eomes and IFNgamma gene loci.  TGFbeta is required for the induction of Eomes and CD103, as well as the inhibition of Th2 cytokine expression.  In addition, IL-4 induces Eomes transcription through activation of the Stat6 signaling pathway.  IFNgamma-producing CD103+ Th1 cells are detected in the IEL of normal mice, and their numbers significantly decrease in Tbet- and Stat6-deficient mice.  These results represent the first molecular mechanism of IL-4/TGFbeta-dependent augmentation of Th1 cell generation, and raise the possibility that IL-4 and TGFbeta may simultaneously enhance the Th1 cell-mediated immune responses under certain cytokine conditions.

DESIGN
Th9+IFNgamma and Th9 cells are profiled for mRNA expression
