TITLE
Functional analysis of the cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2 in skin morphogenesis and disease: Identification of Nrf2 target genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Nrf2 transcription factor is a key player in the cellular stress response, which regulates the expression of important antioxidant enzymes and other cytoprotective proteins. We recently generated a novel transgenic mouse model to determine the function of Nrf2 in the skin. These mice revealed interesting phenotypic abnormalities, including hyperkeratosis and acanthosis. To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms, we wanted to identify genes, which are differentially expressed in the skin of wild-type and mutant mice before the onset of phenotypic abnormalities.

DESIGN
RNA from whole skin of 3 single P2.5  K5cre-caNrf2 (tg/tg) and 3 single P2.5 K5cre-wt (tg/wt=control) mice were used
