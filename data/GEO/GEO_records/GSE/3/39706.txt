TITLE
Expression analysis of neural stem cells isolated from Olig1-wt and Olig1-ko embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Olig1 is a bHLH transcription factor which is important for Oligodendrocyte development We used microarray profiling to assess which genes are differentially expressed in absence of Olig1 in neural stem cells.

DESIGN
Neural stem cells were isolated from ganglionic eminences of E14.5 wild-type and Olig1-KO brains. The cells were cultured in serum-free neural stem cell media and RNA extracted.
