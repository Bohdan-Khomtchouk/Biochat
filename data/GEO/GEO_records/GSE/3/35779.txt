TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of dorsal skin gene expression of control, Krox20-cre:Shp2fl, Krox20-cre; Mek1fstop/+ and double  mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of genes regulated by Shp2 mediated signaling in hair cycle initiation which are rescued by overactivation of Mek1

DESIGN
Total RNA from dorsal skin of control mice was compared to transgenic mice
