TITLE
Experimental identification of miR-378-3p targets by overexpression and silencing in murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNA molecules regulating the expression of mRNAs. Target identification of miRNAs is computationally difficult due to the relatively low homology between miRNAs and their targets. We provide data here utilizing an experimental approach to identify targets of mmu-miR-378-3p, where mmu-miR-378-3p was overexpressed and silenced in NIH-3T3 murine fibroblasts and compared to control RNA transfected cells (RISC-free siRNA). Expression of mRNAs was profiled and differentially expressed genes following either treatment as compared to control transfected cells were identified. In this way we identified 491 significantly differentially expressed genes with more than 1.4 fold change in either comparison. One of the putative targets Akt-1 was subsequently confirmed by luciferase reporter assay.

DESIGN
All conditions were assayed in triplicates. A commercially available mimic or inhibitor of mmu-miR-378-3p or control RNA (RISC-free siRNA) were transfected into NIH-3T3 fibroblasts using a chemical transfection system (DharmaFECT 1). 48h post transfection total RNA was isolated and mRNA-expression profiled.
