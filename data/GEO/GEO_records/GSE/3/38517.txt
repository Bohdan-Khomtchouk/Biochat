TITLE
Expression data from fibroblasts derived from human normal oral mucosa, oral dysplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of genes that are differentially regulated in fibroblasts derived from dysplastic oral mucosa and oral squamous cell carcinoma compared to fibroblasts derived from normal oral mucosa. Affymetrix microarrays were used to define differential gene expression.

DESIGN
Populations of fibroblasts were isolated from human normal oral mucosa, oral dysplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma, maintained in 3D collagen I biomatrices, RNA extracted and processed for Affymetrix arrays. Fibroblasts maintained as monolayers were also included as comparators.
