TITLE
The unique role of GATA1s in Down syndrome acute megakaryocytic leukemia biology and therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray gene expression profiling of lentivirus shRNA knockdown of the GATA1 gene in a DS AMkL cell line, CMK (harbors a mutated GATA1 gene and only expresses GATA1s).

DESIGN
Cell culture samples from two CMK clones (CMK-5a and CMK-5b) were compared against a negative control infection sample (CMK-neg). Two dye-swap microarrays were completed for each clone.
