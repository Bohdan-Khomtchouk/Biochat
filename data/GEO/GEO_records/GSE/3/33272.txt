TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of primary human CD4+ T-cell activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order investigate the control of genes encoding cytoskeletal motor proteins and their interaction partners in primary T-cells, we performed whole transcriptome microarray profiling of cell activation for memory and naïve T-cells isolated from three anonymous blood donors.

DESIGN
CD4+CD25- naïve or memory T-cells were cultured in medium alone or stimulated ex vivo and harvested for total RNA isolation and whole transcriptome microarray analysis.
