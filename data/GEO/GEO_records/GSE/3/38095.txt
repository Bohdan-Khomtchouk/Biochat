TITLE
Leptin and the Placental Response to Maternal Food Restriction during Early Pregnancy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Concentrations of leptin decline during food restriction.  This study was designed to test the hypothesis that some of the effects of maternal food restriction on placental development are mediated by the loss of leptin.

DESIGN
Mice were randomized to 3 treatment groups on day 1.5 of pregnancy: (1) ad libitum fed (control) (2) 50% food restriction (restricted) (3) 50% food restriction with leptin replacement (1Âµg/g body weight/day) (leptin). On day 11.5 placentas were collected, and two placentas from each mother were pooled for microarray analysis.
