TITLE
A splice isoform signature of Parkinson’s disease in peripheral blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In these studies, we used splice variant-specific microarrays manufactured by the ExonHit company ( www.exonhit.com) on the Affymetrix platform. The goal was to identify splice isoforms whose expression is altered in whole blood of early-stage Parkinson’s disease patients compared to healthy and neurodegenerative disease controls. The study included 19 cases of Parkinson’s disease (PD) samples, 4 of multiple system atrophy (MSA), 4 progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and 10 healthy controls. Thirteen splice variants were confirmed in quantitative polymerase chain reactions and used to classify blinded samples from Parkinson’s disease patients and controls with 90% accuracy and 94% sensitivity.

DESIGN
In these studies, we used splice variant-specific microarrays manufactured by the ExonHit company ( www.exonhit.com) on the Affymetrix platform. The study included 19 cases of Parkinson’s disease (PD) samples and 20 control samples including 4 cases of multiple system atrophy (MSA), 4 progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and 12 healthy controls. Splice isoforms differentially expressed in PD vs any other control group were identified and validated using real-time quantitative PCR on two independent sets of 33 coded and 53 blinded samples.
