TITLE
Altered PtAIL1 expression is accompanied by significant transcriptome changes during adventitious rooting induction

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
Oligoarray analysis was used to identify genes differentially expressed in 2 mm sections of the basal stem region of wild type T89, PtAIL1 over-expressing or PtAIL1 RNAi lines of P. tremula x Populus tremuloides 24h and 72h after adventitious rooting induction.
