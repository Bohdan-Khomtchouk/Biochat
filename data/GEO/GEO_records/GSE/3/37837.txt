TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of autologous eutopic and ectopic endometrium from fertile Indian women with endometriosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome expression analyses of autologous, paired eutopic and ectopic endometrial samples obtained during proliferative and secretory phases of menstrual cycles from eighteen (n=18) fertile women suffering from  confirmed stage 3 (moderate) and stage 4 (severe) ovarian endometriosis were performed using whole human genome oligo microarray Agilent paltform (Cat. No. G4112F).

DESIGN
In the present study, genome-wide expression analysis of autologous, paired eutopic and ectopic endometrial samples obtained during proliferative (n=13) and secretory (n=5) phases of menstrual cycle from fertile women (n=18) suffering from moderate (stage 3; n=8) or severe (stage 4; n=10) endometrioma was performed by using Agilent single color oligo microarray platform (G4112, 4X44K). Thus eighteen (18) eutopic (shown as EU) and eighteen (18) ectopic (shown as EC) samples from eighteen (18) subjects with confirmed menstrual phase (proliferative and secretory) and severity stages (stage 3 and stage 4) were studied.
