TITLE
Profiles of genomic instability in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) predict treatment outcome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Profiling of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in HGSC, subcrouping HGSC by LOH-based clustering  and comparing to the LOH profiles of triple-negative breast cancer [previously submitted; GSE19594]. Study for the correlation of LOH burdern and LOH-based subgroups to clinical response to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients suffered from HGSC.

DESIGN
SNP data (Affymetrix GenChip 250K SNP Nsp) from 47 high grade serous ovarian cancer were generated and used for LOH and copy number analysis, LOH-based hierarchical clustering to subclassify HGSC, and comparison to the chromosomal alterations in high grade brest cancer. The associstion between LOH-based subgroups and LOH burden and clinical resposne to platinum-based chemotherapy was investigated. The results were validated in two independent public opening datasets.
