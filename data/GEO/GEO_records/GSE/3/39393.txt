TITLE
ChIP-seq using a Dp1 antibody in Drosophila S2R+ cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Here we report the identification of genomic regions of DNA bound by Dp1 in Drosophila S2R+ cells. Dp1 is a dimerization partner of several E2F transcription factors and is needed for E2F target promoter binding. We find that Dp1 binds the promoter regions of genes important for oxidative phosphorylation. This result is important since our data demonstrates that expression of several oxidative phosphorylation genes is down-regulated in dDP mutant Drosophila 3rd instar larval eye imaginal discs. These ChIP-seq results suggest that the mechanism by which dDP regulates expression of these genes is direct. In addition, we have confirmed a number of these Dp1 bound gene promoters by conventional Chromatin Immunoprecipitation.

DESIGN
Examination of Dp1 bound regions of genomic DNA in S2R+ cells.
