TITLE
Gene expression data from livers of Yap+/+ and Yap+/- mice at postnatal day 30

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver undergoes both size increase and differentiation during postnatal period, which in mice is approximately first 30 days. The mechanisms of simultaneous postnatal liver cell proliferation and maturation are not clear. In these experiments, role of yes associated protein (Yap), the downstream effector of Hippo Kinase signaling pathway was investigated.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from livers of Yap+/+ and Yap+/- mice at Postnatal day 30. Pooled livers from 5 mice per genotype were used.
