TITLE
Primary pneumonic vs cultured Y. pestis

ORGANISM
Yersinia pestis

SUMMARY
Although pneumonic plague is the deadliest manifestation of disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, there is surprisingly little information on the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for Y. pestis-triggered pathology in the lung. Therefore, to understand the progression of this unique disease, we developed an intranasal mouse model of primary pneumonic plague. Mice succumbed to a purulent multifocal severe exudative bronchopneumonia that closely resembles the disease observed in humans. In order to assess the adaptation of Y. pestis to a mammalian environment, we employed DNA microarray technology to analyze the transcriptional responses of the bacteria during interaction with the mouse lung as compared to bacteria cultured in vitro.
