TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in early stage breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MiRNA profiling from whole blood (EDTA) was used to identify a miRNA profile applicable for early stage breast cancer detection

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a consecutively collected, well-defined cohort of 48 patients with early stage breast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma) at diagnosis was compared with a cohort of 57 healthy individuals for known homo sapiens miRNAs (mirbase 15).
