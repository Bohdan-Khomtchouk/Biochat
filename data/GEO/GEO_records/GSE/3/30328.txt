TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of Yersinia pestis Ysp AHL quorum sensing at 37°C

ORGANISM
Yersinia pestis CO92

SUMMARY
Quorum sensing is a cell to cell communication process that involves chemical signaling. Yersinia pestis, the agent of plague, has two functional AHL quorum sensing systems Ysp and Ype. For several reasons, it was not clear what effect AHL pathways have on virulence gene expression and survival in the two different hosts, flea and human. To investigate to what effect Ysp AHL quorum sensing has on gene expression, we conducted microarray studies comparing Yersinia pestis CO92 (∆pgm) to a single AHL mutant strain (∆pgm ΔyspI) at 37°C.
