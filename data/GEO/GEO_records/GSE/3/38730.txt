TITLE
Gene expression profile in human hepatoma HepG2 cells induced by gambogic acid and bortezomib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment is designed to evaluate gene expression alterations following treatment with gambogic acid and bortezomib in human HepG2 cells. We find gambogic acid yielded a similar gene expression profile as did bortezomib.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from human HepG2 cancer cells treated with gambogic acid (0.25μM, 0.5μM, 0.75μM) or bortezomib (50nM) for 9hr. HepG2 cells treated with vehicle alone was used as a control.
