TITLE
Mycobacterium tuberculosis Growth After Aerobic Expression of the DosR Regulon

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression of M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv:deltaRv3133c::pEXNF-3133c following ectopic expression of a plasmid-borne copy of wildtype Rv3133c compared the same strain with Rv3133c uninduced. The M. tuberculosis H37Rv:deltaRv3133c was originally described in Mol Microbiol. 2003 May; 48(3): 833â€“843.
